1,esfj,"My experience is that INTJs and ESFJs cannot stand each other. How is it possible? How can I build bridges with them? The issue is that I have never been understood by them. Most of my family is I/ESFJ as well as a significant part of colleagues at work. As that time goes, I get better and better at conflict management. ESFJs do not want to understand my ideas. They seem hostile and intolerant. Supposedly ESFJs are collaborative but I see it rather differently: all due respect you seem to be overemotional, tyrannical. Here I usually compare you with those who accept political correctness to such an extent that it crushes free thought, progress and simply logics of bare facts. Some of ESFJs tried to manipulate and play some ""gray eminence""-style social games in order to destroy my reputation in my community (by describing me as somebody as very bad who should be cast away from society). Why do you attack people vulnerable emotionally on the emotional level? Why do you reject logical thinking? Wanna know!"
2,esfj,"A few things:
I get along with the few INTJs I know that aren't mistyped. There are two in particular that I love to chat with about typology. So I don't buy the INTJ-ESFJ conflict stuff that gets thrown around.
Also, you seem to have a very biased and incorrect view of ESFJs. Let's not forget that we value Ne and Ti, so we do appreciate ideas and certain theoretical concepts at the very least. We aren't the dumb sheeple you make us out to be.
Lastly, that seems pretty severe of them (though there are undoubtedly some ENFJs and ESTPs mixed in with the people you talk about). What's their side of the story? Because while I'm not saying it's justified what others are doing to you, you seem too unaware of how you come off (insulting, cocky, etc.) to make me think that you're totally innocent here.
Also, let's not pretend that Ni is always a paragon of logic. :P "
3,esfj,"I mean if you have multiple people who ""describe you as somebody who is very bad who should be cast away from society"" then don't you think that it's possible that you're just a dick? I get that there are some people that you can't mesh well with but there's a point where you should start looking at yourself. "
4,esfj,Hmmm my fiance is an INTJ and I'm an ESFJ .... he drives me crazy sometimes but mostly makes me incredibly happy and helps me not take things too seriously. Perhaps it's that dichotomy that's impacting your interactions?
5,esfj,"INTJs and ESFJs are in what's called ""Conflict"" relations in socionics. Conflict types are the types that are least compatible due to incompatibility of cognitive functions. You guys basically think, feel, and appreciate things so differently from each other that it makes it difficult to get along. Usually ""conflictor"" types will try to keep at a distance and may admire each other from afar. If they have to work or cohabit together for long period of time, tensions build up and then one or the other explodes, resulting in a conflict or a fight. It's best to give each other space and divide tasks if you have to work together.       
And it's not that ESFJs ""reject logical thinking"" - it's that they appreciate it when it's given from Ti while the INTJ provides only Te.   
If you'd like to read further about socionics intertype relations, check out this table (ILI is INTJ and ESE is ESFJ): Wikisocion: Intertype Relations Overview."
6,esfj,"Hi there! ENFP dropping by with some insight as to why you may be having issues with ESFJs.
Your personality types naturally clash in the way that you approach situations. ESFJs approach problems more emotionally, whereas for an INTJ emotion has no value or place in problem solving. Furthermore, an ESFJ is not generally going to budge willingly on their stance due to their assertive nature, regardless of the facts that you throw at them. I know it's difficult for you, as you've gathered and know all of the facts, but you have one of two options...
1) Let them crash and burn.
2) Let them believe it was their idea in the first place.
Usually option two is the best, because as an INTJ you only care about the best results, and the ESFJ will revel in the glory...
The reason you're running into the issue with the ESFJs pitting other people... not against you necessarily... but rather with them is that their personality type is that of a leader. They're going to get people on their side to support them, while you feel all you need is the facts.
Anyway, I'm at work, so I've got to run... I'll try to add more later... Hope this helps!"
7,esfj,"Little late to the party but my best friend is an INTJ and we have an amazing relationship. She has helped me develop into a very highly aware individual. She taught me how to be less vulnerable and emotional, as well as become more self-aware and logical, which in turn really helped me strengthen my strengths and work on my weaknesses. We also focused a lot on my confidence. We were very compatible because in turn, her weaknesses were my strengths. Anyways, to sum it up what helped me the most with understanding her was that she would always explain why she thought the way she did. Also that she was constantly focusing on big picture and her self, where I am the opposite. I feel like I am not even coming close to explaining it all therefore I would like to finish by saying ""I wish she was here to explain it to you"" - but I am sure you already concluded that. Bottom line, your family has to be open to how you think too, which is hard if they are extremely irrational and resistant to change. "
8,esfj,"INTJ here and I am dating an ESFJ and what you said exactly describes my girlfriend's personality. I never worked with an ESFJ outside of my girlfriend so it's a different situation in a way. 
 
They do everything you just described because they are not logical like we are. If they are going to attack, it's going to be emotionally and playing social games. When my girlfriend argues with me, there are always lots of flaws in her statements but I just grown used to it to not say anything. She is stubborn. She does not care about how things work. She finds it boring. She just wants end results and only sees end results. She has her emotional tantrums too.
 
However, some of her behavior may be due to her having PTSD and traumatizing experiences as a victim of many sexual assaults. 
 
I do not think ESFJs are bad people. They are extremely sweet people but things can get ugly fast if the wrong things are said to offend them. "
9,esfj,"Why do you say I am supposedly unaware of how I come off? What is cocky and insulting in an INTJ? I do believe in logics, rationality, being clear and direct, not showing / controlling emotions, strategy and planning, decisiveness. I do not want to see a human being. Humanity is for me like a machine or a apiary. Each member/part has to orderly and effective realize some goals. Everybody is replaceable. What's cocky in this? What is insulting in direct communication when at work? We are paid to do stuff, not to talk about ""life and death"". I keep inquiring. What is ""your side"" of the story? "
10,esfj,"Calling me a dick by an ESFJ (namely: you) is a classic ESFJ behaviour, bias and lack of tolerance towards INTJs. What can I say more...I did not ask you to say sth offensive but rather to understand the conflict/tension between our types."
11,esfj,"I just cannot stand illogical, tyrant behaviour of ESFJs. My gf is ENFJ. She is sweet like yours, but she does not limit me intellectually, because her type understands the big picture. This type is ready to connect to us intellectually."
12,esfj,"It's that edgy teenage philosophy about people being replaceable that is so immature. The twisted utilitarian outlook you have is scoffed at by most academics (if you don't trust us dumb and illogical ESFJs). 
Judging by your other comments about NJs being big picture people by nature (untrue, Ni doesn't lend itself to big picture analyses, Ne is more likely to do that, which we have). It might be a good idea for you to look more into typology through cognitive functions. 
To answer your question, we can be logical just fine. Myself and other ESFJs I know of have excelled just fine in math, foreign language, philosophy, etc. So I can't answer as to why we're so illogical. "
13,esfj,I agree with you. I guess I just learned to cope with it and be patient with her. Even yesterday on the my ESFJ girlfriend was being illogical about a mobile game we play together but I just shrug it off. I do understand where you are coming from.
14,esfj,"Amazing how quickly you rush assigning emotional and derogative adjectives. Like I care if you call my thought: ""teenage, immature"" and bla bla bla. They boil down to nothing else but some crippled attempts to patronize me and other INTJs. As ESFJs do, you too are trying to emulate logics. You may seem logical to people who need some ""guidance"" but not to INTJs and those who are intelligent. Wow. Congratulations for doing just fine in mathematics and foreign languages. I guess you put lots of memorization in it lol. As what concerns the big picture perception ability, you may try to reverse the falsehood and the truth, but it does not change the reality. Go, analyze the big picture of emotional tension on a boys-band gig. You would certainly do it better than myself. You can write anything you want to be true in a post, but the sheer act of doing that want make it true."
15,esfj,"Have you looked into cognitive functions at all? I have trouble seeing you as actually being INTJ to be fair. ISTx actually doesn't sound too bad, based on what you're complaining about. You don't seem too Ni either. Not enough to go on. I'll assume you're an INTJ for now though.
Judging fact that you aren't refuting my claim of the Ni and Ne difference, you seem to be going based dichotomies. Which isn't always horrible, but online descriptions of those dichotomies tend to be super exaggerated at best and completely wrong at worst. You might want to look into Jungian functions if yo
By the way, Calculus 3 doesn't really lend itself to memorization. And while foreign language does to a point, the grammar of it is systematic and isn't just cookie cutter phrases. ESFJs tend to actually be better at the systematic grammar stuff because it let's them crunch their Ti, even if it's our inferior function. Relating it to Fe and branching it out through Ne is what we do. While our Si let's the different examples leave impressions for us to re-reference. But I've noticed that Si isn't always great at rote memorization. That's usually Si blocked with Te if I'm honest.
Also, if we're going by dichotomies only, I test as ENFP. So you may insult me all you want if that's the case :) My ""intuitive"" mind should be able to keep up."
16,esfj,"If you want to understand an opposite side of the spectrum, you have to approach that side in a manner they would be receptive to. Your original post put ESFJ's on the defensive, perhaps that's how you would have communicated to an INTJ, but as can be seen from the results of the thread, it proved ineffective here.  For the record, you did come off as a dick. And no, I'm not ESFJ. (INTP)"
17,esfj,"I meant I understand what you meant by ENFJ and how they are a type ready to connect with us intellectually.
 
My ESFJ girlfriend sometimes gets upset and gives me an attitude because she thinks I act like I know everything even though I throw out disclaimers and argue about both sides of a topic."
18,esfj,"So now you're saying you're an ENFP but in your first post you pretend to be an ESFJ even by stating: ""We aren't the dumb sheeple you make us out to be"". Clearly, you refer to myself implying ESFJs to be dumb (so the ""sheeple"" if you like).
You are funny: like ""doing just fine in calculus 3"" and learning ""foreign language"" means you are smart. Actually, as an INTJ, I am a talented mathematician, proven my first theorem on the second year of my bachelor studies, and speak 4 languages. Yeah, try harder... whom do you try to stupify?!"
19,esfj,"Don't waste my time, you are not coherent in your thinking. I started this topic because I wanted to understand ""the other side"", all your answers are either derogative, patronizing or just illogical (to put it mildly). "
20,esfj,"Au contraire, my example proves that your statement is wrong. Most of the minds throughout the history were NTs (I acknowledge not only INTJs), nevertheless they couldn't be ESFJs. There exists a very strong correlation between how much you score towards NT and how much you score in IQ tests. Not only this is proven by countless examples, scientific research but also it follows from the definition of having an NT-type of personality.
I would like to leave you with something positive: being ESFJ for sure you could be a greater social entertainer than myself."
21,esfj,"Functions are important to understand how a type works. If you aren't aware of them, how can you know you're actually talking about ESFJs? You're the one stereotyping and we can't answer questions about ESFJs if you don't understand this personality system.
So answer the question and stop avoiding it: do you know what functions are? I have many resources for you to look at if you don't."
22,esfj,"I'll be blunt. I'm a male INTJ and I'm trying to save my marriage. I've read a couple of books on relationships and I have an exponentially better idea about how to communicate effectively with my ESFJ wife. All I have to do to save our marriage is prove to her that I love her. Very simple in concept, frustrating because I've loved her the entire time and she hadn't felt it. Reading the books really helped me to understand better how she needs to feel loved by me.
The problem is that she doesn't make any time for me and even actively avoids me when she would otherwise have time by immediately filling it with basically anything else. She had admitted to putting up an emotional wall of sorts. I'm not exaggerating when I say some days we don't see eachother at all, purely because of our work shifts, unless I want to stay up late to do so. Which I have done, and she responds with typically a very short conversation and goes to bed. In her defense she is legitimately tired, and frankly by then so am I.
So what I'm asking for is some ideas that would help me to connect with her better in what short time we may have throughout the day until she feels confident and more comfortable to spend more time with me so we can fix it much better. The work I've been putting into the relationship appears to be working, but it's very slow going and I want to make the absolute most of the time we have together when we do have the time.
For those who are curious, here's the books I read:

Real Love in Marriage
5 Love Languages

The first one I think was more important for me even as a person to understand. I actually found it so helpful with life advice in general that I recommended it so a couple single friends, one with depression issues even and it helped him a lot. The second feels like it helped me to understand how to better focus my efforts.
Thanks in advance for any advice offered!"
23,esfj,"First, some disclaimers - i am INTP myself, and i am a student of socionics. It's basically an eastern-european version of MBTI with a bit more emphasis on intertype relations.
If both of your types have been determined correctly, then the problem likely is that INTJ and ESFJ are conflicting types. Reason for this is that main products of INTJ psyche are Ni(introverted intuition) and Te(extroverted thinking) functions, both of which ESFJ is vulnerable to. This works both ways - Fe(extroverted feeling) and Si(introverted sensing) of ESFJ are the weaknesses of INTJ. This leaves both mentally drained in prolonged contact with each other. The result is escalating conflicts arising from seemingly trivial things and frequent inability to come to understanding between the two.
To make this relationship last would require either both partners act like someone they're not (INTJ acting as INTP and ESFJ acting as ESFP, for example), which is not conductive to their mental health, or keeping their distance, which in turn is not conductive to a marriage.
I am sorry to rain on already sombre topic, and i do hope i am wrong, but if this rings true, then maybe it is worth some heartache to avoid a lifetime of misery."

25,esfj,"Er, you're fine. We've decided to have the marriage absolved last night actually. We've been basically room mates for awhile now, and with only that as the expectation we've been fine. So the intent is we'll just be roommates so we don't have to worry about debt and make any drastic changes to our kids, and can still share resources to really take care of the kids. That aside, we're free to see other people. Obviously if something changes and we're unable to be roommates then that fix is easy, but since we've been doing fine like that for awhile we figure it will probably be ok. No messy divorce, no custody battle, we just share what we've built up until now and we'll proceed accordingly if that doesn't work out."
26,esfj,"I'd agree that I'm not the one being problematic right now, but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been in the past. But we both had a flaky understanding of communicating with eachother effectively and I only really figured that out after reading those books and actively applied what I was learning. I do feel like if she put in the effort that I have towards trying to understand her we'd be really well off.
My wife is actually not that into physical touch, and I am. It's a little weird I guess. Otherwise everything else seems about right though. I've been pretty bad about non-verbal confirmation for the past few years, I've definitely improved that over the course of this year.
I get the feeling she just doesn't care anymore, like I took too long to figure out exactly what she wants and so my efforts feel pretty futile right now. I won't give up until she's signed the papers, but it's frustrating at the very least.
Thank you for the kind words and advice!"

28,esfj,"x-posted to other MBTI subreddits
Hi gang,
I  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality. Check it out here:
https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd
Come  find more people of your type, or seek for others of compatible (or not  compatible) types! Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!"
29,esfj,"Hey ESFJs, :)
I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project.
Even though I think - you are the guys who are least likely to be interested in the MBTI theory - I thought I'd let you know that I just released your video ;)
https://youtu.be/iRYBKdKsu2s
I really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!
Enjoy! :)"
30,esfj,"I'm pretty sure this person I know is ESFJ and I've always noted a major difference in the way we approach small problems or chores - I prefer to do it as quickly as possible and the ESFJ really likes to take his time with stuff like that. For example, if I have to do a lot of dishes I'll just get to it asap to get it over with. If he has to do dishes, he's gonna turn on a podcast, lay some towels around, make himself a cup of coffee, do some stretches etc And it's the same thing in any similar situation
Function wise, I think this is an Si comfort vs Se impatience sort of thing. What do you think?"
31,esfj,"I am hardcore crushing on an INTJ and we are SLOWLY getting to know each other. I'm letting him move at his own pace because if it were me we'd have started dating a while back. ANYWAYS.
Any experiences (positive or negative) that you'd be willing to share? Words of wisdom? From what I hear it's either a great experience or an awful one :/"
32,esfj,"I'm an INTJ and seriously dating an ESFJ.  We've been dating close to a year and here are some insights.  
--Communication is vital.
--Our emotional side is our weakest trait.  Be patient and open-minded. We open up eventually.
--We can be blunt and not be sensitive to your feelings.  It comes from a rational solution of how we think.  INTJs are always learning to be more sensitive. 
--We tend to analyse everything in terms of if the relationship fits our ecosystem. If it meets the criteria, then we are in it for the long run.  
--We don't like colors that stick out, lol.  Don't try to dress us up! We can meet in the middle. I think ESFJs like to stick out and be recognized.  INTJs like to blend in and be unnoticed. 
--Do something out of the blue like bake him something.  My gf did this for me and I appreciate the thought and time she put into it.  A rare surprise that made me smile. 
--INTJs don't like competition on insignificant things. 
--We like to talk about ideas, big goals and how to get there.  That's a big one.  If both of you are on the same page, it's a go.
I think if INTJ and ESFJ are willing to meet in the middle, then both can teach the other valuable skills to be a super couple. I'm more social b/c of her and she is more aware of herself b/c I taught her to be more reflective, be more practical with her habits and ask more questions of 'why'.  My gf has gotten me out of my shell, to be more open towards doing things that are not on the big picture to-do list or things I really suck at.  We recently went to those wine/paint classes.  I suck at art and she told me to relax and enjoy myself of being a rookie. To my surprise, I really enjoyed it! 
Anyhow, I hope things work out.  We are having a blast being together. Opposite attract!
edit -word"
33,esfj,"I have friends who are married, she is an ESFJ, he is an INTJ. They've been very happily married for probably 18 years now. She's helped him soften up his ""mean"" side (he tells it like it is). He has taught her to be honest and communicate effectively. Their dynamic works really well, especially since they understand their differences.
Hope this helps!"
34,esfj,"I am an INTJ and my wife is an ESFJ. We've been married for 8 years and so far it's going great. 
Check out [Personality Hacker's podcast] (http://pca.st/JLNI) for a great one minute post on how INTJ's get and give love. Helps see things from you SO's side. "
35,esfj,"I would never cross any human being off my list, and have been pleasantly surprised getting to know everyone.
That being said, I have never, ever, ever been attracted to an INTJ, and I cannot fathom how it would work, personally, for me.
But I am not attracted to TJs period.  The harshness is something I can't tolerate."
36,esfj,"Okay so I only browse reddit for the news and, I use flipboard for the news besides that I barely touch my phone except to make plans with people and chat a little over text for people I don't see often. But I found this subreddit and its so damn interesting to hear what people think about ESFJs, Im usually too busy hopping from being with one person to another and then sleeping and repeating that I dont have any time to hear what people think about me. Enlighten me, I am down to hear good and bad stuff, it'll only help me grow."
37,esfj,"How does this make you feel? Do you get over it quickly, after a few months? Does it linger in the back of your head for awhile and bother you when you think about it? Does it crush you and you feel helpless?"
38,esfj,"Yes, I would feel really really bad and sad. I never want to cut ties with anyone, most especially if I love the person so much. I will do my best to make up with the person. However, if the person has already made the decision and it's final, I can do nothing about it, and just hope that the person will be happy in the future. I will try to move on with all the good memories, but without the person in my life already. I do not like it, but it has been the choice of the person, so I can only respect that and move on. It would torture me for so long though, blaming myself,  before finally being able to move on. It would however be a lifetime scar for me, bringing out all my insecurities and doubs within myself."
39,esfj,"The thing is. You are not responsible for anyone's feelings or choices. I understand it would hurt, and I'd myself (INTP) would try to fix the problem. However, blaming yourself for a choice such as this is a waste of time. I have an ESFJ friend that I need to cut ties with, simply because they are toxic for me and my situation. Although, I am going to cut ties does not mean I hate that person. In fact, I care for them a lot, but the consequences of the friendship are more than the benefits, therefore the connection must be severed in order for both of us to develop. Although I will be the one to sever the ties, I wouldn't mind getting a message from them in a few years, or me doing the same. "
40,esfj,"I see. But we can't help but blame ourselves and as ourselves what we have done wrong.... :'( Really? You cut ties even if you don't hate the person and still care for the person? Because for me, if a person cut ties with me, it means that the person hates me and does not care about me anymore... May I ask what reasons make you cut ties with others? I see. So it is okay for you to be friends again in the future?"
41,esfj,"It is simply because I feel like she is not in a state where she's able to care about me. Everyone seems to think that I am this unemotional robot, which I am to some degree, however it pisses me off that she will undermine everything I've gone through to the point that it doesn't care to listen. Hence why I will cut ties. I understand that she is dealing with a lot, which renders it impossible for me to hate her. However, for the time being I need people who are willing to actually show that they care. Like I said, I don't hate her, and I genuinely want her to get better, but I can't be there in the process simply because after 5 years I've reached my limit. "
42,esfj,"I'm also an ESFJ and ""we"" aren't all like you. I've had a friend cut ties with me recently and despite the fact that she did it in a really spiteful and ridiculous way, she was right to do so, and I'd been considering how to withdraw from our friendship anyway because it was getting toxic for me.
Ideally we would take some space and time apart, be civil and friendly to each other (we have a lot of mutual friends), and move forward. If we were to grow close again that would be great. If not, a relationship that has become negative would have exited both of our lives and that would be a good thing.
End of the day, the fact that it has become negative is enough for it to be worth ending or at least stepping back significantly. I don't need that kind of stress in my life, and frankly, the only thing that bothers me is that she's really anxious and will make this an issue for all of our mutual friends, whereas I don't mind if we see each other in public or whatever and exchange pleasantries. I don't hold anything against her (except annoyance for how she's handled it), so it doesn't need to be awkward. She'll make it awkward, though, which is most of the reason I'd have preferred it went more smoothly.  "
43,esfj,"I see. I understand. I also have close INTP friends. They are very dear to me, and though they may always say that they are emotionless robots and it may always seem like that on the outside, I know they also feel deeply and care for the people. I hope your friend becomes okay and that you both make up in the future~"
44,esfj,"I see. Well, I can't generalize. That's for me, and I'm ExFJ. :) I had a bestfriend who I have cut off from my life too, before, but that was because she cut me off from her life first and she became really mean, which was already abusive for me. Although I blamed myself a lot for what happened because I kept thinking there was something wrong with me. Anyway, we are talking to each other again and we are friends again, after we both have moved on from what happened. Different things work out for different people. Some people prefer not to take back people who chose to leave, and that's okay, too. But I suggest just focusing on the people who chose and continue to choose to stay beside us. :) "
45,esfj,What social media and what is your age? I use Reddit a lot but all my social media use has been for fact collecting  I don’t care what other people are doing on social media at all and I dnt think they care about my like either. 
46,esfj,"I'm 27. I use the main ones--FB, IG, and Snapchat. lol just commented on your other thread about social media, but yeah. I like being able to keep up with my friends' lives that I don't get to see often. "
47,esfj,"as in you can figure out their personality and what type of person they are. I know that not everyone is the same or stereotypical, but more towards that I would say that i'm a good judge of character :D
do any fellow ESFJers feel the same?"
48,esfj,"I (F, ENFJ) am dating an INFP guy and things are going pretty well. We've been going out about 6 months with no blips so far. I've known the guy for years and years so feel pretty secure with things and I'm enjoying the fact that we're at the stage where I can hang out with all his friends (as well as our mutual friends) and it's all fun and chilled.
Now here's my query.
My guy's housemate is a lovely, good-looking ESFJ. He's a fun guy to be around and is the best friend you could possibly imagine to my boyfriend. As in, would do ANYTHING for him. They are part of a very close group of friends but even so, there's some special bond between the pair of them that at times seems almost MORE than a bromance... This guy cooks for my boyfriend, plans surprises for him, takes up hobbies my boyfriend has to spend more time with him. He misses my boyfriend when he's away to the extent that my guy is reluctant to take too many weekend trips with me or even his family. (I don't mind this; it's important he hangs out with his friends!) 
Apparently at university people referred to them as a 'couple' and the other night one of their friends drunkenly asked me if I thought the roommate might have a 'thing' for my boyfriend! I was drunk, and brought that comment up with my bf when we got home (maybe I shouldn't have done). He said it is something he had thought about, and was worried that if his best friend does like him, then it might all be a bit painful for him. 
The weird thing is, whilst on the one hand I see how he totally seems into my boyfriend, I sort of get the impression sometimes he is into... me!? We are very similar and like a lot of the same stuff and often have a laugh together. He's increasingly complimentary of me and... I don't know. :/ Sometimes it's just a sense you get. 
Now I gather that ESFJ's are usually considered the life and soul of the party so this might just seem like he's a general flirt or whatever... but my guy's roommate is pretty shy - actuallly borderline introvert. He's never had a girlfriend (he's 23) and is pretty shy around girls, though he talks about wanting a girlfriend a lot. He's super good-looking but when I asked him once he said he just assumed hot girls wouldn't look twice at him. 
So what's going on? Anything? Nothing? Does he like my boyfriend? Or is he maybe even a bit into me? Essentially what I want to know, ESFJs, is: is this a personality thing!?
PS. I'm not looking for drama, I'm just super curious!"
49,esfj,"TLDR: Am I a jaded ESFJ maybe? How do you all find joy in caring for people?
I feel I fit into ESFJ pretty darn well when I am happy and feeling truly ""myself"".
I like to have my opinions heard, I think very short term, I use feels first, and I feel there are rules to be followed (although some are ones I made up in my head). Buuuuuuttttttt...
I do not need to get attention. Not a fan of big get togethers or going places with lots of people. I have never had many friends or wanted many, I prefer to be alone most of the time. I can't stand helping people. At this point I hate it. I open my mouth to say something that might help but either get sick to my stomach or think I will just get yelled at so why try. 
I also find myself wanting to be taken care of, finding no joy in taking care of other people or things because I always have to. It is not fun, I see it as a thing I have to do before I can be happy. When I can make people happy I get joy but it wanes quickly because I can't make it last.
I get what I consider ""my kind gestures"" thrown back in my face so I just don't want to talk to anyone anymore. No one listens to my advice or helps me when I struggle. I feel very Henny Penny. As one of the biggest percentages out there, do we all feel this way and are thusly not alone? 
Thanks for letting me vent ya'll! Air hugs for reading all this!"
50,esfj,"You could still be ESFJ. For some reason the SFJs get generalized as simpletons who exist on this earth only to make people feel comfortable and/or silently judge them. Really the extraverted feeling and introverted sensing means that your feelings are tuned into the ethics and values of the people and society around you, and you perceive the world through how reality affects your inner physicality.
That might be a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but I hope it might help a little. SFJs in particular get a very limited description in the MBTI community"
51,esfj,"I think the stereotype is that ESFJs are loud mouths who blabber to anyone in sight. 
However, I'm pretty shy most of the time, especially around strangers. I get terrified at the thought of accidentally bothering someone. Just that I believe I'm an extrovert as I get ""recharged"" by positive interactions with people rather than by being by myself."
52,esfj,"Yeah, I'm definitely a reserved person when I'm first meeting people. Warm, but slow to talk. It seems like I have a need to figure that person out before I put myself out there. I have a tendency to want to know how to present myself -- not in the sense that I'm being fake, but I'm wanting to know how (style of speaking, level of energy, subject matter, sense of humor, etc) I should engage them.
Once I'm completely comfortable, that's when I start to look a little more like the ESFJ stereotype"
53,esfj,"I’m mostly the same. In fact, I’m outright awkward if I’m in an unfamiliar situation with people I don’t know. I do enjoy being around people but loud parties and too many people can really drain me unless I actually know and like everyone there. I prefer small, intimate settings where I can really talk to people. I have been told that I am good at listening and talking (I do sometimes hog the conversation, purely because my Ne goes at a million miles an hour if you get it going) but that only comes out when I feel comfortable.
I thought I was an introvert for the longest time until I realised that being on my own for too long makes me sad. I need people!"
54,esfj,I agree. Which is why I get surprised by people who know an ESFJ who annoys the shit out of them by talking so much. Isn't our Fe good to be able to tell when the other party member is annoyed and to finally STFU? Haha 
55,esfj,"haha tbh I'm not familiar with any of this Fe stuff. But yeah, personally speaking, I feel like I'm pretty socially aware of when people want their turn to speak and I'm conscious of when I'm speaking too much or it's disproportionate. I only know one other ESFJ, and while she is outgoing, I still wouldn't consider her a blabbermouth. I'm not quite sure where this stereotype comes from. "
56,esfj,"Handle people? We want to be liked and want those around us to feel listened to and cared for. We are/I am warm and perhaps too quick to please others. I always “want” to do what others want to do. I genuinely cannot think of preferences when asked. If someone else has one, I’d rather go along with theirs so they are happy because I will be satisfied anyway. I have a long history/problem with caring for others more than myself. I am very generous. What I have, I will give away or at least share 50/50 without regard for if it’s appreciated, respected, or if I might be taken advantage of. I think this is a characteristic of ESFJ. Personally, I have a lot of tastes and cannot be pinned to one thing. I am easy to please and entertain. The extrovert in me is bubbly and will speak to anyone. That doesn’t mean I like small talk. I don’t. I desire deep connections with people... because there is nothing more that I love than people. I briefly dated an INTP and we had very different expectations in the relationship. It was too much to handle. He was a giver upper. I’m a fighter. He was way too casual for my taste. ESFJ can be a little more traditional, to my understanding. I know I am. I need to be asked out on proper dates and have doors held and sweet comments i  the beginning of a relationship. He didn’t feel the need. We liked each other: that’s all there was to it for him. I kind of went on a tangent here... but I hope this helped a little!"
57,esfj,"Wow...thank you for this.  INTP here.  The girl I like is an ESFJ, I think.  I asked her out to dinner, to a movie (last minute).  She said no.  She knew I am into photography and she wanted me to take a picture on the ocean for her.  That seemed like so much work for me.   It didn’t seem like she was interested in me so I dropped it.   She then asked what kind of hair I like.  I told her it’s your hair, get what you want.   She tried to invite me to a few different events but by that time, I already gave up and said no. 
She’s the kind of person who would rather tell/hear a comforting lie while I prefer a painful truth. 
A common friend wondered how two people can think so differently. 
Being socially stupid makes having meaningful relationships so hard.  "
58,esfj,"Wow,  I thought we were the same person for a second. Although I read a lot of ESFJ’s opinions on this subreddit, this is by far the most relatable one. Even down to the INTP - except we dated for a long time, but in the end, different life goals. 
This is probably how many ESFJs function. I agree with all of these. I’m quick to please even if I know I might be taken advantage of. Having few opinions about food or activities makes it easy for us to get along with all types of people. 
Personally, my happiness does stem from making others happy therefore I need them as opposed to “handling” them. "
59,esfj,"Is it possible for an esfj to mistyped by others as an intp. Or rather, are there any esfjs in this world who look like intps, possibly because they use a lot of introverted thinking(albeit poorly) but know they are esfjs."
60,esfj,"I think it would take some effort to be mistyped as the exact opposite, but I’m sure that mistyping happens plenty. ESFJs are rather widespread in the general public but with everyone being a unique individual, there are shades to every personality. I can be withdrawn for a few weeks at a time which may appear completely opposite of the general ESFJ stereotype and I am just as much thinking as I am feeling so typing a person in front of you in the moment can be rather subjective and prone to mistyping."
61,esfj,"That's exactly my case actually. But that's only because according to the MBTI I'm an INTP/INTJ since ESJFs are retards according to it. However the jung types are way, way more solid and actually make some sense. And according to those I'm ESFJ yet that somehow doesn't mean I'm retarded, so that's cool."
62,esfj,Pretty sure there are quite a bit of NP folks on here who are really just SJs unwilling to admit it. It's what happens when you have online descriptions making us out to be dingle-butts with no real prosperity in life.
63,esfj,I'm in the exact same predicament. I score as intp but for some reason when I look at it from a jungian perspective esfj makes more sense to me. I feel like I'm just an anti-social esfj but even saying that sounds wrong.
64,esfj,"Check this discord out and ask James: https://discord.gg/RAdbe6b
I'm just naturally inclined to be social but so insanely intellectually developed I don't look like one. Yet it does get real close to my thought processes. I wonder if we think the exact same way. Pm me on discord and let's talk :)"
65,esfj,"I'm an ISFJ, been with an ESFJ for 2 years now.
I'm extremely happy with him, I think we're super compatible. He's very emotionally healthy, so other people may have different experiences depending on their partner.
Hes very good at communicating, and he pulls me out of my shell a lot. 
I'm not naturally verbally expressive, but he is, so it helped me to develop that more in myself. Any conflict is settled with a short, polite conversation, he's extremely kind and considerate of my feelings. He's a super easygoing person, and it's rare for him to get upset over anything.
He's super affectionate and caring, he's always trying to take care of me, and making sure I'm fed, warm, comfortable and generally content. 
It's a nice change for me, as I'm usually trying to take care of everyone else and sometimes put myself on the back burner. 
I love seeing him in group settings, he brings out the best in people and everyone seems to love him. He's introduced me to a lot of people, and while he still respects my need for quiet time to be an introvert by myself, he's also been really good at pushing me out of my comfort zone just a little bit, and I always have a ton of fun tagging along with him for social events.
He's incredibly encouraging and supportive of me, whatever the circumstances. He's been here for me through some rough life changes, health problems, anxiety, unemployment, etc. He's been an unwavering support system whenever I've needed him, and we make a really good team. 
I honestly can't think of any real problems we have, apart from the fact that neither of us likes to be in charge of making decisions.
Choosing where to eat, what movie to watch, what activity to do that day, etc. 
We have to force each other to take turns choosing, because I think we both tend to be more submissive in that area of our lives, and prefer someone else to make the decision.
Otherwise, it's awesome. It's the best relationship I've ever had, and I wouldn't change anything about him.
I love how kind he is, he makes me laugh like crazy, and I feel like we understand each other. 
We're super compatible, and our whole relationship has been very easy."
66,esfj,Married an ESFJ. She tends to overbook a lot of what I would like to be downtime but is starting to understand this now. They bottle up thoughts just as much as we do. Don’t let that happen. Makes for a better relationship. I’ll come back to this. Gotta run.
67,esfj,"I would love to hear more about your experiences. I've been togheter with an ESFJ for five years and we are having a baby within a couple of months. I love her but she can annoy the crap out of me. This goes both ways, I also can be very annoying. It's a good thing she's not resentful or holding any grudges for longer periods of time. Makes me want to be a better person."
68,esfj,"Annoys you how?
Mine just drains my battery and it happens to frustrate me just as much as if I were Hangry. She fixates in what others think of her a lot of the time and that infuriates me where I’ve learned to not give a shit. I try to get her over that but it’s just her. She has started to better understand things."
69,esfj,"I think you described it very well. If I've had a draining day and come home I will lack patience. And she usually wants to talk alot. And i'ts not a great combination being drained, maybe see something that needs to be done in our home (taking out the trash for example) and listening to things that do not interest me, but is important to her (describing in detail conversations she had).
But if I've had time for myself, doing things I love - we have it great. We share the same values. And usually think the same things. I usually have the conversations in my head, and she verbalize her thoughts to reach the same conclusions.
She appreciates that I'm calm. And I appreciate that she has pull."
70,esfj,"As a child, when things got difficult, I would quit. The sad part is that every coach, or master saw potential in me. I, apparently, was able to catch on fairly quick, but had trouble keeping with it afterwards. Like maybe stupid beginner's luck? Idk. But yeah, I would say quittin has been in my blood. Pretty shitty, but it is what it is. I reckon I haven't found something worth putting my time in, or I feel too much pressure (so I quit).
You guys relate?"
71,esfj,"I relate lmao. If a thing is important to me, that's different though. I'll keep going until my last breath if it means that much to me. But if it's some thing where it's just hard, crappy, and gain nothing from it, hell nah I'm not gonna do it. Screw it lol, rather be doing something I want to do"
72,esfj,"haha man, me and you just don't relate, eh?  
Never quit, never give up. That motto was very important to me growing up. But, a book I read a few years ago helped me realize that quitting isn't terrible, and is even sometimes necessary. The Dip, by Seth Godin, provided a huge paradigm shift for me--if we never quit things, then we can never move on to something better. We'd all be working the same first job that we got and wouldn't progress. Or we would all be stuck in a toxic relationship. Or we would be stuck doing something holding us back. Conversely, we also need to know when to stick it through. Being able to distinguish when you should ""stick"" and when you should ""dip"" is key for finding success and fulfillment.  
So now, I'm more okay with quitting something. Am I just holding on to something because of my pride? Am I afraid of the change that would accompany it? Or should I stick it through because there is a valuable reward that will move me forward in life (e.g. completing my undergrad right now)? These are important factors to consider for me about when to quit and when to dip."
73,esfj,"🤔. 
Very thought provoking. Thanks for your insight. That was some good shit.
Yeah, probably, and probably not. I usually stick things through to just stick things through, so bleh. However, I quit a lot."
74,esfj,"Sit on my ass and socialize on the internet lmao👌✨. People judge me for not doing ""oThEr StuFf"" that isn't just typing on my phone, but I'm not hurting them, I don't see why it's a problem, I just wanna get involved in my passions"
75,esfj,"You know, technically, you're still doing it for you. You do things for others so you can feel good for it.
Hm... I kind of hate how I feel the need to do things for others. I like it, but I hate it. It's a double edged sword. I'm kind of extremely freaking angry for it. I create a level of resentment for them in the end. It's even worse if I know they have extremely high expectations, or if I don't know what they expect from me (so I might overdo it). Regardless of what I do, or how much I do, I tend to resent the other person. Like I want to hurt them. So I need to find a balance, but that's a bit difficult. So I choose selfishness in the end because fuck doing things for other people. High expectations. Ask for too much, or don't and I still try to reach whatever expectation that I probably set in my head (which is the issue).
Fe sucks.
:/"
76,esfj,"True. Funny how selflessness is still, in a way, self-serving.  
It most certainly is a curse and a blessing. It's what makes us amazing people with so much to give, but if that's not consciously regulated, it can easily get out of hand and turn ugly. I try my best to be aware of when I start developing resentment and to remind myself that it's a reflection of my own issues. Totally understand the ""fuck doing things for other people"" mindset. Been there, done that, failed it haha. As much as I try to do that, because sometimes I wish not giving a shit would come naturally to me, it just feels wrong and I feel like my soul slowly erodes.  
However, it is definitely important to distinguish between selfishness and self-respect. Selfishness is tending to your wants at the expense of others' needs. Self-respect is tending to your needs before the wants of others. Self-love starts to ablate when you put the wants of others at the expense of your own needs."
77,esfj,"As an ESFJ college student I'm looking for anything new and exciting/joyful/fun/thoroughly enjoyable. 
What is joyful for you? What is something that you thoroughly enjoy? What do you like to do most? Ideally, in your free time, what would you love to be doing?
I'm also curious to see if your interests are similar to my interests, so please post anything you guys really enjoy!
You are greatly appreciated :) "
78,esfj,"For me personally, I don't care too much about what I'm doing so long as I'm doing it with people I care about. So, watching tv series, movies, biking, trying out new restaurants, learning a new language are all things that I love to do, but maybe wouldn't enjoy as much as I do now if I wouldn't have someone to do them with. When I'm alone though, I really enjoy watching health documentaries, reading some awesome fiction books or baking. Basically everyone in my family is an introvert so that may factor into my specific interests as well, I don't know. :p What are some things you enjoy? :)"
79,esfj,"I love nature, I'm and Eagle Scout and have spent a large portion of my childhood outdoors.  I played every sport growing up but especially enjoyed swimming and soccer. I like all types of water sports, snow sports, you name it I like it. For a restful activity I play disk golf and go hammocking.
When it comes to relationships my love language  is touch, it's always been my weakness and quickest way to my heart."

81,esfj,"When I first learned about MBTI, the S/N was described to me as:
When you are getting directions to drive somewhere S's prefer use of visual cues (turn right at the big blue barn and then immediately onto the curvy road NOT STRAIGHT) while N's prefer verbal direction (turn west onto State St and then take the left fork onto the trafficway).
Thus my thought is that the S's are more likely to spend time on Facebook or Instagram, where you get the quick picture, visual side of things... Then there's the N's who prefer Reddit, where people like to spend time with more concrete verbiage and interaction."
82,esfj,"My mom is an ESFJ and she always says that I'm not close enough to her and she gets sad when I don't talk to her much( at least as much as my sister).
Anyways I like her and I don't want her to think that I don't like to talk to her; but as an INTJ I really don't like the subjects they choose to talk about and I don't want to end everything with an argument...
What should I do? How can I make her sure that I like her? What kind of subjects can I choose to talk?!"
83,esfj,"I feel bad for spinning it this way, but based on your response to Miyagi...
I think your mom might want you to be what she ideally wants and you're not that. So because of that, she doesn't ""feel"" close to you. 
That, or she wants you to share emotional shit. I am hoping it is the latter."
84,esfj,"Find what she likes to do and do it alongside her. Card games? Board games? Working out? Watching old shows? Volunteering? Spring cleaning? Literally anything that she enjoys try to engage in that with her. She will feel loved that you are taking time to learn her interests, and slowly but surely that will grown into an emotional and respectful bond. 
Also, ask her questions about life. Ask her what she was like growing up, or how she got through (insert whatever) when she was your age. It sounds like she loves you and wants you to be your best, this might encourage her that you are really trying to better yourself by seeking her advice"
85,esfj,"Why dont you start the conversation and talk about something that interests you? Im an intj and my wife is an esfj and we have no problem having conversations. Just tell her something interesting you learned recently, or something strange or funny that happened to you, etc. 
Or find a tv show that both of you like and watch it together. "
86,esfj,"Make her something thoughtful, frame a picture or make a scrapbook page with you and her in it. Buy her something she's been needing and mentioned, esfj's mention everything. Tell her that you appreciate her and love her."
87,esfj,"My mom is a little like OPs mom. Also ESFJ. She doesn't want me to be what she thinks is ideal. She wants a close relationship. Talking a few times a week, sitting together for lunch, doing things together every once in a while.
I am an ESFJ and clearly speak her language. She still doesn't understand that I barely have time and if I do I might want to rest a bit. She gets hurt on the inside, but lets me have my way.
She is wearing ESFJ glasses and probably doesn't realise different people think in different ways. If its not logical in her eyes she wont understand."
88,esfj,"Can you believe that whenever I start to talk to her about these things, she says ""and why do you think it's important to know these things? Are all these really useful?"" 😐
And when she is in front of TV, she always watch some old typical movies that I hate😐 
Actually I think the only subject that can satisfy her us my good grades at school 😂 but she's really kind and I really love her and I sometimes feel sorry that I can't be as good as she expects me to be... Well I'm not a good girl for her, maybe"
89,esfj,"Lol obviously not everyday, but think of ESFJ's as they are more in the moment, practical, shorter fuse and enjoying words of affirmation more often, for me If I know how someone feels about me because they've expressed it in some way before and I feel it hasn't changed it's stitched in me. Mark Twain said once 'I can live on a good compliment for about two months', similar to that. 
But ESFJ's are more likely to run low on feeling loved faster because of their highly extroverted/people person nature I feel mostly they want to be with you, talk with you and don't want to be ignored for long periods of time."
90,esfj,"Hard to tell. Overall your iNtuition scores are higher than Sensing... Have a look into what the functions do and decide for yourself which one you use more: Si or Ni. Whichever one is stronger, the other one will be your weakest if you're either ESFJ or ENFJ fyi. "
91,esfj,"Agreed with daffodils, tough to tell and the questions on the tests are weirdly worded. Best way imo is to see how posters in enfj write and how they connect ideas/form conclusions versus the Esfjs here. After some time you'll notice lots of difference between the two types :) "
92,esfj,"I'm surprised I got downvotes lmao. I wasn't trying to demoralize you. Anyways, I know as an SFJ, we try to play roles-it's normal af.
Rate your memory from a level of 1-10. Do you think you can remember the faces and names of all your elementary school teachers?"
93,esfj,"This is probably very ESFJ but I have worked in accounting, marketing and business development, and diversity and inclusion work over the past 10 years (2-4 years each). Eventually I get bored and frustrated with each role because I don't feel I can impact peoples' lives for the better directly and the roles feel very administrative/rote. All roles have been for professional services firms (accounting/law firms). Because I like process and organization I can keep going like this for a while but I don't feel satisfied. I finished an MBA in Marketing about a year and a half ago, while working full time, and I will be looking for my first post-MBA role this summer. I'm hoping to take this time to perhaps find something a bit better suited for me (I worked while in school and am already in middle management so I recognize I may have to take a step back to gain specialization experience, but that's okay if it means I'll feel more satisfied long-term). I thought I'd reach out to fellow ESFJs who may be in the business world for their input. 
I have learned I prefer smaller to mid-sized companies for the opportunity to personally get to know colleagues."

96,esfj,"I feel ya, bro. 
I just try remember that I work harder than everyone else at my workplace. ESFJs have a great work ethic and it definitely shows. Your boss wouldn’t be complimenting you if it weren’t the case. I try to remember back to where I began and I’ll see that I’ve come a long way.
I’ll also spend more time by time to ponder things about myself and really sit down and break down why I’m feeling this way. Even though it can get a depressing, I usually think myself out of the rut. 
Don’t know if this helps, but if you need support, feel free to pm me! You are great!"
97,esfj,"If I feel that way, when I get home, I fiddle around on my guitar to help me process my feelings. Additionally, if I manage to do sometime nice on the guitar, that small achievement makes me feel a whole lot better. In other words, find something to do that's relaxing and therapeutic for you, which also sometimes grants you a rewarding sense of accomplishment"
98,esfj,"Hi, I've been wanting to ask Fe users directly about how they see Fi at its extreme. 
As a dom Fi user (INFP), I don't really take people seriously if they show a lot of outward emotion/facial expressions. They seem kind of fake, but that's just my instinctual reaction. I know that for Fe users, being very outwardly expressive and caring is the most genuine thing they can do. 
So go ahead and tell me what your instinctual internal reaction is when around an INFP or ISFP being their normal self. Does it also seem not very genuine to you, or unnecessary? What is your mental process and internal feeling like around them?"
99,esfj,"I am an ENFJ, so not exactly what you were looking for, but I did get 100% Fe user so there's that. 
My SO is INFP. She and I are each other's support in everything, but there are times when I can see something is wrong, and I will ask, ""What are you thinking?"" or ""Is something wrong?"" And she says ""I don't know."" It happens a lot, and at first, when she and I were only friends, that she just kinda didn't want to tell me, so I let it alone, not wanting to pry. But I know now that she really just doesn't know how to express it. I will usually go with some open ended questions, like ""Okay then, What are you feeling?"" I have to kind of guide her through the expression. Once she gets started, then she becomes very articulate and really is able to vent. But it takes some help. So, no. I don't take it as ingenuine if someone can't express their feelings, or if they need to stew a bit first. I know it's an actual thing, that they may need some help, and that if they really want to express it, they will once they figure it out. "
100,esfj,"Hi! I was hoping to hear from any ESFJs out there, how you perceive INFJs? I’m guessing that because your PoLR function is our dominant function, we could come off as delusional or intimidating? Is this true?"
101,esfj,"I’m crushing on INFJ that isn’t interested in me (I told him directly in person) and he didn’t reciprocate. But instead told me about some other girl he likes. Now it’s my mission to get them together so he’s happy. I find myself pouring out love to him so he’s encouraged and confident. I get thrown pebbles in return but every moment he checks in with me feels like $1m bucks. I’ll eventually have to just walk away and leave it alone. I’m getting hurt. I lost attraction for him actually but my drive to serve him and boost him up is so strong. As a matter of fact, I thought I was over it and moved on but he flirted with me and my mind kicked right back into full on crush mode. But I know he doesn’t like me. I just had a bad dream where he asked another girl out and it felt like a nightmare I woke up and can’t go back to sleep which is why I’m writing this. So I guess that proves I haven’t moved on. We’re in the same friend group and we’re quite close actually so I see him all the time. 
So to answer your question. I think INFJs break my heart because I want to give them so much attention and help them. He has idealistic plans which I want to work with him on building concrete ways to achieve his dreams. (We discussed all this). But he’s so aloof. He doesn’t ask anything of me. He doesn’t need me in any way. So I feel lonely."
102,esfj,"In my experience, INFJs are more intimidating. They often let off an exterior of “I don’t care about you” or “I don’t need you”. Of course I don’t know if that is really how they feel, but how you present yourself is everything."
103,esfj,"I think it's less about how common ESFJs are, and more about where on the internet they are likely to hang out. My husband is an ESFJ and spends most of his time on the internet looking up stuff about sports and gaming and other hobbies of his. He's not very active on social media because he prefers to talk to and hang out with people. And while he's aware of his MBTI type, he's not terribly interested in delving deeper into it since, according to him, it tells him what he already knows.
I have a feeling that he's a pretty typical ESFJ. My mother is one as well, and just like my husband, when she's on the internet she tends to look up stuff that pertains to her hobbies, memes, jokes, funny videos, and practical things like recipes. So, in the case of the ones I know, chatting with other ESFJs about being an ESFJ isn't something they'd be likely to do."
104,esfj,"Im an INFJ myself, this breaks my heart to see this, it’s hard to just ignore your liking on someone. But moving on and accepting the reality of the situation seems to be the hard but only healthy option I can think of. You seem like you are very drawn to his idealistic plans, maybe you can make some of your own. You maybe a sensor, but that doesn’t mean you can’t be idealistic, being a sensor is just a label, you can be idealistic. Once you do have your own plans, you won’t have to be dependent on someone to change the world for the better, so you won’t even need him. You can change the world for the better yourself!"
105,esfj,"Thanks for your perspective! That sounds like a hard situation to be in! Thanks for reminding me that we're all multi-faceted! I guess I was looking for a one-size fits all response, but that's just not true about people XD"
106,esfj,"Ah oops. Yeah I do that. Especially when I’m in the grip, which is basically all the time when I’m working. I’ll totally start ignoring people. I was starting to suspect that it bothered my ESFJ producer, so thanks for the confirmation. "
107,esfj,"Yes, I read on a different forum on www.socionics.com (just discovered this site 2 days ago and am pretty obsessed lol, check it out, it's one of the most accurate sites I have come across recently) and someone (probably INTJ) pointed out their same theory how ESFJ types are not typically the ones that would be hanging out on the internet reading these forums and such.
I agree with you, there is definitely some truth to that.  I'm pretty much as ESFJ as it gets although I was almost 50/50 with the S and N, I am almost an ENFJ but still made the cut for ESFJ.  Maybe that's why I am much more into this stuff and dig deep into understanding than another ESFJ.
Aside from that, I still don't think ESFJs are as popular as they say but like I said, I don't really know many ESFJs.  I always attract introverts in my life and like to keep it that way :) "
108,esfj,I actually ended up asking how’s he feels about me directly. He likes me as a friend and appreciates my supportive nature but also asked that I slow down a bit too. I could honestly tell him that I’m not attracted to him any more and would love to just be a supportive friend. I feel a little sad but I need to remember that I was almost obsessed with trying to change this guy’s personality to suit my own... and that’s crazy. I’m aware of it. I hope I can come across someone like me someday. 
109,esfj,"I have been reading about socionics lately, and supposedly the perfect pairing is between types with the same functions in their function stack but in the opposite order, which for an INTP is an ESFJ.  What is your opinion on INTPs?  Have you met any that you have really clicked with?  According to socionics.com:
Have you found this to be the case?  Do you have any experiences with INTP mates/friends?"
110,esfj,"I was an only child growing up and I was/am jealous of people with siblings. Now my main circle consists of an INTP, ENFP and one other who wont tell me. The three of them I look at like brothers and sister. The INTP and I are wicked complimentary, its really nuts. But this took a while to become this and I think that little extract you provided might explain why him and I took so long to click."
111,esfj,"That's interesting.  I think INTPs tend to come off a little condescending sometimes.  We value our own thoughts and opinions a lot more than that of others.  Even if we don't consider ourselves superior to others, I can see how it might come across that way.
Also, that description was of the duality relationship type, but I wonder if it varies depending on the two types involved.  Certain combinations might fit a lot closer than others.
Another thing: our functions develop more as we age.  If you guys are fairly young, maybe over time she will grow as a person and learn to appreciate what you have to offer more than she does now."
112,esfj,"I am over 30 and I am still struggling to develop my functions.
Part of understanding types is learning what sorts of things provide good opportunities for you to grow.  Take advantage of your understanding now to help you become more true to who you are.  I wish I had started when I was your age, but everyone ends up who they are eventually, provided they are willing to try to grow as a person.
Good luck!"
113,esfj,"I am an ENTP (tertiary Fe), and I find it pretty difficult to handle emotionally manipulative people.
I tend to kind of just walk away, as I’m not sure what I could say to remedy the situation (YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FE).
Any of you strong Fe users have any ideas for gracefully dealing with these types of situations? Thanks :)"
114,esfj,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.
My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.
I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.
Cheers!

115,esfj,"I'm INTJ, and my crush, 25 m, took the test recently for the first time and came out ESTJ. I could have sworn he's xNFx, so I thought maybe ENFJ? Idk, the more I read up on the two, the more I'm convinced he's ENFJ, but perhaps he has developed his Si and Ti. I have asked other redditors, and someone suggested that he may be ESFJ. Perhaps you can give some insight. So here's what I know so far.
While he does act like an ESTJ in that he tends to judge people at work based on their compliance and respect for, schedules and procedures. He's got a lot going on since he works full time, he tries to keep a really regular schedule of stuff he needs to do outside of work (laundry day, college classes, study time, and usually calling me at the end of the day and we talk for a couple hours).
However, he's always very expressive, and  when he tells a story he usually explains everything surrounding/leading up to the story before he gets to the actual story, and he usually describes his overall impression and how he felt about what happened. He bought a book on watchmaking, and pretty much immediately started reading and applying what he learned to watch repairs. He's really good with numbers and math, and is currently taking a class in differential equations (I'm not sure if that's uncharacteristic of ENFJs, but it seems like understanding systems like that is typically an N thing). He was taught how to cook from a young age, and the way he talks about it, he actually enjoys it. We've been friends for almost 2 years, but things have only started to progress in the past couple months and now when I see him he is very into physical contact (e.g. hugging me, touching my arm, dancing with me pretty much all night). I was invited to a small gathering, and when the hosts wanted to get everyone dancing, and he was the first to start the dancing. He fixed me some food, and I got food poisoning and he took care of me. Usually when there's a ""milestone"" in our relationship (like talking on the phone during the recent eclipse), he says, ""Are we having a moment!? :D"" and seems really excited about the progress in our relationship. Whenever I start to wonder if I should tell him something, he always encourages me to be open with him. In fact, when I asked what he wanted me to tell him, he specifically said, ""Everything! I want to know everything you're thinking about!"" He seems to really enjoy when I open up to him, especially when it's uncomfortable and vulnerable (which is scary for me, an INTJ). He said something about how it shows trust? He said he's typically really good at reading people, but these days he makes a conscious effort not do it anymore because he feels like he knows too much about the person and it can being upsetting sometimes. And the last reason I think he's ENFJ is he is a slut for the Confucius meme, lol, which I've heard ENFJs are really into memes.
I've asked ESTJ redditors what they think, and it seems the consensus is that he's definitely not a hardcore ESTJ. 
Here's what one redditor said about where the ESFJ and ENFJ overlap:
TL;DR Does anyone else find that they tend to act like an ENFJ? How can I determine if he is ESFJ or ENFJ for sure? What do you feel like your biggest differences are with ENFJs?"
116,esfj,"He isn't an ESFJ for sure.  If he is an ENFJ he should be passionate about some bigger picture issues even if they may be illogical.  He would also be interested in many forms of art and get distracted by many different interests and ideas.  But ultimately the biggest difference is an ENFJ will make decisions from their ""heart"" or intuition rather than logic or analysis. "
117,esfj,"Both. 
ESFJ's build their own morals based on how they were raised (or raised themselves). So if they never talked out a thought process or misunderstanding, they might build up walls or rules around that wrong information. This can lead to them thinking they are being nice and helpful but they are really playing chess outloud, moving everyone the way they want and not what actually works for others.
Advice on taking to her, I would say be honest and straight forward. Don't bring feels bring facts and explain where she helps and where she doesn't as clearly as you can. 
Hope this helps!"
118,esfj,I am in a weird relationship with an esfj guy. I am crazy about him and I know he likes me too. But it’s a ldr and we really only have texting for communication which doesn’t lend itself well for conveying tone. We get to see each other once a month-ish. It’s always intense but I wonder how much of that is my natural tendency to be intense and the time between seeing each other. He has said “I want to continue to see you as long as you will let me.”  Are you guys really this committed?
119,esfj,"We are totally committed. I (ESFJ/f) had a long distance relationship with an ENFP (m) for 2 years and it was hard at times but it's important that you trust us, don't be too clingy but shows us that you do care and want us. It helped me to see that my partner really wanted to be with me no matter what and was happy to understand who I am. Don't treat us mean because that doesn't keep us keen but show us the possibility we have with you in the future, that you are committed and want to be closer together at some point. "
120,esfj,"I agree with the statement above! We are totally committed. I may pretend otherwise because I’m afraid of being hurt but once you’re in, you’re in and I’ll do whatever it takes to make it work (mostly behind the scenes because I’m insecure about being clingy).
I (ESFJ-f) also dated an ENFP (m) but I don’t think he was a mature one. We lasted just over a year before I lost it. He was condescending and a bit controlling and I could never express myself without being shut down. He was much too scattered for my liking as I like structure and being organised. We got along for the most part and I did like his energy and passion for life. He was fun but he wasn’t what I was looking for in a long term partner - I felt like it fell on me to be the responsible one all the time. I felt like the awkward parent in the relationship even though he was 10 years older. Show us stability and that you have what it takes to be a reliable partner and that’s all we need. 
I have ENFP friends and I adore them but I couldn’t be around them for too long because they’re much too flaky and scattered."
121,esfj,"I totally agree. I'm the organizer, the doer, the responsible person in the relationship who sometimes need to act as a parent otherwise things won't get done. But then, he shows me how to have fun and that life is about having fun and relaxing and not being too strict with myself. I think ENFP are great because they care about your feelings and would actually do anything to be with you but can also be controlling at times. Fine balance but a mature ENFP is a real blessing for me because he makes my life so much more exciting! "
122,esfj,"Hello everyone. Im 17 and I will be soon graduating high school.
As most of ESFJ's i like artistic stuff and caring for others and i got to say i have a pretty hard time choosing between these two fields in terms of choosing a job for me.
Heres some background story of my life:
When I was in primary school i got bullied quite a lot. It made me withdraw from social life, and stick to a very little circle of friends. At that time I learned by myself how to draw, and  i got to say as the time went on, i got very good at it. I tought of becoming an architect or some kind of designer when I will grow up. But when i hit 13 I got an idea of creating youtube channel. For the first time in my life i started  to speak openly, loudly, with no shame or fear, which became insanely empovering, and i experienced a great sense of joy from this form of art which was creating videos . It also affected my social life in middle school - it became very easy for me to socialize, read and understand peoples feelings, and even speak in front of big crowds. Then some stuff happedned to me in life which basically leaded me to withdraw from social life more than ever, and as i started to get my sh*t together, I started feeling some sense of desire to teach and help other people. I started thinking about becoming a doctor.
As i took the MBTI test, and started understanding my actions i took till that point in life, i began realizing i had a little bit of a doctor in myself trought my whole life, for example by always picking some support/medic type character while playing videogames with friends, and caring for the ""weaker ones"" at school. Also I was always easily catching any medical theories, and basically i liked to learn how human body works.
That's it. Now I have to say, that I feel I would rather like to become a  doctor than some kind of an architect or filmmaker, because I feel I need caring for others, and love in my life way more than creating stuff. Idea of this job gives me some sense of ""emotional independence"" - I don't feel like i would have to keep chasing after girls as i did troughout big part of my life, because my emotional needs would be fulfiled with that job. I can add here that im probably Enneagram type 2. I also feel like even though i have some talents in artistic field, creating drains me out of some kind of ""emotianal energy"" more than it gives to me.
I know im not scared of blood and i can control myself in emergency situations, but i have readed a lot, that ESFJ's are very sensitive - too sensitive, to get trough rough med school, and too sensitive to make tough decisions which can affect their patients health trough the rest of his life. I can also see how this sensitivity affects my life - it's very hard for me sometimes to motivate myself, and im generally not a disciplined person.
Also I can't understand how could such change in character happen: in primary school I would definitely decribe myself as introverted. Now im extraverted as hell.
I know nobody else, but me can pick myself a career, but I would like you to share your thoughts about things I have written, and if you as ESFJ's have some experience with these career fields, please say a little about it
At the end I would like to apologize if my English wasn't perfect, but it's not my native language :v
Thanks for reading!"
123,esfj,"You should still take the medical school route. You may find something you like that is medically related and helpful to others that doesn't involve immediate life and death. Perhaps looking into nutrition, medical research or nursing. So many options.  Discipline can be learned and life will toughen you up. Go for it. Figure out the first step and take a leap of faith."
124,esfj,"Off the bat, I feel the need to tell you that you should never look to work to replace meaningful human connection. You'll only be disappointed. That being said, that doesn't mean your job should be meaningless. It is clear you like the in your face adrenaline/joy of helping others. Might I also suggest looking into being a fireman? I have several friends who are firemen, and they get more medical calls than actual fires. And the whole part of being a doctor, the aftercare, diagnosis, etc. the hard part basically, is not put on you. You get to give them immediate help, without the ""responsibility"" or liability of being a doctor or a nurse. Whatever you choose, make sure it makes you happy. And also, just because this is what you pick now, doesn't mean this is what you have to do for the rest of your entire life. Young people tend to be short-sighted when it comes to picking a career. Maybe do the medical thing now when you're young and vibrant, and maybe you can do the architect thing later in life. If you're in school, try talking to your guidance counselor (if you school has something like that). Or just another trusted adult. It's always best when ESFJ's TALK out their decisions. You don't even always know what you want until it just pops out of your mouth during a conversation."
125,esfj,"I just realized today I should consider athletic or performance coaching. I was cheering on a friend who feels really sensitive about exercising and is just getting back into it. It felt really good to be giving him true and real advice (the more you put effort into something, the more you will want to come back to it- it's true it's like a drug in your brain. it has to do with subconscious mental engagement). I could totally see myself being really happy, watching people get better and better at stuff and challenging themselves and feeling good about themselves because that's exactly what I like to see. Social sciences interest me especially in its application so that could be another reason why I find the role of a coach appealing. My personality dictates the ""happy seeing others grow"" part."
126,esfj,"I think your thoughts on going to the medical school is a good choice. Although ESFJ is sensitive, they are also very good at take care of other people, which made medicare or other related jobs a good fit for them. ESFJs emphasize order and hierarchy in their lives, and don’t mind working on projects that involve repetitive or monotonous tasks. They are generally reliable, and thrive in places with clearly laid out rules and structures. ESFJ personality types are often great in administrative roles because of their natural aversion to conflict, their love of order, and their practical skills. Some Common ESFJ careers include:Social Work;Medical Care; Personal Accounting; Teaching; Non-profits. 
You've already made a very clear point on only you could pick yourself a career. Wish you good luck:))"
127,esfj,"I married and ESFJ and it's absolutely exhausting for both of us.
She whines and nags about me not being emotional enough and I grit my teeth in silence as she goes on yet another emotional tantrum/rant about literally anything and everything.
We cannot have deep conversations because I come at it from logic, facts and open-mindedness and she comes at it from feelings and a sense of moral high-ground and neither of us literally give a flying f*** about those things, respectively.
Opposites do attract though.
We admire our hero and parent functions. I admire that she's so comfortable around people and can make friends with anyone and she admires that I can solve literally anything and can see through obstacles. I admire her hard work ethic and dedication and she admires that I can stay so calm and collected all the time, even in crisis.
It's a cluster-fuck to say the least and it's extremely difficult to manage but more so lately. But when we're both chilled out and laid-back, being lazy, it's a joy to be together. All in all, possibly the worst match I can imagine for a deep relationship. I'd say ESFJs are fucking amazing friends though."
128,esfj,"I have a close friend who is INTP and he is definitely my rival!!! I joke with him of how he is my mortal enemy and archnemesis, but it is just my endearment to him. But we are definitely rivals!!! It's like we are the same but reversed!!! I am actually ExFJ but I think when it comes to cognitive functions, it explains why we are that way, because our cognitive functions are the same, but reversed (ESFJ and INTP). I think we can never understand each other. I'm not sure with him, but I still appreciate him even though I cannot comprehend him (He is a mystery to me)!"
129,esfj,"I'm here because I'm typing people that I know, and I got to my step-dad, who I like to refer to as The Step-Dictator®. He is my sworn enemy and I wanted to know if I would hate all ESFJs or if it's just him."
130,esfj,"As an intp, I can agree we like esfjs. I think I understand them well enough but feel self conscious about not being able to connect with them as well as I'd like 
(maybe because my Fe has no idea what to do)"
131,esfj,"Awww, you INTPs are so sweet! :) I also love so many INTPs in my life!!! I cannot understand them most of the time, but I appreciate them and love them!!! :) Even though we are complete opposites, I think we get along well! :)"
132,esfj,"That's a pretty good answer. I have a friend who is INTP and he thinks we are diametrically opposed functionally. With INTP's having the primary and developed use of introverted thinking as opposed to the extroverted feeling of us. TiNe versus FeSi. If you are north we are south right? Opposite but in an attractive way.  
Now I'm not sure the validity of what he had to say but it makes a certain sense to me. The analytical versus the empathetic I guess."
133,esfj,"Hey guys! So I'm an ENFP and recently I had my mom take the test too. turns out she is an ESFJ! 
Unfortunately I feel like our relationship is strained. She says she trusts me but she behaves like she doesn't and has therefore been very strict (even controlling) with me for most of my life. I have tried to talk about this whole thing with her but it I can't tell if she just doesn't want to or doesn't even think we HAVE a weird relationship. I think it's the first one because she used to say ""I feel like I don't even know you"" when I was in trouble as a teenager. But, obviously our mindsets/personality types are different, so I want your perspective before I just assume. 
What can I do? Do you think she doesn't wanna talk about it, or do you think it's more that she doesn't even notice it? 
ps-I have gone to therapy but I have only gone in-depth abt our relationship during one session, so I'll likely do that too as soon as I can. But that won't be for another year and half, starting March. What can I do in the meantime? 
Thank you so much, hope that was readable. "
134,esfj,"My sister and mother have the same issues. My sister, ENFP, was very rebellious against the tradionalist rules my mom enforced. It led to her leaving and living on her own.
I'll tell you this, know how your mom operates and just give her what she wants. Unless it's severely abusive, I doubt it'll actually end up affecting you. For example, let the fly buzz around your face, what's the harm? 
Don't forget, your mom, ""thinks"" she knows what's best for you. She's a sensor with a present minded way of viewing things and a future-worrying oriented way of foreseeing things. So maybe she just cares in her own illogical way."
135,esfj,"ESFJ aren't great at NeTi, or understanding new perspectives. They will stick with what they know/experienced. 
You've got to expose her to whatever you are in small doses. You don't want to be controlled, well, don't be. Just do it small doses, not slamming the door at once. Give explanation here and here and let it accumulate.
Of course, whatever you're in therapy for (is it actually important?) will impact that."
136,esfj,"Thank you. I appreciate your intent but it really does affect me. I found myself becoming a super people-pleaser in other close relationships bc it was a habit I had with her growing up, hence the therapy. I do know she cares, and I appreciate that, but the way she cares has always felt confusing for me. Also, I have moved out and am going to college. I just want to get a little closer to being her friend "
137,esfj,"Thank you. That's what I am trying now, small explanations here and there with patience. I am in therapy for my anxiety and the way it affects my boundaries in close relationships"
138,esfj,"I don’t think I see fe in myself. But does someone efj here preferably want to look through my user history and tell me if they think I am one of you?
Thanks.
And please please explain. I don’t think I have fe but I could be wrong.
People say my posts don’t read like estj and I don’t seem like one."
139,esfj,I chat to most redditors via discord. It’s a much better platform and has voice chat functions so it’s easier for chatterboxes like me. Otherwise just messaging is fine. I’m always up for new friends (:
140,esfj,I don’t have a good discord thing available. I guess if you really want send me a message I’ll give you my number. I don’t usually but I am curious enough. Haha! I have mostly decided on probably not but I mean I can actually relate to ese a little just not the oh you feel deeply parts. Hahaha! So I don’t know. Now people are thinking ESFP and I am not a p haha! Or fi. fi people usualy know they are fi. Hahaha!
141,esfj,"aww that's nice of you to say that bro! legit got a smile on my face when it came up on my reddit feed
thanks for the well wishes :)
i don't know much about ISTP's nor do i have any ISTP friends but good to see one around"
142,esfj,"Hello lovely people!
ENFP here. The three ESFJ I know are all in their teens or early 20s and they struggle a lot with anxiety.
I know a lot of types struggle with anxiety (I myself have all the major symptoms and it’s very frustrating) but ESFJs seem to have a particular kind of loop, somehow their anxiety is different from mine and they struggle much more to find good coping mechanisms. 
I was wondering if this is an ESFJ thing, and if it is, what is your experience? Was there something that made you click and made your anxiety better? What are some good resources I can recommend to the people I love?
Thanks in advance!"
143,esfj,"I was 21 when I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I went to counseling, which did help some, and I learned a mechanism to help me organize my priorities (and subsequently my anxiety and self worth). But honestly the life changer was medication. I take a low dose anxiety/depression pill, and looking back I truly don't know how I functioned before then.
Years later, after graduating from nursing school, getting engaged and married, and moving multiple times, I tried to quit the meds, thinking that after growing up and having less stressors in my life I'd be ok without them. Unfortunately I reverted to having the crippling anxiety I'd had before the meds. I decided to go back on them because that kind of life is no kind of life- even if I have to be on meds to live THIS life. "
144,esfj,"Look into the enneagram. This may have more to do with what enneagram type your friends are. I think gender also plays a huge role as well. My husband is an ESFJ, and he doesn’t have any mental health issues at all, which is weird! He is also in his 30s so I bet that helps too. But hopefully looking into the enneagram can help you and your loved ones! Best of luck "
145,esfj,"It's a vibrant community with lots of active members. If you want to stay a while and listen, or say something yourself join our server. We have a variety of communities involving psychology, philosophy, and typology

146,esfj,"Ah, good ole CSJ, i found his videos to be a bit meaty, but his recent typing videos are pretty dope.
​
fairly thorough analysis of Fe, i wish he could be a bit more concise, but nonetheless, dope vid."
147,esfj,"I have determined I am probably an ESFJ but I just want to check.
Are esfj enneagram 1s common? 126 probably.
Also I peaked in to a thread and everyone seems to be a big reader of fiction on here. I find that I am actually much more interested in non-fiction. Is that not a common esfj thing?
I am also fairly ambitious hopeing to work for my political party. Perhaps not being a person who runs for elections but some sort of person that works with others in either campaign or with a congressman. Is this rare for esfj or is this normal?
I also read widely like stuff like word and trivia games and read widely to know a bunch of stuff, mostly if not entirely non-fiction. it may not be books but stuff like this on websites like this just researching stuff.
That’s all I have for now maybe I’ll come up with more."
148,esfj,"I can only speak for myself and my observations. I read almost exclusively nonfiction. My enneagram type is 2w1 and my tritype is 2-6-1. ESFJs can be very ambitious. 
Here’s some information on enneagram and mbti correlations.

149,esfj,"Do you have to be a people pleaser and be super easy to influence as fe? I don’t tend to think of myself as a people pleaser. I just tend to be liked a lot. I connect with people well if you see what I mean but not necessarily be a big one for people pleasing.
I also have a lot of opinions and stuff like that and can be argumentative."
150,esfj,"You don’t HAVE to be a people pleaser. I have a fairly self-assured and argumentative ESFJ friend. She’s an ESFJ Fe subtype. However, her main focus in life is helping people.
I am a pretty independent ESFJ, but I hate disharmony and conflict. I will argue when needed, but it makes me extremely anxious.
What would those that interact with you in real life say about you?
Do you feel other people’s emotions quite readily, or do you typically need explainations?
Do you notice other people looking uncomfortable and feel 100% obligated to help them? (Like you don’t even consider not doing something)
Do you find that you overextend yourself to help other people?"
151,esfj,"So I'm an international student from a foreign country, I've had my dad take the MBTI (out of curiosity) and he came out as an ESFJ. Being an ENTP myself, I seem to be the complete opposite of him which irritated him more than it irritated me. I seem to be open to more ways of doing things and he seemed to continue to ignore me and follow his older ways. Any advice on mending our relationship? "
152,esfj,"I can relate heavily to this (although I'm not an international student). As an ENTP myself dealing with an ESFJ father, it can be painfully irritating at times if not most of the time. We're polar opposites, which you stated was the case with your situation as well.
This isn't the most professional advice, but just wait till it's over. Wait till you can get out. I've sought professional help but I've found that it's extremely superficial and my underlying feelings about my dad haven't and won't change. He'd still irritate me, but I was just being told not to show it.
I can wholeheartedly agree with the idea that you're the open-minded one and skeptical to old values/traditions that quite frankly are useless at times, as that tends to be the scenario with many ENTPs' relationships with parents from my experience. 
There's not much you can do about it, from what I've learned. In his eyes, you're the minor and therefore you are subjugated to his ways, and not the other way around. Trying to refute his demeanor or traditions will just result in more conflict and you two disliking each other even more. This is not to say that you should just go along with what he says and believes, as that'd be quite hypocritical of myself to utter.
Keep in mind I am only 15, so I may not be the most creditable source for help, but hey, it's better than getting a ""realize your parents only want the best for you and love them for that!!"".
Anyways, best of luck in your household battle of ideologies.
G'day, sir (or ma'am)."
153,esfj,"It's Friday.... Today my plans are to finish up class. Then go over to this store called ""world market"" to check out their wine and beer section. (They have all imported merch. Big variety) 
    After coming back from Germany in August all beer I have had is TERRIBLE. I deeply miss all of the German brews.. Let's hope this place carries at least 1. FYI -Munich had the best beer IMO. 
Your plans ? "
154,esfj,"Husband and I had social plans that fell through. He asked me to be flexible with what we do tonight (I'm not always flexible) and I responded with, ""I will plan on being spontaneous tonight."" So no clue!"
155,esfj,"Ah yes, German beer is nice but Belgian is even better, I think.
My plans are simple - relaxing at home after a tiring week. I honestly ran out of energy to go out/go to the gym. Tomorrow, however, I'm going to a gig and afterwards I'm going to eat some Ben&Jerry's. :D"
156,esfj,"Sounds very nice. Just finished my day actually
   Picked up some beer from that store, they had a few brands I liked luckily.. Now I am just relaxing also. Ben and jerrys is good my favorite is cherry Garcia. If you've never had it.... Try it. "
157,esfj,"Really wish this sub Reddit was more popular. It's Friday again. Any plans ? I have class in the morning. Then have to finish some school
Related stuff. Drinking with a few friends then later that night having another friend over to watch movies and drink more lol. I sound like an alcoholic but I am not!! Just rekindled old friendships so it's celebratory. Was in Germany for 5 months. "
158,esfj,"Indeed! Not many of us seem to be on Reddit, which is a shame. Btw, movie night and drinks sounds like fun! I'd totally be up for it but...
Today I took a day off work to relax before tomorrow's day trip. So today, among other things, I'm making a chili sauce, reading comics and mags, and going to a gig in the evening.
Tomorrow, I'm up bright and early again for some shopping, hanging out with cats and friends. I'm also going to a beer and burger festival (really excited to try an imperial coffee stout and a burger or two!) and an IFBB (I think) championship. Then it's burgers again.
Sunday, it's rest day. :3"
159,esfj,"Hi! I’m an ENTP and I’m just curious about the ESFJ type. I could read articles about them all I want, but I figured better go to the source.
What’s it like? How do you go about daily life? Tell me about you!"
160,esfj,"I'm not sure what it's like to be an ESFJ because... well I am one? It's like what do I compare that to if it's all I know. 
I lead a very conventional lifestyle. Work, home, sleep. Self care such as eating, showering, etc. Very routine. I look forward to the moments of ""self care"" because I'm lame like that. I love meal and coffee breaks, for example. 
During little breaks in my day, I mess around on the internet where I think I can partially resemble a strong Ne user (I might have several tabs opened either waiting to be read or will never be read). 
I also try and spend tid bits of time from someone important to me here and there. Usually my brain drifts from time to time and suddenly ""Oh yeah- how is that person doing? I should say hi"", and I'll message them.
I also day dream too much for my own good."
161,esfj,"Well hey, ENTPs are big day dreamers too. Not as much love of routine, but holy hell do I always have too many tabs open. Currently have 11 open in this window alone (also two more browser windows open that we won’t even discuss).
We can certainly struggle with personal connection. It sometimes feels like I share too much personal information because I strongly value the truth and don’t like when relevant information is withheld, regardless of whether it’s factual or personal.
Sorry about how vague or hard that question was to answer, just looking for some comparisons"
162,esfj,"no need to apologize :) honestly I think it's interesting to see all of us learning about each other. I think my skills in understanding abstract language has certainly improved, and I've learned the second most from the ENTPs on here (the first on that list would be the ENFJs lol). But yes many XXSJs do tend to prefer specifics as u/esfj3 indicated. 
And I can relate with the oversharing, although I've noticed ESFJs are wayyyy more sensitive to other people's responses than ENTPs, so we probably end up being a lot more cautious when it comes to interacting with others. Quite frankly, I am envious of ENTPs (seeming) ability to just always say what's on your mind and not care what people think. The irony is that I've learned that your tertiary-Fe does make you desire to leave a positive impact on others, although it's not your primary focus (unlike for us). Even so, the confidence ENTPs display especially while debating is something unparalleled tbh."

Results Post Here

Hey there, ESFJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESFJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
164,esfj,"I am an ESFJ, see below for test results.
Your score for openness was 50%. This is in the moderate range.
Your score for conscientiousness was 58%, which is in the moderate range.
Your score for Extraversion was high, at 71%.
Your score for Agreeableness was high, at 75%.
Your score for Neuroticism was moderate, at 56%."
165,esfj,"ooooooooooooo, Im an ENTP with a 45% Openness score. Interesting how youre higher than me, though I get a different result on this website than on any other website, try taking it on outofservice.com? I mean if you have the time, its a short one. But it corresponds to my results with all the other websites, just not this one."
166,esfj,"My mom is an ESFJ. She is very clingy and a massive nitpicker. She likes to put her arms around me/my brother for no reason and without our consent. If my hair is off in the slightest way, she will hold me in place and fix it, no matter how long it takes. She also refers to introverts as ""weird"" or ""just shy"" and rejects any counter-arguments I have. The most annoying thing she does by far is act like an airhead. "
167,esfj,"ESFJ here.  That just sounds like overbearing mom behavior. How old are you?  I'd just sit down with her and calmly explain that you feel uncomfortable when she acts that way, and that you'd like to be treated as the [age appropriate] person you are.  
Edit to add:  You want your mom to respect you as your own person.  That's important and I agree 100%.  However, you should also work on accepting and respecting your mom as a person.  Some of these things sound like they are just her personality traits.  They might annoy you, but they are not uncommon nor unhealthy.  For example, my mother in law (who is NOT an ESFJ) is the biggest airhead I know.  It drives me crazy but it's just who she is.  I know there are things about me that drive her crazy.  We are different, and I have to accept that and move on."
168,esfj,"Thankfully, my ESFJ mom is not that bold about anything and she seems to accept that I'm not ever going to be as affectionate as my sister (ENFJ). I can relate to the whole ""oh, you're just shy"" thing. She doesn't seem to understand that it's not mental shyness, I physically don't like the noise and stimulation of going out all the time. For a while she didn't get that I didn't ever have to be fixed."
169,esfj,"I recently found out that I'm not an ESFP or ENFP, as long as I thought I had dominant Se justifying it as ""taking things as it is,"" it also came with a whole other set of traits that I don't relate to in the slightest, including things like being assertive, concerned with aesthetics, and great at taking charge,, and this kind of thing has been popping up everywhere, and has been following me around for as long as I can remember. You can clearly see me trying to overlook these for a long time, but after awhile it starts to feel like I'm forcing a puzzle piece. It came down to, if I'm not an ESFP, then I'm not an ESFP. 
After being lowkey rejected by ESFPs, I figured I was ENFP, especially with posts like this, and posts like this, and posts like this, lmao. But then I go and read about dominant Ne and intuition in general...
... it sends my running for my dear S.
My cognition simply isn't dominant Ne. I'm not constantly shooting out ideas  or having hunches while drowning in possibilities,
Where are y'all seeing the intuition?? LMAO
So I found a good middle ground at ESFJ - And to confirm it, I was verified over a video chat and got typed as an obvious ESFJ, and  ESFJ pretty much accounts for everything. My massive Si tendincies I'm always talking about, the resteraunt stuff and the nostalgic recalling dates from the past, and I tend to base my descisions off the past too, like if I knew that this particular resteraunt has some nasty broken soda mechine, I won't order soda there, things like that. ESFJ also has Ne, just not dominant, but it's there enough to explain why I kept getting barraged with ENFP typings lol. And the inferior Ti would explain why I'm pretty bad at logical consistency, people have pointed that out to me a lot too. 
But about the Fe. People have pointed out that in my questionnaires I mention appreciating a good social atomosphere, that's lively, cheerful and accepting, and accepts me for who I am, and it sounds very Fe. Wanting to interact with people especially on discord, caring about twitter followers, wanting to be chill and not control anybody - sounds like Fe. 
But the thing I don't relate to, is Fe being good at creating social circles, reading the room, being good with social cues, and being well liked by most. I am a cringelord for crying out loud, ever since elementary school I've been kind of lowkey outcasted, because I'd always overdo it with expressing my obsessions or meme references or whatever. My family also gets on my ass a LOT about acting socially inappropriate, and I've actually been banned from some places. I'm trying to work on that, but my point is it doesn't come naturally, like a dominant function should. I'm far from a popular social butterfly, the closest thing I'll be to that is typology discord lmao. I believe that everyone has the right to live their life their own way, we're not here to control each other, nobody is less than as a human, the world (especially cities haha) is a beautiful place, and I see no need for social games, gaslighting or any form of malicious manipulation, I just want to live my life with people I love and do what I love. Does this support or go against Fe? They seem to be very big traits, just like how Se dom have these big traits, and I would just like to know if it's that big of a deal to worry about, or if they actually end up supporting my type. 
Edit: I just want to say, that I really do respect and trust everybody's analysis here, I appreciate all of it and I don't want to seem like I'm disregarding anybody's opinion. I hope I didn't come off as 'screw everyone' on this post, I'm just a bit confused atm."
170,esfj,"Yeah, that supports Fe. 
You could just be socially anxious. 
I am too. I'm ESFJ and I do a job that requires for me to be social all the damn time.
You might be ENTP-might, but your narrative seems very Fe."

172,esfj,"Yeah but s/he confirmed your type based on you mentioning that you were an ""outcast"" of some sort which makes no sense. Esfjs overall are probably less likely to be some sort of ""outcast"". 
However I myself don't live up to the stereotype either.
I think it's great you are now much closer to understanding your type and yourself, and I'm really happy that you are trying to authentically assess yourself. I agree that it's important to ignore stereotypes and focus on understanding what Fe is. If you haven't checked it out /r/JungianTypology has great resources. 
I also noticed that it's easier to type by comparing how you write/link ideas together with other people of a certain type. You can see similarity between how u/dragonman369 and u/goonswitkush (Esfp) from one of your posts act for example. "

174,esfj,"I love JungianTypology! People gave me in-depth analysis for me being ESFJ, and it makes me feel a lot better that I don't have to fit a stereotype to be a certain type. And comparing how I act to other ESFPs is very interesting, and the difference is clear as day. I hate taking charge and I don't have near as much assertiveness as they do. I'm more of a walking meme fangirl if anything lmao. I'm really glad to have some contrast and it really helps!"
175,esfj,"Haha I hate most memes funny enough. Occasionally I'll like one if I think it's clever.
But yeah, I'm sure Esfjs can be assertive at times, maybe sometimes even as much as or more so than an ESFP. Depends on the person and even depends on enneagram, but I still don't think that's a reliable way of determining someone's type. I'd suggest going through this page if you haven't already and learn the functions for yourself."
176,esfj,"Hey fellow Esfj's how do you guys act around people you like?(crush)
When I like someone I tend to get either quiet around that person or a little to excited when around them. When I'm with my friends I get open more and start to say stupid stuff but it's only because the person I like is there so I tend to get to anxious. But when we're one on one I talk better with him. And when I know there in the same room I tend to look for them just to know we're there at and who there talking to(discreetly). What wrong with me!? Why am I saying stupid stuff I would usually never say!?!(I'm so confused)😵 🔫"
177,esfj,""" No other kind of relationship provides people with the ESFJ personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming.""
- https://www.16personalities.com/esfj-relationships-dating
ESFJ's tend to require devotion and support in relationships. Due to this, most relationships with ESFJ's are formed after an initial close friendship. Therefore my advice to you is to get to know him better, treat him like a friend and see if you think it will work from there."
178,esfj,"I'm an INTJ, but I need a bit of help understanding all you ESFJ's. I figured that this subreddit would be more appropriate than INTJ, so sorry if it isn't. Either way, I am confused about how your personality type makes decisions. For me, I find it overwhelmingly difficult to make any sort of decision without having some sort of logical pathway/plan. It confounds me how you are able to make decisions without some sort of analytical basis to make your decision upon."
179,esfj,"I don't know if I can speak for all ESFJ's here, but I'll do my best to explain how I make decisions. :p How I make decisions usually depends on the gravity of the decision. For smaller things I usually make it quick and bring it back to my core values. & For bigger decisions, I will spend a few hours doing some research, go through the pros and cons of my decision, do some more research :p, ask family and friends what they would do and what they think of my decision so far and then lastly spend time alone to think about how the decision will fit into my overall plan in life. ^Run on sentence ftw. :D So in other words, if the decision will have a big impact on my life, I will spend a boatload of time analyzing the different options I have and picture where each decision would lead me to in the end. Then I spend what feels like an eternity to pick the one I feel will help me get to where I want to be/who I want to be most effectively. In general, I also spend a lot of time thinking about how my decisions will affect the people close to me. Hope that helps."
180,esfj,"How do you know they don't have a path of reason when they make decisions? They could but just not tell you or find it hard to articulate. Just because you don't understand their reasons for a decision doesn't mean it's baseless. You should be asking them why they decided on what they did instead of overanalyzing them in your head. This isn't a personality problem, it's a social competency problem."
181,esfj,"I agree with this. I generally base my logic off of my emotions unless I have time to really think things through. Even when I do, I always mange to draw up scenarios based upon how I think people are going to react.
I also got a late start in life so I feel like a lot of my decisions and and lack discipline put me in a somewhat child like mind set in terms of impulse and lack of will power. 
Over all, I believe that we make a lot of our basic and complex decisions based off of our own personal experiences and emotions. Up until we make the appropriate mistakes in our personal lives as well as our professional lives."
182,esfj,Were you strongly N last year or was it pretty much on the fence then too? Since I found out about MBTI in November I've been testing as an INTP but with the T being only barely dominant (55-60%) and then one time it wound up being only 49% resulting in a score of INFP. I'm pretty sure I'm still an INTP deep down but circumstances have been pushing me towards the F because I was in an emotionally difficult situation.
183,esfj,"It might be easier to think of it in terms of functions (socionics). Socionics is based on our top 4 functions out of 8. It's kind of like MBTI in that there's intuitive, sensing, feeling and thinking functions, but each of those 4 get assigned either an introverted or extroverted role. Fe = extroverted feeling, Ni = introverted intuition, etc...
According to socionics, everyone has an intuitive, sensing, feeling and thinking function in their top 4.
ENFJ would be Fe-Ni-Se-Ti
ESFJ would be Fe-Si-Ne-Ti
So ENFJ are considered to be ""intuitives"" because they have N in their top 2 while ESFJ would be ""sensors"" because they have S in their top 2, but it's not surprising that if you're one of those two the strength of your ""N"" and ""S"" functions would be pretty close.
In terms of how the socionics functions relate to the other MBTI letters, the E comes from having an extroverted function (Fe, Te, Ne or Se) as your #1, and the J comes from having an extroverted judging (Fe or Te) function in your top 2.
I think it might be more helpful for you to think about whether you use Ne and Si or Ni and Se, rather than N or S to figure out your type. Both ENFJ and ESFJ value making others happy, but I find that an ENFJ will be more like a psychologist encouraging people to accept themselves for who they are while an ESFJ will be more focussed on creating a positive atmosphere and people's physical comfort.
ESFJ's Si means they focus on what worked in the past, how things made them or others feel, and use those experiences to decide what to do. ENFJ's I don't understand as well since their functions are different from mine (INTP = Ti-Ne-Si-Fe; reversed priority but still same functions as ESFJ) but from what I understand, Ni focusses on determining the logical implications of an idea. So I think that would be like if an ENFJ decides someone feels like x then therefore that means y, therefore z and try to get the big picture about someone.
ESFJs also have a light hearted and goofy sense of humour and seem like they really don't like dark humour, or music, movies, books, etc. ENFJs can enjoy that kind of light hearted humour too but it seems they will also enjoy dark humour. Like when one of my friends told my ESFJ friend that hamsters sometimes eat their own babies she had such a devastated reaction and the cheerful expression she almost always has drained right out and she went really quiet for a few seconds as she was processing that. ENFJs might find that shocking but also somewhat intriguing.
The 1st you use automatically almost all the time, and the 2nd is the one that it's usually paired with, but sometimes you'll use the 1st and 3rd instead. The 4th one you usually only use when you have to because it's pretty awkward, and using it can be draining."
184,esfj,"That's not really socionics, that's jungian theory. Socionics only really differs from Mbti in introverted j vs p, everything else is the same 
Personally I think for classification/ formula purposes socionics is better, but for practical actual irl application MBTI is better"
185,esfj,"It's pretty tricky, I still don't fully understand some of the functions and what exactly they mean, but from my understanding, it's more or less like this
Te = figuring out what to do
Ti = figuring out how things work
Ne = noticing how things are connected/related, pattern recognition
Ni = understanding how one thing leads to another
Se = awareness of how you physically impact your surroundings
Si = awareness of how your surroundings impact you physically, but possibly also emotionally, and remembering that, and is often said to include fact gathering too
Fe = awareness of others' feelings and how to affect them
Fi = awareness of your own feelings, morality"
186,esfj,"ok quick portraits. i'm going to assume you are male from the name cristiano for sake of ease. 
enfj: friendly, they range from moderate to high energy, usually internally a very soft and emotional male. Somewhat self conscious about this fact. Although able to be conscientious and perform duties, they often ignore school and are distracted by their classmates. More often in the female is the need to entertain everyone and be the star. Will usually have some sort of artistic hobby to express their feelings. Males have a tendency when they get to adulthood to increase their machoness. Prone to being confrontational, wishing to start fights and lead a life of excitement. At times prone to being a shit starter if they are bored. Doesn't really keep care of household duties, can be able to live in a total mess. Interested in 'out-there' topics like origins of the universe, aliens, conspiracy theories, etc especially from a less rigorous perspective than say an NT. Wants to be rich and famous. Views life as a war or battle. Usually has a vision for their plan in life.
ESFJ: friendly, more often on the high energy scale (rare they are moderate energy, but esfj males are more rare in general than enfj male). Very friendly and open, wishing to be friends with everyone. Usually very kind, avoiding arguments and conflicts in a comical and forced manner, bending over backwards to NOT insult someone. They can hold their own if need be, but wish it never happened. Lives day to day, doesn't have much a plan of the future. High capacity for work, does well in school, works hard on the job, works just as hard at home. Have much more willpower than the ENFJ, who lacks some serious discipline. Much more family oriented. Wants to be perfect. Views life as a chance to have fun.
i will post a couple vids to help out. granted these 2 aren't the most typical examples, they provide a good contrast. 
ENFJ Tito Ortiz https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAeEU1DxU4Y
contrast that with some of his shit talking interviews.
ESFJ Super Sage Northcutt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTWuJeHUZFw
he is kind of an over exaggerated version of an ESFJ but a good example.

edit:better sage interview in the 2nd."
187,esfj,"I should add ENFJs will be pretty good with Fi and Ne and ESFJs with Fi and Se, but those are functions that while quite strong, they tend not to enjoy using as much.
ENFJs aren't very good with Se and Ti and ESFJs aren't very good with Ne and Ti but they still value those and will try to use and improve them."
188,esfj,"Hi ESFJs! INFP here looking for some inspiration. What kind of gifts do you like getting? My ESFJ sister's birthday is coming up and I've no idea what to get her. For context: it's her 30th, she's married and has a one year old boy. She never really talks about things she loves except for sweets, chocolates and wine haha."
189,esfj,"I mean, if all else fails, then fancy (or not) chocolate/wine is a great gift!! But, personally, I'd just ask her if there's anything she wants or needs? :]
Personally, I love handmade gifts/cards even if they're small. Maybe a small collage or scrapbook of good memories? 
And this will sound cheesy, but really anything bought or made with thought is very much appreciated."
190,esfj,"My ESFJ wife loves elaborate themed gifts, where lots of thought and organizing went into it. It doesnt matter exactly the theme as long as its something you know they like. But get a few things or a bunch of small things and pay attention to presentation. So if I was using Harry Potter as an example, a small wooden box with a gold snitch (a ferrero roche with paper wings attached and folded inside) A scarf with colors or other apparel from the house they would be sorted into. And wrapping paper using their house colors. Using as many details from the theme you are going for. It wows them and shows you care enough to find out all about their interests and take the time to put together something so entertaining and comprehensive. Does not need to be expensive but just show a lot of thought and attention to detail!!!!"
191,esfj,"I honestly believe that with only about 6 actively participating ESFJs on this sub that the vast majority are people curious about the type than actually the type. But to answer your question, I’ve been expanding my internet browsing more over the past couple years but it’s first a resource, then a time-suck. So when I’m not looking up things or researching the main things I use the internet for would be YouTube and Reddit (I do watch this sub, I just don’t have questions to ask personally). Overall I don’t really “surf” between not having the time and just using what I want to use and then being satisfied"
192,esfj,"I'm on the internet (my phone) almost constantly. But it's usually just checking in on social media (twitter, instagram) or getting sucked into various Reddit wormholes. If I'm browsing, I'm usually shopping or reading articles. Or trying to gather information to set my fantasy football lineup for the week. "
193,esfj,"I'm logged onto my email while I'm at work all day, and I use the internet as a tool at work quite regularly.  When I'm at home, with no other plans, I'm usually browsing Tumblr far too much, or reading.  Lately I've been on the internet quite a bit, which has meant other hobbies have suffered.  I may try to limit myself more going forward, but probably not.  Laugh!  "
194,esfj,"I'm on the internet very often, using a wide range of social medias like snapchat, instagram and twitter! if i'm not at an event and just lazing around at home, i'll usually watch videos on youtube or read stories on ao3.. if I am browsing I'm usually shopping! ESFJs are really inactive in the MBTI community :/"
195,esfj,I liked being at home with my family the most. It was hard for me to keep long lasting friends because I was kind of bossy. The best moments I have are being around my family laughing and eating and just being myself with them
196,esfj,"For me I was shy. Never been on great terms with my family, especially in recent years. Always relied on friends more. Always an average/ slightly above average student. Always tried to seem/act smart which got me in trouble a few times "
197,esfj,"Worst moments were my ENTJ father losing his temper.  Otherwise, I had a seriously ideal childhood.
I am close with all of my family members, although, at times, my three younger siblings have all been distant, combative, or outright uncommunicative.  So that hurts.  But we get through those things.
I am super super super close with both of my parents now though.  They are my best friends, and they spend a lot of time with me.
I was a straight A student with a high IQ.  Married my INTP husband.
I am highly motivated by psychology and helping people, as well as my Christian faith.  I write books and homeschool our kids.  I love to theorize - even more than the INTP.  (Yes, we have our types right.  Not all stereotypes are true.  ;-))"
198,esfj,"Best moments was doing well in school. Always a straight-A-teacher's-pet type. Had a solid group of friends, but fit in with all the groups (i.e. populars, goths, thugs, preppy, athletes - typical ESFJ social butterfly). Worst moments was just family drama, nothing personality related. My mom is/was crazy. Attempted suicide when I was 8 or 9. Lived with my grandma for many years. So that put a strain on everyone and every relationship in the family. Two older brothers. It always seemed like only two of us could get along at a time. I was motivated for a long time (still fight it now) by my need for my mother's approval. Overall, I was a VERY good, obedient, studious child. Rarely acted out. Never got in trouble at school. The only time I got detention in my entire life was for chewing gum."
199,esfj,"We cancelled a romantic trip this weekend because there was, ""too many other things that need my attention right now"".  Ah, an ESFJ man who needs to keep everyone happy.  At least I had the guts to tell him I was disappointed and though his logic was spot on (because yeah, we do have a lot of things we need to finish up and have some closure on, business-wise) I would like to be considered someone who needs his attention, too.  He agreed, and yet the trip was still cancelled.  Such is the life of living with an ESFJ man."
200,esfj,"Hello dear ESFJ women, men, anyone that will find an echo within their lives about the long story I'm about to tell you.
A few of you might remember me, I was the desesperate guy that tried hard to understand his ex after neglecting her and sending her away... failed miserably at getting her back and then be hated by her.
Well, as I said I would, since then I constantly tried to improve myself, in every possible way and I've been really fine.
I also got back in ""good terms"" with her last october after writing her a letter that basically said that her presence in my life at the worst moment saved me and gave me the will to become a better person.
Since then, my feelings for her never changed, but I kept it down, we see each other in classes between internship and every time, I engage in a short brief but happy conversation. I always ask her if she is fine, give a compliment, a little joke, help her whenever I can then I leave.
(She also has been with someone else for a couple of month so ... )
Three months ago, she heard by a common friends that I was seeing someone, and in less than a week, she started following her on instagram.
She gave that friend an ""angry face"" when seeing him messaging her once in class
I also made a trip with that person last month, she saw it since she follows her.
Recently, my friend was having a party at one of my ex's friend home and she started asking about me "" How I was"", he said that I was fine, just got back from a trip blablabla, she answered "" Oh yeah I already know about that :) ""
Last week, I arrived at school after a rough night and proceed to tell my friends the story ( hooked up and such), but outside the classroom.
Later that day, another of my friend's ex was with him and she told him "" Jorg does seem to be fine these days hey ?"" and a bunch of questions about me hooking up and apparently her face was not one of happiness when he told her I was ""really fine""
Three days later, my ex was there, first time seeing her in a month, she instantly gave me a 2 seconds ""death stare""
I still went and talked to her the same day and two days after, for once I decided to teaser her and joke abit, she seemed responsive.
Since she also blocked me from every social thing at the time after an argument I decided to ask her some advice which would have make her send me a text message, she agreed but got nothing back.
To anyone reading this much, it might be some dumb shit, it would also be dumb and boring to me if I wasn't concerned by it but I'd like your opinions.
I'm not very familiar with those ""games"", being 1) ENTP and until recently closer to a machine than a human 2) not this immature but ..
Well"
201,esfj,"Sounds like she's jealous to me. And strange that you're stringing her along, showing that you care about her but somehow your  relationships end up in her face. You're probably driving her crazy, and confusing her. If it were me  (I'm an esfj) if want you either completely out of my life, or in my life as what you previously were. The in-between is too difficult emotionally. "
202,esfj,"My ""relationships"" end up in her face because she wants it.
She is the one who followed that girl and who got her friends ""investing"" things.
I do think she isn't ""uninterrested"" by me but she won't show it, and truth to be told, if I saw that she didn't care I would not hang on, but seeing that makes it impossible for me to let it go.
My entp-ness disappears when it comes to her and I find myself looking more as an esfj than anything else.
I don't know what to do to make her ""step forward"" if it's what she wants deep down"
203,esfj,"I had an ex write me a letter expressing his feelings after we broke up, and it made me change my mind because I couldn't stand making him hurt in the way he described. He described his loss without guilting or shaming me but just expressing why he loved me and how hard it was to be separate. We then dated for another half a year. But it was a very emotionally painful relationship. "
204,esfj,"I've been (too much)
When I went out of my ""self depression phase"" I went all out, without tactic, without even thinking, I was blinded by love and the possible lost of her so I overwhelmed her, ridiculised myself by being unactractive.
The real problem started when I saw her once with THE guy I hate on earth, I couldn't bear it and, one night while drunk I beat the shit out of him :') 
But in the end, he rejected her because I knew he was a dick using her in order to forget his ex.
Now we're ""cool"", but I really feel like I can't go all out anymore.
I had to enter that ""mind"" game where it feels like I'm playing chess.
But yeah, truth to be told, what kills me is the absence of action, I'm always planning a move when I know I'm gonna see her, and if she becomes single I won't wait much to offer her a drink"
205,esfj,"Yay it seems things started to change after that letter.
But I don't think it's because of me being hurt, I think I gradually became (once again), first, the person she fell in love with and then with time, an even better person.
As a, once, very very logical person I would believe that either she is missing me and feeling attracted once again to the person I've now become, or she simply liked the idea of me running after her.
Don't know which one would be the most plausible truth tho"
206,esfj,"WARNING: SUPER LONG POST
I recently had a life-changing experience with an ESFJ. Having not known any ESFJs closely in the past, I was blown away by how genuinely caring she was and how much she made an effort to relate to me. She was also very smart on an intellectual level, as well as being very sharp in terms of street smarts. And she was also very wise, offering general life advice in a sage-like way.
If you don't mind, let me indulge for a little bit and share my story:
She is a friend of mine from high school who visited me for a weekend. During the time we were together, we had some very deep conversations about our personalities, our lives, and how we had changed since high school.
She and I Skype from time to time, and we've spent a fair amount of time talking about her, so this was the first time we really delved into talking about me in great depth.
She noticed I had changed a lot since high school. I had changed a fair amount physically, but she commented more on how I had changed personality-wise. She said that I seemed more poised and that I carried myself differently. In high school, I was more loud and immature, whereas in college I had definitely grown up and become more mature.
However, she commented that the flip side of this was that in high school, people knew who I was. I wasn't popular by any standard, but everyone at least knew who I was. I may have done some dumb stuff, but because people knew me, my good qualities shined through. If I messed around in class, at least most of the class would support me, so my teachers ended up liking me. She said that everyone knew I was smart (brilliant, she said), because I wasn't afraid to show who I was, even if some of the things I did were immature sometimes.
Now, she commented that I had completely turned into an introvert. She said I had reverted into my shell and kept my guard up.
She was taken aback to learn about certain elements of my personality, some of which had been around since high school. She was surprised by how analytical I was, as I had not shown this side of me in high school (we were close, but not that close back then). She didn't realize that I approach the world and all problems I face from a purely analytical standpoint, and that I am constantly thinking, my mind is always running, and I am unable to shut it off.
She was also surprised to learn how much of a planner and a scheduler I am. I enjoy routine and regularity to a certain degree, and I also enjoy large-scale plans. I reminded her of instances in high school where I had gone out of my way to plan a big event for our class, taking a leadership role on it and seeing it through the finish line. I also enjoy working on personal projects just for fun, like a big Excel spreadsheet to analyze a bunch of data. The love for that sort of analysis was there in high school, however, considering how much more varied I was as a person in high school, the need for regularity was not as great.
I also surprised her with my strong memory. I was able to flash back a number of times to events in high school and remind her of them in precise detail.
The one detail of my personality that I think she was particularly startled by was how I sometimes learn about and analyze someone without talking to them at all. Either by watching or listening to them, or by looking them up on Facebook, I get a sense for their life without having said a word to them. I mentioned that I have done this to all my friends, including her, and she was noticeably creeped out by this. (In retrospect, probably was TMI. I forgot that we hadn't seen each other in 2½ years, and something like that may not need to be shared. I think it also pushed her in the direction of ending her trip short, amongst other factors.)
She and I connected over a lot of things though. Family, friends, high school, relationships. I learned a lot about her too and it was very productive.
We ended up discussing the topic of relationships a lot. She said I seem to be self-pitying myself a lot (something that had slipped out over the course of our conversations during that weekend). I posited that I wasn't sure what else to feel, given my lack of success with girls. I had never had a girlfriend, had only kissed one girl on a chance occurrence, and had never even been on a date. She said that I was too nice, and that comparing myself to my peers will only hurt my self-esteem. She added that given my nature for wanting stability, I didn't offer what girls my age wanted. She said that most of the girls I meet are probably looking for excitement and adventure, and I was mostly looking for something more low-key. I asked why, and she said that girls are often looking for a bad boy, rather than someone more ""marriage-material."" I pushed further, and she said that this is because of their need for drama or excitement, or in her case, because she had more of a savior complex. I acknowledged that this was probably true, but said it doesn't make it easier in the near-term.
We also ended up discussing standards. She said that she had all sorts of standards that her ideal husband needed to meet (to the point of extreme specificity). She asked what my standards were for my future wife. I realized I had not even thought about what my potential spouse would need to be like. Outside of ""nice"" and ""good sense of humor,"" I literally had nothing else that I would consider important, saying my personality is malleable enough to be compatible with a lot of people. She was surprised that I had not given this any thought, as she said that most people she knows at least had a sense of what they were looking for.
We went on to discuss my one brief fling I had with a girl I met. I revealed to her that a) she was much, much older than me, b) I didn't even really like her at all, and c) that I pretty much just went for it because the opportunity was there. I used a baseball analogy: ""When you're a pinch-hitter, you don't get many opportunities. So a strikeout is much worse than if you're in the starting lineup. You have to take advantage of every chance you get."" I acknowledged that this sounded like more self-pitying, but I believed it to be true. She said that I need to get more standards for myself, and start thinking about what I really wanted.
This topic raised a larger issue about the direction my life was headed. I said that I don't like to set goals for myself in general, just doing what I see to be fit at the time. She said having tangible goals is important, as it would allow me to move in a direction that was right for me, rather than sitting in the passenger seat of my life. I said that I have a general sense of where things are going, and don't actually need goals to accomplish anything. She countered that if I don't set goals, I'm not really looking to get anything accomplished with my life.
The discussion on relationships brought us to the issue of confidence. My friend said that while I have matured, and I have become more career-focused, my attitude almost makes me intimidating to girls, because I'm not as fun or playful and they don't know what they would talk about with me. She said that the lack of confidence is apparent, even based on slight physical cues (slouching, walking with hands in pockets, standing with arms crossed, etc.). She said my job seems to be unfulfilling to me and I'm not enjoying it and getting a lot out of it, plus it comes with long hours, hurting my ability to find confidence outside of my work. She said I need to find ways to improve my confidence, even though it's not that simple, and recommended a couple of Ted Talks to watch.
Finally we got onto talking about high school. I shared some other things from high school, with regards to relationships, friendships, or just general memories that I had thought of. She noticed that I had such a strong and fond recollection of high school, but I hadn't found that in college. She suggested that I regretted my college experience, not because I had made the wrong choice, but because the experience wasn't what I wanted it to be. She also implied I was depressed. While I told her that I didn't feel sad at all, I acknowledged that I really didn't feel anything. She told me that it's not good to be numb to my emotions, and that I needed to open up.
I said that I kept looking forward to meeting up with high school friends, and that spending time with them would be more exciting to be than spending time at my current university. She shared with me that she had a hard time moving past high school too. She was so popular in high school and everyone liked her. To go from that to college, where no one knew her, was a hard transition. She said she was depressed her freshman year of college. She said it would be harder for me, because I had so much fun in high school, in a small town, in my comfort zone, and I went to a big city where I was a nobody, and I quickly became introverted and made no friends freshman year. But she said that it wasn't normal to remain so attached, no matter how close I was to my friends in high school. Despite being so popular in high school, she realized that outside of a couple good friends, no one else was looking back and reminiscing. Everyone was moving on. She would have to do the same. And so would I.
She said the biggest change for her came when she went to study abroad. She had settled in better sophomore year, making new friends and getting involved with different groups, but when she went to study abroad for a semester, she truly learned more about herself. She became more confident in herself, she learned about who she was and what she wanted to do, and she said words I will never forget. She said, ""I'm happy now,"" as sincerely as she could. I knew she wasn't just saying that to prove a point. I had commented on how much wiser she seemed and how tough she was, and I realized the fact that she came to my city and had no problem navigating for herself, doing what she wanted, without even needing my help, was proof that she was a lot tougher than I really knew.
She said I needed balance in my life. I had spent three years in college so far doing the same thing, taking the same boring classes, not taking any risks, and now I was turning into a shell of my old self. She said I needed a change, and pushed me to study abroad. I told her that I have too much to do senior year, and that I hadn't planned on studying abroad. She asked how I would feel if I was told I had to drop everything for a year and live in a foreign country. I said that I wouldn't want to do that, because I would want to think about my career and my other commitments. She told me to stop thinking so much and just take a risk and try something new. I would have the rest of my life to play it safe, but this would be the best time to take risks.
She asked what was holding me back, and when I listed a factor, such as a club, an event, a potential family or friend commitment, she shot them all down, saying that those things could all wait and could all be done later. She said that nothing was worth missing out on a great abroad experience for. She said that I needed to change, and while I could do that in New York during my last semester, she didn't see that happening, given how stubborn I am and how New York has been to me so far. She suggested a change of scenery would do wonders for me. That I would grow so much as a person while I was abroad, meet and connect with people in a completely new environment, and hopefully be happy. She insisted that having an adventure would be a good thing, despite what I might believe. I decided right then and there to study abroad during my final semester of college. I had carefully laid out a four-year plan for college, and followed it to a T. But she made me realize that I needed to throw out the playbook and do something different.
The last thing she said to me was not to dwell on anything she had said, to just relax and fall asleep (it was 2:00 AM at this point) and think about it later. I had no idea how she knew I was dwelling on it.
She left a couple hours later to head home in the middle of the night, while I was asleep. I heard her leave. I checked to make sure she was gone, and then I broke down in tears. I cried for nearly two hours. I hadn't cried in two years (the most was when I teared up when I watched Boyhood). I thought I had forgotten how. No one has ever been able to break me down like this. I felt emotions that I didn't even realize I had before. I also saw she had written a note on a piece of paper and left it on my desk. I can't read it yet. I'm not emotionally prepared.
I was amazed at how she made an effort to connect with me, learn about and understand me, try to help me, and how warm, astute, and genuine she was. I felt an emotional connection with her that I had never felt with anyone before. After she left, I felt like she had taken a piece of me with her. I just wish I could talk to her more. She didn't even offer me a hug, because I don't think she realized how much I needed it. How much she had made me feel.
ESFJs, you guys are wonderful people. Don't ever change. I wish more people knew how genuine you are. I'll say this, if there's one preference I now have when it comes to finding a spouse, it's that I hope she's an ESFJ.

An ISTJ
"
207,esfj,"I do want to know:
How do I connect with her now? I want to keep talking to her, but I think that she wants to keep our relationship a little more distant. I don't think she'll think it's healthy if I keep talking to her, considering everything she told me about moving on. And I don't know if she was as fascinated to learn so much about me as I was by her.
My other question is, what can I do for her? How can I show her my support and love the way she did for me? I want to be a part of her life in some way, in a way she wants me to. How can I show I'm always there for her, the way she was with me?"
208,esfj,"Hi there! I'm quite smitten with an ESFJ. As you delightful extroverts tend to be, he's just nice and loves all people. 
He is also humble, perhaps leaning to the point of density😆 So I have tried to be very intentional about making my feelings clear. He seems to be responding well, giving encouraging feedback. 
But what's the difference between an ESFJ who's interested and one who's just being their normal, bubbly selves? Even if you do get interested, is it maybe just because the person put the idea in your head? Not because you independently admire them? 
Thanks! "
209,esfj,"I think that an ESFJ that likes someone will definitely ask him/her out or find opportunities to get to know you better and have alone time. If he shows up more often and asks questions about your family/friends/personal life and has long drawn out conversations - I would say there's a good chance he's interested.
While I am a ESFJ girl, I like to be bubbly around people but I will always try to find an opportunity to be around the person I like... to make them a priority in a way. "
210,esfj,"My ESFJ boyfriend was pretty straightforward about his feelings for me from the beginning. He makes friends with everyone, and is a bit flirty with everyone by nature. He was was more upfront with me though, saying his intentions, really showing a vulnerable side of himself. I feel like if you get talking and he opens up a bit it could be a good sign."
211,esfj,"i'm an ESFJ and tbh, when talking to people i'm interested in then i'm very forward and upfront about it (even though in my head i think i'm playing it very cool and taking it slowly)
i saw in one of your comments that he's passed a few opportunities to hang out together - which makes me think that he could like you but not in that way yet - and is very aware not to lead you on. then again, i'm very dense when people are attracted to me. 
there's still time though, so i wouldn't give up yet!"
212,esfj,"ESFJ (gay woman) here, and I can only speak for myself. I hate conflict and I am pretty good at feigning ignorance when someone I’m not interested in is clearly into me. I’ll be nice and friendly but I’ll avoid one on one situations for sure if I think they want something to go down. At the same time, I’ll usually talk openly about crushes on other people, etc, to make it obvious I’m not on the same page. Men tend to mistake my friendliness for interest. Not saying this dude isn’t into you, I don’t know the situation at all, just giving the negative perspective. If I like someone I make a deliberate effort to be with them"
213,esfj,"Recently been dealing with a guy at work liking me and not taking a hint that I don’t want to go out with him. He asked me out once and because I’m nice I said yes and took my roommate in hopes it would be clear im not interested. Not sure if he got the idea but he’s backed off for sure. Also ESFJs gossip a lot so if this guy asked some of my co-workers he’d find out, maybe. Another thing is people are pretty darn loyal to the ESFJ even though they gossip with everyone so you’d have to find a person in your office who the ESFJ talks to that doesn’t realize it’s gossip they need to keep to themselves. For me if this guy asked the right person I’m sure they’d tell him without realizing it would hurt his feelings. "
214,esfj,"Thank you! It's tough because he does those things, but also passes up opportunities to do be alone together. He seems a little nervous around me alone. 
Do any ESFJs get anxious over intimate settings in the way introverts get anxious in crowded settings? "
215,esfj,"I definitely do not get anxious over intimate settings with someone I like, nor do I imagine passing up an opportunity to spend alone time together. For me, personal time is really important to me, whether you're a friend or a love interest. "
216,esfj,"I mean, I think it's natural that we, as humans, get nervous around someone we like. Some of us hide it better than others; so I wouldn't put too much thought into things that. However, I think that a lot of ESFJ's are pretty straightforward in our actions and feelings of someone we like, and thus we will show it and probably acknowledge it too.
I would actually ask him out, if you can. Just ask him if he wanted to go get drinks sometime or maybe out with a group of friends/coworkers, if that's more your style. It will show (maybe) interest on your part romantically but it would come off as interest that you want to get to know him better. Either one is what you make of it, but it would probably be flattering to him that you asked to hang out."
217,esfj,"He has invited me out with groups and we've gone together. But realistically, it seems like I should continue to be polite and encouraging, but assume it's nothing until he makes it abundantly clear. Is that fair? "
218,esfj,"INTJ (M) seeks ESFJ (F) for messaging to discuss topics of a wide range and test a theory I read about that said ESFJs are the most feminine MBTI type for females.

Don't make it weird, just send me a message if you're interested to have conversations, and we can add to the discussion."
219,esfj,"Hello my fellow ESFJ's. I've been on numerous breakup sites, toxic relationship sites etc. I just wanted a different perspective. As ESFJs we tend to form ourselves to be what people need/want us to be, to make them happy?
I recently got out of a relationship which was so incredibly toxic. I ignored all the red flags (which is pretty normal I think) but the thing is, even after I got my heart broken, I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship. Now, almost done with grief, I never even really hated my ex. I still don't. I don't secretly still love my ex or anything, but I still hope she's happy. I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with ""saving"".
​
I guess my question is, have you dealt with turning into a stranger during a relationship just to make your partner happy? How did you avoid this later on? And how did you move on? I feel like because I feel mostly sadness for my ex and her circumstances that made her the way she is, I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. "
220,esfj,"I've had a very similar experience. At first, I was depressed about losing myself and scared that I'll repeat my mistakes. Recently, after spending time with friends who are patient and not judgemental, I've realized that all I can do for the future is to not make the same mistakes. I try my best not to rush head first into pleasing someone. However, I realized that I can still care about other without emotionally over committing myself. Best of luck on your journey through life :)"
221,esfj,"OP, I had to break this up into two different posts. I will follow this one up with another post with my quotations... but hopefully you will find something valuable based on my (ENTP) relationship with an ESFJ. Dated for close to three years so I like to think i know what I am talking about with chiming in here. Below are three comments where I chimed into other posts under r/ESFJ in the last few weeks which cover different points... Before I get started with directly quoting prior contributions I do want to add a couple of short points based on your post specifically. 
"" I idolized my ex. I still harbor love for my ex, and pain for the fact that my ex is so broken and that's why I was put through the things that happened in the relationship.""

I can only speak from experience on how I was dumped by my ex, who claimed the relationship was toxic. She stopped communicating with me and chose to bottle up issues instead of talking to me. We were long term so I would have greatly appreciated having a legitimate discussion rather than her not saying anything. Contrary to belief as an ENTP we are not only very capable of handling conflict but we are also relatively receptive. Had she actually worked on the relationship I would have done what I needed to do for the sake of the relationships integrity. 

"" I forgive her for the things I was put through because I KNOW I turned myself into an easily manipulated person because that's who my ex needed me to be. I went into the relationship with a backbone and while I was in it, turned into the helpless person my ex was obsessed with ""saving"". ""

I think this happens more than you realize. We will bend our own convictions (Did the same) in order to make somebody else happy. Later on we realize what we had done to ourselves. This is part of the healing process to my understanding. You should not be someones pet project. You should never be looking for that metaphorical white knight to save you. If you take nothing else out of my novel of a comment. You are valuable and you have value as a person. 

""  I would have stayed and helped her be the person she wanted to be by using me as an emotional doormat. I just never want to loose myself again, but at the same time, would do it all over again because my relationship with my ex was so special. ""

You won't say it so I will. There is still regret in your heart about the relationship and you wish things happened much differently. Again this is normal. I am going to assume by how you wrote your post that you were the one who got dumped? Regardless you should never lose yourself in someone else. Remember that your needs are important and you are an individual who should make your own decisions independent of what other people want or believe. That doesn't matter if you're ENTP (easy for us) or if you are ESFJ (Harder to understand that concept naturally.)

Comment #1 from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/aspi5b/clingy_needy_just_miss_people/
""I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.

From her behavior she put way too much emphasis on what other people believed she should do rather than her own agency. I could never get her to do what SHE wanted to do.
She would become ""friends"" with anyone but could never see what I already know. Most people are not your friends because there is a difference between acting cordial, friendly, and actually being friends with you.
She was ALWAYS very clingy toward me. I never saw this as a problem because I liked the attention she gave me. She had days where it was overwhelmingly clingy and the way I got through it was to simply gloss over the clingy periods as if it is like her having a bad day. A clingy day doesn't have the weight to change my relationship with her because I find something she did too clingy.
SHE pushed me away from her life. Not because of her neediness. She had problems with her father and I firmly believe she took out her frustrations with her father on me when it finally reached a point she could no longer handle it. Also bonus points for replacing me with the gym trainer almost immediately, because ""I don't know whether I want to be with you or explore the possibility with this guy."". was a lovely touch for the long term boyfriend who treated her very well to receive on his way out the door. Haha.

Long story short not to label all ESFJ under one roof. But I believe there is a possibility that many ESFJ are far too emotionally driven to understand when they are not making the best of decisions. The strongest development any ESFJ can make in my opinion has to do with maintaining an emotional grounding when in more adverse scenarios. The second most important development point in my opinion related to ESFJ is a stronger sense of acting based on what YOU believe and what YOU want. Not based on outside influences and biases within your friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc.""

​
Comment #2 (A reply to another comment in the above post)
"" And my angle on it comes from someone who had nothing but love for an ESFJ whom I actually thought was pretty developed all things considered. Sadly since I am ENTP I can immediately see exactly what you realized with friendships. Not only could I not....get her to see reality, but since she is on the younger side of the spectrum, I learned how incredibly easy it is someone to maliciously influence an ESFJ. I have no doubt the ""friends"" I suggested she keep at an arms length were the ones she wanted to win approval of and they at least attempted to sabotage the relationship her and I had lol... The friends she had who were actually very good people who cared about her as well were of sorts, cast away as well.
If nothing else the guy who replaced me immediately was the one who vultured the relationship and she bought into it for likely the same reason. New person whom she wanted to win the approval of.
Sadly I think ESFJ are incredibly susceptible to being used and unlike some other types I am familiar with, I don't even believe they can understand that they are being used until way too late.""

Comment #3: https://www.reddit.com/r/ESFJ/comments/a6jlxs/how_do_i_manage_esfj_subtle_silent_treatment/
​
"" Very interesting take on this. My (23/m ENTP (borderline INTP) Ex girlfriend is ESFJ and rather than addressing the problems she was having in the relationship (almost 3 years in) she ended up dumping me, going the rebound route almost immediately and claimed I was making the relationship toxic (believe me I picked apart the whole relationship because I was taken aback by that statement and wanted to make sure that I was not subconsciously doing something wrong.). I have spent the last two months diving into human psychology, psychotherapy, attachment styles and anything else I could possibly find to get the answers I needed for closure at the least.
Looking back she was capable of communicating but only up to a certain point. By the point the relationship ended it was long overdue for some kinds of discussions to work on the relationship and move it to the next step.
It doesn't help that I could see right through her bubbly nature to see how hard she was trying to hide how her past was hurting her and I asked her to face it so she could get past it in time and be happy. (ENTP live and breath self improvement and INTP break shit down to a molecular level like its nothing.)
Word on the street is she is acting a lot different now and not characteristic to who she is. Basically I'm betting on house money that she is trying to bury me and she will not be successful because she will not be able to replace how compatible we were at the end of the day (not looking at it with rose colored glasses btw). She will be hard pressed as an early 20's girl to find another guy who will be both long term and check off all the boxes I was doing.
I think she is affected by her decision to end the relationship more than she leads on. I definitely think ESFJ cant handle personal development, conflict, or stressful situations at all. I remember having to talk my ex off of basically the edge of tears because of something that was almost mundane to me, but it was very important in her eyes."""
223,esfj,"Oh, absolutely. I was like the amazing morphing girlfriend, turning into whatever a guy wanted.
What helped: 
Not dating for a good long while. Spending a lot of time learning what -I- like to do.
Having good friends to keep me grounded -- like the kind who remind you that you hate being cold and your sudden desire to learn to ski may not be your own idea entirely, or that your newfound passion for cowboy boots is at odds with your sense of style since forever.
Seeing a therapist to help keep me on the right track.
Working on loving myself and realizing that there are plenty of people who love me exactly the way I am. One of my girlfriends actually pointed that out once… That there are many people care for me very much, and just because none of them were (at the time) in a romantic way, did not mean I was unlovable or needed to change. 
Looking at other people who are single, particularly later in life, and realizing that many of them have a very happy, active, fulfilling lives, and that I don’t need to warp myself into someone else to be happy and fulfilled"
224,esfj,"Wow, I think you know more about me than I know about myself, thank you for such an informative and detailed response. I definitely have always struggled living for myself and not merely to make other happy. My ex always tried to convince me to just do things for myself. And I am very clingy, but my ex was clingier, which meant I was able to stop worrying about her love for me and not seek her constant approval.  
And your comment about the people you suggested she keep at arms length being the ones she wanted approval from.. my family and my friends all disliked my ex. But all I wanted was to feel validated by her. I absolutely seek approval from most people, especially those I feel to be better than me (my ex on her pedestal). 
Like your ex, I also use a bubbly attitude to push down a ton of unresolved trauma haha. And while I did tell my ex all about my past, she got extremely tired of having to pry information and my feelings out of me (mostly because I believed they’d be a burden for her or I’d loose her approval). 
I think that ESFJ’s like personal development in the idea that they’ll be better suited for society, however we don’t like people telling us there are things we have to work on. And not in an angry way, just in a somber, “we don’t have 100% of their love because we have to fix something they don’t like” way. I have also cried numerous times over things my ex thought to be so bizarre. Conflict and stressful situations have definitely never been my strong suit though. I let so many things go unsaid, even if they really bothered me because I didn’t want conflict between my ex and I. I know that for these reasons, as well as some others, I was pretty toxic also. 
I’m sorry to hear about your break up. In my personal opinion, I do think your ex probably realized she contributed to many of the issues in your relationship. In order to not make the same mistakes, she probably is acting like a completely different person but I don’t think that that will last. Especially not with someone who seems to be a rebound. It sounds like she lost someone who truly loved her and would have been willing to make it work. And as an ESFJ I guarantee you she is probably still thinking about you often, wondering if you’re thinking about her, if she had any impact on your life etc. I hope healing has treated you well though. "
225,esfj,"You're welcome. Hopefully what I have to say may help somebody who has not yet reached the point you have. Sounds like you have come a long way 
""I have also cried numerous times over things my ex thought to be so bizarre. Conflict and stressful situations have definitely never been my strong suit though. ""

This is legit exactly what my ex did. She was aware of how bizarre it was but I always allowed her to let those emotions flow as they happened. My rationale was that something surfaced and rather than having her push it down it was better to see if I could get her to move past something if at all possible. Only mistake I made is I am a problem solver. Since my relationship with her I have been working at becoming a better listener which is what she really could have used more. 

"" I also use a bubbly attitude to push down a ton of unresolved trauma haha.""

My last official argument with her was an attempted break up and she turned back from it (Long story I wont bore you with lol.) but I remember telling her ""You have a bubbly facade that you use to make it look like you're happy. But all I see is a sad little girl, who is crying deep down because all she wanted was her father to love her."" ... She told me after the argument that I was spot on with it.
One of the last things I did before the break up was tell her that I wanted her to be able to get to a point where she can put the trauma of her past aside so she can experience what it is like to be a happier person. I had gone through a similar process with my own proverbial skeletons in the closet a couple of years prior so I wanted to make sure she knew that I was going to help her however I could.

"" she got extremely tired of having to pry information and my feelings out of me (mostly because I believed they’d be a burden for her or I’d loose her approval). ""
I think if there is one point that anyone who is ESFJ needs to pay attention to it's what you said here and what I have to say about it. I can only speak as an ENTP, but I personally wanted to know how she really felt. I covered the bubbly nature above but I knew it was fake for a very long time. There was never an opportunity that I could peer inside without fear of being pushed away. For me if I know what is bothering her then I could have not only better understood her, but I could have also given her the validation that I wanted to give for her inner self.  
"" In order to not make the same mistakes, she probably is acting like a completely different person but I don’t think that that will last.  Especially not with someone who seems to be a rebound. ""

Unless I am dead-ass wrong, I would classify gym trainer under textbook short term relationship at best and rebound at worst. Wouldn't be my first time having a girl want to try somebody else and finding out that I treated them better than any other guy did by an overwhelming majority. 

"" It sounds like she lost someone who truly loved her and would have been willing to make it work. And as an ESFJ I guarantee you she is probably still thinking about you often, wondering if you’re thinking about her, if she had any impact on your life  ""

I know what she lost and you're absolutely spot on. Never been in a rebound relationship myself to know if she thinks about me or not. I have assumed that because she ended it and completely blocked me out of her life that at least in this moment she does not think about me, nor does she at all regret the decision she has chosen to make. Which is something I have to learn to live with. At this point the test is simple. If I meant anything to her, she knows where to find me. Like I told her and you said. I would have done anything I had to do. If not then in the long term it will be her loss.

226,esfj,"At first: English is not my mother tongue. :)
So, its no secret that we care about our loved ones very much. In fact, I hate it when my best friend or boyfriend are upset. I do my best to cheer them up but sometimes its not easy or even possible.
Like yesterday, the computer from my boyfriend (INTP) got broken and he was inconsolable. I was positive and supporting because I know a bit about computers. He stayed inconsolable and I havent said something but it really fcked me up.
For me, it feels like a personal failure and I dont know how to deal with this.
He said, I gave him hope and a bit better mood, but for me it wasnt enough..
Is there anyone out there with the same problem and, maybe, a proposal for solution?"
227,esfj,"Ahhh, that can be a tough one. We like to be able to ""fix"" things, including people's moods. However, we have to accept that we don't have control over other people's emotions ... even when it hurts us to see a loved one hurting or upset."
228,esfj,Amen. I know it's hard to accept that you can't make someone feel better. You want to make them as happy as they can be. But sometimes it's just not possible. You have to accept the fact that you did your best. They'll come around eventually.  
229,esfj,"I (INFP) just started dating an ESFJ at the beginning of December and it has been wonderful. For the first in my 14 months of singledom, I've finally met a guy who I could see in the long run. He is thoughtful, sweet, generous, chivalrous, open-minded, funny, and we share similar interests - it's amazing. And although we only had 4 wonderful dates together in a span of 2 weeks (I had to keep the distance between the dates), the dates were full experiences, lasting nearly 40 hours total. The best part about these dates was that we never needed technology to steer conversation, we were always fully present in the moment.
​
Anyway, I had to go home (to a different continent) for 10 days following our last date. While I was away, we would text often and FaceTime, and he even gave me Christmas gifts which he insisted that I open in front of my family (which made it seem like he wanted his presence in my life known by my family). 
​
He's such a good planner, he would always plan dates ahead of time, and showed his ""both feet in"" interest following our first date. But it feels that something has changed since I got back (yesterday). Since he's such a good planner and was so keen to see me, I expected that he would want to see me right away! But it hasn't been that way. He seemed quite distracted yesterday when I returned. I sent him a picture of his x-mas gift that I brought back (which is a perishable item) and asked when he wants me to give it to him, and his response was ""I'm trying to find some time before I go snowboarding x"" which I think is Jan 3 or 5th. He did reach out again to me today, and his messages have been sweet and full of xx, but he still hasn't made any motion to try and see me. My initial reaction is to close up and send very dry responses, because I just don't understand this change in behavior. I really like this guy and I want it to work out, but my now fragile heart is scared of being hurt again. 
​
I've read that ESFJs are very loyal, and although we weren't officially together, he told me that I'm the first person (in a year) that he wanted to go on a second date with. He also planted many seeds in my head that he would be sticking it out for the long run. I've also read that ESFJs need a lot of positive affirmation, and perhaps my dry responses are pushing him away? He told me a few times how honest he is, so I'm thinking of messaging him saying, ""You've always said how honest you are, and I really respect that. I've noticed you been a bit distant lately, is everything okay?"" or something along those lines. I don't want to push him away, but at the same time, I don't want to play games and I need authenticity.
​
TLDR; How should I communicate with an ESFJ if I feel they are going distant? What pushes them away, and what brings them closer? If an ESFJ is super into someone for a few weeks, how likely is that feeling to disappear?"
230,esfj,"Yes dear they need affirmation but there are other factors to consider. Did you say something that might made him upset? Fes dont want to know that you offended them because they dont want unnecessary confrontation. Fes can be honest but most of the time they dont want unwanted confrontation ( in my own experience with fe dominants)
Affirmation is what brings them closer to you and if they see you are paying attention to them, they will be drawn towards you (imo experience). 
Try to message him like hi how are you and maybe he might strike up a conversation. Maybe he has other personal priorities? 
If it has been weeks and hes still not responding then dont wait anymore. If he's really honest then he will tell you right away. He is not your responsibility anyways and that is his problem not yours."
231,esfj,"Yeah I'd be as straight forward as you can. Just asking straight up ""hey I feel like we've been growing distant recently. Do you feel the same way?"" or something and go from there. See if maybe they're just not interested. Idk, personally I like it when someone is straight forward with how they're feeling"
232,esfj,"Boy oh boy, do I have an answer for you.
I am an INFP,
My mother, friend, and ex are ESFJs.
DISCLAIMER: ESFJs can be great as friends to rant to, because when you rant to them, they will be angry with you. They don't see the need to understand the other side, so you can feed off each other's anger and vent it all out. Same goes for any other emotion, I guess. As an INFP myself, it is nice to have someone support my side and encourage me to be selfish every now and then and just let my anger roar. 
My advice from personal experience: ESFJs question everything as ""you must not love me anymore"". They do not have the intuition to understand that love comes in many different ways, so it is hard for them to appreciate love shown in ways they aren't ""programmed"" to receive. It is hard for INFPs, because we have our own moral code that we uphold, and we take huge offense to someone believing we are less than moral.
From a girl's perspective of another ESFJ girl: Maybe through my friend's patterns, you can understand your guy a little better? To be honest, an ESFJ's thought process and insecurities can give me a headache. I love my friend, but when I hear her love problems, I can't really understand, despite being quite empathetic most of the time. She will freak out about things as small as not receiving a reply from her boyfriend for a few hours while he is at work, and will automatically think he must have met someone new. I usually calm her down and very firmly tell her: ""Either you trust him and stay with him, or you believe he's a horrible person and you dump him. It's not that hard."" For me, it's kind of a no-brainer. If you are so scared of him cheating, then he's either a serial cheater that you should dump, or you have to learn to trust he isn't. Instead of taking my advice of dumping him or changing her perspective, she usually starts putting him through tests, because she allegedly loves him and doesn't want to lose him. ""Let's see if he texts first,"" is her go-to test. To this day, I still have not failed in receiving an upset phone call even if he does text first, because he texted too late, or the text isn't apologizing, or sweet enough. Maybe by going on a trip, you didn't give him enough affirmation and love, and now he's in his scared-mode, testing the waters, trying to figure out if you still like him, and if you will apologize for not talking as much as you ""should have"".
As an INFP girl who dated an ESFJ guy:
I had a really hard time coping with trying to please the ESFJ. As an introvert, I was ok with ""together time"" being working on things or watching movies within the same room. I was ok with playing with our phones whipe eating together, because to me, we didn't need to chat about useless stuff. (Obviously not on a first date. I'm talking about once we got comfortable with each other) But for him, it was me losing interest and he couldn't understand that sending him encouraging notes randomly, booking a trip to Japan together, helping him in finding a new job, and other things were my ways of showing love. 
Another thing that struck me as really odd and trying -- I was going through a really tough time at home because of some family issues. He met my parents around that time, and apparently the fact that my parents didn't like him offended him. (I stuck up for him, I didn't let them bash on him) He didn't even talk to me or tell me that something was wrong when I asked. He just randomly decided one day to stop saying ""I love you"", and if I told him so, he'd say ""Okay."" I was already going through a lot, and I was still mustering up the energy and courage to stick up for him AND spend time with him. Turns out he wanted me to APOLOGIZE for the situation, because it made HIM feel awkward! All I needed was for HIM to give me some affirmation, but he was so insecure about my parents not liking him that he decided to ""punish me"" (his words, not mine). I asked him honestly then where he felt like our relationship was at, and he said ""Better than ever"" (not sarcastic). For him, he forgave me already, but needed me to apologize before he could tell me that he loves me.
We obviously didn't work out very well as a couple. But we are fine as friends now. 
If your guy is anything like the guy I dated, I don't think anything is particularly ""wrong"" persay. He might think you guys are better than ever, except he's waiting for you to apologize for leaving him alone while you were with family for 10 whole days.
If your guy is like my friend, then maybe he is just putting up his guards, and wants to be sure you like him. Which you can probably prove you do by apologizing for leaving him all by his lonesome for 10 days and not telling him how much you missed him every few seconds. "
233,esfj,"So... I can speak on this. I'm ESFJ, and I've encountered this many times before with my exes. I feel horrible because I realize now I've wasted their time. Tbh, I think the honeymoon phase is over, and he's more or less over it. He probably just wants to do him, and was trying to live up to what your expectations were-maybe his too. Now, he's probably exhausted because he put a lot of effort in, and he wants to call it quits. He did this because he thought he was doing it for you/to get you to like him. He probably thinks that he has to keep doing this stuff to make you like him. He's young, and trying to figure himself out. He also probably feels bad because you liked that version of him, but he knows he can't keep it up. He needs to learn to like himself. I guarantee this guy loathes himself.
I don't mean to be a jerk by divulging this information, but I know it'll help. You can test this if you want. Give him an ultimatum, he'll feel bad and give you effort. Then, it'll die out. You'll notice a trend too. It'll be 2 months perfect, then slowly dies off. You do another ultimatum, it'll be 1 month perfect and dies off. And eventually, it'll just be hell. It'll be a push and pull/pulling of teeth. Pure emotional rollercoaster you definitely don't want to be in. It's up to you though. We all make decisions; some of us have to learn from them the hard way."
234,esfj,"I don’t think I said anything to offend him. The only thing could be that I pulled back a bit lately - perhaps out of fear? But I still made it known that I wanted to see him. I do believe I stopped the x’s quite a bit, could that be it?
He is responding and still showing me he cares by messaging me, but his actions are no longer congruent with how they were before. My mom (yes I ask her for advice lol) said I should pull back more. But I just want to have an adult conversation and see how he’s doing."
235,esfj,"Yeah I mean personally that's how I'd go about it but my friends often say I'm too blunt so lmao. But I feel like as long as you don't phrase it in a way thats blaming him you should be fine. Like ""hey so I've been feeling lately that we're growing distant and was wondering if you felt the same?"" Alternatively you could say ""hey so I've been feeling lately that we're growing distant and while I'd hate to lose contact with you I just want to know if you're interested in staying in touch. If not that's fine but I don't want to waste either of our time"" if that's how you feel. From there if he says he is interested you could follow up asking how he views the friendship/ relationship going forward- he might say he's just interested in being friends or he could say he wants to see how things unfolds or something else. Or he could say he's not interested in keeping in touch and while that would suck at least you'd know now. It's all about making sure everyone is on the same page.
Personally I've had these types of conversations though with girls before (I'm a guy myself) and usually it's been met with pretty good feedback as people tend to open up and respond well when you're direct. Everyone is different though and so even though the guy you're interested in and I share the same personality type he might not react as well to being so direct. I'd say give it a shot though. Make sure you don't phrase it in a way where you're putting the fault on him and be prepared for him to say he's not interested in staying in touch. If he does say that while it'll be heartbreaking understand that you can't make someone stay in touch with you if they don't want to. So if he's made up his mind he doesn't want to keep talking, you can't really argue with him to change his mind
I also know you mentioned he prides himself on his honesty and so you just gotta hope that's true. So if he says he's interested in staying in touch with you then you just gotta hope he gets better and texting. Actions do speak louder than words though so if he's like ""yeah of course I want to stay in touch!!!"" But still is acting distant and stuff I'd give up personally and just message back if he messages you first. At that point it's not worth your time or energy.
Good luck though with everything and I hope it does work out for you!
Edit: so I reread your post and he could actually just be busy though. If he works or is in college or anything he could be busy visiting friends while back on break or the holidays themselves could just be super busy for him. Personally I'm with you where I too would be a bit weary about the shift of not finding some time to see you in person however people do have their own stuff going on so who knows. Alternatively to what I was saying earlier you could also just ask if he's still interested in going on another date or something. Sorry I had missed the part that you returned so yeah I'd probably try and stick to the asking what his thoughts are on the relationship then. If he's still messaging you and such it's probably a good sign and so yeah, just trying to get on the same page with people is usually a good thing in my experience. I wouldn't pull back anymore because that'll just send signals to him that you're not interested so in the case that he is just simply busy then from his perspective what will be changing is it'll seem like you're pulling away, When you phrase the question you could even start with saying ""hey so this might just be my own worries, but are you still interested in going on a second date (or dating whatever you want to say)? I feel like we've been growing distant and I just want to make sure you're still interested in seeing each other again"".
Sorry this comment is rambly i don't want to lead you astray lmao but yes TLDR I'd be direct with him and you know use language that's neutral. Don't say ""So i think you're pulling away"" because that'll make him defensive. I'd also advise against saying ""So you've always prided yourself on honesty"" because, again, kind of putting him on the defensive. Using ""I"" statements and such (I feel we're growing distant, is this how you feel?) is usually the best way to go when communicating or if you ever have an argument with the guy/ need to bring something up with him"
236,esfj,"Wow wolfpackalpha,
Thank you so much for putting in the time to write this thoughtful response! I really appreciate it! You bring up some very good points (he could be busy and thinks I'm pulling away, Using ""I"" phrasing, etc). I'm glad to hear that you've had good responses with being direct - I really think that's the best way to go. I am going to try this out. Like you said, I don't want to waste either of our times so it's best to get it sorted sooner rather than later, for better or for worse.
Thanks again!"
237,esfj,"My ESFJ (M) crush/good friend seems so charming to our other friends, bantering, playful pushing - but is extremely awkward/silent around me and often avoids eye contact. Does he know that I like him and wants to avoid me? How do I read the situation?"
238,esfj,"He senses you like him. Be yourself and be friendly but not overly friendly. Give him space/freedom, hopefully he will banter with you like others and then start building something on top of that.  Go flirt with another guy, he will notice immediately. Do this to break away for a bit and then start the bantering friendship. "
239,esfj,"That you Megan? 
Jk, she doesn't use Reddit. Anyway, I empathize with your crush. He probably feels pressured not to make a bad impression with you, so he's more cautious about the things he does and say to you. I recommend initiating banters with him and randomly chatting with him. If he realizes that you like him and he reciprocates, then he'll engage with you and (hopefully) occasionally initiate. Good luck :)"
240,esfj,"this is very true. be careful though because if he really does like you, then him seeing you flirt with other guys might make him feel bad and take it out on himself. but at least you’ll be able to gauge from his reaction if he really does likes you"
241,esfj,"Where would I find an esfj in the ""wild""? I'd really like to if not have a long conversation then at least follow around (in a not creepy way. Ok following some is creepy. Darn), for a day and see what they do and how they interact. If I met one I might just hug them (out of excitement), maybe (if that wasn't creepy. It is. Darn). From the description I would like them a lot as long as we never discuss certain subjects. "
242,esfj,"Just wanted to tell you ESFJs that I really like to be around you because you make me see things from a completely different perspective that I've wouldn't ever have thought of. Plus, I love the fact that we have the same function, but in reverse order and that you can help me develop my weak functions and vice-versa. At the beginning of high school, I was being bullied a lot because I was very nerdy, weird and ""awkward as fuck"" (typical INTP xD). It was very difficult, but I had this ESFJ friend. She was incredible and always there for me, her genuine kindness gave me a huge amount of motivation, and it was all I needed to believe in myself and begin having ambition in life (at that time, I hated school because I was bullied; now I want to obtain a PHD in theoretical physics). The fact that people like you ESFJs exist is amazing. Have a nice day :)"
243,esfj,"As a 27 male INTP who is about to marry an amazing ESFJ woman, I can't agree more. You ESFJ's are so kind. And even though we may seem super critical and negative about everything, we want you to know that you fill a part of our lives that no other personality can. Though our critical attitude makes us sound unhappy, we really do love you guys!"
244,esfj,"If there's something that we ESFJ's adore, it's when people make it known that our enduring kindness can have such a profound positive effect. I'm so glad that your friend was able to do so for you! 😊
All the best in your studies!"
245,esfj,"I can truely relate to what u said. 
Even the school thing. And getting such a emotional support from this ESFJ girl.
I wana ask u a different thing though as I find u too relatable.
I am kinda in a dilemma. And it's about choosing a major. The 2 majors that are fighting in my mind are Theoretical physics and Computer Science. And in terms of what I am good at, I am good at both.
Conputer Science will provide me more money(according to the trend right now). And allow me to work from home. Also try new things.
Theoretical physics is what I am very interested at. This path will provide me with things to think. According to what I think now, it will allow me to be stimulated.
I think u were also in a dilemma, maybe similar, what are the reasons and how did u decide?. 
Hope u ans it."
246,esfj,"I too used to want to study computer science. What made me choose theoretical physics is that I realised that if I go in physics, I'm also studying computer science, because physicists need to be good at programming for simulations, for example. However, if I choose computer science, I'm very likely not studying physics (or not as much as I would like) and that would be a shame for me. In physics, I'm not study computer science as much as if I were a computer science major, but I realised that understanding how the universe works is more important for me than to be a computer expert and doing programming applied to theoretical physics is enough to satisfy my computer curiosity. But that's just me, for you it might be different"
247,esfj,"Sorry I don't really know about this since I'm only 18 and not yet at university (I'm entering physics at university next year, now I'm studying natural science at college and I love it, especially physics and math), but what I know is that many people tend to have prejudices about being a physicist; they tend to think that physicists have a poor income. This is wrong, while physicists do not have close to the income of, say, a doctor or a lawyer, they have enough money to live decently. Hope it helps"
248,esfj,"We both go daily to the same coffee shop.  I once went talked to her for a minute then felt nervous and left cause she's attractive.  Now she still makes eye contact and mirrors me and I smile nervously of course the thing is if I go talk I'll either be uninterested in small talk or she may find me weird as infjs can seem to sensors. I would like to know her but I don't recall interacting with another esfj before so I'm clueless thus nervous, my perfectionist tendencies and e4w5 with a 1 fix don't help either.  Besides I'm her supervisor I don't want to use my Ni to directly block or offend her Si as i know that supervision relationships can cause frustration.  Any kind of input from esfjs is appreciated
Tldr: In a nutshell how can I as an infj guy talk to my esfj crush without embarrassing myself or her.  What topics do you like most?"
249,esfj,"Hello!!! :D I was happy reading your post. :D I am an ESFJ and I love INFJs!!! ^^ I'm attracted to them. There's really something in INFJs that draws me to them ^^ Almost all my bestfriends are INFJs and I have so many close friends that are INFJs :D My first love is also INFJ hehe ^^ I'm sure you'll get along fine!!! :D you can start with your common ground which is the extroverted feeling (Fe) cognitive function, her dominant function and your auxiliary. :) You are both concerned with people, feelings, and relationships so I think you can start with that. :) I can't speak for all ESFJs but I love talking about feelings and relationships on a more personal and intimate level. Probably talking about your loved ones and relationships with them. Also talking about the causes or advocacies you believe in or your beliefs in general will make me interested. I like conversations which are personal and intimate, the feeling of getting to know another person on a deeper level and the feeling that we can open up to each other. ^^ Trust and understanding can be built from there!!! :) Just be your authentic self, too!!! We would appreciate that!!! Hope this helps! :) Hope you can also update us on your progress! Thank you! :)"
250,esfj,"I'm exfj, but I'll answer. 
I'm super into people I have a soul connection to. That spark; that click. If you and I have that, then just be you because it was you and your charm that attracted me in the first place. 
And be kind. Mean and arrogant people are 👎."
251,esfj,"Hi, im ISTP
had an ongoing relationship with an INFJ for a year.
it was a cosntant struggle with her depression and various physical problems.
i have invested emotionally and materially in her health issues.
there was progress on this side, but it did not translate into our intimacy.
overall i have given on all sides, my concepts , philosophy, my money, my time, and my emotional energy.
i dont feel like i got much in turn, she wanted to give, but she wasnt giving me anything, she kept making efforts that went down the drain.. you can realize this is frustrating on both sides.
its like a father giving his son money with love, and the son wanting to give back to his father by investing it in a shit shaky business. what i care and cared for our intimacy and relationship, her well being.. and everythign she did .. although well intended ended up hurting herself and myself.
im spent . we had a talk about her nutrition last time, and it escalated and she hasnt contacted me in a month.
i feel like i should pull back. ask her sister to pack all my things and take her without seeing her"
252,esfj,"I am honestly not sure why you're posting this here, but here goes nothing.  If she hasn't contacted you in a month, I would say you are no longer together.  Try reaching out and asking if you can get your things back, and if she doesn't reply, then ask her sister for her help."
253,esfj,"Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.
I will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.

254,esfj,"I tend to love all genres across the board. However, what normally bothers me the most musically is yelling or screaming. I haven’t been able to appreciate edm yet either. I tend to find myself loving chill, relaxed, calmer music across all genres. I love songs that make me feel sentimental."
255,esfj,"You guys just cracked me up. I'm also an INTP. Researching types tonight and ended up here. I also wondered why so few posts, but then again... I have an ESFJ friend who hates being online. Anyway, nice seeing you all here."

257,esfj,"Hi everyone. ISTJ here. I met a guy on a dating app back in February. He claims to be ESTJ. But I never understood him and he always drove me crazy. Since we STJs should definitely understand each other, I keep questioning it. This morning I had a lightbulb moment where I was convinced he's ESFJ.
Here are a few observations about his personality:
He seems to be very last minute (spontaneous) even though I am a planner and I have asked him to give me more notice. He ignores my request and keeps initiating things at the last minute
He remembers so many lines from so many movies. He also speaks 4 languages.
He restores cars as a hobby and works in customer service as a job. Although he doesn't like his job.
He is very open about his emotions, past relationships, etc. Even from the very beginning.
He is a neat freak. The worst I've ever seen.
He seems overly concerned about wasting my time.
Even though we've messed around tons and I've told him I want sex, it hasn't happened yet. (WTF??!!!)
He keeps the relationship going. I've always just sat back and let him pursue me. And he does. Things fizzled out after about a month but then he came crawling back about a month later. (I'm not usually like this. In fact I'm usually the pursuer and obsessed over the guy I'm dating.)
He seems controlling, but denies it. In fact it appears more like disrespect. Examples: He insists I speak French while his English is perfect and my French isn't. He forced himself into my basement after I repeatedly refused to let him see it. He refused to let me see his apartment for the first 4 months of our relationship because he was bothered by our income disparity."
258,esfj,"I'm an ESTJ, but this doesn't sound like ESFJ at all. If anything, he sounds like an xSxP, probably ESFP. I kind of want to say ISTP because he restores cars and you know how the stereotypes go lol.
Also, ESTJs can be quite controlling but usually admit to it. I like to think of it as a strength, I make other people get shit done :P"
259,esfj,"To ensure that I don't accidentally offend anyone, I am using ""I"" statements this entire time. So this isn't about all Esfj, but me and anyone else who can relate.
I have trouble essentially being my own person. I have a tendency to focus on getting another person to like me, and molding myself into the ""right"" person. I have difficulty forming opinions and sticking to them. I also can have difficulty judging the merits of others.
The times I am the most independent is when, essentially, I am upset or feeling blue. At those points, I feel quite distant from the world around me, and I spend my time secretly judging others and deciding what's wrong with them.
Constantly second guessing myself and feeling stuck making decisions is, quite frankly, exhausting. It also doesn't help that I don't have very reliable people around me to aid in this process.
Is there anything in MBTI theory/our functions we should focus on to become a tad more self-reliant?"
260,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ and have the exact same issue - I rely on others so much for just everyday mundane actions, not just big decisions...
I'm 34 this year and still struggle with it, but in the past 6 months I really feel like I've become stronger. I bought a flat, in an area I was unfamiliar with, and have slowly (I mean really slowly - still going!) started to realise I can do stuff on my own, when I want, and that my own company is lovely and I'm not selfish for it.
As an example, the area I moved to, I don't know anyone but visited as a child. I had the desire to go to a certain wildlife park and see how it was 20yrs later, as an adult.
And for ages, I thought 'I will ask xyz if they want to come with me' and stuff like 'oh I'll suggest it as something to do when I see friend abc'...
And then the revelation hit me, like a ton of bricks. Why don't I just get the bus and go... On my own!?!
Honestly, sounds so stupid, but it genuinely blew my mind realising I could just take myself off, have a wander, do something that I wanted, and no one else needed to be involved.
I had that revelation about 3 months ago and I've really blossomed, I know I don't have to rely on having someone with me all the time...
But don't get me wrong, I'm an ESFJ through and through, so if I can have adventures with a friend I always would prefer that!
You'll get better at it, I promise x"
261,esfj,"You can reach your desired outcome of being independent through poor logic as well. Be careful how you get there. I know an ESFJ who reached a measure of independence from the hive so to speak by becoming jaded after being hurt and by assuming everything they did deserved reciprocity and that their self worth and level of love from others was correlated to how much others celebrated this friend of mine. 
To get to the heart, you must first go through the head. You cannot feel for the things you don’t know. Spend sometime fleshing out a worldview involving an ethic to have something internal to compare to the external. This will help with judging the merit of others. It’s not perfect, but it helps.  "
262,esfj,"Yeah I think you can learn it. I’m one also and I understand everything your saying. Exactly me also. 
Interesting you said you can’t keep your own opinions. I’m kinda the opposite where I have strong ones and are very black and white about people if they don’t think the same thing as me. 
I absolutely mold myself though to be the right person, mirroring them in anyway I can. 
I get told all the time I can’t tell when someone is bad news. I think that has to do with my extreme love of people and wanting acceptance. 
What age are you? I’m interested. 
I’m 23 and have grown a little out of certain things. I’m finally getting closer to the I don’t give a fuck attitude and that helps a lot. 
As an ESFJ the best thing you can do is surround yourself with people who really like you since we take so much self worth from others. And surround yourself with people who will tell you that and not leave you guessing. No closure is our WORST enemy!
After sleeping around, luckily I don’t think I’m ugly so I get a self esteem boost from all the people on the apps telling me I’m handsome. Do I think I am? Eh, I don’t know. I never know what I look like to people and what they think of me. We’re really bad at that and always assume the worst. And when people say the best you think they’re lying. Actions speak loudest for us. 
The 2nd guessing will go away with self esteem boost you get from the right people. 
Oh learn how to fake it till you make it. ESFJs best friend. "
263,esfj,"I struggle with this too! I am usually placid and agreeable because I want people to like me, and I tend to absorb other people’s energies very easily. This is nice in the short run because it’s sociable and you might have lots of friends, but after awhile you may feel depleted and lack an inner sense of independence. 
Developing my own voice has been important for creating healthy boundaries between myself and other people. Instead of mindlessly agreeing to everything, I now take careful stock of what is being said before I respond. I might listen to a friend’s opinion, and ask myself: “do I really agree with what is being said? Or am I just inclined to agree because I want approval? If I don’t agree, why don’t I agree?” This mental exercise has been helpful in developing my inner voice, because other people’s opinions are first put through an internal filter before I decide whether to accept or challenge them. "
264,esfj,"Look up to ENTJs and model your life after them. You can't be them, but you can at least see what they do and how they do. Apply what you learn from them. Just don't fall into the trap of mistaking your Fe for Te."
265,esfj,"Well, to be honest, you just have to let that weakness inside you fade. It's like a crack addict itching for crack. The more you let those feelings go, the weaker they become. Nothing's overnight and the feeling may be strong, but if you want it, nothing's unattainable. You just have to be able to see farther than your eyes can, or just jump and hope you land the way you like.
Think about it."
266,esfj,"This is a really great response. I’ve noticed I don’t naturally have very strong values of my own, other than wanting to preserve social harmony and not offend people - mostly because I crave acceptance. I don’t have anything that is truly central and immutable to my core self. Could you elaborate more on how to flesh out a worldview involving an ethic? I would really like to work on this more myself. "
267,esfj,"I second this. I married an ENTJ and he has had a remarkable influence on me. I’ve learned to carve out time for myself, regardless of what others might be doing, and really understand what I want, which has always been tied to what someone else wanted me to be (at least what I thought they needed me to be.) I watch what my husband does with envy and then realize... it’s all a choice. I can make those same choices, and no one seems to hate me for it. "
268,esfj,"INTP here. What is a worldview? The world is full of people and sunlight, mundane day to day, galaxies swarming, desert wind blowing, a robbery, a birthday party, a marriage, a rape, someone brushing their teeth, cosmic background radiation, kings queens, history, books... it’s all just data. Is there a point? Science takes data and pulls a conclusion from it. A worldview is like science in this sense. Are there patterns and evidences we can recognize in world to make sense of it. I think what we believe about God largely colors our worldview. No God? Well atheism is the belief there is no god, it’s not a worldview, but it informs it. There is a God? Well now we’re theists. It colors what we believe but it’s not a worldview. What you believe determines your worldview. God is the first main fork in determining yours. Now, let’s say we settle on a worldview. Let me correct myself, you can be a theist, or atheist, and leave it at that, it IS a worldview but a very vague and very weak one. 
Thinking this far may seem wasteful or useless, breaking into the realm of abstraction that increases yawn frequency and tiredness of eyes. Here is something I think is key to remember, if you don’t have a solid worldview, and your ethics are subject to the social harmony around you, then you are subjecting yourself to the developed worldview of others, and MAY be bending yourself in a direction you wouldn’t objectively choose.  
Here’s a fun example. My wife is an ESFJ. My friend is an ESFJ. My mom is an ESFJ. My fundamental question is, is this true, is there a rational basis for what we’re doing? Christmas time, every year, the argument of Santa Claus arrives. I think Santa sets a false precedent for what is good. A mortal, fallen, man who tracks and judges the moral behavior of all children, determining wether they get gifts based on their yearly behavior, this is not grace. This is not Christian. It’s blatant mythology, it’s harmful and detracts from the better, beautiful, and sweeter reason for Christmas. All of my ESFJs are flabbergasted at this. Why? Because they enjoyed the charade as children, as did I, therefore it is good to uphold the tradition. “They’re only little once, don’t ruin their childhood.” “Don’t take away Santa!l “That’s just evil man!” “Soda_blood, if you tell him there is no Santa we’re done.” Now I’m no Scrooge. I love a Christmas, and I’m DEFINITELY not going around whispering “there is no santa” to children at the playground so I can watch them melt as if a priest had suddenly realized there was no God. My worldview determines my actions where my ESFJs in my life are concerned with forwarding traditions that feel good regardless of their rational conclusion about what is moral. (I’m not saying ESFJs are wholly irrational or unintelligent. All of my ESFJs are, I think, smarter than me.)They are all AT LEAST sympathetic to feel good prosperity  preachers like Joel Osteen, defending his message based on his dispensation of positivity, not wether his claims are based on a contextual interpretation of scripture. I suppose you could argue their decisions are based on their OWN worldview, and we all have one - however flawed. What I mean though is that their decisions are based on their personal emotions.
So worldview, to build one with an ethic, it will require work. I’m anything but an expert here, but I would suggest finding a philosophy 101 course on iTunes U, and follow up with some God reading, whichever side of the fence you fall on there. I’m personally a Christian so I know that path do a degree.  Find a theology or philosophy and invest in it to the degree you can determine your ethic within a framework. I would personally advocate reformed theology as a worldview basis but that’s just me ;)"
269,esfj,"Thank you so much for this thoughtful response. I think I am going to invest in my own philosophical readings. I have been exposed to Christianity from my cousins, know about stoicism and Buddhism from my friend, and could easily describe Epicureanism. But I’ve only ever understood these philosophies and beliefs from other people’s worldviews. I don’t have strong feelings about any of them in particular, and I suppose I have to dig deep and figure out my own set of beliefs. 
Your Santa Clause example struck me - like your wife, I value family traditions and Christmas is such a sentimental occasion for me, that I would want to preserve it as a happy and warm occasion - Santa Clause is a part of that. For me, my relationships and how my loved ones feel are the most important. It’s only recently, after feeling disappointed and let down by others around me, that I’ve started to question whether this is the wisest view to have. "
270,esfj,"ESFJ (ego) Fe - Si - Ne - Ti | (shadow) Fi - Se - Ni - Te
Te in the ESFJ is the ""Demon"" function. You could say it's the least preferred of all eight functions, nearly the weakest in terms of potency, and is directly avoided (for good reason). The Demon function of any type is like ""sin nature"" or the ""human condition"", almost like a source of evil. Usually managed or ignored, but if forced to use a demon function, it can be real nasty. It's also the gateway into the super ego (which is a bad thing in this context, I know some definitions of super ego make it a good thing. different definitions).
In ESFJ, the Te demon would be like an inability/disinterest in what other people think, or what the group thinks/believes. ESFJs are so focused on what other people feel (Hero Fe) and what others feel to be good/bad, and are so insecure about what they think is true (inferior Ti), that they basically don't give a crap about what other people think. They are too distracted by the Fe <-Under extreme stress, and I mean extreme (chronic abuse or conflict, inability to use the ego, unconscious, or subconscious to resolve issues) then the Te demon may become the gateway into the super ego (in this case, ENTJ | Te - Ni - Se - Fi). This is like letting the demon out of the cage, and the super ego collapses in on the ego, overwhelming it. The super ego just wants to watch the world burn, destroy everything and everyone, and start over from ground zero. An ESFJ in super ego aka demon mode would be very legalistic, hyper focused on calling people out for errors and falsehoods, presenting facts and evidence and history to supports themselves (though not necessarily doing so correctly/effectively). Ni makes them all about what they want, disregarding what others want or what will happen to others (demon super ego doesn't care!). Se is all about the moment, and Fi would be insecure about how it feels and what it feels is right/wrong. You effectively will have flipped the ESFJ on their head, from normally being very caring to others, very concerned with what others want, very past and duty focused, and unsure of what they think is true, to instead being a dick that's going to tell you what's right, only care about what they want, only care about the moment, and only care about what they feel is right or wrong.  
A bit rambly, but there's my attempt at explaining it. Sorry for the late comment.  
In response to your other comment asking why ESFJ is very conscientious;
-Si Parent is very responsible and dutiful, focused on the past, tradition, and what should be done.
-Ne child cares all about what other people want, and what will happen to others, while Fe Hero loves to please.
-Ni trickster means they are unaware of what they want for themselves (to focused on what others want, and on what they should do to think about what they want to do).
---All of this together makes them focused on getting things done for reasons beyond their self, which makes them conscientious. But only if they are given external motivation.  
Hope I helped. Cheers."

Thoughts / comments?"
272,esfj,"Yeah, totally legit. If you really want to get into it, Reckful wrote an extensive post a while ago on Personality Cafe, debunking all the common criticisms against MBTI. He’s a long-time poster who’s more into the dichotomies than the functions, but whatevs. Don’t ask me what that means, cos I dont know, lol.
https://www.personalitycafe.com/myers-briggs-forum/283457-another-mbti-debunking.html#/topics/283457?page=1"
273,esfj,"MBTI is pretty innacurate and shallow. Fun, and can give you a general idea (assuming it got it right, which it often doesn't), but if you really want to understand yourself and others, you need to dive into Cognitive Functions. But first, here's this;
http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/
In summary, MBTI tests are looking for an ""A or B"" answer to each of the four letters. But each of those questions is loaded, and also extremely subjective. And it does nothing to address the cognitive functions, which are also well explained on the above website.
Furthermore, there are actually four sides to the mind you could say: The Ego (Conscious), The Shadow (Unconscious), The Subconscious, and The Super Ego. Depending on your maturity level, as well as your behavior under stress and your confidence, people often test on MBTI aspects of their subconscious or unconscious, further confounding the results. All of the above is why people can often take the MBTI tests and wind up with different results over time, or even taken back to back.  
In short, you have four functions of which can be introverted or extroverted, making eight total. Everyone has all eight cognitive functions, but four are in your ego/conscious, while four are in your shadow/unconscious. The order of your MBTI letters can completely screw with your cognitive function stack, and the stack is what you actually care about.
For example, if you can't decide between ESFJ and ESFP, you might think ""what's the difference between J/P? It's not much"" but that is incorrect.
ESFJ:  (ego) Fe - Si - Ne - Ti / (shadow) Fi - Se - Ni - Te
ESFP: (ego) Se - Fi - Te - Ni / (shadow) Si - Fe - Ti - Ne
The order of the functions determines strength, preference, and how the function manifests in it's ""role"" in your psyche. So not only do these two personality types operate on different functions entirely, they also operate with different strengths and such. These two personalities, seemingly similar on MBTI, are miles apart in the real world.  
I could go on and on and on (I love this stuff), but I'll stop there for now. I can elaborate if you want, I'm happy to talk more about it or answer questions.
If you'd be interested to learn more on your own, my favorite youtuber is C.S. Joseph, he does a fantastic job, including explaining the problems with MBTI, what the functions mean, what each type looks like, their interactions, and so on.
The version of personality typing I'm referring to here is called Jungian Analytical Psychology, or Cognitive Typing (these are similar and parallel, just slightly separate). Many of these schools of thought originated from the works of Carl Jung, including MBTI, but MBTI is sadly very limited in its approach.  
Cheers."
274,esfj,"No, your base personality does not change, even if your results change. For example, a stressed INFJ may resemble an INTJ or an ISTP, and may end up getting ISTP on a personality test, but that doesn’t mean he’s an ISTP -just a stressed INFJ."
275,esfj,"The misunderstanding here is to think that MBTI reflects nature, but it's more like it reflects your current state, which is easily confounded. You have to consider the cognitive functions, and the four sides of the mind.
If for example, you are ESFJ, your 'mind' actually looks like this
Conscious ESFJ | Subconscious INTP
Unconscious ISFP | Super Ego ENTJ
and each side of the mind has four cognitive functions (e.g. ESFJ | Fe - Si - Ne - Ti) but while that is extremely significant, it isn't necessary for my point here so I'll leave it at that.  
When you mature, you integrate the functions of the Unconscious into your Conscious. When you are insecure or aspirational, you use the functions of the Subconscious. The Super Ego is more rarely relevant, so never mind that for now.
When you test MBTI, your current mood, stress level, and maturity levels all impact which functions you are currently utilizing, from different sides of the mind, and in different roles/strengths/preference levels. All of this combined can cause you to test entirely differently from day to day, despite you remaining the same type all along.  
This is further confounded by the fact that MBTI uses loaded questions and misleading dichotomies, leading to bias/subjectivity and frequent mistakes.
http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/ 
After you mature past early childhood, your personality is essentially set in stone. How it manifests however, can change and improve (or degrade). An INTP for example, normally considered antisocial/shy/robotic, can eventually mature and aspire into building their ESFJ subconscious, thereby becoming an apparent social butterfly when they choose to. However, using the alternate sides of the mind will be fatiguing, so eventually the pseudo-ESFJ will return to their INTP conscious to ""recharge"" and be relaxed as themselves again.  "
276,esfj,"This is how I saw it. Though not as detailed as how you put it. But I always said that your personality type is you at your most comfortable. And NOT the only thing you are.  
What I tell people is: We are basically all 16 personality types. The difference is that each of us prefer 1 over the rest most of the time.   
Now I know that's a rough way of saying it, but I think the point is the same. Which is to say: If I told you to act as each of the 16 personality types for 1 day. You can do them all, But 1 type would be easier than the rest and would come naturally to you. because in you're most comfortable state that's what you're like. So at a point you wont even be acting"
277,esfj,"Yeah I get ya. You could say it like that (""we are basically all 16 personality types""), but I would disagree slightly. I think it'd be more accurate to say that all 16 types are composed of the same 8 cognitive functions, and we basically all have the same 8 functions individually. The big difference between people, based on their personal type, is which functions they value/prefer, and how that manifests. So an ESFJ with Ti inferior could be just as logical as an INTP with Ti hero (it's a stretch but not impossible), the problem is they don't value Ti nearly as much. So Ti won't get the same attention, the same weight of importance placed on it, it won't be their primary mode of thinking like it would INTP, etc. So basically, everyone can do the same stuff, and everyone can grow every trait, but realistically people will still turn out very different. These differences are so innate in our value systems that people of different types won't be able to act like the other types, it'd be more like mimicry while the underlying priorities remain. For example, I as an INTP can act like an ESFJ through mimicry, but I'll be using my INTP functions under the surface. I hope that makes sense.
In part I think this comes down to the assumption most people have that ""everyone basically wants the same things out of life"", which simply isn't true. When you look at other people through your ""mbti lens"", you'll naturally try to explain their actions from the standpoint of ""what would I do/want"". A simple example, extroverts commonly look at introverts and think ""why are they so shy? they must be lonely or insecure"" when the reality is that the introvert is operating on an entirely different value system, so it's like trying to measure someone's weight in inches. With the 16 types, the layout of your 8 functions essentially defines the metric that you use to measure yourself and the world around you. So sure, you can convert grams to ounces to pounds to stones, but you'll only be pretending and secretly doing the math in your head to try and understand the alternative points of view."
278,esfj,"I'm writing a story in which I have an esfj character who has been raised his whole life taught that he, and by extension his family, and by further extension his entire social caste of breeding, is inherently superior to those who aren't in the same caste and to look down upon them with disgust and scorn. His Fe is very concentrated on what his society, what his caste expects of him, and what privileges he is afforded from being in the higher caste. He does have issues with taking a man's life, not because he values the man's life or likes him, but because he is terrified (the man is a very powerful man), and because killing the most powerful man you know is a scary task for a 16 year old. Also, the pressure from the expectations of his social caste to kill this man really gets to him, but he's not likely to up and switch sides to the ""good"" side, because he does still believe he is better than those of lower castes. His Si manifests in a disinterest on changing anything, after all, why should anything change, this is the way its always been, and he gains many perks from the way things are now. The only change he supports is to go back to ye olden ways, where those with his views had much more power. 
So what are some ways I could take his motivations and use them to convince him that it is in his best interest to leave his current side? I don't expect to change all of his views, merely decide that the best place for himself to be is not where he currently is.
I'm having difficulty getting inside his head, since as an ENFP fe isn't even in my main stack and Si is at the bottom of main main stack.
And before anyone accuses me of ripping off harry potter, the thing I'm writing is a harry potter fanfiction, and I'm trying to come up with a realistic in character reason for draco malfoy to start thinking being a death eater maybe isn't the best decision.

Thank you!"
279,esfj,"I've been designing a self-care app for FJ types, and I've just finished a prototype. I'm looking for folks that could user test for me today. Participating is very easy, and I would greatly appreciate your input.
Reply to this thread or message me if you're interested in checking out what I've been working on!"
280,esfj,"Yes.  But they only came out with my kids.  :-(  I was never angry with my parents or siblings or friends or students.  Just my kids.  I realized I had this giant host of expectations for them that I didn't anyone else.  It pains me, and I work on it seriously."
281,esfj,"So I'm an E/I-STJ (I've typed as both) and in an on and off relation ship with an ESFJ girl. I know ESFJ's are know for being one of the most helpful personality types, but do they hate being helped themselves?
Let me explain: When we first started our relationship, she was the one always doing things for me. She would make me food almost everyday, frequent sex, good morning texts and everything in between. I wanted to start reciprocating more, but at the same time figured what I was doing was clearly working and I should just keep this up. Maybe she likes the ""hard to get"" type. We weren't official at the time but it started to feel like it. Fast forward a few months and I started to feel guilty like I was using her so I wanted to tell her what a wonderful woman she was and how happy I was to have her in my life.  Us  XSTJ's aren't exactly know for our warm fuzzy feelings so to say the least, it took a huge effort. I started buying her food as well, started to tell her things I admired about her, and just generally opening up to her. I was doing this for about a month and a half. One day I noticed she was really upset about car trouble she was having, her new job, and her kid. She started taking her anger out on me over a trivial argument and I got a bit mad myself. Eventually my good side within me won and I told her it's ok for her to feel stressed under all of that load. I brought her to my place, let her sleep while I took care of her kid, gave her a massage, bought her food, and took her to work after. It was then the weekend and she said she was a bit tired, and would be busy doing family stuff. Come Monday, I try to give her a kiss and she pulled away. And I was like ""what's going on?"" and she said she thought she wasn't ready to be in a relationship now. Which came as a shock considering I've recently started being nicer to her. I did a little experiment and decided to not give a shit, banter with her, and only worry about my needs. Lo and behold, she starts flirting back, we kiss, and get back together. Then as soon as I started trying to reciprocate all the stuff she gives, she pulls away again. So after that, I started being less available and being emotionally cold again, she posts all these sad facebook posts and now recently saw her and she is touching, flirting with me again. 
So what's the deal here? I would like to know if some ESFJs (notice I said some, not all) suffer from an insecurity and feel the need to be the more helpful one so they can feel ""in control"" so their partner will never leave? Does it feel uncomfortable when their partner feels the need to match their level of helpfulness at least some of the time? I don't seek to criticize or judge, only to understand. Any insight is much appreciated. "
282,esfj,"ESFJ here. I love serving, but get uncomfortable when people serve me. It takes real effort to allow people to do things for me. 
The way I get around this faulty wiring is to realize that when I don’t graciously allow others to do things for me, I’m denying them the same joy I get from helping others. That usually leads to an upward spiral of two people being great to each other and a really solid relationship. 
Edit: notice my unintentional use of words “allow people to do things for me”, as if I’m still in control, lol"
283,esfj,"Boyfriend is ESFJ and he doesn't like accepting  help, but he does like positive affirmation and being called sweet names. When reading your post I kind of feel like she's on the extreme end of the spectrum."
284,esfj,"I am an ESFJ, I am in a relationship with an INTP. I try to be as affectionate as possible and he tries to do the same. A lot of times I think that their happiness is more important than my own and will try extra hard to make them feel appreciated. I sometimes feel like making them bring me happiness is a burden to them and try not to let them. (After all INTPs are not know for supporting emotions) 
So maybe your situation is similar where she thinks that your happiness should be placed above all, and she feels guilty when she feels like a burden. Truthfully you should just talk it out with her. "
285,esfj,"I really like this. Maybe I can explain this to her that they joy she can provide for me isn't always in me receiving but in allowing me to give to her. Hopefully this goes smooth, thanks."

291,esfj,"I've dated an ESFJ and the problem with sharing my feelings was that he'd always give me a bs emotional response like ""don't worry"" or even offer practical solutions. Most times all I wanted was for him to analyze me/my problem and I already had my own opinion/solution in mind but was just curious to see if he thought the same. Also, don't say what you think we want to hear. ENTP's can catch on to ingenuine comments quickly and that makes us less inclined to share. "
292,esfj,"could you elaborate a bit on what it is you are struggling with.
as an entp ive dated an esfj before (didnt go so well)
if you want them to open up more be brutally honest.
its hard for us to share anything so when we do and you answer with some bullshit answer like everything is gonna be fine we dont really see a point in sharing it.
we are focussed on solving problems so if we come to you we wanna hear potential solutions."
293,esfj,"It'd be nice to hear how things turned out.
Maybe he just needs some space to think, xNTx are generally low maintenance. Since he is an extrovert you should be the first to know when he wants some company, which shouldn't be long."
294,esfj,"I could totally see all of that. I never say things like “don’t worry” or “it’ll all work out” he actually says that. Lol I’m coming up with plan A,B, C etc. practical solutions and goals. Or how I can help. I also can catch in-genuine comments as I read people extremely well, so I can’t stand that either. "
295,esfj,"Opening up. Even when I am brutally honest about it, it’s a closed door sometimes.
I am also all about resolution and solutions.  I am the one usually coming up with the things I can work on and he can work on to make it better. He is more get angry and get the silent treatment for days. “Fuck it” Sometimes  I do feel we both will come up with rational changes we can make and it’s receptive, sometimes the behavior doesn’t change. (IE- knows I am a words of affirmation person and I don’t get many if any) don’t want to have to drag them out of him so I say nothing. If he wanted to say those things he would.  I don’t want to continue to have the same conversations and be repetitive. I truly believe if you say it, feel it, your actions will show it. If you know what ( insert meaningful thing) means to someone you work on it, do it, say it, show it, make x goal and knock it out. 
Edit: in other relationships we have discussed where we were going and made plans to execute that. I knew how they felt and it was voiced. I know he loves me very very much, I do not doubt that for one second. I hope he sees a future together and I know he has said it has crossed his mind but isnt very vocal about that. I like where we are and where we are going. It’s just nice to hear romantic things or envision a future together.  "
296,esfj,"I think he just needed some space. Too many projects at once going on =overwhelming, but productive. He works well under the stress for the most part. I just try to give him space and go do things with my friends or run errands. You’re right when he wants company he reaches out or we make a plan. :) "
297,esfj,"Please help, this is super important to me :(
I have an ESFJ in my life, someone I care for deeply but as an ISTP my mode of operation is analysis and facts based.
If something is wrong, I want you to tell me with proof so that I can grow. My ESFJ is all about feeling and group think, she disregards proof, facts, analysis and even what is right in-front of her in favor of her feelings.I take huge issue with this because feelings are subjective, your feelings can be wrong and when presented with documented proof, how can you disregard that in favor of ""It feels wrong"" and then justify it with ""These guys also say it feels wrong so I'm right."". It baffles me. I understand that criticism and growing is very difficult for an ESFJ and it's even more difficult when challenging peoples beliefs and making them grow is my fucking love language :P
I have a friend whom I dearly love and he challenges my beliefs ALL THE TIME and I LOVE him for it. I feel like I grow every time we speak. But I really don't know how to communicate with my ESFJ who I can see is hurting herself and making her life much more difficult than it should be and it's seriously affecting her, but when I try to tell her she's gets furious and extremely hurt. I don't get it. Why wouldn't you want to improve your life based on documented truths in favor of subject emotional delusions...
You're clearly upset, why hold so tightly to what is clearly upsetting you... even when presented with facts."
298,esfj,"I understand that challenging a person's beliefs may be an ISTP's love language, but this may come across to feelers as purposely hurting them and challenging the whole person. I know it must not be taken personally, but feelers really tend to see it that way because we see our values and beliefs as part of who we are, so it may come across in a different way for the person. Rejecting our values, principles, beliefs, may be rejecting us as people, too. I have an ENFP friend in a relationship with an ISTP and this is almost always the root of their misunderstandings. Maybe you can just explain it in a nice way? You need to meet halfway. Perhaps you can explain your side in a way that will not hurt her feelings, and she needs to listen to what you have to say, too, with an open and understanding heart."
299,esfj,"I really feel like I have. She thinks I'm not devoted and that I don't care but I'm honestly unable to do my job effectively because I'm spending all of my time and energy on making her feel better. And she keeps talking as if I'm gone, as if i've already left. It's extremely hurtful to be completely disregarded like that. She's clearly pushing me away with her words and actions yet a part of me thinks she's just so insecure that she's trying to get a stronger and stronger reaction out of me by being more and more of a dick. She demands love and attention whilst also being a jerk. I'm out of steam to be honest. I can't take care of myself anymore.
The other explanation is that she truly wants me out of her life and she's too worried about conflict that she can't fucking say it. So she's trying to go the 'easy' route. I just can't understand it though.
As an ESFJ would you avoid breaking up with someone because of your natural aversion to conflict? why?
And if you didn't feel loved, would you push the other person to their breaking point in order to get some sort of reaction out of them? If so, what's the end goal? I'm trying my damn hardest to not rationalize with my Ti and understand with my Fe. It's absurdly difficult."
300,esfj,"I am sorry to hear that you are having a hard time. :( You may be dealing with an unhealthy ESFJ... I, myself, admit that I have low self esteem and low confidence, so I have a lot of insecurities as well, but I'm doing my best to work on these things so as not to be a burden and so as not to hurt the people that I love. Perhaps she needs to work with herself first and come to terms with herself first. It's difficult to pass on one's emotional baggage to your partner... :( 
As for me, I would avoid breaking up even though I'm already hurting, because I don't want to hurt the other person's feelings. I would make sure I did my very very best and tried all things possible before breaking up. It should be an extremely hopeless case for me to break up with someone. I think I also am the person who tends to wait for the other person to break up with me even if our relationship is already going downhill, as I can't handle being the one to intitiate the break up... For me, breaking up means hurting the other person and giving up on the person... As long as the person still wants to be with me, I will do my best to make it work... But if the person no longer wants to be with me, that's the time I will let go of the relationship, so I prefer my partner being the one to break up...
If I didn't feel loved, I'd communicate with the person and talk with the person. I learned that honesty, openness, and communication are really keys for relationships to work out. I'd be honest and I want my partner to be completely honest, even if it means hurting my feelings. It's better that way in order to address and resolve the issues. I don't know with other ESFJs but I am upfront and I want my partner to be upfront and honest as well. I dislike passive aggressive behavior. Those who have passive aggressive behavior may reason out that they just don't want to hurt others' feelings by not being upfront, but this behavior really hurts me so much more."
301,esfj,It's the exact opposite for me.. having my perspective on the world changed when backed up by logic and reason is exciting and gives me a sense of adventure. Like I get super excited about the new possibilities that arise due to the new way of thinking..
302,esfj,"Hmm. I guess all types when unhealthy are honestly cancerous.
I think subjectively I may dislike the unhealthy ESFJ more than any other type, perhaps because I'm an NTP (functions in reversed order = perhaps most easily offended by unhealthy functions in the opposite), but I also love healthy ESFJs over everything else - assuming there is such a thing and I'm not just blinded by my own needs and desires. I don't know.
Point is you can be awesome and you can be cancerous imo. Same probably goes with all types of people, eh."
303,esfj,"Okay so, I'm here because I don't know what to do.
I am an ENTJ (f/16) and recently got close with an ESFP. We are a funny and stupid duo and nothing can stop us.
Now, today we went to a theatre and we went by bus. So...my ESFP friend and I said that we were going to sit together. 
Apparently my ESFJ friend (that is childhood friends with my ESFP friend) realised that and she got REALLY mad.
She shouted at my ESFP friend how she could abandon her like this and said that I am trying to interfere with their friendship.
I - being an ENTJ - of course couldn't keep my mouth shut and told her that there is no need to make such a scene for SITTING BESIDE EACH OTHER (like god damn). Well....that didn't make it better.
Okay my question now....was she jealous? 
But why? I am just friends with my ESFP 
friend it's not like we're going to get married or something. 
I'm really not interested in this type if unnecessary drama (and my ESFP friend neither).
I'm just really confused pls explain what happened there."
304,esfj,"For me when I am jealous I either bottle it all inside as to not hurt the people around me, or I try to confront the source and tell them my feelings (this only happens if I am very close friends with the source). I would say try to include them and broaden the friend circle, ask them to sit with you guys. I think based on the story she was jealous, she was probably thinking why would my lifelong friend betray me, is he leaving me for a better friend, could I not provide what he needed, etc. Possibly the ESFP should talk to her and validate that their friendship is still meaningful and will always be. I actually had a similar scenario a while ago, my boyfriend got a new female friend and I was worried that it might turn to more than a friendship. I asked my boyfriend about the scenario and said how I felt, he validated that he does not have that kind of feelings towards her and I felt instantly better and became closer friends with the girl becuase if it. Sorry for the monologue."
305,esfj,"Jealous occurs when someone is insecure about themselves and compares themselves with another. Can happen with any type. Seems to just surface more often with Fe doms (at least in my life). I ignore them or I encourage them. But ultimately the other person needs to deal with their jealousy. No one can help that. In your case, it sounds like your friend has felt replaced in the past and was responding from that hurt place in your situation. Has nothing to do with you."
306,esfj,"u/ink_my_umbrella you didn't even read the post correctly and now you're trying to overpower a 16 year old ENTJ. You're very insecure. You need to put yourself in check. You're already starting drama by giving so much attitude and playing the blame game.
u/mirashp If you still want to be friends with the ESFJ, you're going have to level with her, and she's going have to understand. If she doesn't, that's her fault, and you should move on. Whatever she does, she does. You tried putting your best foot forward and whatever happens next is on her."
307,esfj,"I actually agree with what you wrote!
Not gonna go into details but I realized I'm not an ESFJ, I'm an ISFJ. Coming to the conclusion I'm a Si-dom with Fi critical parent and my Fe is shit. It's something I need to work on lol. Compared to you guys, I've realized I'm nowhere near as emotionally intelligent. 
I got annoyed by how many XNTXs come here smugly so I felt the need to immaturely troll a bit. (My point still stands though. ENTJs are more likely to cause drama than ESFJs tbh). "
308,esfj,"Umm... ISFJs are more emotionally mature than ESFJs believe it or not. It's because they actually shut their mouth and observe. Whereas ESFJs (with Dominant Fe) will speak without thinking.
At the end of the day, choose whatever you like and be whoever you want to be. The last thing you should be doing is stepping on people's toes and actually reading what people write before you begin typing. ISFJs also do that a lot (you know, the gathering data and thinking before speaking thing)."
309,esfj,"I would agree that ISFJs can be more patient and methodical than ESFJs but I'm not sure about emotional maturity. Particularly if the ISFJ isn't really well adjusted to society and spends most of their days by themselves rather than learning to properly interact with people. That means that Fe doesn't get properly developed. 
Either way, there were people dead-certain I was an ISFJ and introverted, so I consider those data points in my understanding of myself. 
Edit: Also Si is about gathering impressions of the concrete world around us and comparing that impression to an impression of a past experience. 
I also find it funny how you chided me for trying to supposedly ""overpower"" the OP and yet your tone here is rather scolding and kinda doing the same thing. Lol. "
310,esfj,"I'm very confident you're an ESFJ. You're a very ""triggering"" person.
Also, I'm not picking on you, but I am picking you apart by determining who you are based on how you type/speak. I honestly see no similarities between you and an ISFJ.
But like I said be who you want to be."
311,esfj,"That's passive aggressive BS and you know it. You were the one who started tone policing me in the first place.
Either way, it's difficult for me to judge the typing ability of an ESFJ over an INFJ and ENFP who say otherwise. 
Edit:
22 hours ago:
LOL. You can't even type yourself. ""I can tell by the way you type"" da fuq. You should've been able to understand yourself, then. Good riddance. "
312,esfj,"I recently took the test and was curious what all this means? I think I have a basic understanding of what it means to be an ESFJ, but I was hoping that some of you could help me have a better understanding of this and all the other stuff cognitive profile stuff.
Sorry if this doesn't make much sense and Thank you in advance for all the help!"
313,esfj,"I'm an INTJ, but I'll help out nonetheless, since the ESFJ sub isn't nearly as active as some of the other ones. If you want to talk about MBTI, r/intj , r/intp , r/mbti , r/entp, , r/infj , r/entj , and r/infp are probably the ones that are most frequented, and the people talk no matter what your type is.
Well, the MBTI is basically a psychological outline that explains how you perceive information. 
The cognitive functions are the functions that you use to perceive, and you have four of them: two introverted, and two extraverted. Your first function, Extraverted feeling (Fe) is your dominant function. Fe is considerate and group based, as it is extraverted, and usually means that your moral system is most likely traditional and based off of societal standards. 
You next function is introverted sensing (auxiliary function), or Si. Si reviews facts and data from past experience and compares it to the current one to see similarities or differences, and that produces a clear and accurate idea or goal. 
Then is extraverted intuition, or Ne (tertiary function). This can best be described as a ""brainstorm function,"" which kind of bounces ideas around about anything and everything to look for interconnections and the like.
Last is your inferior function, introverted thinking, or Ti. Ti cares about logical consistency internally, and it analyzes things within certain principles. So, inside of your head, it'd be something like: ""hm, what are all of the parts that makes this up, and what happens if they get moved around, blah, blah, blah.""
Put all of those together and that is basically what it means to be an ESFJ. MBTI isn't like a horoscope or anything, but it's an outline, and there are certain generalizations and stereotypes about each type that you could or could not agree with.
I would really suggest looking at this video by Michael Pierce. He has a really good grasp on the types and their functions, better than I do, and they are all really enlightening and will explain things better than I can:   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8UBvtcBFvM
There are other sites out there, if you care, like 16personalities, keys2cognition, cognitiveprocesses, and things like that if you want more profiles or explanations, but I'd suggest looking at the video, mainly."
314,esfj,"So, I'm an INFP and need some advice. My hubster and I have been married for five years, and I love him oh-so-much. One thing about him alternately hurts my feelings and puzzles me: he is absolutely obsessed with what 'other people' might think. Two examples will illustrate the point. First, I love to tell a story about one of our first dates when it became apparent that while I was out of my mind with romance, he was thinking about food. It's a cute story and completely harmless in my view. Hubby recently told me every time I tell that story 'other people' will think he's an asshole. I was speechless. It used to be one of my favorite little vignettes about us, and it's one of the things that made me fall in love with him because he made me laugh. Second, we were at a work-related Super Bowl party with some of his co-workers and lots of other folks (over 100 people). I'm a touchy person and I reached over to rub his shoulder with one hand while we were watching the game. Well, afterward we had a huge blow out because 'other people' might find us touching to be inappropriate. 
Now, to be perfectly honest, as an INFP, I couldn't give a squirt of piss what most actual people think and some nebulous concept of 'other people' holds even less sway over my behavior. But 'other people' seem to rule his life down to whether or not I can rub my husband's shoulder. Do I just have to get used to this? Or can I help him be less self-conscious? Or am I the weirdo? Thanks!"
315,esfj,"I'm an ENFP (F) with an ESFJ fiancé (M). From what he has told me, he used to be very insecure and wasn't sure he had anything good to offer anyone when he was in his 20's. I've been told that this used to dictate much of his behavior in the past. I'm not sure if this is playing a role with your hubby, but it does seem to be self esteem related. When he is okay with himself, he won't care as much what others think (his dominant Fe will be more balanced instead of all ruling). As far as practical ways to help, perhaps encourage him towards what gives his life meaning and purpose? I think ESFJs tend to be really sensitive about their competence, as well as their ability to be everything their significant other needs. They pride themselves on being the most romantic and thoughtful, and your first date story may highlight a time when he maybe was not at his top game! Or maybe the way you tell it makes it seem as if you are more romantic that he is? Just a thought! Funny enough, I say something similar about my guy! I always say, ""From the first time I met him, I knew I could talk about the deliciousness of mac and cheese forever"". What I meant by this is that our discussions are perhaps not always as theoretical as I am used to, but they are still super entertaining! My guy is seriously a comedian, and can make any mundane thing a blast, and that's what I always tell him. Not sure if any of that could help, just going off the info I have! Hope it was useful in some way!! "
316,esfj,"I totally agree with the self esteem comment. I alternate between not caring how others will perceive my behavior to being obsessive about how a certain statement or behavior was interpreted. 
For me I'd say that I tend to worry less when I'm around those that I know and understand well. I feel they know me well enough to know I mean them no harm. (Or I know them well enough to know that their opinion of me is unimportant)."
317,esfj,"Thanks for your reply. It was very helpful. I do agree it has to be a self-esteem issue, unfortunately, and there's not much I can do to make him happy with himself. I think I am going to insist that he do some mindfulness meditation with me. I've suggested it before, but I'm going to make him do it now. I think it will help his anxiety and he'll really enjoy it. My honey was thinking about chicken and waffles rather than mac n' cheese, but the upshot is the same. Are ESFJ's foodies? That's a separate but interesting question! "
318,esfj,"Thanks for your reply! This is an interesting insight. So, when he feels like his superiors or subordinates are there evaluating and judging his behavior then the 'other people' bogeyman appears. I think I get that. He has never explained it that way. I just kept saying, ""Whose wife doesn't hold his hand or touch his shoulder? Wouldn't people be more weirded out if we just stood woodenly next to each other?"" Like we're Ricky and Lucy sleeping in separate twin beds. It was just an odd idea to me. But I think if I see it as him playing out his discomfort at being surrounded by strangers whose motives are unknown, I guess I can get my head around that."
319,esfj,"So I thought there was something going on between me (INFP) and an ESFJ. Anyway, it lead me to a question about your personality.
Do you often notice a contradiction between your feelings and your decisions?
Suppose that you find yourself in a situation where you fall in love with someone else while already in a relationship? Would you choose to go with your feelings or loyalty?
Thank you :)"
320,esfj,Loyalty but if I had real feelings and I am unhappy in the relationship then I would follow my feelings however it would take a while as I would live in denial and clutch onto the current relationship. 
321,esfj,"For a committed relationship, loyalty every time but that’s still based on feelings including prioritizing the lifelong feelings of regret I know I would have if I acted disloyally over a new feeling that’s likely transitory."
322,esfj,"ESFJ here. I find that people often think they are closer to me than they really are or maybe misinterpret the relationship. ESFJs are normally very warm people and are good at connecting with people. I know that there were multiple women prior to my getting married that thought I liked them, but from my perspective they were just good friends and I was just being my friendly warm ESFJ self. It hasn't been as much of an issue since getting married, since people know I'm married and there's less chance of misinterpretation. "
323,esfj,"Loyalty. I actually think that I'm a kind of person who will stay in the relationship even if I'm unhappy, rather than hurting the other person. I will do my best to work the relationship out. And I will never forget of course the bond that I have formed with my partner for so long and still work in strenghteming. I think exceptions would be an abusive relationship and cheating. These are dealbreakers for me. Although I guess having feelings for someone else is very very very unlikely for me because I am very loyal, and I know the difference between love (which is longlasting, deep, intense) with infatuation (which is fleeting, shallow, not true love)."
324,esfj,"I think we have a trend for loyalty! I respect that. I guess I thought that, as objective feelers, the object of your feelings would prevail but like you said, we must distinguish between different types of feelings . As for myself I must admit I find it harder to make these distinctions. Thank you for helping me understand ESFJs"
325,esfj,"Yes we are feelers, but the focus of our feelings are the feelings of other people rather than our own feelings, because our primary cognitive function is extroverted feeling. The worst thing is hurting other people, especially those who are important to us, even at the expense of our own happiness. Those who have their cognitive function as introverted feeling are the feelers who are more likely to be honest with their own feelings, because their feeling function is more inwards rather than outwards. By the way, how do you find it harder to make these distinctions? What did you mean by that?"
326,esfj,"Well said. OK what I think I meant was that the idea of falling in love while already in a relationship is troubling to me, infatuation or not. If that person is making you feel things so strong compared to what you can expect from the current relationship.  Because it's hard to do things for someone if love is not there. it's almost paralyzing.
ESFJs, while you're warm and kind to everyone, it appears that there are certain people that seem to attract you most? Is it possible that, sometimes, you're not fully aware that your love has gone somewhere else?"
327,esfj,"I see. I, myself, am very very very loyal, so I am not sure how this happens, too. I am very loyal actually even if it's unrequited love for me. However, based from my friends who are couples, I can see that they had crushes with someone else while in a relationship, but these are just shallow crushes. If they start to develop feelings for someone else, they become honest with their partners about it, and I noticed that these feelings soon pass. Honesty, communication, and openness are really essential to make a relationship work out. I, myself, do not understand it because I think that I won't even have crushes if I am in a relationship, but like my couple friends, I prefer for my partner to be totally honest with me in case it happens, and same with me. I think people misunderstand true love, because maybe love is too idealized in movies, books, etc. Most people believe that they always need to have spark when in love with someone. But as for me, love is not all rainbows and butterflies. You don't always feel the spark with your special someone. Your special someone even sometimes annoys you and does things that you dislike, but that's okay. You're staying because you still love the person. You are willing to compromise and meet halfway because you love the person... I think that is true love. Other people, when they feel that there is no more spark, they search it with someone else. Then they feel like it's love, when in fact, it's only infatuation and it's only shallow, in my opinion, since most of the time, they ""fall"" for someone else they just met, etc. They don't really know the person fully to claim it as love, for me.
As for ESFJs being warm and kind to everyone, most people misinterpret us. This makes people think that we are not loyal and that if we are sweet to someone else, that we have developed feelings for that person. But this is not the case. It is only our default version, it doesn't mean anything. There may be people who we are absolutely fond of, but it doesn't mean that we have developed feelings for someone else. I am really really really loyal to the person I love romantically. My significant other may not notice it, but there are really soooo many things I do to that person that I don't really do with anyone else. :)"
328,esfj,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!"
329,esfj,"Despite usually being able to perceive the emotions and feelings of those around us, I personally find myself to be generally clueless as to whether someone is showing interest in me. An ESFJ will likely assume that he/she is just being friendly before believing it to be a romantic interest largely because we try to be friendly to everyone ourselves and we may see it as self-absorb to think it would be anything else. So unless the attraction is strongly shared, I'd recommend being upfront about one's feelings with an ESFJ if they are romantically inclined, otherwise it may take multiple obvious hints before it will catch on."
330,esfj,"As a ESFJ, just ask me out and be clear with what you want. If you are not clear about it im gonna go crazy in my head and start to overthink. If you want to go to a date, ask me on a date. If you want to hang out as friends, then please ask it in such a fassion."
331,esfj,"I am also clueless until you spell it out. Mainly because I am an extrovert and I never meet s stranger. So I don’t assume everyone is interested in me, rather they just want to be friends. Exactly what old_oak_doors said. I also feel like I need words of affirmation throughout the relationship to know where we are and where we are going. That and quality time fill up my “Love tank”. Deep thoughtful meaningful moments of connection or compliments outweighs effortless “I love yous” or the same repeated compliment. EX/ catching someone off-guard while doing monotonous things like cooking, etc stopping them and saying you are so beautiful. "
332,esfj,"I am an INTP marrying an ISTP in about a year.  We want our wedding reception to be simple and relaxed; if we had our way, we would have a barbeque with family and friends in casual dress and be happy.  Somewhere between our ideal and the constraints of tradition and formality is probably where we would end up.
If not for an ESFJ future mother in law trying to spend a ton of money on us and make everything formal and princessy and perfect.  She just does not get our attitude about this and doesn't believe us that we don't want flashy and expensive things.  She is taking all the control away from both us as a couple and my ESTJ mother (the latter is no easy feat).  We don't know how to approach her in a way that will convince her that we actually want something simple.  My fiance and her have a pretty poor relationship where non-shouting communication is rare.  My fiance is unconvinced that the best course of action is not to simply let MIL run the show and be miserable for a few ours at our hyper-formal reception.  Obviously I don't want that.  How do I deal with her and communicate our desire for a simple and practical wedding with minimal fluff and monetary cost?"
333,esfj,"If I was her, I'd want you to tell me. My feelings would be hurt in the moment, but I would get over it soon. I would be doing all of that just to make y'all happy and if it wasn't what y'all wanted then you would have to lay it out for me. "
334,esfj,"I would be honest. Sit down with her, preferably alone if she doesn't get along with your fiance, and have a heart to heart. Tell her that you don't like it that she's not listening to your wants, especially since it's your wedding. Explain to her that different people want different things and you just happen to want something different than her. "
335,esfj,"So I can’t believe I’m doing this but apparently ESFJs don’t frequent their own forums. Too busy  being with people I guess.. anyway I’ve had lots of questions about us and how we work and even got a few PMs from just saying I am one. So if you got a question this is the place to share it so everyone can see! 
If there are any other ESFJs out there feel free to answer the questions also I would be interested to hear others take on similar topics to me. "
336,esfj,"This should be interesting grabs popcorn except the stars of the show didn't show up...which is right on for ESFJ's as they have more important things to do than hang out on Reddit.
I've lived with an ESFJ boyfriend for awhile now (INFP, here) and they're the most interesting creatures, ever.  I love learning about them.  (He varies from J/P, on occasion...just as I vary J/P on occasion).  Makes for a fun time, though.  I'd go anywhere with him.  He's a blast."
337,esfj,"He’s an incredibly stable and reliable person. I can count on him to come through whenever I need him. He’s quite selfless when it comes to helping others. He’s practical,most of the time but if he’s really wanted something or wanted to go somewhere he will work hard to make it happen.
One of the things we disagree on isn’t really a disagreement but seeing things from a very different perspective.  He’s all about the basics. He would consider say, buying Charmin toilet paper totally unnecessary when he could pay 30% less for cheaper toilet paper....because he’d rather spend his money on a concert ticket that costs $85.  To me $85 on something like that is crazy, but having comfy toilet paper is something I would prefer. 
He’s cheap....unless he’s spending on entertaining, fun stuff. I am not quite the opposite, but my take is more conservative on entertainment and more on creature comforts.  Same with groceries. That’s why I buy the groceries. I can’t do baked beans and store brand Mac and cheese three times a week. 😖
I would travel the world with him because he’s probably one of the most curious, adventurous people I have ever known.  He loves his family deeply and is dedicated to making their lives easy if he can. He’s the baby of the family, but he’s their go to person for anything they need help with.  He’s very sensitive to others feelings most of the time unless he’s frustrated or they’re just not listening to him. When he’s angry he’s really angry but then he’s over it. I’ve had to remind him that I’m pretty easy to hurt, emotionally so he’s patient to no end with me most of the time.  He tries very hard to communicate with me in the way I need him to.
He tries hard at whatever he has committed himself to. I think that’s what I love most about him.  He’s extremely hard on himself. His standards are incredibly high so I guess if he’s with me it’s because I passed the tests he gave.
I love him dearly."
338,esfj,"Yes! My husband's an intj and his feed is always full of intj tidbits and comments.  Meanwhile I am an esfj and very content just reading questions others ask about esfjs and never commenting back. Why is that? I appreciate all the comments made above, because you are all describing me perfectly!"
339,esfj,"Thats so interesting. I see the similarities. I skimp on a lot of things to get what I want. I have like one or two outfits because I would rather spend my money on technology and furniture so my friends and family feel really comfortable and enjoy being at my home. My slogan is ""The best or nothing"" So I see how our system is the same but I would go for the expensive toilet paper and the most expensive ticket and probably pay for my other half stuff.  I enjoy being the provider. The anger is the same, very heavy but gone in an instant, probably bipolar seeming honestly. And yes my standards are extremely high for myself and others around me. So you should feel proud your part of his life. "
340,esfj,"I usually get pretty quiet. I may turn down invitations for once. I tend to answer ""How are you?"" very honestly, so if I say ""I'm fine"", I'm probably trying to hide my real feelings from you. I guess that's the Hallmark of an ESFJ, we never want anyone to feel bad, which would extend to them feeling bad for us. TBH you're probably going to have to work hard to figure it out, because (at least I do) we try hard to hide it."
341,esfj,"People give us energy and happiness so the sadness us usually at home alone. If we seem sad in public then s**t has really hit the fan. I agree with the other person we will say I'm fine when we're not okay, but only to people we don't want to tell what's wrong otherwise were very honest about it. I don't need people to feel sad for me, I just like it when they will do their best to cheer me up, that is usually letting me talk and helping me work through it and giving me honest feedback."
342,esfj,"I hate that I can lose my cool easily. 
I need help finding ways to keep my cool. I've created countermeasures for situations to help me keep cool. However, I find myself coming across more and more situations that I'm never prepared. This FeSi is becoming more and more irritating.
Anyone else struggle with this, or even better (no offense), found success?"
343,esfj,"I think I'm decent at keeping cool and patient. All depends on the situation, though. Sports and video games? I don't keep my cool that well, although it has gotten way better. Other than that, I'm pretty calm and collected. It does take tons of practice, though. Keeping chill under hot situations is a skill, and any skill can improve with practice. 
Practicing self-awareness is the first step. If you don't realize how emotional you're being, then you can't really control it, can you? Once you're aware of your emotional state, then it comes to keeping your emotions to yourself and letting them pass through you. Emotions are temporary feelings, not permanent states, and they just take time to pass. Whether I'm being emotional or not, I try to hold what I want to express and save it for later. I later realize either I was being over emotional and don't need to express it anymore, or I've calmed down and I can calmly express my emotions without being influenced by my emotions. "
344,esfj,"Yeah, I feel like sometimes I don't know when I'm overreacting, say if someone wrongs me or something doesn't go the way it should (especially if I can do something about it), but I also don't want to be a pushover, you know? I think something that might help is like say if you get angry with family / friends think about how you would want them to treat you and act in a similar way. In terms of being competitive, maybe give yourself outlines of when it's cool to be really into it and when it's not, and if you do get heated when you lose (aka me) give yourself like 5 minutes to be angry and then after that try and let go."
345,esfj,"So I've been thinking about this for a while...
I understand why other types THINK we are ""fake"".
However, I think the problem is that other types misunderstand us. In fact, I think many ESFJs can relate to the term ""being an open book"". If anything, we are worried that everyone can figure us out too well and that all of our thoughts are displayed out there for the world to see.
This is the nature of Fe and inferior Ti. Fe doms focus less on what someone is saying and more on how it is spoken.
FJs were always really easy for me to read more than other types (especially XXFPs who have their lids closed on their feelings). Fe = Objective Display of Emotion. Emotional Expression. At the baseline, it's like a smile = the person is happy.
Fe, of course, goes beyond just reading a simple smile, and we can take into account nuance via body language, change in inflection or tone of voice, tightness of muscles, eye contact, facial movement, etc. Having inferior, introverted thinking means that we don't necessarily care to voice all of our thoughts and feelings on a subject. We think the mode of expression is good enough to understand us.
This is why Te types and high-Ti types get frustrated with us because they just zoom in on content completely. Te looks to see if people are saying and doing things which are ""based on fact"" and Ti searches for logical contradictions in someone's words/actions.
Ironically, I've probably called many Te-doms (blind Fe) ""fake"" numerous times because they might try and talk about their feelings, but their expression may be entirely blank/robotic. So I think ""Liar. You don't actually feel that way.""
Hopefully this made sense?
tl;dr Fe may not voice things but we openly display how we feel. Te might not openly display how they feel but they can voice their thoughts and feelings. Both think the other type is ""fake""."
346,esfj,"Interesting, this makes sense to me. I've actually been thinking about this a bit lately. I'm outwardly very honest with my feelings and pretty much an open book. But, I'm not very outwardly honest with my thoughts, and I attribute that mostly because I disagree with people often and voicing my thoughts on something would probably lead to an argument which I'd rather stray from if they're emotional.  
Would also agree with thinking that Te-doms are fake because I rarely know how they truly feel about something. "
347,esfj,"They are both. They can be genuinely sincere & overacting depends on situations, the facts is, ESFJ are very concern how peoples seeing them, they likely to demand approval & seek validation from. society, and sadly they believe they needed it the most. That's make them give it all in repositioning theirs value in society.
Unfortunately, ESFJ didn't spontaneous know its become  addiction, so faking will happen. 
As I'm an INFJ. I seen and study an ESFJ very closy. They are very weak and strong at diverted direction and developing life from outer world to inner self,  they are extreme vulnerable by society, but possess true blessing of self sacrifice.
The way ESFJ intimidating & manipulating society is definitely of joyful experiences towards every participant,, but, same also the very dangerous to themselves instead, 
its can turns as repulsive, if it's performing toward an INFJ. 
I need to speak of INFJ because we catch all lies. We don't want to hurt you. So, I just advises ESFJ, you need to be careful showing both true genuine sincere or decieveness anxiety.  The best can't replace the worst for to us. 
As an INFJ, I truly understand the consequences and recognizes all 16 personality. I just wish they don't misunderstanding me, when I show gratification or resistance to them, I will trade everything healing anyone toxic traits, need to be fix.  Especially if the ESFJ can't handle criticism very well. Take caution. But I understand why. 
The other type DID NOT misunderstood you. You misunderstand the type of yourself instead. ESFJ is fake but INFJ know why they do it, it's all about self sacrifice to overcome theirs social anxiety. ESFJ need to listen to theirs voice and follow the heart, not the herds and you'll be a truly wonderful bravery and blessing souls peoples will appreciate to lives by. 
Seriously advise for everyone:
Extrovert personality is useless and unnecessary. The others 5 is genuinely great variety of positive personality. 
because I strongly believe that we cannot truly grown from outer world into inner self.  It's necessary for each of us to put together yourself, spending time understanding ourself solitudely, then we can deal and Handle every external influences
 ESFJs please bare in mind. There are 3 advise I giving 
  1. Shift the priority : inner-self before the world, The Society is not human's main essential tools to survives. The true definition of life is from  yourselves, yourlife it is very first tools. You shouldn't never reconsider in  verify & clarify your fake / sinceres. Just do it. Don't worry, if you already did do everything with integrity, the right peoples will understand, for those who don't. Let them be. 
The facts is : people leave all the time, they die, they fly, they lie. Please don't lives to others, lives for your heart, all of it. 


There's always 3 side of every story : our story, others story and the true story. We all spontaneously blinds to survive, and lie to defy ego. 


Superior life is gratitude & aspiring life towards other. No perfection exists in homo sapiens specie. Lives unconditionally. Learn everything fearlessly. 


It's not your fault to feel offensive but it's will be your se  fault & failure not taking it, not regaining the right-being of defensiveness as you should be. 
ESFJs is an excellents sacrifice souls out of 16s MBTI, just changes whats not correctly perform as I said above.  You will become one of the closest perfect souls to humanity. 
😊 This is my opinion as an INFJ
THANK YOU FRIEND "
348,esfj,"I think it's caused by our Fe. We understand that they'd probably be hurt if we didn't take an interest, or care about what they have to say. So we overcompensate and act super interested even though we aren't. Happens to me all the fkin time.
TBH, I hate listening to people talking to me about things I don't care about, but I have to act like I care because it's my job.
Outside of work, if I don't give a rat's ass, you ain't getting my ear. Sometimes my Fe can't help it though, so I act fake and nod/listen like I care but I don't lmao.
This behavior, however, is socially unhealthy. The idea of being real can quickly be a way to shoot yourself in the foot. 
Here's why:
If you act ""real"" and someone is turned off by it, then don't call them the next time you go calling for help. They'll remember how you made them feel. Also, in this world, to receive, you have to give. You can't ask something from someone unless you give them something in return. 
CAVEAT: this doesn't mean their obliged to give you anything, or owe you anything for that matter. It just means you've fucked yourself over double time in the event you might need their help.
So yeah, I'm fake as fuck."
349,esfj,"Fakeness come from thing that any Fe user when they speak they soften their message. Even if Fe is trying to point out any flaws he will go full blown polite way and sometimes Fe can just go silent route to not say anything about topic(esp me being ISFJ) and then people drill me over some topic and I actually might say what I think about it despite I didn't want to say anything about it on first place. 
But literally whatever you get your ability to read people's emotion with trade of emotional instability and their got reading mind ability with trade of being indecisive. (Te dom and Ti inferior). "
350,esfj,"Honestly this just confirms things. I used to cringe at many XXTJ politicians and news anchors as I thought they were soooo fake. On the flip side, I (usually) adore XXFJ types because they just seem so in-touch with their emotions, and not completely dead to the world. Funny how that works."
351,esfj,"Hello fellow Fe user!
I'll be frank; I struggle to communicate with Ni users at times, so it is possible that I simply interpreted everything you wrote in another direction. 
Well I was trying to say that we attempt to ""fake"" things or manipulate by not fully voicing the truth. But our body language is very easy to understand and generally gives away our feelings, especially if you notice how someone's body language changes. 
I said that we are emotionally authentic, even if we do not want to be. Especially to another ESFJ.
This is in contrast with those with blind-Fe as they are unable to demonstrate their emotions objectively as well as we can. So I tend to interpret those people as ""fake"" by my definition.
I think it's because you can read an ESFJ well. As I mentioned above. NFJs go further and try to determine the motivations.  
Personally, I can empathize with Esfjs so I don't feel that aversion to them.
You find these actions of ours repulsive. I dislike certain things about XNFJs on the flip side. Ive always felt that XNFJs had some sort of... long term agenda that is way out of my consent. A discussion with an XNFJ rarely feels like a casual, friendly discussion. Rather it feels like I'm about to be pulled into something I never asked for. 
That's the nature of having different cognitive functions and different orientations in life. We clash and tend to not value the other.
INFJs and intuitives in general are incredibly rare. The reason you are guarded towards SJs could be because of our numbers. If things were reverse, i.e. an intuitive world, perhaps things would change and you would not feel our impact. 
Most people in this world, no matter the type, are not fully developed in their stack, which is why the bad outweighs the good. 
I don't know what it means to handle criticism ""well"" or ""not well"", according to you. Would you care to expand on this?
I am very eager to learn from you if it is beneficial, of course. It is strongly possible that I, and other Esfjs, have our heads stuffed in another direction. And my Ne i think craves to have some help seeing possibilities. 
For now, this is what I think. As I get older and more experienced (the best way for an SJ to learn!) My ideas will become shaped differently. Who knows; I might come to agree with you 100%.
Edit:
I understand now. You thought I was offended by the accusations calling us ""fake"" and was defending us.
I was merely trying to help others understand us better and why we do certain actions. I do not suggest, in any way, that ESFJs continue as they are, but rather develop self awareness and change. At the same time, for others to learn to work with the ESFJs in their life."
352,esfj,"The thing is, Te users would do the same thing if it helps them achieve their ""goals"". They can be very manipulative, and many have admitted as such.
Pretty much every type is full of shit to an extent; we just have different ways of coming to a conclusion or making decisions."
353,esfj,"Wow, are you actually ESFJ? This very interesting ideal sharing with you. I leant better about ESFJ, but I'd very appreciate if you do not feel offensive for my piece of opinion. I appreciate your ideas. Maybe using words fake is wrong. But I want you to know that we all fake but in different level of it. It's need to be understood depending on situation why we do it. I'm sorry if I offended you. I 100% agree to your awareness. It's great to know you trying to help others. Thank you. "
354,esfj,"Not offended. Quite frankly, I agreed with many things that you wrote. 
IMO Esfjs, myself included, are defensive as hell to a fault. We have a very strange relationship with our egos. I experienced sincere humility since reading about MBTI and quite frankly do not blame others for having a perception of us. 
I used to argue with my ISTJ mother all the time, for example. I used to think she was the Devil's incarnate. Until I started to understand why she did what she did. I wouldn't say it justifies everything she's done in my life and I do wish she was more aware of that, but alas it allows me to forgive her more and develop methods to cooperate with her.
I was hoping to achieve the same goal here, not just with non-ESFJs but also with fellow Esfjs. Having self awareness and awareness of others is incredibly important, I've come to find.
So I was not offended by your post! I was joking a bit in the end, my apologies, but everything you wrote in your edited portion was correct. Also you have a very valid way of seeing the world."
355,esfj,"My sister (16) is a somewhat socially awkward ESFJ, she gets along pretty well but does not feel particularly comfortable. My older brother (27) is an INTJ and they get along fine. The three of us (I am ENTP (13)) hang out a lot. It seems like she thinks he doesn't like her too much, but in all honesty he doesn't have a problem with her. That is probably why ESFJs and INTJs do not get along often is because ESFJs get the feeling they are not liked/wanted. "
356,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ with some level of social phobia. So, in some ways, I can be a bit socially awkward. That's usually from the phobia, however. If I'm comfortable with people, I'm pretty well-liked by most people. 
I'm a software developer, so I know a lot of INTJs. We get along just fine. "
357,esfj,"Interesting topic.  I would say I'm a true ESFJ to the T, I love people and have a really good emotional IQ when it comes to interacting with just about anyone and everyone.  So I wouldn't say I'm socially awkward.  I will say though that growing up, I was much more shy and behaved more like an introvert although back then, I still loved being around people.  I just did not approach people too often.  I broke out of that phase probably by the end of high school and moving into college.  By the time I got to college, I was very involved with activities and had an active social life.  
In terms of INTJs, I happen to like one right now lol so I wonder the answer to this too haha.  I would kind of agree with what @SpunkeyAlizza mentioned.  I kind of sometimes question if the INTJ likes me back when it's probably just in my head.  Unless someone makes it really concrete and is really warm towards me, I kind of have to wonder but I recognize INTJs are not typically warm and fuzzy people by nature."
358,esfj,Probably this is true. I usually get along with INTJs and I love the INTJs in my life! :) But I always get the feeling thay they don't like me which makes me afraid of approaching them because I might be a bother to them~ 
359,esfj,"So I'm talking with an ESFJ guy and he's so cool! Cooler than me by far actually. I'm kind of surprised we're still talking! Anyway, can you give your perspective on why he might be attracted to me? I mean, we are just friends, but obviously there's something about me that has kept his interest."
360,esfj,"He probably finds you cool! 
As for attraction, it could be a ton of things that may or may not be related to being an INTP. If you're feeling brave, you could ask. :D
To answer your question: Yeah I'd date an INTP. My deal breakers don't really have to do with type, and INTPs are generally cool."
361,esfj,"I am an ESFJ and I love my INTP girlfriend! She is amazing. Absolutely smart, beautiful, and not too loud. She also loves and appreciates me for my Extroverted Feeling function and my Introverted Sensing abilities. "
362,esfj,"Well, my understanding is that the horoscope is only indicative of the placement of the sun sign, and I read that you have to take into consideration the person's full natal chart and transit chart to really understand them. 
Unfortunately horoscope to me is like the enneagram; any one of those things can apply to anyone depending on your interpretation."
363,esfj,I want to make an ESFJ friend because I think this type is the one that is most compatible with my type. Could you tell me what places you guys go to hang out when you go out? What places during the day and at night?
364,esfj,"Everywhere that there are other people. Not. Even. Kidding.
It's Sunday and I'm feeling antsy because I've had no interaction yet. What to do? GO SOMEWHERE WHERE I AM WITHIN 10 FEET OF ANY OTHER HUMAN.
My actual feelings."
365,esfj,"When I have free time I love this local little tea shop nearby. I can go and read, or maybe write a little bit here and there. I don't go out of my way to seek out others but I appreciate the presence of a crowd. Going to bookstores is my next favorite place. "
366,esfj,"Hello my fellow Wolfpack members, ever since I discovered that I was an ESFJ. I did some research and discovered something. We provide positive energy to the world despite that we are emotional. Why can't we encourage ourselves? Why don't we entertain ourselves when we feel alone? We should start posting our stories that may leave you confused. We need to provide the inspirational advices we give others. 
Members welcome to ESFJ 2.0"
367,esfj,"I think it has something to do with the fact that our energy is triggered when we are around people. The very act of being near people makes us happy. When we are alone we get bored and lethargic. IMHO, We can't give ourselves comfort or entertainment because we need to be around people in the first place to have it."
368,esfj,"I don't know, but it's something that i've found which greatly applies to me
personally I like helping people, and it can be really difficult to help myself sometimes. when I do try and fix my own problems, I create this situation where I think i'm special and my problems are much worse than others. so helping others is how I live vicariously, especially if they're my close friends. so in effect it kinda makes me feel better
so yeah :/"
369,esfj,"We can do these things for ourselves, and that's why I think these categories are transcendable.
As of right now, I am at the beginning stages of a relationship with someone who I think is an INTJ and have had a couple of occurences where I regretted expressing myself because it came out so messy. I was unable to control my passions, and though I thought I was expressing myself in a calm manner about my emotions but it still came off, I think, as selfish and worthy of contempt. Embarassing but I still have to fight off the nagging feeling that I should give in to resentment for them not giving me more to go on as far as intimacy is concerned. Alas, I just need more patience and self-control."
370,esfj,"Glorifying your problems as unique and insurmountable challenges does not also glorify you as a martyr, because everyone else can pretty clearly see that your problems aren't particularly unique or insurmountable. It's the same shit everyone else deals with, only they actually choose to deal with it, so you aren't making yourself look special, just pathetic.
If you want to truly feel special, then get over yourself, fix your problems and be awesome. I realize that's easier said than done, the trick is to actually want your problems to be fixed more than the false notion that they somehow make you special. "

Sciences as a whole seem to captivate my interest, mathematics is intriguing, anatomy&physiology is extremely useful and fun to understand and apply, physics may confound me at times but is quite interesting, and obviously more but you get the idea"
374,esfj,"Hello all. It's my first time posting in this subreddit, but let me start by saying that I've a couple of esfj friends and they're both very dear to me. 
 
So sadly, tomorrow will mark a year since my esfjs friends' father died of heart problems. The memory of the day he called me about the news still haunts me.
 
It's been over a month since I kept thinking about this date coming up because I want to say something to him (since he'll most definitely spend tomorrow thinking about that horrible event). I was thinking of sending him a funny video (he loves family guy) and give him a message saying something that'll remember him that his friends got his back but without being a downer (if I'm making any sense). Idk, I feel like as a friend I should acknowledge this so that he doesn't feel alone in this kind of heavy moment.
 
So my question to you all is this...how should I tell him that his friends are there for him for support in a way that cheers him up rather than make him sad? (I hope I'm not overthinking this haha..) Thanks in advance"
375,esfj,"I am an ESFJ and I lost my brother a few years back. I always appreciate people bringing it up because it shows me how much they care. They love me enough to remember this event, the date, that I might be effected. And overall, I think ESFJ's prefer it to be happy rather than sad. We like to be sad on our own. So you can do something as simple as a text, ""Hey, thinking about you today. Hope you know how much we all love you, and we're here for you for whatever you need."" Also, I appreciate distraction. If you guys are close (like, live in the same state) I always enjoy a good kidnapping. You can plan it or not, but just swing by and pick them up. Say, hey, this is what we're doing today. Go to the movies (making sure it's a funny movie with no death in it) go mini-golfing, just do something fun and active. Theme park. Something like that. My very good friend kidnaps me every year on the anniversary. And she's so subtle about it, will ask me WEEKS in advance if I'm free that day. Sometimes it doesn't even occur to me till the day arrives that that's what she's doing. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the thought, effort, execution. Actions really do speak louder than words. Especially in these kinds of situations. Hope this helps!"
376,esfj,"P.S. There is nothing you could do to not make it sad. It is sad. So don't try and take that on. Because you will fail, and then you'll be hard on yourself about it. It IS sad. The best thing you can do is distract."
377,esfj,"I had a boyfriend a few years ago who was really into it and he got me interested, though I haven't really paid much attention to it since we broke up a few years ago.  Anyway, I'm definitely a (phobic) 6. "
378,esfj,"I'm an ENTP and was wondering, what are some general social rules/boundaries. No, don't say, be nice, don't do drugs, don't stand too close in the elevator/line, or, there's the one stall away rule. Just throw a few out there. What better way to find out than from one of the most social people in the planet? ENTPs aren't necessarily social, they just get mental stimulation from being people, so I wanted to ask you guys."
379,esfj,"Pay attention to your surroundings. Notice if you're in someone's way in the grocery store. When you talk to people, try to picture how they're feeling and why. Don't assume a bad mood from someone else is your fault. People love to be remembered, so remember details. ""Hey, how was your camping trip with your in-laws?"" My most valued tip is to make people feel understood. If someone tells you about how hard their shift was, a simple, ""wow, it sounds like you had a long, tiring day"" will help them to feel understood."
380,esfj,"OH MY GOD THIS ONE DRIVES ME UP A GODDAMN WALL. No, of course I don't mind waiting while your entirely family meanders side by side slowly down an aisle, pausing to look at every little thing. Ilove having other people waste my time!"
381,esfj,I feel like I do all this and I'm still socially awkward as hell around some people. How do you accept that you can't be friends with everyone? I get jealous of how social butterfly-y ESFJs are. I think people assume ESFPs are but we really aren't. We're more just players and entertainers.
382,esfj,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESFJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
383,esfj,"Im an INFJ who have a cousin that I used to get along with that's an ESFJ (same age as me, 18). So I'll sum it up with my own perspective and opinion/thoughts about her:
Good points:
•Sometimes can understand me when I say something ""bizarre"" that other people we both know dont get
•Is generous; always buy me a souvenir when she travels to somewhere
•She's most 85% of the time being meek, so she just goes along with whatever the plan is
•She acts weird that I dont see everyday so that's what makes her funny. And also sometimes say it weird
•She's ok with babysitting but not me
Bad points:
•In a conversation when she's being countered or embarrassed/humiliated, she becomes heartless with attitude and most of the time say something unnecessary (too defensive)
•She cares a lot about her reputation so she can be dishonest or avoid the question/convo if its too ""personal""
•Now she goes on her phone a lot checking her Snapchat every 3 min. And bc of Snapchat she still reply to my msges early and for 10 min or less we keep replying to each other, but after that she wouldn't reply for an hr+ and she would stop reading or replying even if I sent her a long text. This happens every time I msg her (I'm the type who hates late reply)
•As for her college decision, I think she's going for college that's popular with good rep, but not a college that will help her career 🙁
Ik there's a lot more but I can't rembr them. These are the main points about my cousin tho. I hope it helps.
Extra fact about my cousin: When we watch horror movie and comes to a scary part, she looks down and sometimes look at how others r watching ir reacting it. I find it annoying "
384,esfj,"I've never really been able to grasp the difference between Sensing and Intuitive. I know what they are on their own, but how would those look different when fitted into an EFJ personality? Just trying to figure out which I am and curious for y'all's thoughts :)"
385,esfj,"Not an expert, but in general, I believe ENFJs are more creative and big-picture oriented, whereas ESFJs are more practical and detail-oriented. I've also read that ENFJs can keep things more ""close to the vest,"" whereas ESFJs show everything they think and feel on their face (definitely true in my case!)"
386,esfj,"What a great question! I have taken the Myers Briggs twice with a couple years apart and gotten both ESFJ and ENFJ. I know that it can change for various reasons over time, but I feel the same confusion about the two because I can identify with so many criteria for each. Most recently I've gotten ESFJ.. so that's what I'm goin with for now. Haha "
387,esfj,"Just found out one of my dearest friends is an ENFJ, so I have a little additional insight. I would say that the biggest difference between us is that she is definitely more of a planner and takes more of a long-term approach to things. I tend to be more worried about the here and now. She also is definitely a person who can step back and look at a situation in its entirety, whereas I tend to dwell on details. In addition, she is definitely more circumspect, and I'm an open book."
388,esfj,"There’s this ESFJ girl I share nearly all my classes with who I’m really in to. For context we’ve been in the same school for several years now but never really got to know each other. On multiple different occasions over the past 3 months I’ve caught her staring at me (sometimes she shyly looks away immediately or she smiles and then looks down and away) and when I talk to her she’s playing with her hair/fiddling with something a lot. But when we talk she always seems so nervous which I thinks comes from her lack of experience as she’s never had a relationship with a guy. 
I’m an INTJ and I’ve been told by several people that I’m quite intimidating. How do I initiate something with this girl that doesn’t scare her off and let her know how I feel without just dumping all my emotions/problems on her?"
389,esfj,"Just say hi and be curious about her. 
ESFJ's like attention. The more you ask about what she likes, the more comfortable she'll feel as with anyone.
Also, don't be afraid to talk about what you like. And... try not to speak highly about yourself. ESFJ girls don't like that.
Anyways, I have a feeling you might get bored. ESFJs are simple as heck and I'm also talking about myself. That being said, I'm a guy."
390,esfj,"I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome."
391,esfj,"Hey guys, I am a pretty strong ISFJ. My brother and his wife are both ESFJ's, along with a friend of ours. All of them insist that they are introverts, but I don't think they are. My brother and sister-in-law have always been popular and outgoing people. Is it common for ESFJ's to be consider themselves introverts? Thank you!
Edit: And I do realize that there are more to ESFJ's than the description I gave, but they match up with a lot of the other descriptions as well. They just don't consider themselves extroverts. "
392,esfj,"A good question.  In my opinion, the Myers-Briggs personalities needs to be thought of as a grey area between the personality types; you're not just one or the other of the 4 areas.  Maybe your brother and wife are really good at acting like ESFJ's when they need to but it exhausts them?  I am an ESFJ sometimes, but sometimes I really need my alone time.
I have heard that the main differentiation between an extrovert and an introvert is whether social interactions give you energy or drain your energy.  For me, sometimes it just varies.  I think that unless you are an extreme version of any of the personality types, you probably morph between them throughout the day.
Again, this is all my opinion based on how I am... maybe you should ask them about how social interactions affect them.  Do they always give them energy, drain energy, or just vary depending on their mood or situation?"
393,esfj,"i've found that many extroverts will claim to be introverts (especially ENFPs). i think there's a stereotype that extroverts are more superficial, also all people are in their heads to some degree, so i think people can interpret needing some alone time as full on introversion"
394,esfj,"I took the MBTI test and it said ESFJ. It was shocking because i always knew and felt like I was an introvert. Like being alone, hate social settings, prefer quiet and calm, etc. But at the same time, I do enjoy having a conversation with someone, as I have a lot to talk about and i love telling stories and whatnot. Just not with a group of people. I definitely prefer 1 on 1 convos than groups. For this reason. I consider myself as both. Im an ISFJ when im introverting and I become ESFJ when im feeling chatty. I believe everyone is a little bit of both (I v E, S v N, F v T, P v J) but we lean more towards one over the other. I think the ""S"" is what makes me feel like an introvert."
395,esfj,"A esfj introvert, this make no sense imo. At least for what I am and for what rating I got from a nice looking website, which is, the result, esfj.
Maybe someone that is going to be esfj in the future could be introvert right now."
396,esfj,"Ok this thread is kind of old but it's on the front page. If you think you are ESFJ but feel like you are an introvert, it is possible that you are really an isfp. ISFP women can be popular and outgoing, they won't be super over the top with enthusiasm though. The men are more low key, but usually can always talk to a stranger. Both may consider themselves shy, confusing everyone around them who always see them interacting. 
ESFJ have a kind of restless energy and will enjoy physical activities to relax themselves. ISFP will do everything they can to not physically exert themselves. "
397,esfj,I can understand what you mean. I certainly agree that MBTI is a spectrum from one extreme to another and everything in between. I guess it's hard for me to empathize because I never really talk in big groups. Thank you for replying!
398,esfj,"Sorry for the delayed response.
For me it varies on the kind of day I've been having plus the kind of social interaction it is... for example, I was leading a 2 hour requirements gathering meeting with some developers that was very intense and somewhat combative.  I left that meeting feeling totally drained and tired the whole day.  Other times I'll look forward to meetings if it is something that I know will be fun/interesting.
Honestly, I probably act more like an ESFJ than I really am because I think that's how you ""play the game"" at work... :)"
399,esfj,"First post so plz be patient!
Just got out of a long term very serious relationship with an INTJ and having hard time coping/moving on/being happy. 
How would other ESFJs handle situations like this? "
400,esfj,"don't over-romanticise your ex and the relationship. it wasn't  as great as you're making it out to be in your head, otherwise you would still be together
you will find someone to bond with as well as the previous person if not, better. but DON'T RUSH because these things will take time. and time is a great healer, so hang out with your best friends and family and before you know it, you'll feel a lot more strong
keep yourself busy. don't go back to him/her. spend time with other people. and most of all, good luck!"
401,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ. I kill all my feelings. Find things that I like, and do those things. You keep yourself occupied because shit hits the fan the moment you think. 
However, if you do want to think, look at your life in a detached manner. Remove ""you"" from the situation and see what can be improved, how you can be improved, and what can be done next time to be in a better relationship.
Otherwise, stay busy, or you'll start self-loathing."
402,esfj,"I’m an ESFJ who has been dating an INTJ for 4 years. I almost broke up with him last weekend. Here to talk if you ever wanna just discuss their personality type and how they mesh with ours, and also can lend an ear as a friend too. Best of luck getting through this!"
403,esfj,"Who broke up with who? In any relationship usually the one being broken up with feels worse because they feel powerless.
I had a gf I wanted to break up with once, but when she tried breaking up with me first I was devastated. It was so weird. 
I'm INTJ so I can't help with your ESFJ question."

405,esfj,Do you ever accidentally turn people off/push them away by your seeming neediness? I can't tell if I'm overwhelming my friend by constant texting. I really miss her and just want her to know I'm here and would love to listen/hangout/talk. I feel like my emotions can lead me to be too  clingy. Advice?
406,esfj,"Yes, I'm an ESFJ and it's taken me many years to realise, not all people see friendship the same way I do; I used to be almost offended if someone didn't want to reciprocate the intense friendship I can offer.
But I've mellowed since I turned 30 a few years ago, and can see now that I was certainly intense and why it put people off.
I think one thing I learned is, if somebody wants to be your friend, they just will be! It doesn't matter how much you text or see them, or don't - if someone wants you in their life, they make themselves available, and will accept you for the crazy intense friend that you are!
My advice would be try and distract yourself, if you think 'I want to text my friend' open up a game on your phone or something, and distract yourself for a few minutes. Or some other app. "
407,esfj,"I (ENTP (close to being an INTP) dated an ESFJ and I will say a couple of important things about my analysis of her that may help some of you.

From her behavior she put way too much emphasis on what other people believed she should do rather than her own agency. I could never get her to do what SHE wanted to do.
She would become ""friends"" with anyone but could never see what I already know. Most people are not your friends because there is a difference between acting cordial, friendly, and actually being friends with you.
She was ALWAYS very clingy toward me. I never saw this as a problem because I liked the attention she gave me. She had days where it was overwhelmingly clingy and the way I got through it was to simply gloss over the clingy periods as if it is like her having a bad day. A clingy day doesn't have the weight to change my relationship with her because I find something she did too clingy.
SHE pushed me away from her life. Not because of her neediness. She had problems with her father and I firmly believe she took out her frustrations with her father on me when it finally reached a point she could no longer handle it. Also bonus points for replacing me with the gym trainer almost immediately, because ""I don't know whether I want to be with you or explore the possibility with this guy."". was a lovely touch for the long term boyfriend who treated her very well to receive on his way out the door. Haha. 

Long story short not to label all ESFJ under one roof. But I believe there is a possibility that many ESFJ are far too emotionally driven to understand when they are not making the best of decisions. The strongest development any ESFJ can make in my opinion has to do with maintaining an emotional grounding when in more adverse scenarios. The second most important development point in my opinion related to ESFJ is a stronger sense of acting based on what YOU believe and what YOU want. Not based on outside influences and biases within your friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, etc."
408,esfj,"And my angle on it comes from someone who had nothing but love for an ESFJ whom I actually thought was pretty developed all things considered. Sadly since I am ENTP I can immediately see exactly what you realized with friendships. Not only could I not....get her to see reality, but since she is on the younger side of the spectrum, I learned how incredibly easy it is someone to maliciously influence an ESFJ. I have no doubt the ""friends"" I suggested she keep at an arms length were the ones she wanted to win approval of and they at least attempted to sabotage the relationship her and I had lol... The friends she had who were actually very good people who cared about her as well were of sorts, cast away as well. 
If nothing else the guy who replaced me immediately was the one who vultured the relationship and she bought into it for likely the same reason. New person whom she wanted to win the approval of. 
Sadly I think ESFJ are incredibly susceptible to being used and unlike some other types I am familiar with, I don't even believe they can understand that they are being used until way too late.

410,esfj,"I'm just curious as to what ESFJ's think of INTP's. I've often wondered about this and I personally think of ESFJ's as kind of an enigma. I do admire your desire to help others and how gregarious you guys are. Seems like it comes so easy to you.
Anyway, let me know what you think!"
411,esfj,"i tend to get on very well with introverts, more than extroverts at least. i know it’s cliche but the quieter people are often more interesting and have more to say
i’ve heard that INTP’s can be insensitive, which can be a downer for me. but if i know it’s not malicious or deliberate then that’s fine with me :)"
412,esfj,"ENTP here.
I dated an ESFJ for along time and I will agree with the general consensus regarding xNTP needing to develop better interpretation and execution on emotional availability and empathy. The ESFJ on the other hand I believe benefits most from making decisions based on their own convictions and relying less on the approval of the people around them."
413,esfj,"Yeah as ForeverJay wrote, many INTPs I've met aren't the most tactful people and can come off as insensitive, but I've learned that you rarely mean actual harm. Same with the ENTPs. 
I've also learned that INTPs have a tendency to over-generalize about things, and I've had to force myself not to take it personally. 
I've met a couple of INTPs who really developed their Fe and they were fantastic, some of the best people I've ever met. They were like super-INFJs, able to connect with a person and provide insight on their character as well as practical advice for how they can improve their lives. "
414,esfj,"Some famous ISTPs include Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Vladimir Putin, Erwin Rommel, Scarlett Johansson, Melania Trump, Snoop Dog, Tom Cruise, Christian Bale, Daniel Craig, Bruce Lee, Kirsten Stewart, Simon Cowl, and Steve jobs."
415,esfj,"I'm currently with a INTP and /u/peppermint-kiss is right. We are polar opposites but we balance each other out. He will go out and socialize because it makes me happy, I'll come earlier from a bar with friends to spend time with him at home. We push each other to do the things that we should do but don't/can't.
However, she's also right about the confrontation bit too. There are a lot of time where I wish he would go out without feeling wildly uncomfortable,  or enjoy having people over and we butt heads around that. He also loves to play devil's advocate and in the beginning it drove me mad!
But the truth is every year I love him more and more. I started dating him as a fling, that was about 4 years ago. Dating an ""I"", especially as reserved as an INTP, having him feel completely open and free is the best feeling ever. The love and loyalty that it brings is worth ever fight, bicker, and hurt."
416,esfj,"ESFJ x ISTP is one of the best relationship combinations.  It's called a relationship of semi-duality.  You have her dominant function as your inferior and vice versa.  This leads to a lot of personal development and magnetic attraction.  Note that it is often a quite tumultuous relationship (fights are not uncommon), but that it's one of the most stable - you keep coming back together.  That keeps you growing and keeps you interested.  Relationships of semi-duality are often likened to being a ""moth to the flame"".  The relationships get stronger and more loving the longer they go on.  Highly recommended.
Btw I'm ENFJ in case you were wondering. :)  I just want to commend you on noticing the attraction of semi-duality.  A lot of people (as you can see evinced by the other response) don't instinctively realize how good of a match it is, for various reasons."
417,esfj,"I think it depends on how mature both individuals are and if you're both understanding enough to accept and work through each other's differences. 
I'm an ISTP male and I dated an ESFJ female before. Personally, it didn't work out for us because we couldn't quite get past our differences. 
Not saying it can't work for anyone else though. "
418,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ and I'm married to an ISTP! 
We were friends for a year or so, and I would have NEVER imagined dating him. We were so different and I found him a bit annoying ha! 
I picked up on his willingness to serve others and his loyalty, and we began dating. Boy, was that a crazy and fun time! Our differences were so strong, and I always being so uncertain, that I was constantly overthinking whether we were ""supposed to be together."" 
Well, finally he wore me down and I married him 😉
I agree with everything that has been said. We REALLY have to be thoughtful about our communication and who the other person is, because it's so so easy for him to upset me, or me to frustrate him. 
We definitely have to genuinely appreciate our differences, and help each other grow. I'm so excited for the future experience of parenting with him! It will be a new challenge, but also an opportunity for us to complement one another on a whole new level! "
419,esfj,"Thank you, I didn't realize this when I asked the question. I asked what I did, because a girl I like is a ESFJ. I went with her to prom one year ,but just as friends,  the whole ordeal was awkward, and it didn't lead to anything. We sorta just drifted apart afterwards. It's been 3 yrs and I find myself being drawn back to her. I am more mature and confident now, so I know I can make things work this time around. Yes I am an ISTP."
420,esfj,"Hello fellas, 
I'm gonna explain briefly my situation.
I'm an ENTP dude that used to go from women to women and never be serious about anything.
Two years ago I met that person, I instantly felt that she would be special for me.
I kept waiting for her an entire year but she had someone for a long time. 
After a year and being in the same uni then afterwards in the same class, she was free and within two months we were together.
The beginning was really great, I did not know how to act properly because it was my first time being serious (btw I'm 23 now and she is 20), but we managed it.
After a few months she started complaining that I was ""distant"", not seeing her enough and stuff. 
Of course as dumb entp I was acting like she was crazy and all but ..
Eventually I had to deal with hardships in private life, I failed a internship that was important to me, and both my grandparents nearly died.
Of course she knew about it but I acted like it was not much of a deal.
After 6 months, seeing her sad because of my evasiveness and distance, I decided to propose her to break up.
Eventually I got better after a month, I realised that I had gone through quite a big depression phase during 3-4 months.
But I had already damaged our relation, she thought I didn't care and let her go instead of letting her in my life.
So I chased her from Late april to august.
To the world and me, she said it was over, she did not know why but it was, but at the same time, she always said ""I don't want you completely out of my life"".
and a common friend of us whom she used to speak to told me she was clearly hesitating.
End of august I caught her with a dude, it would not have been a problem since I'm a civilised man, but it was someone I hated for years, she did not know about it but shit began.
We were really mean to each other, I brought her every presents or little words I had of her then after an alcoolised night, I ended up beating the shit ouf of that man.
In the end we never spoke again from september till recently, but they never were together.
Since september we are in the same class, she hangs with a dear friend of mine, one day of that month he phoned me asking loudly why I did not bang some random chick I talked to him about, she heard him and went to him saying ""I can't believe he told me I was important for him all these months and now he's off fucking random girls""
Then we went in a one month internship, since september I did alot of work on myself, not only for my clothes style and stuff but also my mind, I'm trying to become the man she saw in me and wanted me to be.
So I wrote her a letter, sayin that she changed my life forever and that I would always be thankful for that and other stuff.
I gave it to her and tuesday she came to me asking to talk, she told me a bunch of things that I can resume in : 

She did not want me to hope for nothing but it calmed her alot
-She """"nearly"""" felt happy about it 
She has a new boyfriend ( I already knew) 
She received two months ago a very late gift of mine, she wanted to give it back to me, I said I can't force you but I can't take it back, throw it away if it's impossible for you to keep it, she answered ""No I won't throw it away.. That's why I wanted to give it back to you but ..""
She wanted us to stop ignoring each other and greet once again.

So, of course me becoming another person is first for myself before than being for her, and I should let go, but even when I try, no other women gives me the vibe she used and still gives to me.
So, it may be childish and dumb and nearly impossible. But now that I have break the shell of her late hatred towards me, I want to keep improve and try to make her being attracted to me again, I could go to any girls it's not a problem for me, but she really is special for my heart.
So.. any advices on how to get in her high esteem again ? "
421,esfj,"ESFJ-A here: I can only speak for myself but we’re a very forgiving bunch. I, too, have been put off by a lover that just pushed me away too many times and once I was done I was done. It seems like you’ve tried, which I would appreciate, but when we get involved with someone else we start giving all our passion and love to them to feel that reciprocation. I would advise you to try again but she’s been very straight forward about moving on. I would wait until she’s single again after some time, do some growing up and then go for it :)"
422,esfj,"Is this accurate?
i guess so, anyways find an ISFJ (SiFe)"
423,esfj,"ENTP here with an ESFJ girlfriend. We've been in a relationship for almost a year and every time I make her feel sad or hurt, I tell her how much she means to me deep down my heart. She usually gets happy and confident again when I tell her about the emotional connection we are having. Telling ESFJ that she has a special place in my heart really is what makes her happy again."
424,esfj,"Lmao this is like the most ENTP thing ever
edit: source, since this sub doesn't have flairs, is that I am entp"
425,esfj,"Thanks for the answer!  Yes actually I was thinking about it, keeping improving, maybe see someone else but keeping myself somewhere within her memory by doing... Idk what yet"
426,esfj,"Yeah I used to do it too, that's why we lasted but at some point I entered my ""robot phase"" and it all tumbled down before my own eyes, so I ended up myself before hurting her.
I forgot that I would end up hurting me even more in the process"
427,esfj,"Thanks for updating me. I'm glad to know you're continuing with the self improvement. It kinda validates some of my global observations.
I lean pretty heavily into esoterics, and think that this info might be helpful and inspiring to you. Personally speaking, I feel as if I'm in something called a Twin Flame dynamic. It's a partnering that happens where neither of you can really exist in each other's space while also holding on to various traumas, coping mechanisms, and negative belief systems. To be near the other person is to have your issues brought to the surface so they can be addressed and let go. This process transforms us into the best versions of ourselves possible.
The above dynamic is intended to remind people on Earth what Love really looks like. Currently, and for a very long time, we see people pairing up as a way to balance out each other's needs. Major amounts of codependency and using one to stabilize the other. What happens is that very little true growth occurs and neither gets to fully experience love with the other person. It's an unhealthy model, in the long run, and plays a silent yet pivotal part in why so much on this planet is so wrong.
This ""new model"" of Love does not look like ""I love you. I need you. Why won't you love me back?"", but instead looks like ""I don't know why, but want to get to experience getting to know you so much that I'm willing to go solo through my own personal hell in order to identify and carve out all of that which isn't authentically me."" It's the opposite of what most people do these days.
It seems that you have met someone who inspires you to want to become the best version of yourself possible. If the pairing is ""meant to be"", then she is feeling similar things occur. Regardless, you will find that, through each growth stage, you end up loving yourself more than before and are more capable of both giving and receiving love in authentic ways you never imagined possible.
At least... that's how I perceive things. 
No matter what happens, I'm happy to know you're growing from this experience and are so inspired. Good luck!!!"
428,esfj,Esfj here that borders closely as a enfp too. This really hit me hard. Thank you. I needed that refreshing depth. This is why I’m so attracted to infj. Read my last comment. Might be interesting to you. 
429,esfj,"I need more ESFJs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there are no ESFJs, whereas other types are crossing 100 limit right now. 
Here is the form.
I really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, here is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from ""INFP"" in cell A3, to ""ESFJ"" if you want to see your statistics. ESFJ Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs."
430,esfj,"Brief intro, I am ENTP female, I have an ESFJ boss and a friend. I think they are great people, just really harsh on themselves they cannot see how important Fe is because its the first function, so in socionics land its pretty much disregarded as insignificant. Fairly similiar for me and Ne, they complement my Ne and I am like ok thanks. 
​
Basically I am curious I have pretty decent Ne-Ti meaning (I am walking bullshit detector, I learned code in 4 months, I wrote an academic paper, I have 2 degrees and I write  both freelance, work, fiction and non fiction etc). My Ne is always seeking for more (not intended to brag here, its actually quite annoying if ENTPS get me because really we want an Ni focus point but our Ne is like 'Dude OMG OMG OMG We so have to try this OMG imagine learning this, oh yeah lets start, we get excited and sometimes not always it can fizzle etc)- LONG WINDED BUT YOU GET THE POINT HERE 
​
**<THIS IS NOT A CRITICISM
​
Maybe this is not a socionics/MBTI thing maybe it just a normal competitve thing, sometimes one overcomplicates and sytemises things so one would appreciate any response (ESFJ or otherwise)
​
PEACE DUDES, <YOUR NOT STUPID, FUCK SAKE"
431,esfj,"I don't know if I'd go as far as to say there is a need to seek Ti from ESFJ's or any other subtype. It's certainly a case-by-case thing. However, I can definitely say that every kind of person is at least intrigued by how other people might think differently, even if they don't appreciate it. So I wouldn't say that your friend's or boss's profile is the reason they might seek your friendship. It's probably more related to you as a person and their own individual interests and needs.
I would say that if you sense jealousy, it is probably a normal competitive thing, maybe spurred by any similarities you share with your friend/boss. If they notice that you can do the same things they can/more, of course it might be a cause for insecurity.
Wanting to do more work isn't really a dick thing to do, so if it makes someone else insecure that's their own issue. But that doesn't have to be the end of it. You still want to have harmonious surroundings for your own benefit, so you should find a way to maneuver socially around your friend's/boss's insecurities. Maybe this means ""saying the right thing"" when taking on more work, or maybe it means finding a way to help them understand where you're coming from and why you enjoy learning new things (without making it seem like you're grandstanding)."
432,esfj,"No I am not ""jealous"" of Ti. That makes no sense.
Quite frankly, I dislike Ti if I'm being honest. I see it as a necessary evil. And this makes sense, as Ti seems to be the antithesis of Fe. 
However, for the most part, I slowly started to realize that my ultimate goals, self-actualization, and true feeling of fulfillment as an ESFJ cannot be complete without developing Ne and Ti.
Fe and Si are fun and make me happy, but do not entirely allow me to mature as a person.
If there are any functions I'm jealous of, it's probably Fi and Se FYI..."
433,esfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/entp] Question- Are ESFJs triggered by the need to seek Ti?

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
434,esfj,"I see, I think ''insecure of ti' maybe have a poorly described phenomena in this post etc.
Personally, the ESFJs I have encountered appear to be of a lower conscious awareness. They are highly competitive and comparative. It smells like insecurity which is probably separate from their Ti seeking behaviours. A need to feel intellectually validated and substantiated within reality. But, if your saying they are not connected I see.
The polarity between Fe and Ti is more obvious than an ENTP, ours is more balanced in the centre. For example, they have issues separating themselves from the Fe with a Ti comment, if forced to give one. Its like either a toss up between slightly direct/blunt (Fe latching on- I think Ti is detached as seen more explicitly in INTPS).  
....
Why would you be more jealous of Fi and Se?
^one last point 
Why do ESFJs assume that certain questions are stupid when all questions are useful. Answers are not as well defined as society likes to 'tell' us. I assume this is 7th Ni POLAR the blind spot, ESTJs do the same thing by becoming overly agitated with the abstract or things they believe are obvious. 
These things are not obvious to me."
435,esfj,"Yeah it sucks. Being ESFJ with totally underdeveloped Te and Ni, which probably is undevelop-able sucks. I hate my constant indecision.
For example, I have an intuitive feeling for what I want to do and then all of a sudden something just hits me in the heart and says... ""wait... I'm unsure."" I am then frozen in my fucking tracks. So yeah... SCREW Ne for sure."
436,esfj,"It COULD be related, but it isn't for me. depends on the person.
Fe = what is I guess valued in society. for me, intellect was never really valued, ""coolness"" and popularity was. With your boss, especially because he's a man, it may be different.
As I get older, I start to see the importance of intellect, instrospection, logic, critical thinking, seeing ""possibilities"" etc. I know I am shit in these areas but I am not jealous of people strong in these areas (unless they, y'know, are really charismatic as well or something).
I feel some envy for XSFPs because socializing is oftentimes completely effortless for them, and they don't really experience certain struggles that I do, such as the need to ""people please"".
I don't know what you mean by lower conscious awareness. Like introspective?
The last point- Yeah probably. I have done this in the past when I thought certain things were ""obvious"". However, note that intuitives may also over-think things to a ridiculous level, so there comes a point where over-theorizing really isn't beneficial. 
​
​"
437,esfj,"The idea of ESFJ coming on reddit is hilarious. You think Taylor swift spends her time on threads? only nerds, idealists and artistic types do this, sentinels are too busy being sensors to usually do shit like this. "
438,esfj,"We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg"
439,esfj,"Hey guys - I've been typed very in depth and accurately as ESFJ with the functions by multiple people and I'm quite confident in my type now. But one thing I read a lot about ESFJs is that they're ""very good at reading the emotional environment and able to influence it to make people happy.""
Well, I guess I'm a weird ESFJ, because when I do that in the slightest I either get ignored, interrupted, or just straight up shot down, lmao. My family also points out that I'm ""terrible at gauging the appropriateness of the situation and thinking about how my actions will affect others,"" for example that one time when I attempted to climb on the table and take a video of us all cheering and holding our drinks up, but then instead I practically got yanked down and kicked out of the restaurant. The video turned out as a one second long blur btw. 
My intentions are Fe, but it's weird because I'm actually quite bad at it. I'm far from a social butterfly unless you count randomly sending people friend requests on discord. 
Can anyone else relate? I'm pretty good with details and consistently test as a high sensor, and I line up pretty well with the socionics quadra values too. Cognitive function wise, I'm pretty sure I'm ESFJ, but I wanted to get that off my chest too. Am I alone?"
440,esfj,"Actually your example seemed quite Fe like. You're paying attention to the immediate social atmosphere and acting accordingly based on the current emotional atmosphere. You didn't pay attention to the future implications of current actions. That can be Fe-Si.
Si makes decisions based on past experiences, or sometimes tries something new spontaneously without full insight because of tertiary Ne. 
I think a lack of Ni is what your parents are indicating?"
441,esfj,"This makes perfect sense! Also Ni is my PoLR, so it's probably the function I'm least interested in developing, which makes my family really frustrated because they keep having to repeat themselves so much haha
Thank you so much!!"
442,esfj,"I've been obsessed with MBTI for quite awhile now. It's been really hard for me to type myself. I believe it's due to my family of STPs and INFPs. I also struggled with depression and anxiety for many years. I finally feel like my true self. I'm either an ENFJ or ESFJ. I've tested as ESFJ ENFJ INFJ ENFP INFP. I currently think I'm an ESFJ with good use of Ne. I posted on a thread intended for typing, but I didn't get any responses. I'll post a link. I know it's a little long :D Thank you!
https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/am3vx2/february_type_me_thread/efpbwby"
443,esfj,"OK, there's a lot to unpack here and I don't think many of those questions are well designed. so I'll just focus on what I think is telltale.
Memorization should be a cinch for ESFJs as long as its deliberate. Si- is based on memory, parsing information, remembering obscure, interesting details and facts is one of our strengths, we remember a lot of things, and memorizing things with intent and consciousness is very easy for us. We're known to be information powerhouses only second to ISXJs. Memorizing boring facts is a chore but isn't generally difficult/stressful. What is generally stressful for ESFJs is material that are based on understanding that isn't either self evident or ultimately a practical mode of thought. So things like Physics, Organic Chemistry, lateral thinking, Mathematics tend to be more difficult to learn for ESFJs. But then again, when there is a chain of events linking things together, like you said ""learning how a theorem was created."" learning becomes a simpler endeavor. Doesn't sound like an ESFJ on this level of analysis. I think your description best describes an 
​
This sounds very ESFJ, especially if half the time things tend to go bad if you rely on improvisation and there's no one else to help you out. As an ESFJ myself, I get over this sort of thing by forcing myself into a schedule and a plan because we have Ni-Trickster in the seventh Slot. Meaning we are completely blind as gauging a means for ourselves to get from point A to B. We even have a lot of trouble figuring out if point B is something worth  pursuing, If you ever had trouble figuring out what you want or how to get it. That's could be a marker of poor introverted intuition (Ni) meaning that that is a good marker for ESFJ-ness. We are notorious for this. *By the way, you have to be exceptionally matured for your age or intelligent to use intuition regularly if you are indeed an ESFJ ( time practicing meditation/prayer/self-reflection  in isolation is  generally how ESFJs can develop intuition). 
​
Objective logical consistency or your own brand of systematic thinking based on a subjective value metric where you prioritize certain things that others may not immediately rational. Like, in your post you said you are religious, which is good. But, religion is not objectively logical. It makes sense to you, and everyone in the congregation, but to most people it might not, because religion is based on faith and not objective fact. Basically what I'm saying here is that are you logically consistent or are you just .....consistent. If its the latter, that's a point for ESFJ. (Part of maturing for an ESFJ getting over this hurdle.) 
​
100% Extroverted.
​
Bad extroverted intuition and completely lost unconscious introverted intuition, sounds like ESFJ. 
​
OK here's the easiest test for ESFJ: 
When you think someone doesn't like you or isn't friendly do you consciously or unconsciously resent them for it? Also, do you care if people like you or not? And most importantly, when someone gives you props or encouragement, does it give you fuel and leave you elated and filled with pleasure and a desire to repeat whatever you did?"
444,esfj,"Thank you for helping! I’m absolutely certain I’m an ESFJ. I think the question about memorization is skewed, because I get brain fog sometimes. Part of my trouble with typing is I always score high in openness on the HEXACO test. I think this is just due to self development rather than natural preference. And yes I care about people liking me...a lot!
FYI according to my sister-in-law I’m basically the real life version of Leslie Knope."

Your list doesn't have to as extensive."
448,esfj,"Hello there ESFJs, I got a little survey for everyone to fill out. I'm curious to see which types most likely mistype as what other types, and so far I haven't got any answer from the ESFJs. If you would all be so nice to fill it out that would be awesome, I'll post the ""results"" on /r/mbti as soon as I feel like I've gotten enough answers if anyone is curious. Enjoy.
Edit: Now with link to the survey!"
449,esfj,"I mistyped as everything under the sun until I got over the anti-ESFJ bias enough to seriously consider it. Everyone seems to assume all the people they know who are clingy, emotional, and pushy must be ESFJ.
Btw, it says closed for maintenance?"
450,esfj,"How do you plan to account for people who deliberately and persistently lie and misrepresent themselves?
On /r/INTP there is a 70% mistyping rate. 20 percentile points of that are people who do it deliberately in order to fuck with the type they're misrepresenting. Then another chunk does it in order to get the fuck away from the type that's doing the lying evil.
/r/ENTP meanwhile is infested with narcissists schmoozing to get close to their targets. They also enjoy lying and deception even if they don't love lying evil for its own sake.
Your asking people about mistypes makes it so you'll catch the ""oh hey, they made a mistake"" rather than ""I am evil, watch me fuck you over"". And while the former category is indeed larger than the latter category, they're not the same types.
So by voluntarily asking for people's type mistakes you'll never figure out who is lying. You're basically counting on people who say ""trust us, we're honest"" to be honest."
451,esfj,"Ah but that's life, isn't it? Just hoping that people will tell the truth. It's not all too serious either so it really doesn't matter that much. Mistypes are often inevitable, but I thought it would interesting to see which types often have ""been"" a certain different type in the past. Maybe it should be changed from ""MBTI and mistyping"" to ""Presumed MBTI and mistyping"".
Also that's a pretty snazzy list, though I'm a little confused with what's meant with the different categories such as Angels and Time Lords, and what all the numbers indicate.
Also also, results coming in soon, as soon as I figure out how to make some fancy graphs on Excel."
452,esfj,"What the numbers mean
What the names mean
Should be read in that order.
000 means they're incapable of handling being their own type at all so they try to deny it in ways that still come off as their type.
100 means they're only capable of handling being their type if everything is going great.
001 means only when everything has gone to shit.
010 means only when everything is meh.
111 means they're fully capable of handling their type in every possible way and they're everything it means to be that type."

455,esfj,When I was young I was rather petty and would punish people for not following through on commitments like hanging out with me or being a jerk. It sounds like other ESFJs do this also. Now that I’m older that has mostly gone away but I find myself unable to control eye contact. I have been complimented on my ease of keeping eye contact while talking to anyone but if they have slighted me in anyway I cannot look then in the eyes and they always notice and often ask me why. Anyone else do this?
456,esfj,"When my boyfriend is upset he definitely makes much less eye contact with me, and when he does his eyes really emote the anger or hurt he's feeling.
I don't think he's trying to punish anyone but I think eye contact makes him feel more vulnerable and he tries to avoid that.
I notice that when he is pissed off at someone he will basically stare into their soul. 😂 I guess that's his way of punishment, extreme eye contact. "
457,esfj,"My ESFJ boyfriend uses eye contact A LOT!  It doesn't matter if it's a positive or negative emotion, those eyes will tell you everything you want to know.  On a positive note, when he's really interested in someone and what they have to say, he makes sure they see his face.  It's very, very important to him to make that connection.  I think this is a very ESFJ way to communicate.  He tries to express himself with words, but his physical proximity and the body language piece are a much more accurate gauge of what he's feeling.  For ESFJ's I believe the old adage, ""The eyes are the mirrors of the soul"" is incredibly true."
458,esfj,"Interesting take the this... I definitely avoid eye contact with someone that I’m upset with, but it’s not out of punishment from my perspective. While it’s not something I intentionally do, it’s something I’ve noticed that I do that I’ve tried to stop doing, and it’s next to impossible to break this, it feels. My thought process behind why I do it, is that I don’t want to discuss what it is that’s making me upset at the moment, and I fear that if I lock eyes with the person who has upset me, they’ll be able to see how upset I am and we’ll need to discuss it then and there. Or I’ll burst into tears... 
I’m sure it just feels like the cold shoulder, but I’m not trying to ice anyone out, I’m just afraid my eyes will betray my attempt at “I’m fine-ness” and with kids running around, it’s not always a good time to hash out a volatile topic. In a perfect world, instead of averting my eyes I would be having a conversation with the other person about what’s bothering me and we would get to resolution, but this isn’t a perfect world and while I’m learning to better communicate my feelings, for now, averted eyes help me get through everything I need to do to take care of the family without falling apart. "
459,esfj,"Eye contact is weird thing. I love to prelong it as long as I can with people because it allow me to read their emotion easier but some people feel unsafe from it. Also you could try teacher eye contact to punish people.
t.isfj"
460,esfj,"Hahaha omg that's hilarious. I definitely find it hard to look people in the eye when I'm upset. I feel like it comes from still wanting to please people, so even though I might be telling them how they hurt me, I don't want them to REALLY know by seeing it in my eyes. And I second the soul staring when I'm mad! 😂 My eyes are naturally green, and when I'm mad people tell me they get very dark, almost black."
461,esfj,Yes that is more accurate to my feelings. It’s definitely not intentional to hurt someone but intentional to keep my feelings secret. I feel 100% the same about what you said. Better said than mine lol. I find it funny because when I’m trying to hide I’m doing the exact opposite because anyone close to me is like why the fuck are you not looking at me because eye contact is so important to me.

463,esfj,Have any of you had trouble with your self-identity? My mother describes me as a very different person than I do. When I talk to other relatives and friends and ask them to describe me their accounts or descriptive words line up more accurately with my self-identity. I get very confused when she starts talking like she knows me. I try to minimize discussions about myself with her.
464,esfj,"Not everyone has the same outlook or view - that's why no matter how hard you try, you can't make everyone like you because everyone holds different values to different personality traits. 
For example, if you would consider yourself as outgoing, bubbly and friendly, someone else might see that as obnoxious and nosy. 
Or if you're disciplined and a hard worker, someone else might see that as cold or arrogant in a work environment. 
I wouldn't take it too personally. I'm sure if you flipped the script, it would be the same for her. I'm sure she sees herself in ways that you may not agree with also. "
465,esfj,"i have identity confusion in the sense that i feel that i don't 100% relate or identify with other people. i have lots of friends and i'm a social butterfly, but also there's not many people that i can emotionally connect with on a very deep level

466,esfj,"It would be easier not to take it personally, if she hadn’t inflicted psychological damage on me. A portion of that damage was by frequently defining me with negative terms, until my sense of self was entirely broken down. It’s a big can of worms. Fortunately, I know myself much better now. I also have very supportive friends and family to call if she tries to cut me down."
467,esfj,"i def relate to the part about having many friends but not many close friends. do you also have a tendency to make multiple groups of friends and have to split your time between them? for me, i find that sometimes that makes it hard to feel like i totally fit in with any specific group."
468,esfj,"Absolutely! Having more context definitely puts it into perspective. Bad thing for us is we want everyone to like us; good thing for us is we find value in ourselves too - even when others can’t see it. I’m sure for every complaint your mom has, 10 people would say the opposite and love you for those same characteristics that she holds against you"
469,esfj,"totally, i have like 5-6 friendship groups and i split my time with all of them. ideally i'd like to have core friendship group (actually i would say that i do with my uni friends) but i don't feel like they would be my 'best' friends since we're all different people, but the one thing that bonds us is that we lived together and have known each other for a long time"
470,esfj,"Hello, my ESFJ husband is really going through something, and I (ENFP, Female) don’t know what to do to help him. It seems like the ways that I find are helpful for MY depression are making things worse for him. I worry that there is something inherent about my personality that is hurtful to him, and half the time he is not even aware that I am hurting him. He just says “something is bothering me and I don’t know what” when it comes to knowing how he feels. This doesn’t help me grow if I’m doing something unknowingly and hurting him. 
My approach to conflict with him is very direct. I also interpret a lot of things. For example, I might say “maybe you’re feeling depressed because you’re blah blah blah...” in a brain storm like process. He processes internally and at a much slower rate about his feelings. Which is a guy thing, and I think an ESFJ thing. He has a hard time admitting our marriage has problems, but we can’t work on things if he’s using this denial or just avoidance of processing tough emotions. 
Also, I have suggested therapy, but he says it makes him feel like a failure and he wants to try other methods first, like getting hobbies outside of work. So far, he has not picked up said hobbies and makes excuses. He’s really apathetic about many things these days, all signs of depression. He comes home from work and basically just dies on the couch. He says he is more likely to want to try meds (I am on them and he has seen how well they’ve treated my depression). 
My ways of motivating him are not working. I’m so sad and embarrassed to say this, but the things I love about him have been disappearing lately. We used to love traveling together, trying new things, exercising, and laughing. Now when we do something together, he just seems miserable and wants to go home. He gets mad and blows up over small stuff. I almost think he’s going through an identity crisis of sorts. 
Any tips on how to be the best support are appreciated! As an ENFP it is very hard for me to withhold my opinion and tendency to fix and help, but it seems this does not help him at all. Are any of you in a similar spot? What helped you or your relationship? Thanks!! "
471,esfj,"ESFJs need to feel like they are helping someone, and that their efforts to help someone are appreciated and actually helpful. Make sure that you aren’t criticizing him in any of his efforts. 
It’s important that he feels worthwhile aT work too. Keep an ear out for if he feels like he is being criticized in his work, or not appreciated, then it may be time to encourage him to look for other work."
472,esfj,"At this point, you're going to have to try to influence him. You need to find his pain point. It seems like failure is his pain point. If you can convince him failures fail because they only rely on themselves/own ideas, then he'll listen.
You can try these methods:
Tell him the biggest failure is giving up and not trying the best method that will best help your relationship. Then, tell him your xyz friend has gone through therapy and it worked out well for him. The only way to convince an ESFJ is to be slightly salesy. You also might have to pamper him. For example, ""You're so smart, I bet you'd probably think therapy is best for us don't you?"" Something like that. Or more like, drop compliments here and there and suggest therapy moments after. That way you condition him to have a positive response towards therapy.
Yeah, this might be manipulative, but ESFJs are quite dull. They think they're the smartest things in the world-trust me I know. I'm ESFJ, my mom, my dad, and my sister is. I'm also surrounded by ESFJs at work. They are irritating to be around sometimes. Anyways, the only way to get them is to finesse them and catch them off guard to get them to do what's best for them. Or... You can have him stick the way he is now, and he'll never change."
473,esfj,"agreed, it's so hard when that happens because it's so comfortable for us to play the victim and think everything is the absolute worst and that we suck
when we come down with depression, it hits us so hard :("
474,esfj,"I was recently in deep relationship with ESFJ, she have a crushed on me first, but she then fall out of us for a tiny threats. It's suck and I hate her so much. It's hurts me for long times until nows. And she mad and victimized herself, then sheater shown completel sadness through her eyes when I finally get going too.  Wtf is wrong with her.
It's hurts me!!!!  But damn I survived, all alone. "
475,esfj,"Thank you! :) 
You definitely should! It's an expensive sport, but I only have to pay $60 a semester at my university, so I thought it worthwhile to pick up.
I hope to! The Stanford invitational is coming up soon, and I hope that I'll be good enough to participate. If not, I'm content with just watching.  "
476,esfj,"This might just be me, but I almost always prefer talking with people in person over typing stuff out. I feel like when I'm talking with someone face to face I'm less likely to be misunderstood :p idk... anyways, there are a lot more ESFJ's on personality cafe if you'd like to see some in action. :pp In general, I feel like most ESFJ's out there have probably just never heard about MBTI, or don't really care about getting into the details of their personality type. What are your thoughts?"
477,esfj,"Reddit is not really a personally social site, something like facebook would better suit ESFJ's. Where as someone like me (INTP) as far as I know the most introverted of us all, would find redidt more appealing, with the real lack of actual human contact allows us to talk to others without actually talking to others. Thats why the ESFJ sub reddit is relatively quiet, despite the amount of ESFJ's out there. In comparison to the INTP sub reddit, there are more active users, especially in contrast to the amount of INTP's out there."
478,esfj,"Actually, this data is highly inaccurate, because 1) most of the statistics are from the eighties (!!!) up to 21st century, 2) referring to the particular group of people e.g in the USA (!!!), in XYZ high school etc. What about other countries? Different cultures, different upbringing! Imo, now, with our society constantly evolving, I believe that actually the Intuitives are more common. More and more people from younger generations are introverted, spending their time in front of a computer or doing nothing (dreaming, duh). You say there’s so many Sensors out there? I disagree."
479,esfj,"1) What are your biggest fears in a relationship? 
2) my girl is EXTREMELY decisive and never looks back once she has made a decision... we have been together for 2 months and she is already talking about getting engaged and having kids... if I try to slow it down and talk about it, she either accuses me of having doubts, or ""questioning what she wants..."" I can't bring up important topics of convo like this without conflict. So frustrating!
3) my girl wants consistency and a routine/dependable reliable marriage and husband. She always talks about how she wants kids and can't wait to get married.. two things I don't care for at this moment in my life. Is this common among any of you?
4) I'm an ENTP and think more logically. I swear I say atleast one thing every single day that upsets her or offends her, she thinks I am insensitive (which I am), but I am mindful of her feelings--I just don't understand why some things I say upset her. 
I would love to just hear how some of you ESFJ's (particularly females) are in relationships. Even if you don't directly answer those questions, I just want some feedback. Thanks!"
480,esfj,"Regardless of her M-B, if she can't sit down and have a calm conversation with you about what YOU want, and YOUR timelines as well as hers, and yours together as a relationship, I would be concerned about this relationship going anywhere.  2 months and talking marriage is VERY fast in my book, unless you're both over 30.   "
481,esfj,"She sounds unhealthy but I'd say this is common. An ESFJ friend got engaged twice and broke it off before finding the right guy to marry. Having a family is incredibly important to them. As the other commenter said, I'd be very very cautious about continuing the relationship if she's already wanting marriage at this stage. It doesn't sound healthy for either of you."
482,esfj,"Based on her quickness to ignite, coupled with her inability to have real conversations about serious topics, of say that she'd be an unhealthy example and you should carefully examine your future together as it is. ESFJs are very family orientated, but an unhealthy ESFJ could turn it into a sensitive fixation. The same is true with the depths/significance of interpersonal relationships; I would suggest caution before sinking neck deep. Best of luck to you though"
483,esfj,"Very true. She is almost 25 and I'm 23, this is my first serious relationship since highschool, she just got out of a 3 year relationship with a guy who cheated on her and ripped her heart out... this was only a few months ago. Might have something to do with it "
484,esfj,"Each type generally has qualities or focuses that embody that type. For EFSJs the typical focuses you'll find are harmony, family, and relationships. However there are ""unhealthy"" versions of each type where these are still primary focuses, but they can become negatively warped. For example, I am an ESFJ and find a practical significance in strong interpersonal relationships because I enjoy helping others and want to support those whom I am close to which would require a strong relationship to do so better; now an unhealthy ESFJ may still desire strong relationships, but it is now more of a need for things to move quickly and increase in intensity with anything that moves in the opposite direction is unacceptable and starts a fight. While this person may not be ""unhealthy"" in every mbti respect, there does appear to be enough factors that warrant a serious pause. Wanting a commitment is normal, an intensity to the point marriage must be immediately around the corner is warped. Wanting to be close is normal, starting a fight over every hint of a problem is not only counter productive but also warped"
485,esfj,"nah, I didn't mean it to be mean, just cheeky;
i simply meant ESFJ's say nothing on reddit, especially on this ESFJ subreddit... most ESFJ's are out and about chattin it up in the real world rather than hanging out on reddit!  i say this as an ESFJ sitting on reddit right now... stereotypes aren't always true ;)"
486,esfj,"Yep. Me.
I'm 3w2 apparently. I'm bored so i took that ennagram thing and that is what I got from that. Fits me fairly well. Heck, I've been hit with some pretty heavy shit in life but I still manage to get my accomplishments no matter how small they may be to other people. I don't give up and determined in a way when I should have given up a long time ago. "
487,esfj,"edit: 9/30 ESFJs have taken this survey (about 1% of all participants). I need 21 more. Thanks!
Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
488,esfj,"Hi, i am an ESFJ/ESFP (i took the test 2 times and am on the border between J and P), currently working as an organizer of executive education programs for a management school. I like the not-too-stressy aspect of the job, but on the other hand the job content is boring and not challenging at all. I have a master in International Business and one in Business Communication. My first job was as an online Marketing campaign manager for a major online player. the company was very chaotic and i did not feel professionally guided so i decided to leave, but now i am even more bored and feel undervalued at work. 
my question is: what kind of careers do you think i could pursue with my education (+ the fact that i speak 5 languages of which 3 fluently)? 
TL;DR: ESFJ/ESFP with masters in Int. Business and Communications asking for career suggestions."
489,esfj,"Hello. I am both as well and it is so confusing for me! In my previous job and I experienced some of what you talk about. I think the key point is that you are feeling undervalued this is a vital part of the ESFJ. The ESFJ hates routine but the ESFP prefers it,It's difficult being both as it often contradicts itself. I am currently trying to decide what to do as one is very creative and the other is more plan ahead type, quite different. I am an occupational therapist which is covered in both types but think I will pursue my ESFP/creative side. It depends what energises you at this time in your life. "
490,esfj,"Hi Friends,
I just took a myers-briggs test which indicated that i am ESFJ-t. 
I took the test at 16personalities.com
I know this means, my personality is inclined toward
Extrovert, Sensing, Feeling, Judgement 
but 'what does the T' Stand for?
ALSO, does anyone know of a site that can explain what each personality trait means in detail?
Thanks very much!"
491,esfj,"The T stands for ""Turbulent."" It's based on how you handle stress. Turbulent people don't handle stress as well as A or Assertives. (I'm about 99% sure on that)
And I don't have any speciffic website for you other than the one you already took the test on. But I can assure you that after a while, all the different letters start making sense. Just remember there's oposited for each. 
Extrovert-Introvert
Sensing-iNtuitive
Feeling-Thinking
Judging-Perceiving
And not all of those mean exactly what you may think they do. So a quick search like ""What does Judging in Meyer's Briggs mean?"" Will provide lots of interesting info for you. "
492,esfj,"You might want to try looking into the cognitive functions. i personally find 16personalities to be a bit unreliable, since they use the dichotomies (i.e. scales for e/i, s/n, etc.) to type people, which can skew the results based on your mood or feeling (note: i'm not trying to say that you aren't an ESFJ, but just letting you know that you could possibly be mistyped). Two other popular tests that I'd find to be pretty accurate (and some others in the mbti community) are here and here. (The first test's about 60 questions long, the second one's around 50)
I'll leave a few other links below in case if you want to dig a bit deeper:

Other than that, welcome to the mbti community!! have fun & hope you enjoy your stay ;D
~a friendly infp"
493,esfj,"The -T/A thing 16personalities.com does is pretty much a gimmick they use to get people to buy their information. It isn't standard MBTI.
Also, if you are into personality stuff checkout the Big 5 traits. That might give you a better idea of how you tend to deal with stress."
494,esfj,"Thank you very much!
You sound like you know about personality types.
QUESTION: Have you ever read 'the new personality self-portrait' book by Dr. Oldham? 
(He goes into 14 personality styles and the disorders associated with each style)."
495,esfj,"Gotcha, thanks
Just reading up on that 'T' for turbulent. Not good (from my perspective). It seems that T's are driven for success but also have low tolerance for 'stress.' (this sucks). How can you be driven for success yet, have issues with stress (that's not a good combination). 
Sigh.
Any recommendations on how to deal with this (maybe i should start a thread on this topic) ...'T' Turbulent?"
496,esfj,"As an ENTP-T I have so much trouble with my dominant Ne. Combining it with my turbulent trait it can be hazardous in so many situations. E.g. I crashed my car due to aggressive driving... My dominant function is Ne, so I think that my turbulent    personality affects it mostly, so learning how to control your dominant trait may help"
497,esfj,"My boyfriend is an esfj, or at least that is what the MBTI test says. Sometimes I wonder if he has been mistyped, and other times I really see the esfj shining through. My best friend from high school is also an esfj, and when she met my boyfriend, both of them said ""we are like the same people!!"" I laughed at this because I knew they were both the same type. 
The thing that fascinates me, and also sends me into an analytical frenzy is the way that ESFJs can defy their stereotypes. For example, my boyfriend is not super"" traditional "" at all, and neither is my esfj best friend. My bf is not crazy about the idea of having kids, even though he interacts with most of them well. His family is pressuring him to start a family (awkward for both of us since we've only been dating a year), and it makes him really mad, which is surprising because I always read that esfjs are super family oriented. He has even tossed around the idea of moving AWAY from family with me to California. Sometimes I worry that he is giving me lip service and sacrificing his needs just to please me, but then I look at his history. Before we even knew one another, he had moved out of town and away from family on multiple occasions for his work, and has even gotten resentful towards them for pressuring him to stay put.
He also does not gripe at me about cleanliness (I am a slob in comparison to him though). I have read that esfjs tend to be neat freaks, but at home he really isn't. Maybe he uses this energy up at work? Or maybe he's just suppressing his tendencies at home? I don't know. 
Anyways, I am writing the esfj community to see if any of you can relate to how my boyfriend is. Is this common esfj stuff? Perhaps esfjs don't fit into their stereotype? Why do you think they are often thought of as superficial, gossipy, neat freaks? I don't see this at all. Anyways, share your thoughts, yo!!!"
498,esfj,"How is your boyfriend like with his friends and ""Found Family""?  Is that part of his life pretty important?  Maybe it's more about the people he knows love and respect him, and maybe his blood family just isn't?
Also, not sure about cleanliness, but does everything have its place?  Maybe it's more about ""This goes here."" and not ""This is dirty""?  "
499,esfj,"I'm not an ESFJ, but my wife definitely is. She's taken the test multiple times and is a 95% match to the personality which is ridiculous. Anyways I hope this might help. This site has been one of the more accurate ones that I've come across."
500,esfj,"For a year and a half, I (the ENFP) was dating an ESFJ. I broke it off. However, I've been recently reconsidering getting back together. We recently talked about where we failed each other and reflected on what we've learned apart.
PROS: we have absolutely everything in common, like going out on daytrip's, foods, the music we like, holiday celebrations, family, both super super affectionate, love a clean house, etc.., everything in common, even childhood likes and experiences. It is like she dropped from the sky out of a mail order catalog... so much fun. She's also committed to growth and doing whatever it takes to make a relationship work.
CONS: As I have seen on other posts and some sites, she (ESFJ) just can't seem to listen, understand, and connect with my sort of dreamy, artistic ideas, or even just talking about the hard day I've been having. It's like she has to ask 40 questions when I'm just sharing something chill about my day. And the questions sort of seem like an interrogation. Challenging in approach. She is sort of black and white. Also, she is incredibly moody. Hot cold hot cold. I felt like I was walking on eggshells at times because I didn't know who would be walking through the door. And she ""couldn't"" see her behavior. Says she didn't know she was acting that way. It's like I just can't put my finger on it. She saw me as her best friend, but I couldn't see her as my best friend in the end because it just doesn't seem like I could be myself sometimes. After a while I felt like I irritated her with my sort of ENFP artsy, sharing, spaced outness, even though I always just loved to just listen to her. I also felt like I was giving and giving and getting little back emotionally at times.
I know with the cons it sounds ridiculous that I want to get back together, but when times are good, and she's in a good mood, it is the most fantastic relationship in the world. Knockout!!! I'm really struggling over this. It's so hard to know as someone over 40 where we are to compromise in life and work on communication. Your experiences?
Confused. Am I crazy???"
501,esfj,"I absolutely don't think you are crazy! I think gender has a really big role here. Female ESFJs have these tendencies more than males, I think. My (male) ESFJ, really doesn't do the hot/cold thing or ask me 40 questions, BUT I will say that I can relate to not always feeling understood. Sometimes I will have a conversation with him, and he just stares at me and thinks about something, and then moves on to talking about his day!! LOL. He is an internal processor (inferior Ti), so if I say something super logical, he will chew it over and then maybe bring it up the next day and talk about how what I said really helped him at work!! We have the ability to confront one another and ask for our needs to be met, and don't see it as a bad thing that we have to ask. Yes, there are some types Who will understand you more instinctually, but if you can ask for your needs to be met, it definitely can work! 
I also work a pretty serious job (therapist), so I get my needs for deep conversation met pretty regularly. I also try to keep a few friends (including my sister, and other family members) in my inner circle. It helps a lot!"
502,esfj,"My male esfj needs time alone to think! I tend to speak my thoughts out loud...and a lot. He tells me to slow down because I'm going too fast. I've learned to back off until he can come to his conclusions. We both like to cuddle equally, and want to spend equal amounts of time together. Have you taken the love languages test together? It's free online!"
503,esfj,"Many of his friends live out of state. They all get together a few times a year, and their interactions are somewhat superficial now that I think about it. They're good friendships, as in, they respect each other, but it's really just about being goofy. The occasional ""deep"" conversation about inner thoughts and feels comes up...with the help of alcohol. I think he really values these deeper connecting times. I also think he's in search for more genuineness in his life, which is why he says he loves me and makes me feel good. 
As for his family, he says he feels like he doesn't really fit in with them, which baffles me because his mom is an ISFJ. I understand his brother, who is an ESTP. I struggle connecting with this type as well. His step Dad is an ISTJ and very overly concerned with morals. I understand why he doesn't connect well to that either, and possibly that might be why he rejects moralism and tradition. His step dad (unhealthy istj) makes it look unattractive. 
As for cleanliness, you hit the nail on the head. I think he gets annoyed sometimes when I just throw shit about, but honestly it's something we just end up laughing about and I try harder at it, but never get it perfect. We really take joy in our differences, (at least I think anyways) LoL
Thank you for these questions; they helped me sort out some of my thoughts! 
I think the reason I dwell on this topic so much is because he has a hard time voicing things such as this (makes sense with inferior Ti and NO Fi function). For me to feel connected, I want to understand a person fully. I think he wants me to also understand him, but just struggles to voice who he is sometimes. "
504,esfj,"I know it may seem like random, dumb advice, but just in case you don't notice, our types can really hurt an ESFJ, and they will keep their feelings bottled up, b/c they are so infatuated with said personality. I'm an ENTP, and we are similar types, at least IMO.
Sorry if TL;DR, just make sure you take it easy on your ESFJ partner. We tend to do stupid things and they follow us for the ride."
505,esfj,"Oh, I have noticed! I am hyper vigilant about if I have hurt his feelings. I think for now, we are able to talk about it and deal with it pretty well. I actually read him your comment and he said, ""Really?! Normally I agree with these MBTI things, but this one...I don't know about that."" HAHAHA! But yes, I have sensed that what you are saying could become a potential issue in the future. I feel like I never REALLY know how he is feeling; it is strange. He is one of the hardest people for me to read, but I really do try, and I think he really does try to be open and let me ""in"" from time to time. I mean, it makes sense. Fi is not in his functional stack. It's not that he doesn't have feelings, he just experiences them kind of distantly. I am wondering if you know what I mean by this, as it is hard to explain kinda."
506,esfj,"I swear whenever I’m around a bunch of ESFJ women around my age, they always giggle. Why?
I think this is the impression I tend to give around them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Olrp_kRhjJw In other words, nice yet socially/emotionally oblivious/naive and oblivious to my external environment at times (not clumsy but having moments where I get sucked into my head). I presume they think I’m cute? It seems to happen a lot, though.
Then, they see what I’m really like, and they run away screaming. :D They’re correct about me, but they don’t seem to notice the Ti/Ne at first. I think they just see “externally oblivious nice guy” and “pure, childlike innocence”."
507,esfj,"Hi, my ESFJ boyfriend and I (ENFP) are currently in college. He's really easy going, very family oriented, and only gets very emotional over sports and his grades/midterms. It's prime midterm season right now and he's really harsh on himself when he gets stressed. I've tried being optimistic and supportive but I feel like he just brushes my words off. Do yall have any tips for what to do for him? Like show up with food? Or just kind of be there to support him? Thanks in advance :)"
508,esfj,"I’m an enfp female married to an esfj male.
I have learned that they really need to feel that they solve their problems on their own. It is rare that any WORDS I say help my husband. They don’t use Te in the way that we do. I think because of their inferior Ti, they need space to sort things out and resolve stuff on their own! Which thankfully they’re pretty good at doing. I would say practical help like bringing snacks, planning fun times AWAY from school when he can take a break, and helping him clean and study are the best ways to help an ESFJ. They can do all the analytic stuff that we do when calmer. Esfjs are really big on reflecting on past stressors and figuring it out after the fact. My husband needs time to process and cope on his own, THEN when calm he can say “yeah, I really think back then this is what was happening and this is what I learned.” In the moment I think he wants to keep the peace, keep a happy face, cope alone. Ya??"
509,esfj,"Hey, esfj male in college here.  
Lots of BOMB food or other things that make people happy like weed, being with their significant other, going outside AWAY FROM THE STRESSOR.  
That last one is the most important, sometimes removing myself from a situation and coming back to it eases my stress.  
And of course communication"
510,esfj,"I (ENFP male) had a relationship with a ESFJ female. Stress seems like quite a big thing in their lives. My ex couldn't handle stress very well, I believe it played a big part in our break-up. 
The only tip I can give you is making sure they don't forget you during their stressed out moments in life. Don't let them stress to much cause they WILL overdo it!"
511,esfj,"I am dealing with an extremely stressed ESFJ partner at the moment.  We're in a time crunch on a remodel project and he's really feeling the pressure-which for him means nothing else at the moment exists and if he doesn't finish the jobs on time (his timeline, not the necessary timeline) he will have failed in the most inexcusable way.  I literally had to go last night and retrieve him (after he had worked his regular job all day, then 6 more hours after that last night) just so he would eat.  He gets tunnel vision and forgets he still has to take care of his own needs.  I'd be glad to help him with whatever I can (and I will) but he has ZERO patience with me when he's like this and he gets really nasty and rude toward me, which I will not tolerate.  I try to stay out of his hair, but then am accused of not helping.  I'm glad to help, but I won't let him speak to me like I'm an idiot or lose his shit just because I got paint on a pair of sweatpants or I can't keep the lines straight while I'm steaming the carpet.  That's how he gets though-he starts hyper-focusing on things that mean absolutely nothing because he's so overwhelmed.  I don't know how to deal with that other than to just stay away from him because he gets so nasty.  So, that's where I am...when you get a decent answer to your dilemma, please share.  I'd love to be able to be an asset right now, but it just seems all I do is make things worse."
512,esfj,"She's been married to a monster for 25 years of her life and things have been going pretty badly ever since. I am also getting my share of psycho-trauma as I can not talk to my dad without hyperventilating into a plastic bag. I finally made her understand that being too selfless is self destructive and that it is time to be a bit egoistic and leave this hell she has been enduring for ""the sake of her children"" (I have two brother's who seem pretty weak as they can not really speak up for what they think is right). She still lacks the courage to get out of her comfort zone and escape. Or the ability to genuinely not care about anyone. I have prepared a stay for her somewhere and know how to reach her if she goes, but that is exactly the thing I do not know how to""trigger""
TL;DR: Trying to convince my ESFJ mom to leave this verbally abusive relationship with a psychopath and that there is absolutely no hope for him to be ""saved"". // How can I encourage an ESFJ to become more risky / not care about how other's see her."
513,esfj,"SJs are persuaded best via their Si and Fe. You can also trigger their Se. When they have an ""eventually"" attitude, say something like ""Let's go do it right now."" like it's no big deal. INTPs tend to experience something similar. It's why they procrastinate like hell. Se turns ""eventually"" or ""later"" into now. It turns something seemingly big like a person's dream into something that seems like an everyday thing yet is no less enjoyable.
They want to take action, but they're ""scared"" too.
You can also try manipulating the energy in the environment as well as yours and the other person's. That's how we persuade and influence. Learn to recognize and read the energy in the environment, people's bubbles, the energy a person has, etc. You'll notice push and pull mechanisms, speaking power, influence, etc."
514,esfj,"Try and make something other than your father her number one priority. Try framing things in a way that will get her to shift her attention from her husband to someone/something else. If you have something set up for her to go to, give her a DETAILED plan of execution."
515,esfj,"I have absolutely no idea, he seems to have multiple personalities tbh it is so hard to type him. All I can say is that he swears a lot, doesnt mind getting into fights and likes to brag a lot. He also always tries to win arguments with poor excuses and doesnt admit that the other person is right."
516,esfj,"You can read Pitch Anything if you want to learn more about it, although experience is incredibly important. I'd suggest practicing basic meditation and practicing grounding (e.g. grounding yourself to reality and your surroundings, cleaning around you to reduce a feeling of being overwhelmed, etc.). That should help with anxiety and hyperventilation. It's like taking a big, deep relaxed breath, focusing on it and feeling it, doing it repeatedly and not forcing it, leaving a relaxed gap of time between each breath."
517,esfj,"Didn't know meditation helps with hyperventilating. I sadly can not c ontrol it, my body is overwhelmed by it and once I start I can't stop it unless I choke myself pretty much.. do you think I can prevent it completely through meditation aswell? I don't want to go through it again.."
518,esfj,"With enough practice, yes.
There's also another meditation you can practice that boosts confidence, mental clarity, will, and ability to laugh at negatives in life. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMSILdW68zc  If you're non-confrontational or feel uncomfortable when someone comes by (INPs tend to have this problem), then with enough practice (weeks to months at the minimum), you can eventually push through major barriers. Don't care what other people think of you. Why should their opinions matter? Use that fire to focus on what's creating the fire and use the built-up momentum to push even further. Become so intent on doing what's increasing the fire in you (the trigger which can be visualization of an act in front of you or if you're running, at a set location) that you stop caring what they think of you. When you're tired, use that to propel you even further. Use every thing that might pull you back to push ignite that fire even further.
I know it sounds cheesy, but it works very well. If you're an FP, you should be really good at it, given your Fi."
519,esfj,"Oh wait a minute, ESTP's like to brag. Yeah I think he's ESTP. Also ESTP's can develop narcissistic personality disorder. You can call a social worker. Men have no rights anymore. Women have all the rights. The government can probably fuck over your dad very easily & quickly. "
520,esfj,"Man, is that meditation going to be fun for you. There's a reason a lot of fire-themed characters, shonen anime protagonists, and ""hidden potential"" characters tend to be FPs or at least have fiery, laid-back personalities...well besides marketing. You can also check this video out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0L77Fkz-yE&t=140s You should be good at that too. It has TONS of applications including productivity and socializing."
521,esfj,In the beginnings of a relationship with an ISFJ and they always willing to come to anything I invite them to and seem to like me a lot when we spend time alone. But while we are at work together they don’t initiate much and kinda keep to themselves. Again if I initiate they seem willing to go along with whatever. And they also never text me first and havnt invited me out. Although a date that we have planned next week they said they wanted to plan.i Havnt given them much time to invite me out to stuff as I invite them out once every 2 days basically. How do I hold off inviting them out without seeming like I am pulling away now that I have done most of the initiating. Will I come off like I don’t care and scare him from inviting me out?
522,esfj,"I mean I think if you just don't invite them out for like, a week or so and see how that goes you'd be fine. Like, if you keep talking with them and such like everything is fine I'm sure they won't think too negatively of the change in behavior. The other thing to keep in mind too, especially with them being an I personality, is that they might not naturally want to go out and do things. Like, they could love alone time and doing things with you, but it might just not be apart of their personality to just simply do those things on their own. So them not inviting you out might not just be because they don't have interest, but it could be just simply it hasn't crossed their mind? Or they could just be used to you doing it and so just simply wait for you to take lead.
So if you wanted to ""test"" it I think you'd be fine just simply not inviting them out and see if they pick up the slack/ express interest. Like, still plan to go on dates if you want and such but for little things and what not you could wait and see their reaction. If they question why you pulled back you could just say you've been busy the past couple of days or something. 
Edit: So rereading your post, just want to add a couple of things- Just because they don't initiate at work also doesn't really mean they don't have interest- some people just like keeping work and personal life separate. The not texting first thing would bother me too but similarly they might just be used to you doing it at this point. You could also try not initiating conversations for a while and see if they pick it up. Like, don't just stop responding if you're in the middle of one. But if a conversation finishes and hits a lull, you could just wait to see if they start the next subject or something. "
523,esfj,What do you think about when I’ll text him and he’ll never respond to a message. It isn’t a question. Sometimes I’ll make a statement and most people will message me back and say something about it. Sometimes he’ll never respond at all. Like he was sleeping and missed it and didn’t feel like It was relevant anymore is my only guess. It’s so series because he 110% into everything when we’re doing stuff together and will pretty much always say yes to anything I ask him to do. It doesn’t seem like the enthusiasm I have for him is reciprocated. Is that something that happens eventually? I unfortunately get bored of a person if it’s not reciprocated eventually. It feels exhausting to have to do all the work. I don’t want to push him to fast but I also know myself and I don’t want to get bored before the relationship is given it’s best chance. 
524,esfj,"Yeah I mean, the not responding thing would cause me to just not keep the conversation up unless they also put in some effort. I used to try but I find if someone wants to talk to you they will. If not then it's not worth forcing it. If you're looking for a relationship they could also just not be viewing you that way (though if you're going on a date i feel like then that should be pretty clear lol). To be honest, I wouldn't put that much effort into pursuing this unless they also start putting some effort in. It is exhausting to be the one to do all the work and if the other person isn't reciprocating then that's kind of it. Good luck with it all though"
525,esfj,"Why are ""Enegram"" & ""Big 5"" test not as popular as MBTI?
I think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the ""Enegram"" or ""Big 5"" test.
What do you think?"
526,esfj,Well I have 2 best friends who are INFPs and they're the best in the world for me. They really understand me and my emotional tendencies and we can communicate even there are no words said. I really love them. ❤️
527,esfj,"I mean, how would I know, already being an ESFJ? That being said, makes total sense. I am the mom friend. I just want everyone to be happy and feel included and cared about. Also, we need to schedule some free time together."
528,esfj,"My wife is an ESFJ.  I'm an INTP.  She is all heart and she loves her father dearly.  He has stage four cancer and while in the hospital for pneumonia his kidneys failed.  Now they're going to try plasmapheresis.  In his state they're not confident he'll survive the procedure.  Now throw in the fact that we are in Hawaii and he's in Texas.  
I know she is barely holding it together.  I'm doing my best to be strong for her, but real empathy is challenging.  I'll miss him as a friend, but I know his suffering will end if he didn't pull through.
How would y'all want to be supported?  I just want to be as supportive as I can, I guess.  This fucking sucks.  Cancer sucks."
529,esfj,"Hey y'all, ESFJ here. Was wondering if any of you deal with depression and/or anxiety? How do you cope? Is there any way your depression/anxiety gets triggered? 
Recently, I've been feeling terrible. Usually, I cannot emotionally afford to be alone. As of lately, however, my depression/anxiety has taken over my life and, as a result, I've been spending countless days home alone. I know I should do something about my situation, but it gets harder and harder with each day that goes by. "
530,esfj,"Are you lonely because you're depressed or depressed because you're lonely? I've gotten caught up in cycles where the two basically feed into each other.
Although depression and anxiety isn't something you can turn off like an on/off switch I think there are often causes that can be addressed.
In my case, it often has to do with a difficulty in forming new friendships when my social environment changes. I can then turn to online communities to try to fulfill those social needs but it still feels less satisfying than real life interaction. I also need those friendships to help motivate me through difficult or boring work so I'll turn to online communities or other activities that will keep my mind engaged (ex video games) as a form of escapism from my real life commitments and also as a futile attempt to fulfill those social needs because I'm unable to create better alternative means for fulfilling them.
At that point my studies/work related commitments start getting neglected which causes me to be ashamed in those work/school settings and basically avoid people - including people outside those environments like family because I'm afraid they'll ask about work/school and I don't want them to know it's going badly - which just makes the social situation even worse. 
Of course I can't avoid the reality of the situation forever, and in the moments when I realize I'm going to have to face reality the anxiety can get pretty bad. 
I'm still not that good at avoid situations of loneliness, but now that I'm more experienced with those situations I'm at least more aware of how these things can affect me and where it can lead if I'm not careful.
I'm not sure how accurately this describes your situation (I'm INTP not ESFJ) but I'd encourage you to think about what's bothering you, what's driving you to act in certain ways in response to those problems, and where you think that will lead, and where you'd rather be headed instead and what's the best way to get there."
531,esfj,"Hey /u/Rinconnn 
I know this is a month late, and you may take this as poor advice... But I wanted to let you know what works for me as an ESFJ.
I do get random bouts of depression/anxiety, and I find that I get depressed when I don't do anything during the day that I would feel is helping me in the long run. For instance, a day that I hit the gym, or do my laundry/ mow the lawn... Little things... But if I don't do anything constructive I feel TERRIBLE.
I also get anxiety from work. When I am back home I feel like I should still be doing something, or else I'm letting others down.
The answer to these problems for me? Again, you may not be a fan of the answer... But it is Marijuana.
I smoke a little once I am home and know that I am done for the day. It has helped me calm down and enjoy the 'here and now', so to speak. 
Otherwise, just getting out of the house and doing something productive really helps as well. :)"
532,esfj,"I'm an INFP and I struggle with the two my entire life. I have been coping by using meditation, exercise, listening to Abraham Hicks and amino-acid therapy, notably: L-Tryptophan & DL-Phenylalanine.
I feel you though and wish you well."
533,esfj,"everytime im lonely or i feel like people don't like me i become very depressed. At times where i have been socially fulfilled by a wide circle of loving, supportive friends, my depression goes away. i also sometimes experience a little social anxiety when people don't make it obvious that they like me."
534,esfj,"I am INTP and I'm trying to figure out how to save my marriage. I know my wife doesn't feel appreciated or respected by me. I know this isn't true inside my head but I also know that she can perceive my behavior that way. I need help figuring out how to express things to my wife better. I need very specific strategies, statements, expressions, etc to use on a daily basis. I feel trapped by my logical brain and can't seem to come up with anything other than simply saying, ""I love and appreciate you."" I know she feels exhausted by me but I don't know what to do. I feel very stupid and clueless and depressed that I can't make my spouse feel loved and appreciated. I would be grateful for any suggestions or recommendations. I'm worried that I can't save my marriage. "
535,esfj,"I’m an ESFJ and my husband is an INTP. I understand completely the difference in communication styles. One thing that is super helpful for us is knowing each other’s love language. I’ve attached the link below of you’re interested. Knowing each other’s love language is a huge step in being able to make your spouse feel loved. You can then search for examples of things to do for her specific love language if that is something you struggle with. Hope this helps! 
5 love languages  "
536,esfj,"I’m ESFJ and my boyfriend of 3 years is INTP. We used to struggle a lot  with this too. 
Personally, I didn’t feel that it was enough if he just told me that he appreciated or loved me. The action and physical affection must be accompanied by the words! I didn’t mind making first moves, but I couldn’t be the one constantly doing so. Initiate plans with her that you’ve already organized and then just force her into the car to go. Also something simple as hugging or kissing her spontaneously makes a huge difference!"
537,esfj,"I know this sounds weird but make people want to be with you. Be someone of value and someone interesting to be in a relationship.
If you're an INTP, I can hear your inferior Fe all over the post. Turn that cry baby machine off. Trust me. That's going to push her away. 
My advice is have dinners, watch movies, and do stuff together. Don't force things. Let them happen organically. If things happen, it will happen with minimum effort. And don't forget to tease her and kiss her. 
Sometimes, you don't need to say that you love them. Just hold them tight and let them fall asleep in your arms. Don't use Ti. Use Te. Speak without words.
And lastly, don't get riled over this. You'll be an emotional cry baby that she would not want to take care of. Take care of yourself. "
538,esfj,"Hi there, I am an ESFJ female and I once dated an INTP (he told me he had taken it prior to us dating and scored either INTP / INTJ).  Sadly, I broke it off in a little under a year.  There were a lot of minor issues but when I explained to him the reason, I told him as much as I knew he loved me, he didn't give me love in the way I needed it.  I feel like you might be going through a similar situation where in your mind, you know you love her (as did my INTP) but the delivery is getting lost in translation.  I think what made it hard was that in the very beginning of our relationship, he went way above and beyond to win my affection and show he wanted to be with me.  Over time, the real him came out which was more passive and he just didn't show that burning desire anymore.  He couldn't understand how I could break up with him when in his mind he was doing the right things as much as I explained how my emotional and physical needs were not being met.
So back to your question, things you can do.  Spending quality time is key and doing little things to show you care.  Like doing something nice for no reason is always a kind gesture.  Sending sweet text messages and also making her feel very desired sexually.  "
539,esfj,"My boyfriend is ESFJ, and one thing I have learned is that there is never such a thing (with him) as ""too much love"".  As ESFJ he has to have (like the air he breathes) acknowledgement, appreciation and always, always physical affection.  If we're on the couch watching the telly, he has to be touching me, somewhere.  Foot to foot, or elbow to elbow.  It's necessary for him.  So, I feed that animal because I can live with it and I want it to grow.  He takes care of so many things around the house, (for instance, he keeps my car impeccably clean, detailed and shining).  I never fail to thank him specifically for that.  He invested heavily in this relationship from the outset, and I never fail to remind him of how much that means to me, even a year in...I want him to know that I recognize that he isn't like other men, because in his mind, he thinks he isn't like other men.  There is some ego-stroking that has to go down to keep him happy and satisfied, and I'm happy and satisfied (very much so) with him, so I give the man what he needs.  FWIW, I'm INFP, so keeping people happy is naturally a part of who I am.  Does he wear me out?  Yeah, sometimes.  He knows that, though, and when I ask for space, he graciously gives it...although he's probably not liking it while he's doing it.  ESFJ's can come off needy, but really...these guys do so much for everyone all the time.  I can't blame them for wanting the acknowledgement and the props.  I also like the affection so I have no problem giving that to him.  We aren't the ""ideal"" couple, but you know, we both are wired to make it work...so we work it."
540,esfj,"Show her you love her. Do little things for her. And for heaven's sake spend time with her! Quality time is so important to an ESFJ. Have a picnic, visit her at work, have regular dates. All these are very important."
541,esfj,"I went out with an ESFJ yesterday and what I noticed is that she reads body language very well.
Do you find yourself constantly reading people and their motives? What goes through your mind when meeting new people?"
542,esfj,"Body language is probably one of the single most important things when conveying a message to someone. You can tell if they are lying or telling the truth, nervous or confident, etc. It also is essential for portraying yourself.
As a matter of fact, body language is almost the only thing I have to judge someone new.

543,esfj,To those that are grieving a parent first I want to say I am truly sorry for your loss and wish I could take your pain away as I wish I could do for my husband that lost his mother (my mother in law) at the beginning of this year 😞 I have a question. My father in law (ESFP) married to mum for 35 years has moved on really quick. Saying this they were close and did everything together. They were never apart. We found out 3 weeks after mum had passed he was in a relationship. He chose 6 months after to tell his boys and said nothing serious was going to happen after he came back from a month long holiday but with in less of 24 hours of him telling them she (the new girl) plastered it all over facebook. We hadn't even meet her yet. Getting over the shock of that we have seen her twice but even then she is very reserved. Even the first meeting she disappeared for a nap. Now almost coming up a year of mum passing he has told my hubby that he wants to get engaged to her. When my hubby told me this I said is he was crazy. It's your mother's 1st Anniversary of passing and you don't want that surrounding that. He has even asked my hubby if he wants the family portraits that have mum in them from the family home. I don't know what to do or say to my father in law as you can imagine we are quite hurt and gutted by the lack of respect mostly for the boys to be able to grieve for their mother. Any thoughts of how I can approach this with my father in law? We do want dad to be able to move on but the lack of respect for the boys losing their mother is very hard. Also I'm confused with the lack of respect from the new girl too as we know she lost her father back in 2003. Thanks in advance
544,esfj,"could be that this relationship started while mother was still around... Im not sure talking to father in law will resolve anything significant (or the new woman for that matter). it doesnt seem like theres much to do other than to gently/subtly remind them of how the boys are feeling...
I think the best thing you can do is remain available for the boys when they need someone to talk to through their mourning. regardless of how their parent is behaving theyll almost surely get through this difficult time, and will be grateful to know theres other family who are there for them when they need emotional support
this whole situation seems like difficult terrain, but i hope this helps a little. "
545,esfj,"Loss is hard and everyone experiences it in their own unique and individual ways.  Some people expect it, see it coming, prepare for it; others... loss comes as an earth shattering revelation.  While I'm slightly concerned that your father in law may jumping into a new relationship to distract from recent loss, I can not judge because I don't know if he accepted the loss or what feelings there may have been. If you are concerned... share your feelings ... word of caution: be prepared for what you are asking for..."

But I keep running into completely happy couples who defy the stereotypical ""best"" couplings, I decided to see what people's real experiences are so I can let go of letting MBTI defining my relationships or feel there is validity to it.
Also, my bff is an ESFJ and she's gone down the rabbit hole of letting MBTI come into play when choosing a guy so I wanted to get some data on her type too."
551,esfj,"I see. I believe that people of any type can work it out if they exert efforts to understand each other. For me, MBTI does not mean that we will rule out people just because of their type. For me, it is more of a guideline for us to understand other people who are different from us, in order to avoid misunderstandings. MBTI is actually helpful in working it out with other types which are deemed to be incompatible with us, because we now understand how they work. :) But of course the effort to make it work out needs to come from the two parties and they need to meet halfway. :)"

553,esfj,"Thanks for the response.   
My personality is a bizarre combo between the INTJ, the ESTP and the ISFJ. Imagine a color wheel with three colors and then imagine someone constantly shifting between the confluences of two of them. I only ask this question because when I am in INTP-ISFJ I feel approximately 56.0% sentient, and when in ESTP-ISFJ mode I feel approximately 34.56% sentient. When I say ""sentient,"" I refer to consciousness, of course. I literally feel less conscious awareness when I am nearing the ISFJ event horizon. Since ESFJ are probably the type most similar to ISFJs in terms of function stacks, I was wondering what their Sentience Quotient (SQ) would be.   
Schizoid Satrap signing off with a kindly reminder to do your dishes."
554,esfj,"youre acting like sensors don't have intuition in their function stack and that they dont do any self reflection at all. if anyone lives long enough, they will eventually think of something that could resemble intuition while still being an ESFJ or whatnot. it may seem rare in these types, but just because this one person had this one question doesn't mean theyre an INTP. "
555,esfj,"idk, i think of stuff like that constantly and im an INFJ.  how could 1 sentence determine it? although u do have somewhat of a point, hahahah. sounds like something my INTP dad would say. i just dont think an INTP would mistype themselves to be an ESFJ, you know? not even on one of those 16personality type tests (also the sentence under the question is strange. lol dishes? maybe its someone who isnt an esfj challenging them on what they think about)"
556,esfj,"So about a year ago I tested ENFJ, was pretty sure I fit every criteria of the type. Lived it and understood it.
But now after my serious breakup, my thoughts have shifted a little, and I recently retook the test feeling off. I tested as an ESFJ with only 1% judgement over perceiving.
Anyone else had this happen to them? 
Not sure how to deal with it, I feel like I'm back at square one trying to understand myself. Just want to understand how these types differ and what has changed."
557,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ who has frequently tested as ENFJ. I think the reason is I have pretty well-developed Ne and all of those tests look at individual letters rather than functions. Anyway, I have a good friend who's an ENFJ and I've noticed some big differences between her and me. She's always looking at whether everything she's doing fits into her life goals. This is a big Ni trait that I notice in my INTJ dad as well. Everything she does she does for a reason and that's to get herself closer to where she sees herself in 10, 20, or 50 years even. Her goals are often very spiritual/psychological in nature, like achieving self-actualization, but they are super important to her. I don't really have many goals for myself besides being happy. I mean, I have dreams that I hope to achieve some day but I don't think about them constantly and I live much more moment-to-moment than her. She also has her head in the clouds more often, while I'm more practical and down-to-earth. She's a believer while I'm a skeptic. "
558,esfj,"Of all the types, I think ESFJ and ENFJ seem to have the most in common between types, though they're still majorly different. I wouldn't think much should change for you. ENFJs want to take care of people from a long range standpoint and ESFJs want to do the same but practically; day-to-day."
559,esfj,"These are the two types I always test as, so I think it's reasonable to see in other ESFJs. I see them as very similar types. ESFJs are people focused, outspoken, and very in the moment. ENFJs are also people focused, but more restrained with their own thought sharing and are looking at the bigger picture. 
Edit: Here is a nice side by side comparison."
560,esfj,"If I get annoyed with someone for whatever reason, even if it’s a miscommunication or we resolve the issue I always get stuck in being low key annoyed for a while. This is one of the things I hate about myself a lot. I ruminate way too much."
561,esfj,"Yeah, I do too. I almost feel like I can't get over it unless I say something to the person or somehow communicate my frustration and make sure they know it. I don't like the idea of thinking I'm a pushover or someone ""got away with"" something. For example like inviting a friend to something, making sure they're included etc. and then later on seeing they went and did something y'all were talking about doing without you. Another ex, helping them out with work or something and putting a lot of effort in but then when you ask for help not getting the same in return, etc. I'm not sure if those were the situations where you get annoyed, but that's what came to mind."
562,esfj,"Skidoo23, (hello again!) I think this is because you guys are so super-concerned about how others would respond if you did this to them.  You guys have a tendency to walk around in other folks' shoes a lot more than the average person does.  ""How would this make them feel if I did this to them?""  So, when you get annoyed (or hurt, or rejected, or feel shat upon) it only makes sense to me that you would respond in this way-because normally, ESFJ's would not do such a thing to someone.  It's hard for you all to imagine that the rest of the world doesn't feel this way because it comes so naturally to you.  LOL...and yes, my guy does this too.  I tell him he's subtle as a sledgehammer (because it's very obvious to me when it happens)."
563,esfj,"I'd say they think they are walking around in other's shoes. From my experience, each ESFJ responds differently. Sometimes my best friend won't say a thing because she realizes it doesn't matter and if I have a problem with her then I should deal with it. She'll speak up otherwise. My ESFJ co-worker tends to assume my reaction to things 100% wrong. Her idea of me is based on her understanding of ENTJs from MBTI stereotypes and I assume her interactions with her controlling mother which she projects onto most NTJs in our office.  I just think it's past interactions with people and ESFJs like harmony and order."
564,esfj,"I like that you phrased it ""they THINK they are walking around in other's shoes"".  
Yes to this.
My ESFJ has a tendency to color interactions by ""How Would This Make Me Feel"" and that's not always the most accurate measure to use.  Excellent observation!"
565,esfj,"I am curious if others are visual thinkers and can relate to me in the struggle with abstract language and wordplay. 
If I see a word in an unfamiliar context, I often visualize other situations where I've seen the word, or what I think is the most common embodiment of that word. E.g. if I read the word ""sock"", I imagine a sock.
Words which relate to very concrete situations, such as ""sock"", are obviously easy to visualize. Thus, I struggle with words which are more abstract, such as ""system"", ""love"", ""truth"", etc. 
Furthermore, I think this is why I have difficulties with texts where the writer makes a play on words, such as Shakespeare. Shakespeare often times took a creative spin on the definitions, so his work used to confuse the hell out of me. 
Anyways, I hope this isn't too confusing to understand (lol) but yeah curious about your experiences!"
566,esfj,"Yeah I'd have to agree i've always struggled in English classes because I take things at a very literal level. 
""what do you think the author means by this""
 ""exactly what he said"" 
""but can you think of the deeper meaning?""
 ""... what deeper meaning""  
Being able to be hands on with something/ see someone else do it helps me immensely. Or just being able to picture what I'm reading about"
567,esfj,"Funny enough I'm pretty stubborn and so I tend to form opinions pretty easily lmao. I mean, if it's something I don't know about I like to see what professionals say to see if their opinion lines up with mine. But I still have my own opinions and they can change if I'm proven wrong in a definitive way. With movies though in particular I actually have a film degree so I find myself being analytical of movies in general since I know a bit of the behind the scenes work that goes on. So yeah in general I find it pretty easy to form opinions"
568,esfj,Not particularly because I always had opinions on movies and other things even before I was a film major. The only thing now is I have more of an understanding of how things work behind the scenes so I can be more analytical. But even before that I had no trouble deciding on how I feel about things 
569,esfj,"Interesting! I wonder how many ESFJs relate to that. 
I think, for me, if I have a veryyyy strong reaction to something sensory, then I know that I don't like it; i.e. I hate horror movies as they make an uncomfortable experience. Otherwise, especially in my youth, I might initially like a movie, and then get partially influenced by a negative review from a critic or a friend of mine afterwards. I actually met an ENFJ who said they're the same way, funny enough. 
I was kinda relating this to my OP in that I need ""good examples"" of something to feel that I can actually be a critic of it/form an opinion. If someone says ""this is good art"" then I'll analyze the art work and understand what's so likeable about it, and compare other forms of art to this new criteria. Otherwise, without that experience, I feel pretty lost.  "
570,esfj,"Ah I see yeah I mean i also hate horror movies similarly because I don't like the experience. I similarly have issues watching The Office because to me it's too cringey and I can feel the cringe. And yeah I mean, if it's a subject I know less about i'd rely more on critics or friends. Though it's usually more to like, compare notes than inform my actual opinion. So like, for example, I could really like a movie but everyone else could say it's shit. If i were to ever talk about that movie, I'd say ""so while I really like this, most people hate it"" or what not.  
And yeah if it's something I don't know much about having examples would be super important too. I can relate to needing a baseline to compare things though. Like, while I know if i like something or not in order to say something is objectively good I need other examples. My girlfriend is into singing/ operas and plays and such. She'll be practicing singing and I'll think she sounds amazing and she'll be like ""ugh that was so flat/off key/ wrong note/ wahtever"". Or she'll bring me to see a play and she'll be like ""ugh that was amazing"" while to me i'm like ""yeah it's just like any other play"" lmao. So yeah I guess I can form my own opinions whether I like something or not but if I'm trying to speak about something objectively then I'd need other examples to compare things to"
571,esfj,"ok here's the thing. it's so nice that you guys do all these nice things and they look really good on paper and make it hard to get rid of you because you'll just do the next nice thing and confuse us. but when it comes down to it, that connection that comes from truly appreciating the feelings of another, that's what really matters (well to an Fi user anyway). and that's why no matter what you do, pay for my meals and spend lots of time with me, when we tell you our deepest feelings and you just try to change the subject, you can't win me over. i get that you're trying to protect yourself but that's why all that other stuff doesn't matter. and i know what you'll say, you'll say ""i do all these nice things for you and i run rounds making you comfortable"" yeah but what's it all worth if you don't respect my Fi? and that's why that feeling we first get that this person is fake, yes they do genuinely nice things and stress a lot about how to be personable, i'm sure it comes with good intentions, if your'e not willing to be vulnerable with us it was all for nothing. because i can't say you have bad intentions, i know you just want to be liked you're not gonna use me for nefarious purposes - but when you want me to like you so bad, it makes me question - do you even actually like me? you're after that approval so bad you forget about the person it's coming from. you do all these nice things but do you actually really want to? do you see why it could be considered fake?
i honestly wonder how often you guys have these tidal waves, where you spend so much effort doing so much for others only to find that that person wants to leave you and you end up feeling all resentful inside thinking how goddamn ungrateful we are... guess i just wanted to start a dialogue on this because i am already starting to see some cracks forming with my ESFJ...."
572,esfj,"My ESFJ does this not in our relationship, but she does do this with my friends or new acquaintances and I see it turn people off. She will be overly agreeable and some people see right through it. I'm counseling her on being more genuine.
Regardless, she still has that crazy charm. You can't make everyone happy, not everyone will like you. So in the end, she should just play to her strengths and the people who like her will stick around, and those who don't enjoy the gestures will leave. No big deal."
573,esfj,"My bf (INTP) and I (ESFJ) are Christian and I don't think we should have sex before marriage, but my bf has. I asked him if he could go back and change losing his virginity, and if he regretted it.
He said, ""I mean I guess? Yeah?"" And it was so careless like he didn't care. Even if it's not a Christian thing, shouldn't he want me to be his only one, so he should regret having sex with someone else? Is he losing interest? What do I do? I'm shaking.
My friend says he shouldn't regret his past just to show he loves me and I have to accept that he isn't a virgin. But I did! It was a deal breaker but because I love him, I am still dating him! Shouldn't he at least regret not saving himself for me? "
574,esfj,"Hey, I come from a religion where abstinence/purity is the most important thing we learned about growing up, so I assure you I know what the sacrifice is like and how hurtful it may be that you saved your purity for your partner while they were unable to provide that for you. It's a very touchy topic in my church and I know it can be a very difficult obstacle to overcome, for both parties. However, if he didn't grow up with that same value and intention as you did, I do not think it's fair for you to hold that against him. Heck, even if he did, I still do not think it would be fair. I don't think he should have to regret losing his purity in order to prove his love to you. His love to you is what he gives you now, it's not about what he wishes he could take back from his past.
I'm also of the belief that people should not have regrets, but rather learn to accept whatever choices they made in the past, even if they were bad choices. If you want your relationship to work, you need to forgive him. Making him try to regret something he doesn't regret, or just saying those words, will not make the relationship better because that just means you are avoiding taking the responsibility of forgiving him. ""Forgiveness is letting go of the hope that the past can be changed."" If you love him, you'll forgive him.  "
575,esfj,Why would you want him to regret it? He obviously loves you if he's willing to wait for you to have sex again. I think it's really shitty to expect someone to feel guilty for something in their past that they did before they knew you. It changes nothing. I'm honestly not even sure if this is a troll post or not.
576,esfj,"A life full of regret is not an abundant life. I understand where you're coming from, I am saving my virginity until after marriage as well. But to expect a man to go through past events in his minds and be regretful isn't helping. It lowers your frequency and hinders you to grow into a loving, high-chakred person.
Jesus, for example, had a very high frequency - the highest possible, he was one with god. Guilt is one of the lowest frequencies one could have, along with self hatred and the like. It attracts other negative things that are of the same frequency. So wishing your boyfriend to experience guilt is not a good thing, though I understand the disappointment."
577,esfj,"Hi intp here, I just wanted to let the esfjs here know that this was also posted in the intp channel as well. It’s saying something when both esfj and intp both agree with each other on the major points. I’m glad the responses match up. "
578,esfj,"Here's the thing:
You strongly value sex only after marriage. There's nothing wrong with that, and I don't care what others think.
Let's put it a different way- Let's say your partner was not Christian. Let's say he was an Atheist. Or he becomes an Atheist. Something you are dead against.
Would you be able to stay with him? Would, and I quote, ""because I love him"" still be enough?
I am asking these because you have EVERY right to have certain values in a relationship. However, other people may not necessarily comply, and I want you to consider whether this- him having no regrets- is a deal breaker or something you can work through and get over?"
579,esfj,"Hi, you sound like marriage is your biggest dream. Please remember, do not rather hear lies since it's building a castle on the sand. He was honest with you but you are not wrong to feel hurt for receiving a careless reaction. What I want to tell is that you must decide wether or not it's bearable to carry during the lifelong of it. I mean, if after both of you decide to get together, forgiving it and going for it, you throw once in a while he did not save himself for you, that had be mining the relationship since one cannot change past. Maybe he had relationship with someone he thought was the one, maybe not. But if it happened, and he told you, he is being vulnerable to you knowing it's really important to you. He could hide it but he rather keep things transparent. That is the right thing to do. If he lied, you would be entering an illusion and it would hurt way more afterwards, with his discomfort knowing he has done it and it's important to you. If he wants to marry you, that means he finds you are the one. [Edit]  Maybe, try to find counselling from experienced people on church and christian pages on internet too?"
580,esfj,"Not to be a dick, but OP is ESFJ and female. She just wants you to agree with her. If you look at how she poses questions to your answers, she's leading you to agree with her. Inert Ti doing it's thang. Open up your mind young ESFJ. Only then will you find the true answers not your answers. -ESFJ male here."
581,esfj,"What happened had happened and nothing he says will change it. But he's not going to sugar coat it for you. I'd think INTPs want to tell the truth as it is most of the time. They're not prone to people pleasing...
I've met INTPs that did tell me they wished they could have done things differently but I think they also appreciate that their past allows them to arrive to the present. 
I know that it hurts to think he doesn't care as much as you want him to care, but maybe he does and just can't find the right words and actions to make you feel better. Have you spoken to him about it? I think it's alright to tell him how you feel and how you want your feelings to be reciprocated. But it's also important to hear him out too if you're going to have that kind of talk. "
582,esfj,"Ridiculous. Forced abstinence is dumb. Believe me, you want to make sure that your sexually compatible with another person before you commit the rest of your life to them. It just seems like you want to control him and are very jealous. Also, regret is for the birds. The now is all we have!!"
583,esfj,"This is a prime example of the kinds of misunderstandings that an INTP and an ESFJ in a relationship will have. An INTP is very unlikely to see any value to regret except to foster resolve in order to prevent repeating the action again.
For example, I'm an INTP and a few years ago I rear-ended a vehicle because I was following too close under icy conditions. Now when I drive I give more space, to the point that when more aggressive drivers are riding with me they comment that I'm letting too many people space to merge into my lane! I don't regret the accident because it made me a safer driver in the long run.
If I were to try to put myself in your boyfriend's shoes I would probably be at a loss for words when asked a question like you asked him. It's not logical and we value logical consistency in most cases.
That being said, I was raised in a traditional Christian home and I heard many times to ""Save yourself for marriage"" and anecdotes from people that told teens how having sex before marriage would spoil the experience of the first time. It's easy to see how those things are to internalize. With a few decades of reflection I've concluded that these methods of discouraging pre-maritial sex are not healthy and, in my opinion, not Biblical either.
In conclusion, I think your need here is to have your feelings acknowledged by your boyfriend. If that's the case then say something like ""I know my feelings are illogical, but I would appreciate if you listened to what I have to say. I'm not asking you to regret previous actions but I'm looking forward to growing our relationship together from a position of understanding."""
584,esfj,"But he knows that not being a virgin is a deal breaker for me, but I still chose to be with him. Shouldn't he at least say something like ""I learned a lot from it so I don't regret it, but now i just want to be with you.""??? He doesn't even care to make sure I am ok. I cried and told him and he just changed the subject."
585,esfj,"How would he have known he wanted you to be his only one before he met you? It's really unhealthy to expect him to regret living his life. It's like telling someone they should regret going to prom without you before you started dating. It makes zero sense to expect someone to regret having sex with someone else before they knew you. You're acting like he had sex when you guys were dating. It really sounds ridiculous to me that you want him to feel ashamed because he doesn't meet your ""standard"" of being a virgin. If you actually love him you would accept his past experiences, not try to make him feel bad for living his life. "
586,esfj,One of the INTP weaknesses is dealing with emotions. I'm confident that he does care about how you feel but doesn't know what to say because he feels overwhelmed. It's very common for INTPs to shutdown in the face of emotional displays. If you can have a less emotive conversation with him he'll be more relaxed and  be more likely to deal with the issue head-on.
587,esfj,"I'm not saying he has to regret living life, but looking back, doesn't he wish he didn't have sex with her?
I regret going to prom with the guy I went with, because now I wish I could have gone to prom with him. It's not something I can change, but I wish I can. I'm not ashamed, I just wish I could have experienced it with him.
Why can't he feel that way about sex? He can't change it, but if he could, shouldn't he wish he can make it so I will be the only one?"
588,esfj,"No. It's really toxic to look back on past relationships or experiences that were good and regret them simply because your current partner wasn't part of them. Everything you guys have done in you life have lead up to you two meeting and being together. It's really not healthy to expect him to regret his past life experiences. It doesn't mean he loves you less it means he is comfortable with his life experiences, as he should be. The Earth doesn't revolve around you, he's allowed to have good memories that don't include you. If you wish he was in all of your memories that's not healthy."
589,esfj,"Why not? He's my boyfriend, and he's my world. I would do anything for him. I've taken care of him while he's sick, always called him to make sure he's okay, and even gave up time with my sister to spend time with him. I wish he could have been there during my happiest and most memorable moments. I'm not ashamed or trying to erase my past, but that doesn't mean I don't wish they could have been spent with him. Why is it unhealthy to want that?
Shouldn't I mean enough for him at least to make me feel better by saying he regrets not having me as his only one? It's so unnerving that he knows how much sex means to me, and he just brushes it off like it doesn't matter we won't be each other's only one. Shouldn't he put in effort even if he thinks ""well, the sex was good, so I don't regret it"", to say something like ""of course, I wish you can be the only girl I'll be with""?"
590,esfj,So you'd rather he lied to you and told you what you wanted to hear? You guys are on two separate pages as far as what you expect from one another. Just because he doesn't regret his past doesn't mean he doesn't love you. Either accept his stance on it or tell him you'd rather he lied to you about things to make you feel better.
591,esfj,Well of course! If he at least tries to be sweet then it means he loves me and is trying. All girls want to hear sweet words. He just seems like he doesn't care about what is important to me and doesn't love me.
592,esfj,"If he wants to be honest I can understand if he said ""I don't regret it because it's an experience I had, but now i want the rest of my life to be just with you"" or something. But he didn't. He just brushed it off. He doesn't even care to make me feel better about it."
593,esfj,"Okay okay, he didn't care to make you feel better, so feel better by yourself. You are asking him a personal question and making it about you. Get over it. 
If you don't manage to get over this you will have many more disappointments in life to come."
594,esfj,"I love my ESFJ sister, even though we’re super different. She’s my best friend. 
We’ve have long, long term issues in our relationship that cause me a lot of distress and I was hoping you guys could shed some light on what’s going on with her and how I can help make our relationship smoother. 
So basically like, my sister is awesome at small talk, organizing, planning etc....When she gets stressed out or worried she lashes out at me badly. She’ll criticize everything I do in a social situation really obnoxiously, call me autistic/stupid/inept. She’ll try to control everything-then yell at me for not helping enough but I can’t read her mind! 
It seems like when she needs help the most, she becomes the most hostile! 
Maybe it’s my auxiliary FI but even if I intellectually know that she doesn’t mean what she says, it does a number on my self esteem. Part of me will always take what she says to heart. It’s not fair that she makes me cry before a party or a holiday because she insisted on driving and then got lost. 
This is the most problematic dynamic in our relationship, which is for the most part incredible! My mom is an ESFJ and also lashes out at me like this. I guess what I’m curious about from you guys is: 

is lashing out at people close to you a common  ESFJ trait when under stress? 

-Maybe providing some insight into why this happens (for you) might help me understand where she’s coming from. I’d like a little more understanding of what’s going through 
-Any advice on how to communicate with her that: 
im willing to help and hear advice from her, she’s way better at this polite company stuff than me. 
Its 100% unacceptable to call me inept, a waste of space or a child either during or right before social events. It damages my self esteem, it’s not deserved at all and it’s something that will bother me for days to come. 
Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read! Im just hoping to get inside her head a bit so I can see where she’s coming from! "
595,esfj,"Hello! 
I’m an ESFJ and when you mentioned  that your sister lashes out at you under stress... I totally get that and am guilty of it myself! Maybe it’s the fact that Ti is the least used and weakest function, but whenever I’m placed in a highly stressful situation, I automatically assume the worst of everything. As a result, I become highly critical and whatever comes out my mouth has no filter. As you mentioned, your sister lashes out after trying to take the wheel and getting lost. Honestly, it seems like your sister does it with good intentions as you’ve said, but when it doesn’t turn out the way she thought it would, she becomes frustrated at herself, NOT you. You just happened to be the wrong person with her at the wrong time. 
The best way to handle these situations would be to let her vent her steam, she’s probably nervous and ready to break down at this point. Pull off to the side of the road actually. At this point, ASSURE her that she’s got this and 1)help her collect her thoughts and find the right route or 2) offer to drive, but don’t come off as if you’ve been right the whole time. The point is to help her understand and process the situation, not show how incompetent she is.
After you guys have made it safely to your destination and before entering the party, take a moment to talk to her and let her know that you’ve been hurt by her words. Let her know although you appreciate her efforts in planning, organizing and driving, that doesn’t make it alright to be lashing out at you. And finally, let your sister talk it out with you. ESFJs seem to gather their thoughts better by communicating their stressors, needs, etc. We’re a people person and the best to tackle our problems is to talk it out! 
Hope this helps!!!"
596,esfj,"Yes! Suggesting realistic and practical solutions alleviates a lot our stress because that shows you care plus it’s one less burden we have to handle! ESFJs are known to have pretty strong emotional intelligence due to Fe being our primary function, so you probably don’t have to address her feelings as I’m sure she’s aware of them.  Just be make sure to be consistent with any advice/solution you offer because we do notice when people switch up on their words! 
On a side note, I believe that words of affirmation and quality time are ranked as our number one way of receiving/showing affection so assurance along with spending time with people in our lives is a really big deal to us!"
597,esfj,"Hey there! Im so happy you posted this. Im INFP and my sister is ESFJ and I came to this subreddit for the same reason you posted this. My sister tends to be extremely judgmental and lash out at me in front of other people. It has caused a serious strain on our relationship. She embarrasses me and since I’m so incredibly sensitive it cuts me to the core. I don’t have any advice, just here for moral support I guess lol"
598,esfj,"Thanks for this in depth response!!!! 
I definitely feel for her, she’s the sole sensor in a family of NE dom/auxiliary’s and i think that is just stressful in and of itself. 
I’ll practice more on assuring her! I never really understood it as an expression of insecurity-I’ll keep that in mind next time. 
Ok, so instead of like addressing her feelings you’re saying it would be better to be pragmatic but not insulting? Suggesting a solution or helping her make a concrete plan. 
See my approach is to address like her feelings rather than the situation-that could be what’s frustrating her further. 
We did have a productive conversation about it, I messaged her when she was home and she was really receptive but I’m glad to have these strategies to use in the future!!! "
599,esfj,"Dear all
Has anyone here tried a relationship with an ENTJ? I am an ENTJ female and yes, I am aware of the fact that personality types are only the basis and it all depends on the individuals. However, I'm also interested in the theoretical aspect of this.
So far (one month), I've recognized his emotional needs as an area of potential issues, since I cannot really accommodate them in his expected way - I'm not that warm and fuzzy, although most of the times I can read people's emotional needs.
Furthermore, I'm pretty sure he isn't that straightforward with things that are annoying him. He is so accepting of my character, that it gets confusing to me (I still haven't delivered any serious criticism that might hurt his feelings though). Are ESFJs supposed to be like that or is this part of acting his best, since it's the beginning?
I find positive that we are both interested in a long-term relationship and we are willing to put energy to make things work.
Thank you in advance for your feedback."
600,esfj,"ESFJ MALE HERE:
 personally, when I'm in a relationship, I find my emotional needs are high. I don't like to speak up about it though, as it may hurt the other person. I would be aware of his state of mind, and try your best to accommodate. I also follow suit in that I will not often speak out about things that bother me. We tend to accept people for who they are rather quickly. When voicing your criticism, do it gently. I have a tendency to take it as an assault at first, but then think it over and realize it was not meant in that fashion. Just be up front and gentle. Now, these are just how I react, so take the advice at face value for your position. Best of luck, and I hope you both happiness and prosperity."
601,esfj,"ESFJs will always, in almost a brainwashed way, love the character of the person they love - and love the things they love.  It's not fake, and it won't wear off in time - unless you hurt him a lot.  It's all part of the extreme affection and passion and desire to please and bond that ESFJs have.  :-)"
602,esfj,"i am INTJ
and i personally at least think ESFJXINTJ are pairings with an incredibly low success rate. I don't know much about ENTJ though. its the way how ESFJ think about everything in relation on how it makes them feel. they cant put away their feelings when rationalizing. when you hear them talk and their ideas its always related to the person it affects. instead of the idea itself. and its like   they or i speak a totally different language."
603,esfj,"Hey, thanks for your reply. 
Yes, after 5 months that I know this person, I can see what you mean. It's as if the main objective is to maintain harmony and they only allow themselves to feel emotions in this direction. Brainwashed, you nailed it.
Honestly, I had no idea someone can be like that for real. A brave new world for me :)"
604,esfj,"Hi, thanks for your answer. 
It is indeed a different language. Like we come from a different planet. The challenge is to accept it and try to learn from this. Not sure exactly how doable this is though."
605,esfj,"This is a very good question. I don't think he realizes the full scale of this issue. More or less he thinks I'm over-analyzing. Well, at least that's what I think he thinks :) Whenever I try to bring up the subject, he says he just accepts me the way I am. So I'm asking for a logical reaction and I get a feeling one, QED. 
Being the rational here, I would assume it's on me to try to communicate at his level and not the other way around. "
606,esfj,"At least he acepts you the way you are. Wich is a good indicator. Yeah you will be doing most of the hard work. My suggestion is to use their willingness to help. And your own natural entj leadership. You get your own manservant. Just make sure to give him ""feelings, love and their nature as helpers"" because that what they feed on."
607,esfj,"I'm an INFP, and as it is with this type, I have a tendency to become overbearing in relationships. I'm talking with an ESFJ girl who's been my friend for a couple years now, and we both know that we have feelings for each other. We'll finally start hanging out gain once I transfer back to my old college (where she stayed), and I'm worried that I'll put too much pressure on her to start an actual relationship too soon. I'm crazy about her, but I don't want that to come out in the wrong way. So ESFJs (particularly ladies), do you have any specific do's or don't's for me? And INFPs, any tips on how you kept your cool to start a long relationship? "
608,esfj,"I was in a relationship with an ENFJ. I think it's roughly the same as it's probably their Fe they see you through. As INFPs we worry too much about crossing anyones line and become invasive, but we hardly are (generally speaking from my experience.). The way i handled the whole thing was to play it cool. I didn't chase but i let her know that i really enjoyed talking to her... Does that make sense? i don't know. 
Honestly when i really think about it, this probably isn't a situation where you can use types. Some ESFJs/ENFJs want to be chased and some find a reserved and collected person more intriguing. When i was finally in the relationship with that ENFJ, she said that she thought i was trying to be friends and not interested in anything else. I thought i was too obvious and obnoxious to her.
Do whatever you find is appropriate. You should be prepared though. Fe doesn't treat people like we do. Fe is very loving to pretty much everyone and it can be hard to distinguish if you're one of many or a special snowflake in her eyes. Fi almost have a ranking system for who they adore. 
Good luck, it's always a meaningful experience to fall in love or (knock on wood) be rejected. You'll progress!!"
609,esfj,"Hey OP,
ESFJ female here. Don't worry about being overbearing, just be yourself.
I know it's cliche, but if you do share mutual feelings for one another, then this should work out just fine :)
Remember that ESFJs desire to know they are loved and appreciated. If you can show that she is precious to you, then you will have won half the battle :)"
610,esfj,"lets say you were once really close to a person of the opposite gender ( like bff close) and they had feelings for you but you simply didnt reciprocate those feelings, so they were hurt and distanced themselves from you (deleted you from social media, never text you anymore). They hold a grudge against you for not reciprocating those feelings and you feel as if they hate you or have a strong disliking because you rejected them. How would that make you feel? How would you view that person who pushed you away?"
611,esfj,"They stopped talking to you not because they hate you for rejecting them. They did it to save themselves from shame. You feel like someone hates you when they don’t talk to you anymore because you are very tuned to other people’s emotions and it had often been the case in the past. But in this case, I can tell you that this person stopped communicating because interacting with you made them feel ashamed for being rejected. They certainly did not stop communicating deliberately to make you feel bad. 
As to what to do, just communicate your feelings. If they blocked you everywhere, write a letter to their place. Tell them you want to stay as good friends and you didn’t mean to make them feel ashamed. That you have your life and have to make your choices sometimes. That’s all you can do. 
Personally I feel like this person is immature. A mature person will not end a good friendship just because their advance was rejected. But that is for you to find out. I do not know neither you nor that person. My judgement is irrelevant. "
612,esfj,"I would feel really really sad and that a good friendship is wasted. I do not mind if the person needs space first to move on. I will understand that and give the person space and time. However, if the person wants to cut ties with me permanently, I would feel that maybe we do not have that strong of a friendship for this to happen just like that."
613,esfj,"So here are a few things about me:

I am not logical at all.
I have no intution.
I react emotionally.
I take things personally.
I lack tact.
I dont understand emotions yet my reactions are emotional.
I want others to get to the point as I cant process whatever they say.
I am not big of details. Even at work either I cannot grasp the details or they dont interest me.
I cannot process playing games even at work to dating. I dont understand them.
I react vs think.
I like socializing but pick on peoples vibe at times for example if they are they type of person who are passive aggressive I just avoid them or play dumb.
I love fashion.
I am too emotional.
I am too open book where strangers have told me dont be too open.
I make friends easily but my emotions sabotage them.
I take jokes very personally.
I lash out when someone makes fun of me.
I do not get people being sarcastic or bantering. I take it personally.
I want to be myself and at work it is hard since everyone has an angle at corporate america.
I am an Aries.
I get my feelings hurt very very easily.
I take everything very personally.
My family says I am annoying while to me Im just messing with them since they are so quiet.
I prefer women that are logical and details so I dont have to worry about details.

So ESFJ?"
614,esfj,"it sounds like you might need to develop emotional intelligence and social skills. a lot of these qualities don't sound like you're quite as assured as you could be yet
i wouldn't go as far to say you're an ESFJ"
615,esfj,"I dont know what you are, but you seem to have really low self-esteem. 7, 18 and 20 seem to point to inferior Ni, which is an ESFP trait. S are good at details, though, so you might be under-rating some of your core strengths. I think ESFP are more likely to seek help in matters like these in online forums, than ESFJ, who don’t seem to take an interest in these things."
616,esfj,"Tbh idk, I suck at understandimg mbti. My online friends who are well versed with mbti typed me lol. Anyway, jf you put effort into to it, you can easily develope social skills. It's not really something tied to your core being."
617,esfj,"Hi there! 
I'm BlueImagination, and I'm an INTJ (female).
Our faculty has recently hired a new head who has turned out to be one of the coolest, most generous, friendly, sarcasm-whipping, butt-kicking ladies of all time. She also happens to be an ESFJ. Her and I have struck up a pretty neat friendship, and her generosity as a boss-lady and a friend has been overwhelming. I wanted you ask you guys if there was a particular form of ""thank-you"" that really resounds with you? I'm not great at big emotional moments and feel like I'm not getting across how much she's appreciated. Help me out! 
P.S. You're all fantastic. "
618,esfj,"For me personally, a heartfelt thank-you card or something homemade like cookies is awesome. The fact that someone thought of me and went out of their way to do something for me is usually what gets the point across the most. I think that I often forget I exist to people outside of when I am present with them, if that makes any sense. Lol I am ALWAYS thinking about people, even if it's just ""oh, that reminds me of So-and-So,"" but I know that others don't do the same. So something to show that they thought of me in a positive way when I wasn't around is really touching! Sorry if that makes no sense - I'm having a hard time putting what I'm thinking into words today!
P.S. How sweet of you to think of thanking her!"
619,esfj,"Love this question! I wonder if it may be due more to the ""5 Love Languages"" but the way I best receive appreciation is through words of affirmation and physical touch (i.e. hugs, hand on shoulder). If that kind of touch is inappropriate in the workplace then words of affirmation is more than enough for me! I'm fine with edible gifts, but words mean way more to me than a plate of cookies. Again, I don't know if this applies to ESFJ's more broadly or if it depends more on the individual's love languages vs. their MBTI! :)"
620,esfj,"My cousin is an ESFJ and is extremely hardworking in school. Strives for perfect scores and often gets them. Top classes. My current theory is that it stems from her need to please others and meet and exceed the expectations that have been set for her by the community. It's interesting, because a lot of people often underestimate the intelligence of ESFJs but high willpower and work ethic is a trend that defies that stereotype.
Is this common among you all, or could this be a result of her unique upbringing?"
621,esfj,"I had one B during my entire high school career and the rest straight A’s (since 4th grade going all the way back), but my parents were never strict about grades, they just expected that I try; I was smart and wanted to do well, my motivation was my own"
622,esfj,"I'm pretty perfectionistic and part of it is meeting expectations and being impressive to others, or at least avoiding being seen as a failure. But a good part of it is me just wanting to be the best I can be and setting high standards for myself. I don't like to feel like I'm wasting opportunities, so for things like high school and college that only happen once in my life, it's important to take advantage and get the highest grades possible. "
623,esfj,"I've seen this in a few. I think having a family which values education is helpful but generally they strive for good quality work. Compared to me who was always happy to half-arse it because I knew I could do better if I tried, and that was good enough. I'm ENFJ"
624,esfj,"Yup. I really didn't care about school, but aimed to please. Funny enough (as this is an extrinsic motivator only), I ended up doing pretty poorly in high school due to self esteem issues. So I think it only helped for so far, but if I didn't feel like I was getting enough emotional support from the person I'm trying to please (in this case my parents), my work ethic wavers until it nearly drops. "
625,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ, and I generally have good grades for my education system here in Singapore. My parents weren't very strict about my grades, they just wanted me to do my best. I just did well & studied hard because I wanted to be my best. Also partly because I wanted to please my teachers, and exceed the expectations this country set for me, since I am a migrant and they don't really expect me and the people of my race to do well, I suppose. So.. I guess I'm like what you guessed your cousin?"
626,esfj,"omg! I'm an ESFJ and I used to struggle with perfectionism for the longest time (just saying, perfectionism is DIFFERENT from simply aiming for perfection and trying one's best. it's much more extreme than that).
When I went to school in Asia for a while in my secondary school years, they ranked me based on your grades each midterm exams / final exams. I became overly obsessed that I would miss one question and break down and cry... ( if you miss one question, it'll hit ur rank real hard) I aimed for 100s, but getting a 100 didn't make me happy either. To my eyes back then, it was: 100 = good enough, everything else = failure. Yeah. All black or white. I did not have ""tiger parents""; in fact, they were the total opposite.
I'm not THAT extreme anymore, thankfully, and I'm so much better when it comes to embracing my imperfections. This took time to overcome, though. Now, I DO try my best and aim for perfection, but I don't have that extreme perfectionist attitude. I personally know another ESFJ and he's very, very academically driven. near-perfect SAT, perfect GPA, etc. He tries really hard in every other aspect as well."
627,esfj,"Makes sense. My cousin's parents were never academically pushy either, especially not her dad. I think it's partially a leadership thing. That's a common thread that I've observed with ESFJs- really strong initiative and value of leadership"
628,esfj,"I'm in the process of developing a more advanced analysis than the one I provided. It will be based on people global reddit activity and take into account their type. 
If you posted in /r/MBTI and your flair is set, I already got you in my database. Otherwise, please set your flair and post here. My script will find you that way. As a bonus, I will provide everyone that made it into my database their own graph comparing them to other redditors of their type."
629,esfj,"As an ESFJ, I have found that I have a lot of troubles with the casual dating scene. I tend to be very open about my emotions with guys that I'm seeing, and become very insecure when that openness isn't reciprocated which tends to push people away. Anyone else have these same struggles and how did you deal with it?"
630,esfj,"I didn't like casual dating, because it seemed so pointless if I didn't think there was any chance of it developing.  Why should I waste my time having dinner with these people I have no interest in spending long-term time with?  But in the end, I had to think of casual dating as learning about what I wanted, so when I did find that long-term one, I would recognize it faster.  "
631,esfj,"Yeah, I feel like that is exactly what I struggle with. Like everyone that I go out with I would like to form a legitimate connection with, whether that be a relationship or friendship. Maybe I'm just too open about that though?"
632,esfj,"I went to school for a long time, so it’s not been until about 3 years ago that I started to learn about developing a workplace identity. That said, I’m not good at having multiple identities. I am outgoing, often overly so, honest and selfless, to the point I don’t advocate for myself, and I care for others’ feelings and experiences, perhaps too much. Any other ESFJs relate? I feel so damn foolish sometimes. I have been emotional in the workplace, but worse than that... I am not a strategic thinker. I’m just not wired to say or do things in such a way to get a result that benefits me. I’m seeing this hurt my professional identity. I am now seeing a coworker strategically place herself in positions to step over and around me, in hopes of advancement. She showcases her own accomplishments and never anyone else’s. I always share the limelight because it’s my nature. She will manipulate opportunities and credit when management is paying attention so she looks good, but who she actually is and what she does is not that person. I’m now afraid that she will advance before me (though I’ve been there longer) because she is a strategist. I also feel foolish for being so... naive, by nature. Any other ESFJs struggle with this? I wish I were able to see things for more than what they appear and think ahead and manipulate resources and situations to my benefit, but it’s so unnatural to me! Feeling really defeated about this right now. I know I have great qualities. You can trust me with your life, I am caring and generous and fair... but what does any of this matter in the workplace?! Thanks, in advance.
Haters are kindly asked to keep comments to themselves. Thank you."
633,esfj,"Here’s my advice:
Dont worry about what your coworker does. 
Make sure to keep your manager updated on all your contributions and accomplishments. And make sure he knows you want a promotion. 
Update your resume every year with all your contributions and accomplishments 
When a position opens up at your company that you want make sure to tell the hiring manager that you want it or just apply for it
Dont wait for your current company to promote you, look for a new job (a step above your current position) at a different company. post your resume and contact headhunters to help search for you. You will likely get paid more by switching jobs vs being promoted within. 
Source: intj that has been a manager/director at a large corporation for 17yrs. "
634,esfj,"This is really helpful! Thank you! I’ve been rolling this around in my head a bit, but, again, it’s counterintuitive to me. 
I reminded myself many times today and I am responsible for me and I’m doing a great job. Also, I was thinking I would ask my manager how to update her on positive feedback from constituents when it comes straight to me. I get a lot of it and I want to be recognized for doing what I’m hired to do and doing it well.
I’ll admit, I struggle with seeing others cut corners to get ahead, but again... I need to focus on me. I’m not willing to do that. I want to key my manager in on my approach to my work - that I am thorough and dependable. Not a grandstander. I’m not one to hoard credit, even when I’m due. In comparison, it may seem like I’m not as productive, when I am. It’s just that those I’m compared to will never recognize others’ contributions and will take opportunities to boast... and I do the opposite. Is it appropriate to have that conversation or does it point to my concern of others/ a comparison?
Do you compare employees? How easy is it to see through the crap some employees do to be “seen”? The perspective is so different from an employee standpoint versus management!"
635,esfj,"I'll ask you this then...
Would you be okay with compromising your values to get to where they are?
If the answer is no, then maybe you just have to be okay with where you are.
As they say, in a chopped up non-verbatim-way, winners do what others won't.
Or...
Get the higher ups to like you, but don't be a kiss ass."
636,esfj,"At your next one on one meeting with your manager just tell them all the good work you’re doing (with specific examples) and tell him them you want more responsibility and want to advance. Alot of staff are happy in their current role so the mgr wont know you want to advance unless you tell them. Dont compare yourself to others but if you do see people cutting corners that jeopordizes the work product you should let him know that with specific examples and the mgr can decide if its serious or not. 
I dont compare employees but i do try to learn who is more skilled in various areas so i know the best person to assign to different projects/tasks. 
But all workplaces have some political element to it so you need to play the game to some degree. Personality and attitude is important too...not just skill and work habits. Just make an effort to be friendly with all the managers and you should be fine. And treat everyone with respect because sometimes coworkers get promoted to mgmt and if you treated them badly they will remember it and might make you’re life more difficult. "
637,esfj,"Management likes me. I am very well-regarded not only in my my immediate office, but by HR, and even our parent organization. I have a positive reputation, for sure. 
Am I willing to compromise values? No, because they are who I am. I can’t live my life fighting who I am, but is there a way to train myself to be a “more ambitious” employee without being a phony or manipulative AND commit to my responsibilities? This is where I struggle...
Has anyone successfully navigated this struggle?"
638,esfj,"Hey, mrMiyagisChoad, just a quick heads-up:
alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
639,esfj,"a way to train yourself to commit to your responsibilities?
This sounds inconsistent with what you're portraying? It seems like you're a hardworker that holds yourself accountable, but judging by that sentence, I'm now lost."
640,esfj,"Apologies for being unclear. How can I advance while committing to my core responsibilities? When I look around, those who I’ve seen advance have shirked core responsibilities in some way - cut corners, figured out a loop hole, do sub-par work, and/or have been disingenuous (brown nosing etc) to get ahead. 
In the past, I have told my manager out of frustration about not having opportunity ... “of course X person has been able to showcase his skillset in these other areas, he doesn’t complete base requirements, he cuts corners” ... when you do that, you are making time to showcase your skillset in other areas, right? Same with the other coworker, she does a half-ass job when she is on a team, but when she leads a project she brown noses and talks a big game to management and whatnot. It’s strategic. I’m not cut like that. If I do a job, I do it 100% and credit is not a factor. How do I get ahead while also meeting base requirements? Is this explanation clearer? 
On another note, is competition an underlying factor? I’m the least competitive person there is. Perhaps another ESFJ trait. I want everyone to win and be happy and get credit they are due. Ultimately, though, if there’s one opportunity for advancement and 6 viable candidates, the one who does as mentioned above - cuts corners or manipulates their image - gets the spot. When someone like me who is fully capable AND is a dedicated and high quality employee, gets passed up because I don’t engage in the crap... do I have to be “strategic” to compete? And does being strategic mean engaging in the politics and undercutting? "
641,esfj,"I guess it's how you look at it.
As far as I'm concerned, fuck them. You need to outshine them by displaying your strengths and make yourself known. It's no different than creating a resume. If you apply for a job, and it lists qualifications, then you would write all the things you've done that meets those qualifications, correct?
So it's no different with your managers. They oversee a shitload of people and do a shitload of work. They don't have time to pet everyone's head and examine everyone's work. They're looking for something, and that's up to you to find out. It's also up to you to make it known to them as well. Also, never be afraid to ask for what you want. You can never receive if you never ask.
I hope you don't get confused by my shitty analogy lol.
If you want to learn the wicked ways of power, so you can defend yourself, or... at some point, apply, read 48 Laws of Power.
Now, if you want to live life like it's all sunshine and rainbows, read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie.
Or both... because why not?
--Fellow ESFJ"
642,esfj,"I've seen a few folks talk about music here and I have seen this as a common topic across many MBTI subreddits. So I made a subreddit -
I envy you ESFJs. You are talented in ways I can't even dream of being. Take this guy for example. 
Sure there are terrible examples ... but also awesome ones. Here's few of my favorites

Blue - One love
Hoobastank - The Reason
Justin Timberlake - Rock Your Body
Dua Lipa

What can I say Hot ! Hot !
I think each type is instinctively drawn to listen to its own type's music but I could be wrong. Feel free to post tunes here -"
643,esfj,"I can somehow relate. I am an introvert but I am also outgoing.
And I also know an ESFJ like that. He is nice but can be very frank (borderline tactless) when the situation calls for it. He has 51% S and 51% F though, so that probably plays a huge part."
644,esfj,"Well yeah, sure. What i mean is one can be one of the most socially generally extraverted types yet while being quiet. Nonetheless this doesn't answer your question. What functions does he use? I know you might hear this a lot, but tests are inaccurate. The best way is reading up on the cognitive functions"
645,esfj,"Hello all (if there is any people left here ?). I'm a fellow xSFJ, and I did a bit of research about MBTI types and RPG roles in video games, and wanted to know what is your favourite role in RPG's, why and how do you think it relates to your type ?"
646,esfj,"My favorite RPG style game is Fallout New Vegas and while I’ve played through it 3 times now, each time being different, I generally follow the guidelines of siding with the good guys in an up front kind of way.  No real sneaking around and making my presence felt.   Also, in relating to being an ESFJ, I think my constant desire to have a follower and never wandering the wasteland without a buddy by my side shows my love for being with others"
647,esfj,"In a lot of games with different types of classes I tend to go healer or anything that involves machinery (So like, the mechromancer from Borderlands 2). But I feel like the healer aspect or wanting to help out the team probably comes from Personality Type"
648,esfj,"I have problem with my best friend. She is ESFJ, that's why I'm asking you for help.
We're friends for 3,5 year. From the beggining BFFs. We were spending every hour with each other, messaging or talking.
At the end of last year I moved to another country. We haven't meet since that. We're still messaging all days.
But about a week ago something changed.
We spend less and less time together. She gives all her energy, heart and soul to fanpage of one youtuber. 
She's my only friend. I'm afraid that our frendship can die in few months.
I'm maybe addicted to her. I don't really know. 
But I'm sure I can't tell her how I feel. It would hurt her and she would blame herself.
Maybe almost everyone would make new friends and let her go, but I'm too shy. If I lose her, I will be alone.
What should I do to save our friendship?"
649,esfj,"Hey, it's okay. You don't have to be with each other talking to each other every single day. Imagine doing that when you are adults, married.You can still maintain your friendship by communicating less frequently.This change..try and see it.. maybe it is a blessing in disguise? Now you have more time for others. Your family members, a friend or two maybe? Now I know you said that you are shy but let me tell you this. Everyone is strong enough naturally and I want you to know that eventually you are gonna have to put yourself out there with other people to make friends. These does seem scary but it is fun and worth it. You can still be friends with her but now you can accommodate other people in your life too. Being addicted to her seems a little unhealthy, no? Like being addicted to drugs, to games, to smoking. Relax, the circumstances have changed now but it's probably for the better. Be strong! "
650,esfj,"You know it's funny because I've been in a similar situation and I'm the ESFJ. There was this one girl I knew and we were friends for probably close to 3 to 4 years. She lived a couple of states away so I never really saw her that much. I had a really big crush on her, but it was evident she didn't feel the same way towards me. At times I even questioned whether I was much of a friend to her since when she would get a bf she would stop talking with me. I would fret about when it took her more than a day to get back to me because I took it as a sign that I had screwed up somehow. I actually told her I didn't want to be friends anymore and tried to forget about her, only to try and reconnect about a year later. I too was lonely. I missed having someone who I was as close to as her. The friendship this time around didn't last more than a year. This time though, we kind of both just stopped talking to each other. She was pretty mad towards me about something last we spoke but since then neither of us have really talked to each other. 
Now though, I've met  someone who also lives a couple of states away and is a lot worse at texting actually (it sometimes takes her 3-4 days to get back to me). And even though I fret that she is losing interest, I have to keep in mind she's just busy. But I really enjoy talking with her more than I had the other friend within the past couple of months of our friendship, even though we talk less frequently.
I guess what I'm trying to say I don't know if there is anything you can really do based on personality types. Friendship is a two way street and if someone doesn't want to be friends then there's not much you can do. You could always talk to your friend and see what they think? I know I always appreciate it when someone is straight forward with me (but again, idk if that has to do with personality types)
TLDR: Knew a girl who lived far away. Talked everyday, friendship fell apart. Now talk to a girl who I talk to less frequently, friendship in a better place. Try talking with your friend directly maybe, or try and move on. It's not worth the effort trying to make something work where the other part isn't interested.
PS: Another option is you don't even have to go as extreme as I did and call the friendship off. You could just only respond when they respond to you while looking for other friends. That way you're still friends and if they ever realized they miss talking with you they could always start talking with you more
Edit: And I know it's easier said than done with just ending a friendship, and trust me it hurt like hell when I called it off with the first person, which is why the second time around I just let things die out. I hate it when I'm on bad terms with anyone. A way maybe to make more friends would be join a sports club in your town? Or another club that has a hobby you're interested in. The less dependent you are on one person the easier it is to move on. If you decide to move on, I know something that helped me was I stopped following her on Instagram, Snapchat, etc. Out of sight out of mind mentality. You could also check out subreddits like /r/r4r if you want to find someone to talk with."
651,esfj,"Are you INFJ?
It sounds like you are far too attached to this ESFJ.  I had an INFJ friend like that, and it was bad news.  As much as it hurt, I finally had to just get some space.
It could be she feels like you two are bad for each other and is trying to create healthy boundaries.  I'd be very real and open and just talk to her about it.  Try to create a happy middle ground."
652,esfj,Tell her how you feel about the situation. She probably is backing away to see were she stands with you. Thats what I do. We are people of closure. We tend to see if that person we're backing away from will make a effort for us. To see if we are wanted still or Worth it.
653,esfj,"Thanks. I'll try that. 
But there would be problem with clubs in my city. I live in Germany and I don't speak german. 
My friendship is so funny because me and my friend are totally different. Even in MBTI we have all letters different: ESFJ and INTP. 
Maybe I'm hypersensitive about friendship and about attention. I'll give her more ""free time"" and see how it works.
Thanks a lot."
654,esfj,"there was a question in the intp sub asking
so, what do you think? 
Do you feel you benefit from this supposed preference?
And do you feel such a preference negatively impact women of other types? 
Or is it just insulting and divisive passively aggressively attacking ESFJ women for inborn traits and simply being a larger majority than say intp women?"
655,esfj,"I recently had a coworker take the test who is an INTP. We get along great but we are polar opposites, and sometimes it leads to mild clashes.
We work in finance so she's very direct and a leader, whereas I'm the bubbly friendly one. I think it bothers her that I'm buddy buddy with everyone, but I also notice that I have to work harder to prove myself because I have the typical ""airhead"" qualities. 
While she was taking her personality test there was a question that made her pause. ""Would you rather your child grow up to be kind or smart?"" When I answered I picked kind because I value that. Hers was smart. We discussed the pros and cons of both. 
If you're kind, people are more patient and understanding and willing to teach you. If you're smart but an asshole, people are more likely to get their back up when you present a thought or idea, because it comes off aggressively. That being said, an INTPs suggestion seems to hold more weight because they typically are really confident in their skills whereas an ESFJ is more laid back and accommodating with their ideas.
I definitely think the context of the personalities is key - work or socially. INTP would be more of a boss figure and a go-to leader for knowledge, but an ESFJ would have the social upper hand and be more approachable in most areas.
And as the saying goes, it's not what you know but who you know. "
656,esfj,"I think preference would be the wrong term. People prefer people who make them feel good about themselves. ESFJ's make people feel important, valued, listened to. They don't do it consciously, it just comes from within. So, if we are preferred, it's people's innate need to be accepted and validated that gives us this perceived preference.  "
657,esfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/intp] Are ESFJ women more privileged? • /r/ESFJ

^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)
"
658,esfj,"Kind or smart. We had the same debate with ENFJ friend. He claimed kind, because smart and asshole, you're still an asshole. I claimed smart because kind and dumb, you will be played on if you don't have someone to protect you, but even this way, you're not independent. But we were agreeing on one point. If he's kind and dumb, at least he can be the ignorant kind of happy, whereas smart and asshole, you better be happy of yourself, because else, depression."
659,esfj,"so do you believe its a privilege?
and does their popularity negatively impact you?
if it does, in which ways are you affected by ESFJ women's popularity?
And what should they or the rest of us do about it?"
660,esfj,"You really need to get of of your ideology/cult-mindset of radical feminism. It completely twists your worldview to a bitter and hateful one, which makes it seem justified to dehumanize and view as bigoted anyone who doesn't say the 'right' 'progressive' things. If you are looking for bigotry everywhere, confirmation bias will lead to you seeing it everywhere, when its not actually everywhere. You'd be much happier if you abandoned your ideology. All those family and freinds who seemingly turned away from you or against you, consider that actually, you drove them off by trying to shove your ideology down their throats. "

662,esfj,"Those aren't to be taken too seriously. The fuck marry kill thing is totally harmless.
Its actually the 'call out' culture thats toxic. Its better to judge people more charitably, rather than reading the worst possible motivations and beliefs possible into what people say, and trying to demonize them for not saying or doing things as you'd like.
Really?!
You can't assume all intps become necessarily hateful towards a certain type if not well developed. 
It was more of an intelligent guess, keeping mind the pattern and tendency I have already noticed. I suppose I could be wrong. But keep in mind that you did actually come across somewhat like a feminazi. If you are not one, its worth considering that it might be a good idea to not come across as one."

664,esfj,"I'm an ENFP, and I'm pretty close to an INFP. One of my best friends is an INFP, and we are literally on the same wavelength 24/7. We find the same things weird, amusing, stupid, and we even react similarly to different situations. The only difference is that I wear all my thoughts and desires on my sleeve, and she keeps everything to herself. It's hard to get her to open up to people, and she resorts to putting on a front to people she doesn't immediately trust. She's quick to make judgments and jump to conclusions about people and situations, and I sometimes have to remind her that she should give some people another chance before saying ""He's/she's weird."" But she's bubbly, creative, theatrical, kind, caring, spontaneous, compassionate, and a really amazing friend. "
665,esfj,"I'm an INFP, and my boyfriend and best friend are both ESFJ's. 
The good: They bring me down to earth when I get in my own head too much. They're always ready for me when I finally feel like socializing. They love to feed me!
The bad: The Fe vs Fi struggle is real! It's more so with my boyfriend than my best friend, but he doesn't understand that ""because it's who I am"" is a valid reason to do something or not to do something. 
The ugly: ESFJ's are quite stubborn! When the two of them disagree, it can get loud! (They were friends before I met either of them.)"
666,esfj,"INFP and ESFJ are said to be in ""relations of mirage"" in socionics. For further info see:  
ESFJ type matches 
INFP type matches"
667,esfj,"Your parent probably doesn't get it that you actually do feel better when you're off at the Fortress of Solitude (what you call it).  They're probably trying to figure out if they did something to make you flee to what they see as your ""Island of Loneliness and Isolation"".  My boyfriend's son is INTP.  He absolutely doesn't understand him, probably 70% of the time.  He tries to understand him and often he imposes his own emotions about situations his son may (or may not) be in, whereas his son is completely non-plussed and for the most part unaffected.  Things that would shatter BF really don't affect DS the same way.  DS is also very ""dreamy"" or as I like to put it, ""in his own headspace"".  This often drives BF nuts, because he likes a fast response to his questions and a fast response to his requests.  ""Could you come hold this bracket for me while I screw it into the wall?""  seems like a pretty simple request.  DS will literally take five minutes to walk over to the wall and then stare at the wall and say to BF, ""What's a bracket?""  This makes the BF just fly off the handle.  But honestly, DS probably didn't know there was such a thing as a bracket because in his Sci-Fi/Fantasy novella he's writing in his head it's referred to as a quorm.  This is what happens with them.  I am INFP.  I don't answer questions off the cuff for anyone.  That's just not something INFP's do.  We have to mull over our words, making sure we choose them carefully, judiciously, so they'll express in the most lovely and cohesive way the answer to whatever we've been asked.  This makes the ESFJ want to explode.  The answer should be right on the tip of the tongue.  Just let your words fly...except for me, just letting words fly out of my mouth normally results in misunderstandings or I end up looking really dumb.  I can't abide either outcome, so, we have developed a rule.  When he asks me something and he's expecting a swift answer, I hold up my index finger and say, ""Please give me minute.""  Otherwise he feels I'm ignoring him, acting rudely and basically giving him the cold shoulder...which for an ESFJ is just God-awful.  Mr ESFJ also has a tendency to forget that not everyone carries with them his knowledge of how things get done (remember the bracket referred to earlier).  So, when he is explaining how the shelving system is going to work and very quickly goes through the steps that we're going to need to follow to get it anchored to the wall safely and in an aesthetically pleasing way, he forgets that while he may be done explaining what he's going to do, Ms INFP me is still digesting step #3.  So, here's what I'm trying to say:  ESFJ's often see INFP's as slow (sometimes lazy), dingy/ditzy, rude, dismissive, selfish, and sometimes even cold.  Because INFP's do have to digest things, dissect things, and mull them over, this runs counter to the ESFJ penchant for jumping in with both feet, no matter what may lie under the water's surface.  While we are trying to connect the dots on how a process will flow, they're already putting the process into action and we're ""just standing there"" trying to see every facet of it.  When we're lost in our own headspace trying to keep everyone happy and balanced, including ourselves, they're tapping us on the shoulder saying, ""Why won't you just talk to me?  You're shutting me out!""  However...in defense of the ESFJ, they are also the ones coming to the INFP saying, ""Tell me what you think of this person/situation/problem.  You have the best insight and read people so well.""  They like having us as sounding boards and fact-checkers.  And they almost always will take our advice because they know it's solid.  "
668,esfj,"That pretty much surmises an INFP-ESFJ relationship. I dated an INFP for five years and you hit the nail on the head. I wish I had known all of this beforehand because I just didn’t understand why he wouldn’t make any changes and felt like he was flat out stubborn and refused to work on our issues. Now it just makes me sad and feel like maybe I should’ve worked harder with him and just accepted him for who he was because he wasn’t trying to be difficult. If you don’t mind my asking, how do you make it work with your ESFJ? I want to figure out how to be more understanding and how I couldn’t made it work. "
669,esfj,"I made a project of him, for lack of a better way to put it.  (And I mean it in the kindest, most loving way).  I studied him in depth, watched him, listened to him and he wasn't even aware I was doing this.   When I figured out what made him tick, I started making chit-chat with him, joking around about co-workers and asking small-talk questions, ""What did you do this weekend?""  ""How did you like the concert you said you were going to?""  And then I got in his head:  He arrived to work late one morning (which he never, ever does and it is tantamount to a cardinal sin, as far as he is concerned.  He's worked here for nearly 19 years and never been late, save that one day) and he was a mess!  It threw him so far off his normal schedule, he was obviously distressed.  A co-worker asked him why he was so scattered and he replied, ""I just have way too much going on.  I didn't even get here on time, and you know that never happens.""  He was flabbergasted, standing out side of my office and in a huff.  I slipped behind him and quietly said, ""You haven't been okay for weeks.  I can even tell by the way you're carrying yourself.  Your shoulders are slumped, you're scatter-brained.  Whatever the stress is, you're not carrying it well at all.""  Now I said this so that he was the only one who heard.  He turned and looked at me and I knew at that moment I had his full attention...because ESFJ's take care of everyone and everything else and just assume that they can deal with the load they willingly carry.  Self-care is not their strongest trait (at all).  I knew this because I studied his type, and I knew he needed to hear someone say, sincerely ""I see what is going on with you.  I'm concerned.  You can come to me if you need to.""  From that day forward, he couldn't stay away from me, because I had taken time to truly care about what was going on with him.  I let him talk about his burdens and his troubles (which really were minor, he just had linked himself to people who weren't concerned about his well-being and he knew that, but couldn't accept it...so ESFJ!)  This interaction set the stage for our whole relationship.  I found out what he needed, and gave him that-before he even asked for or mentioned it.  There were times I stepped in probably before he even realized that he needed or wanted it-and we've been together now for over a year.  As far as how he treats me, well I am INFP, but I have had to deal with some hard-nosed, insensitive pricks in my time.  I know how to stand up for myself and ask for what I need.  That doesn't mean I always do it, but with him I know that I have to be very straightforward and not hint at things.  If I want a night out with him alone, I tell him so.  If I need time alone (which I do exponentially more than he does) then I tell him so-and I remind him that it's not because I'm not all-in with the relationship or that my feelings for him are wavering;  I NEED time alone so that I can manage his high-maintenance needs (LOL...he knows this about himself, and actually told me this before we got serious).  So, at least once a week, I venture off alone to do nothing and feel no guilt about it-well, minimal guilt about it.  I know it's what I need and he knows it too, but it's still tough for him to understand.  He's just not at all wired that way.   I think for us, for me at least-the key to making this work is that we genuinely like each other-we were good friends before we dated.  Also, there has to be a willingness on both sides to accept and embrace the other person as they are.  He would love it if I got to work 20 minutes early every day (he does this and I have NO idea why) but that's probably never, ever going to happen.  Five minutes, sure, but not 20.  He would also love it if the wheels in my brain would spin faster and keep up with his frenetic pace of thinking and speaking.  Again-probably not a realistic expectation.  Now, he could hate me for not being like him, and I'm all about compatibility and commonality within a relationship.  You have to have that between you and the deeper those levels go, the better.  Here is my thing with him:  he is probably the most generous, conscientious, caring and loving person I've ever had the pleasure of knowing.  He is a giver, and though at times that giving can wear him out, he tries so hard to make the people around him happy and make their day better.  How can you hate someone for being that way?  I can't.  Now, his rigidity and his reticence to change for no better reason than, ""I have always done xyz on Tuesdays.  I don't plan on changing that."", that can send me on a verbal rant that...well it ain't good.  That crap will make you crazy; but again, I recognize we are very different people and I can either resent those differences or try my best to work with those differences.  He's worth the work, and apparently so am I.  We're worth the investment to each other. "
670,esfj,"oh dear. Allow me to express my displeasure. On top of that, it seems your post hasn't exactly warranted popularity, as you have now triggered a defensive response from the party you have accused of holding some rancorous disposition. Please reconsider yourself next time, and perhaps one could reconcile the embarassment through other means."
671,esfj,"The reason I don't believe in mbti theory any more is because I know too many people that identify as ESFJ and they're all so different...some of them I truly cannot stand and some of them I really like.  That's the problem with theory....it isn't fact. 
The reason intuitives don't like you (from an ENFJ perspective) is that some ESFJ like to control people, constantly seek attention and affirmation, resort to manipulation, and are way too caught up in outward appearance of how their life looks to other people. They want the admiration of others. ESFJ can be straight up nuts and most of the ones I know have falling outs with so many people in their life and it doesn't surprise me honestly.  BUT then...some of the esfj I know are so sweet, so, I don't know what to make of ESFJ type any more. "
672,esfj,"lmao I feel kinda bad that you haven't yet been enlightened by the magic of socionics and intertype relations. 
It is actually of known standard that ESFJs are the MOST compatible with INTPs in a long term relationship because not only do they share all functions and so have total understanding for their perspectives, but because one is opposite of the other in the stack they are stimulated in a way that provides great maturation and strength in both members. It is imperative for all types that the inferior be developed in order to gain balance and mental harmony. So, it is only natural that the dom Ti who stimulates the inferior Ti with his rational talk would be the most interesting partner, and vice versa. In fact, it is a very long term goal the reach the level of maturity with the inferior, and a dual partner helps with that tremendously.
And, in situations together, they make a hyper team wherein one partner covers the cognitive area of the other."
673,esfj,"In my dealings with ESFJs, I have found that, unless they are in a very rare and poor mood, it is near impossible to be offended by an ESFJ. 
ESFJs do not seem to have any natural behaviors or thought processes that rub people the wrong way. They also tend to float on the surface when it comes to analyzing situations, and perhaps this helps them get along with so many people. The deeper, more personal and (potentially) hurtful ideas that could upset someone generally do not occur to the ESFJ. 
And yet, most all ESFJs I know have expressed that they make an effort to be kind and optimistic in their dealings with others. The items on their self-improvement list are related to being even better at interacting with others.
Is being kind a focused task, or just a way of life you embrace without much thought behind it?"
674,esfj,"Its not necessarily being kind, as it is making as many people happy so that we can be happy (potayto potaato?).
For me, I'm not really happy unless everyone else involved is happy. So if I make a decision that makes someone in my group upset, I get upset that I did that, and immediately try to make it right. That also tends to make me a worry wort. 
As far as the floating on the surface of situations or issues, I would say (for me) that it only seems that way to others. For me I over analyze every situation, but because I want to make the most people happy, I choose the option that makes this happen. So it may come across as we're just floating there, but really its the opposite, again, for me anyways."
675,esfj,"speaking only from my own experience, I'd definitely say that the perception of ESFJ's as inoffensive doormats is a misguided one. if we are a) comfortable enough with our company and b) feel as though our values or Si-based web of ""truths"" have been violated, the flip switches dramatically. While we ESFJ's try to be as nice as possible as often as possible, we aren't all peaches and cream. We try though. We try."
676,esfj,"My wife is an ESFJ. While she is very kind and wouldn't offend anyone on purpose, she definitely is not a doormat. She doesn't back down for anyone if she's convinced that she's right. I (an INTP) have often suggested that confronting certain dysfunctional people isn't worth the effort. Sometimes I'm right but usually she is.
Keep in mind that these were mentally unstable people that were known for acting in nasty ways. While, yes, she had good intentions in her actions she was fully aware that what she was doing had a possibility of bad outcomes."
677,esfj,"I don't think I float on surface when it comes to analyzing situations. I am very aware of the people I am talking to. I work in an environment where most people are my political opposites. They know this, they love to talk politics, and they still like me a lot. It's because I know how to talk to them without being offensive and I know where the boundaries are. I know when someone starts saying something super crazy, it's time to laugh it off and say something like ""oh, I don't know about that.."" and change the subject to sports or whatever. 
There have been plenty of times when I've had to stand my ground about something, but I don't really get hot headed."
678,esfj,"I'm an INTJ and my two best friends are ESFJs and they are some of the most loudmouthed, savagely mean, and brutally honest people I have ever had the pure, unadulterated delight of knowing in my entire life.
I would not, even for a second, describe them as negative; they are some of the most put-together adults I have ever met, but they take no shit from noone.
And it is so fun to watch. :D"
679,esfj,"A lot of my need to make others happy came from how I grew up. If another member of my household wasn't happy, it would get taken out on me, so I just learned to do everything I can to not step on others' toes and to keep people happy. It's how I've learned to survive. Edit: I wouldn't say we just ""float on the surface,"" when analyzing situations, I would say that we can definitely read and analyze situations really well, and at least for myself, I default to ""how do I make this person not upset with me?"" as a response, no matter what the situation is. I have learned to start standing up for myself if I've been wronged, however."
680,esfj,"yeah I completely agree with what you said. you've said it in a better way than I would have
it's about making decisions so that everyone has a good time + not allowing yourself to make a poor choice which makes people upset towards you"
681,esfj,"I do not see (and would be surprised to hear that other people see) ESFJs as ""doormats."" They choose to be people-pleasers because they want to be, not because they feel like they have to be. 
Have you been identified that way by others? "
682,esfj,"The second comment to refer to ESFJ as a ""doormat"" -- was there something in the original post that alluded to this? 
I do not at all see ESFJs this way. I observe that they tend to choose to make others happy because they want to, not because they feel like they have to or because they are manipulated to."
683,esfj,"It seems we have different definitions of ""float on the surface"" -- your description of what you do perfectly describes what I mean by it. 
Keeping conversation positive and helping people get along/avoid conflict, while valuable, I see as a surface-level interaction. Having that social awareness and standing your ground on an issue, in my opinion, are not the same thing. 
Plenty of ESFJs are credible when it comes to deep and important issues. However, ESFJs most often seem to discuss things in a way where the conversation can remain interesting, but not become controversial or confrontational in any way. This relates back to having a strong social awareness of what will keep everyone getting along. 
When you do find you have to stand your ground, how far will you go? Would you sacrifice group/relationship harmony (temporarily or otherwise) to stand your ground?"
684,esfj,"Was the ESFJ a supervisor/boss of yours?
The SJ combination strongly relies on personal experience. The explanation of it being rejected because the system was ""not theirs,"" while lacking specifics, makes sense for that type. 
Persuading an SJ type to try a new system when the one they have has proven to work well for them can be a difficult task. The new system has to be directly applicable to the situation and (likely) build upon the system they are already using. If the new system has many new aspects to it, it will be much harder to convince the SJ type to try it."
685,esfj,"I try not to. But I will easily do so , if I think that while it may hurt them in the immediate, it will help them learn a lesson or if I think it is for their greater good (not THE greater good). A teachable moment kind of thing.
Now, if you take my kindness and abuse it or turn it around to hurt me or a loved one, you will forever lose my trust, and unleash my wrath. Then, I no longer care about your happiness. You become an un-person to me. And while I may forgive, I will never forget and never fully trust you again.
Hell hath no fury like a ESFJ scorned. "
686,esfj,"My previous post came off as though I was implying that I've been literally referred to in this way, however that's not what I'm actually trying to get at. My bad...
Every MBTI type description has an attempt at describing all-encompassing flaws that most people of a particular type exhibit. So, the not-so-nice way of saying ESFJs ""put others' needs before their own"" and ""neglect their own responsibilities in the face of others'"" is ""ESFJs are doormats."" I've seen this idea (not verbiage) echoed on forums and type descriptions and articles since I found out about being an ESFJ.
Point being, ESFJs can be assholes like any other type, and while we are absolutely prone to selflessness in a way that many other types aren't, we aren't generally so stupid that we'll let people walk all over us with no recourse. "
687,esfj,"No you didn't imply that ESFJs are doormats but I wanted to make the distinction between a certain type of ""people pleaser"" and what I've observed my wife to be.
I'm probably closer to the former. I can't think of someone that I've offended in my entire life. People generally don't take advantage of me though because I disappear quite quickly when I feel used. ""If you don't want to be a door mat, don't lay in front of the door"" could easily be my motto. My wife's motto would be ""If you don't want to be a door mat, stand up"""
688,esfj,"I feel like I do not feel productive unless I get a massive thing done every day. I have a hard time starting habits that last for a long time (which I'm sure many people, not just ESFJs, have trouble with).  I have a feeling this has to do with seeking external validation, as I feel like if I'm not doing it for a grade / performance review / other external reason I don't really feel like doing it, even if it's good for me. Waking up early for example, only really happens when I tell other people about it and say they do it with me, or are waiting for me at gym, etc. AKA I never feel like I do/accomplish enough unless someone tells me I did good in some way.
How do you guys feel/stay productive, and push yourself to do better when there's not external validation?
I hope my question / thoughts made some sense, I at least hope it spurs some discussion. Thanks!"
689,esfj,"lol I relate so hard. I excel when there is structure (e.g. school, stable job, waking up on time to meet other people, etc.), but without it, I get very little done. When it comes to working out, I have a training program that I wrote for myself to follow (I'm a personal trainer), and that keeps me on top of it. Something you could do is hire a trainer or find a program online to follow. I know that's still some sort of external validation/accountability, but I don't really see that as a problem. I've come to accept that I'm not very good without external accountability. So, instead of trying to find intrinsic methods to overcome that weakness, I've just embraced my extrinsic methods and now use it to my advantage. Thus, if there isn't external validation supporting a task for me, then I try to create a structure to it. Want to wake up early tomorrow even though I don't have any obligations or commitments to someone or something? Plan out my entire day, by every hour, so that there is structure to it. If there is nothing obligated for my day and I don't wake up to the time that I planned, then I just try not to make myself feel bad about it and move on.  
tbh, I think it's okay to seek external validation as a means to accomplish tasks. It mainly becomes problematic when you unfairly express dissatisfaction towards others when you don't receive that validation. Also becomes a problem when if that external validation or extrinsic method isn't there, that you blame your lack of success or productivity on that person or method instead of owning up to your own shortcomings. "
690,esfj,I know I’m sort of going off topic... but I am a fellow ESFJ who has ALWAYS struggled with waking up early...and I found this app that saved my life called Alarmy (free in the App Store)..it literally makes you get up and scan a barcode of an object in your house (you program it in your phone prior) before the alarm stops. It was my new year’s resolution to wake up at 6 every day and the app really has helped make it possible! Hopefully it will help you too:) 
691,esfj,"Lol other ESFJs sometimes stress me out though. Cuz we're constantly going out of our way for others, so when someone does something for me I go ""ugh ugh ughhhhh now I gotta pay them back"" and it's just never ending. :]"
692,esfj,"Totally agree. I feel I don't really blame others for my shortcomings though I know they're mine, but external validation can literally mean I have a hard time working in my home / room versus coffeeshop or library. Like I wouldn't sit and watch YouTube if everyone around me is working, so maybe I should use that more too. I really need to make that structure though especially for waking up early. It's just even when I don't have that much to do (little structure), I feel like I should be awake for the sake of ""the hustle"". You know?"
693,esfj,"Definitely understand the pressure of the hustle. I think that’s a pretty common challenge for xxxJs. I used to attend a mental health group to learn techniques for managing my anxiety, and accepting a lack of productivity was really crucial for me to not let it affect me. We derive a lot of our value from how productive we are, and that inevitably sets us up for disappointment. I personally found that that negativity turns into a positive feedback cycle. I’d feel bad about myself for not getting anything done, which would lead me to be discouraged and not do anything, and then I would feel even worse about myself for being unproductive, and the cycle would continue. Learning to accept a lack of productivity for me is key for putting a stop to that cycle. Even if I am still unproductive after stopping that cycle, then at least I am not harming my mental health in the process. Plus I find that when I learn to accept this, it is easier to become productive again. "
694,esfj,"ESFJs spend most their time telling others what they like about them. And don’t get to hear much themselves, that’s why they try to hard to be the perfect person for each individual. What’s your favorite thing about ESFJs?"
695,esfj,"We actually talked before, but to recap I (ENTP) dated an ESFJ for close to three years.
The things that I loved about her personality are...:

Projected the most positive and energetic natural energy of any person I ever met.
Gave a LOT of attention (also wanted a lot of attention and affirmation which I like doing.)
Very affectionate and sincere. She was overwhelmingly the most authentic person I have ever been involved with for almost all of the relationship.
The reactions she would have to the things I did for her were the absolute best. For example I would write her notes before I saw her, then I would hide them in her room or in her car and then there would be this little game she would have to play after I left where she would have to find it. Was always the cutest thing when she found it and read it. Secondly she would damn near cry tears of joy when I got her flowers. 
When we went out on dates she would go above and beyond with making herself look really pretty. I'm talking the kind of pretty that radiates. From my perspective she always made an effort to capture a high class look when going out on dates (Akin to going to an opera or fancy restaurant. She absolutely nailed it.
When it came to work and school, she displayed the greatest dedication and work ethic of anyone I have ever met. When I first was getting involved with her this was something that I saw as a tremendous plus. The caveat on this point is she would tend to prioritize her entire day around either being in work, or cramming her schedule with school (She would work weeks ahead of everyone else in the courses and not be satisfied with anything but near perfection.) at the expense of maintaining her own mental well-being. It was sort of my influence on her to try and make sure she had time to do what she wanted to do. That was very difficult. That being said later on in life where ever she ends up she will be stellar at what she does and applies herself to.
Her sense of organization is naturally dead-opposite of mine. Throughout the relationship her influence on organization was bleeding through into how I lived. Definitely one thing that I sorely miss haha. 
Her sense of planning, while meticulous and almost down to the minute, was also something that did translate. She made me have a greater emphasis about the near-term rather than my natural tendency to prioritize future circumstances over today's needs. There were times that it was a little overbearing (Like visiting her extended family on a schedule akin to a political excursion.) but it was a part of the package that was who she is.

There are a LOT more than these but maybe something I said some of you ESFJ's can relate to. "
696,esfj,i'm an ESFJ and i'm self-consciously trying hard not to base how i feel on the compliments (or lack of) that others give me. it's hard since i've naturally grown up judging myself on what other people say and do. and i need to be more confident in the way i carry myself
697,esfj,"(INFP) -
Can't say for sure, but I'm almost positive my coworker is this type. She gets shit done way faster than me and makes the most amazing cupcakes I've ever had. She brings cupcakes to work all the time and it makes everyone happy. She also always finds a way to be super positive and energetic, even though she has a lot of her plate with a day job and being a ministers wife/mom. Solidly warm person. Oh, she also has an appreciation for the aesthetic of her immediate surroundings that I envy. She set up a coffee bar and all kinds of pictures/motivational quotes are her desk on her first day and I was amazed."
698,esfj,"😂 touché. I think a lot of under developed ESFJs will do that. But I never get to know what people think about me, and this isn’t that specific anyways just kind oof vague stuffabout people like me. 
We do use Feedback as our main source of how to act, so they may just be very insecure. I just want to know what is positive about myself so I can put more positivity in the world. At least for me when I hear this stuff it’s not about fishing for compliments but more about hearing what I’m doing right so I can continue to do it."
699,esfj,"Hi, I am not an ESFJ, but I think you all are awesome. I have posted this survey about the relationship between MBTI type and dreams to a couple of reddit forums but I have yet to get a single ESFJ response. Is anyone interested? I would greatly appreciate it and it only takes a couple minutes. Also, I will post the results if anyone is interested. Thank you and have a great day! 
See the link below to take the survey.

700,esfj,"Hi, for those that are interested, I have the preliminary results on my blog. Here is the link: http://kayla.kaylasweirdbrain.com/2019/05/mbti-and-dreams-is-there-connection.html
I will have later posts that will break the information down into types so feel free to keep checking back for more insights.
Thanks to all who participated!"
701,esfj,"""Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!""
On the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?
Anyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)"
702,esfj,"INTP here with an ESFJ friend... We both stay home with little kids that need socializing and we both know it's good for us to see each other and visit, but she's mentioned before how hard it is for her to say no when she doesn't want to do something (which baffles me), and we've settled on me asking her when she wants to visit and her picking the day, so she isn't trying to do it at a bad time.  I realized I have a habit of drawing her into debates on religion and politics, which I of course love, but she recently told me she hates conflict (referring to something else I believe). To me, these discussions are academic and don't involve conflict.  But then I've been shocked lately when she tells me (wrongly) how I must really feel about something after processing something I've previously said through her own view of the world.  If I felt that way, I would have said it, and it really throws me off because I now have no idea what she really might be thinking about me when we talk.  But I realize that maybe I was making her uncomfortable in the first place with those types of conversations.  So, any insight on what is going on and how she probably feels would be really helpful.  But what I'm mostly wondering is, if she didn't particularly like me, would I even know? If Ivwas doing something that bothered her, would she tell me? What does an ESFJ like doing/talking about?  "
703,esfj,"I'm INTJ and my husband is ESFJ. 
ESFJs are like golden retrievers, for lack of a better word. They tend to be very social, extremely loyal, and feel good to be around. They also care deeply even when they seem bubbly on the outside. They live an emotional existence, which makes them great at empathy, sensitivity, and even having a good time. 
It's true that ESFJ people hate ""conflict"" aka talking about religion and politics. Disagreeing on something so personal definitely feels like conflict to them, not debate, and ESFJs hate to disagree with someone they care about. Debate implies (and feels) like there is a winner and a loser, and ESFJs hate to lose. 
This seems to be an ESFJ trait, too. They process what they hear to its maximum emotional conclusion and then it sounds totally different to INTx ears. They don't seem to understand that other types don't have all-encompassing emotions. 
In short, stop talking religion and politics with your ESFJ friend. You're stressing them out. "
704,esfj,"That you are friends with an ESFJ is a testament to how committed you both are to your friendship. In my experience, NTPs and SFJs don't get along very well. The frictions you've described above are one of my observations why this relationship isn't - on paper - a perfect fit. But I've also noticed that SFJs tend to value approval and recognition over everything else. This is particularly difficult for an NTP to stomach because it just seems so inconsequential to a type with Fe in the tertiary/inferior position. To put it bluntly I can't help but pity this seemingly uncontrollable desire for others' recognition. I have so many cringe moments with my ESFJ coworker where I'm just flatly embarrassed on their behalf. And ESFJs are especially notorious for this because a dominant Fe can be so rampant. For example, my above-mentioned coworker will go out of their way to craft a superb, albeit extremely wordy, question in a training/meeting only to immediately be on their phone when their question is being answered. They seem to have no interest in the actual answer to their question, rather, their goal and desire are simply to be thought of as being knowledgeable in the process of asking the question in the first place. That goal being accomplished, the ESFJ will disengage and begin checking the twitter feed. I can't quantify just how crazy this drives me both from the perspective of the person answering the question and the fact that the ESFJ does not understand how disrespectful this is! This same coworker also has a very difficult relationship with our manager (an INTP). This is partly because the INTP manager is extremely defensive - something that will deter the ESFJ to ever broach a conflict and in any case ensure that the ESFJ will never bring it up again should they ever muster the wherewithal in the first place. It is true that they complain a lot about the manager but they never let them know how they truly feel. This could very well be the manager/subordinate factor at work but, if I were to imagine a similar friction with a coworker, I can't imagine them coming out to directly address the issue in that scenario either. I imagine that you will have to be the one that addresses any conflicts you have or foresee. You'll have to do it tactfully, even playfully, in order to ensure you'll get the ESFJ's true views on it. Anyway, I'm rambling here but the gist is - bravo for having an ESFJ friend.
That said, if you're able to have a friendship and not be driven crazy by their mere existence (and them yours), you can overcome whatever content-related frictions you're having. "
705,esfj,"This is the best description I've read. 
I'm an ESFJ, and I can get along with/talk to anyone, but as soon as politics or religion gets brought up, I tend to shut my mouth and disengage. Opinions aren't going to be changed with one discussion, and I don't want to upset anyone or make them think of me differently because I don't share their views. "
706,esfj,"I am both religious and political and enjoy discussing my viewpoint, but I DO find it hard to be challenged on those topics. A debate that starts out as friendly can quickly start feeling like a personal attack."
707,esfj,"Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I’m ENTP and she’s ESFP. Lately we’ve been interviewing people as a way to catalog types so others can get to know and identify that type.
For a year we thought Brittany was an ESTJ, but through this episode we figure out she's actually an ESFJ! She talks with ESFP Meredith and ENTP Kaila about how she loves hosting parties, spends time and money renovating her home in Washington, teaches 4th grade and LOVES her pets.

708,esfj,"If I do something, I want to do it well. 
Whether it's dieting, exercising, a sport, cheat meals, a school project, fashion, friendships, a new hobby... (basically anything) I go big or go home. I HATE this about myself because it leads to a lot of fluctuation in my life and a lot of inconsistency. I'm UBER healthy one week, and then spend the next week downing pizza and ice cream at 10 pm. One week I'm staying in contact with all my friends, then I don't respond to any texts or emails. I dress like a bum or dress like Kate Middleton. Any ESFJs suffer with this seesaw mentality? If so, how do you combat it?"
709,esfj,"Hahaha yes, that’s correct. I also have mood swings, I cry one minute and I laugh another. From one extreme to the next, also I’m kinda black and white type of person, all or nothing, same as you basically. "
710,esfj,"Lol oh yes, this is me! My sister makes fun of me and says she doesn’t understand me because, in her words, I “either wear my pajamas in public or are really dressed up with makeup and an outfit that perfectly matches” 😂 I don’t combat it, I just accept it about myself and roll with it. I got tired of feeling like I needed to “try harder” or like something was wrong with me."
711,esfj,"i experience this as well, which is why i only try to do new hobbies if i see myself putting in 100%
there's tons of things i'd like to pick up such as photography or running. so i limit myself in just doing one or two things and forcing myself to do it"
712,esfj,So I took a test and said I am an esfj and reading up on it I am. But can someone personality change  up I wasn't always like this in high school I was social awkward not popular at all or are there exceptions some times like person to person
713,esfj,"Honestly, I wasn't popular at all in high school either and can be extremely awkward. But I also think that many people in high school were turned off by me because my confidence and assertiveness came off as aggression, which wasn't my intention. I'm not a great listener and that could have been the reason too. 
After coming to college, I've become much more comfortable with who I am. I still wouldn't say I'm popular, but I would agree that I'm an approachable person and generally get along with most people."
714,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ and I love it but sometimes I feel uncomfortable or awkward in social situations too and sometimes I enjoy my INTP-boyfriend caring for me like an ESFJ. So I would say it can change, sometimes over years, sometimes day per day."
715,esfj,"I did a Myers-Briggs test and it came back as ISFJ, however I think I am actually ESFJ. As a child I was very outgoing and extroverted. However as I grew up I think I started picking up unconsciously my parents behaviour as they're both very shy and it caused me to second guess my behaviour a lot. Now I'm very shy and I isolate myself a lot through habit - e.g. I do sit in the corner of the classroom during class and I don't introduce myself and start up conversations with people. However all this hurts me a lot and gets me down. When I do hang around people I get really energised by it and become like a different person and it gives me like a high. I also get really disappointed when social situations aren't ""energising"" enough. Like tonight I was out for dinner but I was seated at the end of the table so I could not hear or join any of the conversations happening in the middle of the table. Afterwards I just felt down like I didn't get the ""high"" from socialising I anticipated? 
I also think with reference to being shy that is completely habitual. This makes it quite frustrating as I know I'm holding myself back for no reason and I get frustrated that I keep repeating this isolating behaviour. I am not worried about what other people think of me, I can give presentations in front of people, I can attend interviews, etc. In fact I think I probably have less nervousness and social anxiety-type thought patterns then the majority of people. My shyness is purely behavioural rather than psychological.
Wondering if anyone else is extroverted but shy?"
716,esfj,"The I/E axis is not about being shy or outgoing, it is about the direction (vector) you perceive the world: from object to subject or from subject to object.
Being shy or outgoing is just a side-effect of this and not even a guaranteed one."
717,esfj,"Hi yeah i'm the same way. I'm horrible with meeting new people just because I get incredibly nervous by it. However, I definitely prefer being with friends/ hanging out with people rather than being alone, which i guess is what the extroverted part of it is for me too. But yeah, you're not alone "
718,esfj,"Well said.
To add: We all live in two worlds, the inner and outer worlds, being objective to one and subjective to the other (the direction you explained). An Extravert is subjective to the outer world, and subjective to the inner world. The Introvert is vice-versa.
Keirsey's idea that Introverts are shy or hesitant, stems from temperament theory dealing exclusively with our interactions with the outer world. It is likely true that most Introverts are shy or hesitant in this area, but i know ones who are not."
719,esfj,"You guys are the most caring, genuine, and loving types I've ever had the pleasure to get to know. Honestly, I have no idea where I'd be without my ESFJ best friend. One depressing text and the next day she's at my place with homemade chocolates!
And fuck that stereotype about not being as smart or intuitive, when she's her best self she can be the most intelligent, and cautious person in the group and so, so hardworking. gods, you guys are so giving and yet so independent I can't help but admire that! Stay the same, the world needs more people like you💜
-An INFJ"
720,esfj,"It’s always nice to hear something nice about yourself. ESFJs go around usually telling others how much they like other people but never hear it themselves, like ever. Make sure to tell your friend it’ll make her life, I’m serious. "
721,esfj,"I've experienced both sides of the ESFJ coin, unfortunately. On the one hand, loving, caring, sensitive and sweet. On the other, manipulative, ostracising, condescending, controlling, jealous, and victim playing. I prefer to keep my distance. ~infp"
722,esfj,"I used to be like that stereotypical feelings bad and useless, people bad and useless but I have come to appreciating those things because it is like magic I don't posses and it ruins my life. If you don't admire and try to emulate your exact opposite you're doing the personal growth thing wrong."
723,esfj,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.

724,esfj,"Hi /r/esfj!
I am a fourth year Psychology student currently studying in Melbourne Australia. My research thesis is focusing on the antecedents of social and political attitudes and their relations to personality, and here is the survey:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Y7SJ5JC
There are some questions you may find interesting (I think...) and does not take too long. The survey is completely anonymous and has human ethics approval (info inside).
If you feel like giving it a go I would appreciate it. Feel free to share the link with anyone you think might enjoy it. 
Thanks in advance"
725,esfj,"I have had five and a half years with a beautiful soul. We have lived together for three of those so we are well into the part of the relationship we can't hide our true selves from each other anymore. I figure we are currently in a funk because we both have not matured, specifically, in regard to our types. 
I've reseached ESFJ's. They always need to know that you want/desire them. If an ESFJ doesn't get this constant recognition/appreciation then she gets worried that you no longer want them around and of for a while I have felt she has been loyal to somebody else. I  am not her naturally compatible type so she is ""cheating"" on me, please note; not in the literal sense of the word because I crave DIE HARD loyalty. She is getting her needs met by a friend (F) who's type probably compliments hers.
I remember in the beginning thinking how lucky I was because she was so low maintenance. Well apparently not. I figure everyone quicky discovers in relationships so nothing new there. This could be confirmation bias but I have noticed that

She never knows what she wants. 
Because of Ne, ESFJ's take the value judgements of those that influence them but they are also easily sold or taken advantage of so you can imagine the result if you are in the wrong circle. 

These two (actually three) elements are the fuel to my fear of our future together.
The INFJ Te blindspot demands I am not aware of what others are thinking and this is a terrible thing when she does not communicate. I fully understand that I should ignore the self harming thoughts running around in my head during such episodes.
I bet no ESFJ would want to be told what I've written above, especially by an INFJ in person, because when it's truth time I always come off as commanding which I avoid in fear of pushing people away. I am a perfectionist with terribly high standards that I don't adhere to half of the time and I am struggling to grasp that everyone isn't like me. But I am trying to improve myself every (other) day, something I never see in my ESFJ. Will a divide grow between us or is maturity a naturally occuring process? Only time will tell.
PS: Everything I have written above is attached to personal experiences."
726,esfj,"I really hope you guys work things out. 
I'm a female ESFJ and all my boyfriends have been INFJ.. I have a little theory that the INFJ and ESFJ are actually the best match.
Although a lot of what you said is true.. maybe my theory will help you feel confident in your relationship.
INFJ typically are known for being a very deep type who are misunderstood, and take a while to get to know, but once they fully trust someone they stick by them (sometimes to an unhealthy degree). Now, ESFJ, although we appear open and warm, we usually have a hidden intelligence from our Ti.
We're actually self conscious of it and only share it with people we're very comfortable with. So with that allows time for the ESFJ and INFJ to warm up to each other and get to know the hidden intelligence they both have. 
Meanwhile.. the ESFJ often have issues with letting people in-in fear they will leave.. and INFJ stick with people often to a fault, remember?.. so they become an attached pair.
-They both share Fe, and all of their other functions (Ne, Ni, Se, Si) don't typically cause conflict- actually they add interest.. (Example: Ni being the INFJ dominant function, and Ne being our 3rd.. allows our Ne to be presant but not strong enough to conflict.. Giving us an ability to see eye to eye better.) 
Well.. I hope this helped in some way, and that you guys can work things out! "
727,esfj,"Wow. This very accurately describes my last relationship, now ended. I’m INFJ and my ex is ESFJ. There was an initial very strong chemistry.  The problems lay with both of us and I could copy and paste the above comments which elucidate the problems.   I understand that my ex ESFJ is still very frustratedly angry with me for ending the relationship, which is ironic and sad as it was the repeated frustrated anger when things didn’t go perfectly that soured my view in the first place.  I would say my ESFJ was a very anxious attacher, where as I was more a distant attacher.  ESFJ seemed to need constant reassurance that we were attached and this seemed to be a HUGE vulnerability. Whereas I would confidently say that I could very easily maintain a loyal and devoted attachment with someone even if they lived on the other side of the planet.  ESFJ wanted engagement and marriage super fast (wanted to be engaged within a few months) where as I would be very happy with that sort of formality to evolve after several years of devotion and loyalty.  Not sure if that is relatable, but those are my insights from what transpired. Happy to delve further if required. 
In summary: I feel my ex-ESFJ just wanted to be loved in a very secure way, unconditionally.  Whereas I, an INFJ, just wanted to be understood, respected and trusted, unconditionally, without any of the drama. "
728,esfj,"im making a spreadsheet to see if theres any connection between mbti and gardner multiple intelligences.

if any other SJ's are seeing this, please participate as well! comment you type and results so they can be added to the heap.
thanks for listening!"
729,esfj,"maybe, first i gotta do tests for statistical significance which requires a a good bit of data. but once i do start doing analysis im going to compile it and share it with everyone who participated! im open to suggestions as to what relations you would like to have looked into as well!"
730,esfj,"I am the INTJ child with an ESFJ parent (grandparent to be exact). We have always had a roller coaster relationship. Anyone else experience this? Our generation gap puts a strain on our relationship and obviously the way we communicate. Or don’t communicate. The ESFJ loves to “save” people and becomes outraged when that person doesn’t bend over backwards with appreciation. Parent and I are currently not speaking. We’ve been on and off speaking terms for many years. I was a very angry child/teenager due to my initial upbringing with my mother and unfortunately ESFJ got the blunt of it. And the more ESFJ held on, the more I wanted to break free. It seems ESFJ, is incapable of letting go of the past and forgiveness. I can understand, shit was not great between us during my teenage years. But I have grown and matured substantially but can only be seen as a self destructive 16y/o girl. Never as an adult who has matured and built their own life. Any advice is welcomed. At this point, I care whether ESFJ is alive and well but I don’t care for a relationship. I may have matured and grown, but ESFJ is resentful and outrageously stubborn. "
731,esfj,"Seems like you have a more growing up to do. It's not an easy match up between family members to be clashing personality types but a mature person can save face with their family members. I know up until I was in my twenties I was constantly at odds with my family. Eventually I realized that my family was always going to be my family and I could seek people like myself outside of them. Once I was fulfilled by my friends, I didn't feel so demanding of my family to understand me. I could just enjoy what I did have with them, which at the end of the day might just be that they are family."
732,esfj,"Hmmmm...not sure about that dynamic, in that your ESFJ doesn't seem able to respect you as an adult.  Does your ESFJ get supremely upset when you try to set normal boundaries?  Do they get unreasonably upset and don't understand why you want to set up normal boundaries?  "
733,esfj,"Hmmm, maybe I am expecting too much out of the relationship. I know I expect a lot less than I used to because of how it has been. It does seem my parent wants all or nothing. Either a full, open door or nothing. But I don’t trust to have it be that way. And I’m sure she knows that by now. "
734,esfj,"Yeah, I maybe spend too much time on /r/JustNoMIL, but sounds like your ESFJ might be a narcissist.  Let me see if I can find you an essay/blog/article thing I read yesterday...  Take a peep at this, see if it sounds familiar.  "
735,esfj,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/JUSTNOMIL using the top posts of the year!

736,esfj,"Fascinating. Honestly, I wouldn’t put any of this past her. She has done some intensely manipulative shit in the past. Not to an extreme extent with me, but with others that have done her “wrong”.  She definitely loves to be loved, and is confused when others aren’t  fawning over her. She would brag about how all her doctors love her, because they would give her a hug. A damn hug, now the person loves her, wants to get into her pants and make her leave her husband. Yes, of course. 
Excuse the rant. I’m outrageously frustrated. "
737,esfj,"Look up ""Grey-Rocking"".  It's a communication technique that allows you to become 'so boring' in the eyes of your ESFJ they will eventually stop going to you for their narc-needs.  You're not rude, you're just boring, and therefore no fun to terrorize anymore.  "
738,esfj,"Inadvertently, I have done this. I stated doing this the last year I was actually in her life. Things were once again ended in October. It worked to an extent,  she became even more angry and “excitable” the more I didn’t play into her games. I found it really amusing, didn’t let her know obviously. But after her last blow up, I ended things. I’ve attempted to reach out, during holiday or birthday times. An email, saying hey, hope you’re well. Happy “whatever holiday it may be”.  I’m pretty sure a relationship, to whatever depth, will never work. "
739,esfj,"I've noticed ESFJ women tend to have very squealy voices that fluctuate a ton. Why is that and why do they do this? Why is there so much variability in their speech. I'm puzzled, because I don't notice this often with ENFJs.
Why do they make facial expressions like this and do things like the thing these characters do with their phones?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw9_xep7Uao&t=113s
Disclaimer: It's a parody, so please don't take it too seriously.
And why is their linguistic communication like that? I guess it's Fe and Si being their first two functions and Ne and Ti being their third and fourth functions? I've noticed similar articulation and linguistic communication in ISFJs.
Why do they have trouble not gossiping?
Finally, why will they look at a guy they find attractive in a manner as if they're shy, peering at them, hoping they don't notice them? I'm not sure how to word it exactly. From my perspective, it feels as if they think they know and understand based on a scammy video on YouTube or like they're trying some trick that supposedly attracts men. Maybe it's just the society we live in where politicians, schools, and businesses try to manipulate Si?
Some of their communication really confuses me. I find it difficult for me to see in their heads.
An example of this is they'll sometimes giggle a bunch around me like they think I'm cute and child-like in innocence, purity, or naivety. Do they find me attractive? Are they trying to perform witchcraft? What the heck are they doing?"
740,esfj,"I'm trying to see past the insulting nature in which you phrased the question. What exactly is it you wish to know? 9/10 if you ask an ESFJ what they're thinking, they'll tell you. If you ask a girl if she likes you, she'll tell you. But I can almost guarantee they're not flirting with you. They are just being themselves, which a LOT of people mistake for flirtatiousness."
741,esfj,"Agreed here. I generally like people and am friendly. I like getting to know people and learning new things from people. I want to make people feel liked, welcomed, and valued. It can see how it can be mistaken for flirtatiousness. 
If I like you, you'd know. Myself as an ESFJ wears my heart on a sleeve. 
​"
742,esfj,"Any ESFJs really. I've experienced it with ESFJs around my age as well as Gen X and Baby Boomer generations. They'll be looking at me, giggling as if they were talking about me, and I'm being very naive or oblivious like a young child..I'm tempted to use a clip due to the exaggerated nature and satire of it, but it's kind of insensitive."
743,esfj,Of course. I don’t openly call them out. Sometimes during a party I’m hosting I’ll just go and check in and ask “are you okay? Do you need anything?” I don’t like unwanted attention so I wouldn’t expect anyone to like it either. I just want to make sure my guests are comfortable. 
744,esfj,"Generally, I like them! I have a little sister who is an INTP. She is pretty chill, no nonsense, and a hard worker. We are exact opposites, and sometimes that means having to explain things to each other several times before we even understand what the other is trying to say, but this usually results in laughs before tears.
She can be a stupid witch sometimes, but then again, so can I ;)
We are able to help each other out with things when it comes to perspective (she helps me lay things out more analytically and I help her not be embarrassed by her emotions).
I'm not sure if I could be romantically involved with an INTP, but it really depends on the person. Even people within a type grouping are unique :)
Hope this helps! 
-ESFJ"
745,esfj,"Married to one.  I love him dearly.  We've had our share of fights and misunderstandings, but he is the #1 human being who is best for me and balances me out, and I am attached to him in a borderline yandere way.  :-D"
746,esfj,"I am married to an INTP. AMA. 
We both took the personality test before we got married, our counselor pretty much told us that we would definitely bump heads on who was right. 
We have been going strong for 7 years and we are still (if not more) madly in love with each other! Like the kissy smoochie love!! I think because we knew we were complete opposites, we had an easier time dealing with our stronger traits. We complement each other fully, and we work well together. We currently work together as car haulers living on the road, so we are together 24/7. We haven't done this in 5 years, and the first round was only 7 months long, so here goes nothing!"
747,esfj,"I find INTPs very interesting. It's hard sometimes because as an ENTP I'm very curious and i like to break through people's barriers. So interacting with INTP can be a little bit frustrating at times. In saying that I'm learning to appreciate boundaries, sometimes. Have not had a major clash or breakdown of communication as yet! "
748,esfj,"INTP here, one of close family members is ESFJ and we have same analytical vs emotional relationship, one thing that happens is that when i tell my ESFJ how they are doing something wrong and to do it another way, they will become very emotional"
749,esfj,"My husband is ESFJ. 
He is the life of the party. He's like a golden retriever -- loyal to a fault, happy and bubbly around friends, always excited for a chance to go outside and see more people. When we go places together, people greet him warmly and loudly. It seems like he knows everyone. He's so charismatic. 
He doesn't consider himself to be smart. (I think he's smart.) But he is so driven and people are so drawn to him that he finds success in everything he tries. He is in a very difficult profession and excels in it, but still feels it's his people skills that got him there. 
My ESFJ has soooo manyyyy feeelingggssss. Feelings are supreme for him, he cannot rationalize his way out of emotion. He loves poetry and cinema and art for its emotional resonance. He feels empathy so deeply it can be painful to him. He is not ashamed of being a sensitive man. 
He cares too much about people who don't care back. He's loyal instantly and forever, no matter what. He fears abandonment so he gives endless second chances. He's stubborn and easily frustrated. He struggles with anxiety. "
750,esfj,"I'm bubbly, talkative, an insatiable romantic...love to laugh and smile, going out to movies is my absolute favorite thing to do besides being a part of making them. I am always there for people, even when they're not there for me. 
Negatives include talking too much, caring too much, being awful with money and always wanting things my way ;) Sometimes I feel like people don't care enough for/ about me. I have struggled with anxiety and depression most of my life.
In regards to goals and such, I am pretty good at reaching goals. Once I set my mind to doing something, I get 'er done...good luck stopping me.
Occupation: Writer."
751,esfj,"I'm a Esfj I like for everyone to be happy. always up to having fun. I always like to be around people to have a good time. I usually love conversation. When excited with friends I get really hyper and jumpy .
Even though I don't express my dreams in life i to have dreams but I don't share unless you ask if you ask then I'll have a deep conversation with you but I usually start with small talk to get to know someone.if you take time to get to know me,initiating conversation I really like that. At least that's me."
752,esfj,"For some odd reason, I find girls with Ni hot. ENFJ girls give me that vibe sometimes. However, I've had an ENFJ girlfriend and we did not mesh well. Si vs Ni and Fe vs Fe. I was more Ti developed than she was and we would get into heated debates. Also, Fe & Fe makes for a terrible combination."
753,esfj,"I see you're an INFJ. Don't take it personally. Just from my perspective, I like y'all but you're also a bit too serious at times for me. Again, obviously this isn't telling about everyone your type by no means as everyone is different."
754,esfj,"IMO ENFJs are less reserved than you guys, and do laugh openly at things, but there is that sense of taking life very seriously and over analysis. Or trying to move the situation in a certain ""direction"". 
(Nothing wrong with that. I greatly appreciate it at times. And I've learned the most from INFJs than from any other type :) )"
755,esfj,"How do you all get over a breakup even if the relationship was not right and torture the entire time? I find myself having to make myself hate the person by thinking about the worst parts of them. But with a relationship it’s hard to do that because you’ll think about the good, even if it’s few. I loose so much sleep over thinking and thinking what could have been. "
756,esfj,"It's so ESFJ of you to only remember the good things about your ex.  LOL...this is something you guys just naturally do.  I've talked to my ESFJ SO about how he coped after his marriage ended (long before I came along) and for him finding people he could confide in who gave him a different perspective on the relationship was really helpful to him.  He HAS TO talk things out-another ESFJ trait that is just innate.  It's how you guys tend to problem-solve.  
He first went to his pastor, and then when he came to the conclusion that maybe he was the issue, he went to counseling.  He didn't go for a long time, but he did go and it did help him to see that there were some things he contributed to the relationship that bogged it down and made it very hard for his ex-wife.  He also had amazing friends who finally felt that they were able to tell him the truth about his ex-wife and how mis-matched they were from the beginning.  And at that point, because he had prepared himself by doing some serious soul-searching he was able to hear these people  and accept the truth about his ex.  She wasn't a bad person, she just wasn't the type of person he needed to be with-they were so very, very different.  
ESFJ's need sounding boards, people whose opinions they trust and who know them well.  These friends have known him his whole life, and because he worked so hard to hold the relationship together for so many years, they rooted for him and the marriage.  When it ended, they weren't surprised and in some cases they were actually relieved because he had become so unhappy, even though he put on a good front about it.  
Inventory your people.  You know who your go-to, got-your-back-no-matter-what people are and just be candid with them.  Tell them you're having trouble reconciling the finality of all this and you want to know their take on it.  The insight these people have will help you tremendously.  Your people LOVE you, absolutely think the world of you because ESFJ's are inherently lovable, dear people.  I also recommend maybe 3-4 sessions with a good relationship therapist.  Let him or her dredge the depths with you.  They don't judge and they are fantastic listeners and as an ESFJ you will talk yourself to the conclusion you've been seeking.  And that therapist will cheer for you once you do because seeing you guys get your equilibrium back just strengthens everyone else around you.  You're our rock, and we hate seeing you flounder (and often times don't know how to help you feel better...)
Good luck to you-you're going to be okay.  I promise!"
757,esfj,"I just broke up with my bf and I feel your pain and I'm sorry :( 
I have found that the best way to cope is not to dwell on his faults, but instead to think about why he and I didn't work well together. We are still great friends and I really care about and respect him, but for various reasons we would not make a good married couple. Try to focus on why you broke up and how both of you will be better off as friends. It will take time and maybe even some distance to really recover and detach emotionally. I hope you two can be good friends eventually and spur each other on to be better people! 
Hugs and understanding ❤️"
758,esfj,"I'm a female INTP with an ESFJ mother. We love each other but often don't get along. I would like to understand her better and am curious to know, from the other side, what can be difficult about having an INTP in your family, what you would want them to understand about you. "
759,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ and my fiancé is an INTP. We balance each other out really well but our biggest difference is in how we make plans. I like to set plans a long time in advance (ex: wanna eat dinner at 7? to me means we are eating dinner at 7) but he likes to play it by ear (""let's eat at 7"" means that's the goal but if other information comes up, we can change the time)"
760,esfj,"I literally came here for this exact reason. 
Me and my mom are INTP.
My dad and sister are ESFJ.
The problem is is that we all DEEPLY misunderstand each other and this is really taking a toll on everyone.  Me and mom misunderstand OURSELVES as well. 
For me the ONLY THING that can get me angry is my ESFJ dad dismissing my thoughts as stupid or naive. My heart is racing thinking about it now.  I want to understand how my dad and sister feel when I interact with them... even though I fucking hate admiting this. 
I want to post back once I've given this more thought and have more of a point or plan. "
761,esfj,"Dismissing their/a child's thoughts as stupid or naive sounds like a VERY mom/dad thing to do, and is infuriating regardless of MBTI type. I still remember being out to dinner with my parents and talking about how my then-fiance and I wanted for me to eventually stay home with our kids while he worked and both of them laughing in my face. Well, guess what? We aren't rich, but we aren't broke, and have been living on one income for almost 10 years now. Anyway, this diminishes with age bc you end up with a whole stack of years behind you where, look, everything has been fine! so your older relatives don't have as many condescending things to say. Even if they do, you will be old enough to not. give. a. shit. byeeeeee.
I'm guessing that your dad says things like, ""You can't do that,"" or, ""That won't work/isn't realistic,"" and then has no real (objective?) reason as to why he thinks this way. You see possibility and he sees potential failure. He may also feel threatened by your intellect, especially if you use a condescending tone or have a high drive to point out logical fallacies. You don't like to believe your young thoughts aren't fully fleshed-out, and he doesn't like to believe his old thoughts have no foundation.  
For ESFJs, tone of voice, how you say something, is just as important as what you say. We are incredibly sensitive even if we don't show it. We also do not appreciate being made to feel dumb bc we have a lot of superficial interests. I am capable of (and enjoy) deep thoughts, but that's not what usually keeps me entertained when I'm folding laundry or whatever. Dominant Fe and inferior Ti means we are paranoid about looking stupid. Unless you know that we have really high self-confidence, or we are very close to you, don't make fun of us, we can't handle it. We are also really bad at receiving criticism (though we dish it out like a boss), so it's probably best to not try and correct your dad, or offer him advice, unless he directly asks for it, or you're at least 40, and even then, he may still not appreciate it.
If you are close to your sister: ask her if she wants advice before giving it to her. Dominant Fe means we must talk through problems to be able to come to solutions. We usually come up with the answers on our own while explaining the problem to someone else. Or we need to bounce our solution off of someone else to see if it makes sense. Where it seems that INTPs come up with their ideas, state what they are going to do, and then do it, an ESFJ may verbally run through a dozen different possibilities before choosing one. To arrive at the most sound decision, we have to do it that way, that's how our brains work. Good luck!"
762,esfj,"Wow there's a lot here that is very relevant to my life. 
I think you're right about what you said in the first paragraph. And thank you for pointing out that having parents shoot down your thoughts as dumb or naive could potentially be a problem for everyone. I have practically nothing to show for my life and my dad has experienced a lot so all the theories that I express out loud out of curiosity and just to say ""what if"" (which seems to be my strongest skill as an INTP) gets shot down as ""welllll or really it's just this"". I've learned to not bother expressing my theories with him exept for certain situations.  
As for the second paragraph, my dad isn't that explicit because he holds being a good father and family man as his highest value(?) as far as I can tell. It's more of ""so why does that matter?"" or ""so what are you going to do now that you think that?"" and my initial reaction is to get angry because he can't see the possibly profound potential in my theory. (Strong emphasis on possibly. I like to keep open the possibility that I'm totally full of shit and/or crazy.) 
And maybe he is threatened by my thoughts but it definitely seems he is afraid of them. He seems to be very afraid to be alone with his thoughts. Most likely it's because two people very close to him died at a young age: his dad and one of his best friends. Could explain a lot about his influence on my curiosity as a kid. I was this explosion of thought and questioning and what if and creativity, the very thing he is afraid of, so he did things consiously or unconsciously to kill my curiosity. OR I'm way off. 
I'll explore the rest later. "
763,esfj,"This^^^.  Yes.  My ESFJ boyfriend parents a very creative (and somewhat odd) INTP.  I was in the bedroom last night listening to him lecture his 13 year old child on proper bathing techniques.  Seriously.  Now, 13 year old boys are not normally the Poster Children for Perfect Hygiene, but this was so over the top.  And mild-mannered, easygoing child that he is, he just stood there and (I'm pretty sure) he just pretended to listen.  I would love to think that this was a Dad/Son interaction based in love and care, and probably some of it was, but if we got down to the nitty-gritty of it, my ESFJ boyfriend was probably more concerned about being judged a terrible parent because his 13 year old son's ears had wax in them and he had a zit between his eyes.  People might think that as a Dad, my very conscientious boyfriend didn't give a shit about his kid.  He literally made him shower all over again.  ESFJ's really do concern themselves with what other's think and cannot stand to look like a loser in anyone's eyes.  I have said in other posts, many ESFJ's require a great deal of ego-stroking.  You have to let them know they are smart, resourceful, exacting, and that are the best at  (fill in the blank).  This might seem really tedious, especially to a type who doesn't give a damn about what anyone thinks and doesn't need that kind of affirmation.  This is where he and I are very different.  It's not that I don't care, but I am selective with whose opinions I value.  I don't require the same level of approval and back-slapping that he does.  I also don't require the same level of interaction with others, activity (he can be pretty frenetic sometimes), or attention to details.  We are very different, but we also choose daily to accept each other as we are.  I don't expect him to be like me.  I don't WANT him to be like me.  I want him to be his nit-picky, perfectionist, lovey-dovey, rooted in reality self.  Why?  Because it keeps my IDGAF, mediocre-is-okay, disaffected, up in the clouds somewhere tendencies at bay.  He balances me.  I balance him.  We're both mature enough (in our 40's) to realize that neither of us is going to change all that much.  I've learned to use my authentic voice with him, because when I try to pull my usual INFP nice-girl act with him, he calls me on it.  ""Just tell the truth"" he says, and after a long pause I will.  I always expect him to walk out and leave me afterward, because, well, don't people hate it when you're not nice all the time?  Don't I need to sugarcoat things with, well, everyone?  (INFP's understand), but he loves me-unquestionably, undeniably, the man loves me and he's committed to me and to our relationship.  This is one of the things I love the most about him.  The flip-side is, often he doesn't say things in a nice way (he's just blunt) like I would, and I sometimes get overly-sensitive to that.  He tries very, very hard to be gentle with me because of that, but sometimes...well, he's ESFJ and he just needs to have his say.  Differences can be appreciated.  Try to see your family members through a lens other than your own.  I've learned that when I ask him why he reacted a certain way, to ask in a caring, gentle tone (anything else comes off as criticizing and ESFJ's don't handle that well at all).  He calls it my ""Mom Voice""  LOL...but it works.  I always ask if he wants my advice-as a matter of fact I just realized that in the year we've been together, he tends to ask ME for advice rather than me asking if he WANTS my advice, so...progress.  Be patient with them.  They're wonderful, loving, giving people...don't let their edges scare you.  They sometimes don't realize they can be hurtful with those edges.  Remember not to take it personally (so hard to do..but it's the truth).  They're that way with EVERYONE!"
764,esfj,"Never underestimate the effect of trauma on a person, regardless of their MBTI type. Trauma changes people in ways that even they don't like.
You're likely correct that your dad holds being a good father and family man in high esteem; it's a trademark of ESFJ. I see a lot of practical statements being made by your dad, and that's an SJ thing (Part of what N-types don't like about S-types. The J only magnifies it.). Sounds like your father might be suppressing his Ne, which, if true, is a real shame bc that's likely where the the two of you would connect the best. Get our Ne going, and ESTJs will light up with all kinds of stories and ideas and whatnot. Yes, we prefer to use our Ne to come up with ideas or solutions that have practical application, but, since we are v socially malleable (thanks, Fe), we have no problem grooving on ideas for idea-sake. We really almost cannot help giving advice, sorrynotsorry. So much of your explanation screams Typical Dad (Parent) Type to me; he wants you to make something of yourself, he wants to know that you can stand on your own, that you won't be dependent on him forever, and that's why he prods for practical application. PROFOUND THEORIES DON'T PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE, SON. Unless you can find a way to either sell or market that profound idea ;) 
Sometimes there are parts of us that we love that we aren't able to share with those close to us bc they just don't get it, and they even get hurt or offended by it. My dad and I had the same sense of humor and my mom and I do not. Drives me nuts. We love each other and mostly get along, but we would not be friends if we weren't related.  "
765,esfj,"ESFJ's like to pull from experiences they've already had.  So when we INxP's come at them with theories and ideas they really have trouble shifting their thinking into that mode.  It seems like a waste of time for them.  I kind of find it sad, because they close themselves off to a lot of possibilities when they do this.  Just because the last time you went to the grocery store they were out of your favorite beer, and this has happened twice now, that doesn't necessarily mean that's the worst grocery store in the world and the whole chain needs to be shut down for good.  (LOL)  But this is how they think...if it happened before, it's most likely that it will happen again and again.  So, the possibility of a different and better outcome (""Yay!  They have 12 cases of your favorite beer!  We don't have to drive 15 miles to get it!"") just becomes highly unlikely to them.  Also, ESFJ's feel A LOT.  If you scratch that surface enough, they will be unable to keep those very deep, very real feelings covered up for long.  They're sensitive and caring people, for the most part.  That's just not for public consumption.  They hold that very close to the vest, so to speak.  If your dad lost these loved ones early in his life, my guess would be he reveres their memories and holds them very close in his thoughts.  Nobody loves like an ESFJ; that's why they feel everything so strongly, even the sad stuff.  They really do feel deeply.  I don't think your father is so much ""threatened"" by your theoretical yarns and soundings as he is confused and challenged by them.  Remember, ESFJ's don't really do theories and ideas well.  They can, when they have to, but tapping into that ability seems like a lot of fluff when they can just pull from their past and say, ""Well, your likely outcome is this because I've seen/done/witnessed it happen like that.""  Again, the elimination of possibilities.  If an ESFJ is going to put work into something (and he would see theorizing and hypothesizing as work) there had better be something to show for it, by God!  Otherwise, time, resources and energy were wasted.  We INxP's think that's blasphemous, but for the ESFJ, it's the truth.  They need tangible results.  Might-coulds and maybe's hold no worth to them.  Good luck, and keep dreaming...surround yourself with other dreamers and don't give up on your dad.  Just try to be understanding and learn his language.  It will be a gift to you both. "

767,esfj,"Many of the responses that are received regarding the open discussion of telepathy are not about getting to the truth of what is real or not real regarding ESP, it’s about who the smartest individual is, and who can control how people think the most. The biggest egos that like CONTROL over others are usually the first to attack and discredit. This is true all across the board with other writers that also embrace psychic phenomena, not just with what I have written in the past. Many individuals that write about ESP and psychic functioning are immediately discredited and attacked by arrogant, closed minded, control freaks. They don’t like being figured out, they don’t like losing control, and they don’t like being seen for who they are deep down. Anyone with a negative attitude towards other human beings – those that like authority and control over other people – do not like it when highly aware individuals focus on the emotions that they put out to other people. The truth is this: all of us can sense positive-feeling vibrations, which are emotions and thoughts from other individuals, and all of us can sense bad-feeling vibrations. There is no denying this fact. This information exists everywhere in pop culture. It cannot be hidden and swept under a rug any longer.
Big egos like authority and control, and they don’t much care for individuals that are pushing forward ESP and telepathy, even though it is the truth. We all observe it, and we all experience it. Awareness of ESP empowers the individual that embraces it, and disempowers individuals that seek authority and control over other human beings. Basically it’s like this: when someone starts talking openly about ESP and psychic awareness, big egos and control freaks get really pissed off. And this post will piss a lot of them off, but that’s OK – they need to be more observant with their thoughts, lighten up a bit, and relinquish control over other human beings and how they think. 
“Pseudoscience” is a favorite word of the big ego. It’s a vague term that is used quite often to discredit the intelligence and intellect of those that want to study ESP openly. Remote viewing, which is psychic functioning based on telepathy and the ascertainment of data outside of the 5 senses, was developed with the scientific method and double-blind experiments. “Remote viewing” is a science based term that was developed from scientific experiments. This is a fact that cannot be denied. The federal government funded the development and use of remote viewing for intelligence operations, and I have no doubt that it is still being used today. Anyone familiar with quantum mechanics knows about the observer effect, wave/particle duality, and quantum entanglement. Our minds have a DIRECT IMPACT on that of which we observe, and removal of conscious observation of a target or object at a distance collapses the particle into the wave. Our minds perceive in a “non-localized” fashion, and this means that space/time becomes irrelevant when we focus our minds on an object. This is not “pseudoscience”. These are scientific facts. 
I want to take this a step further and say that when other individuals think about us, all of us can sense this focus of thought. This is an observation of mine, but it has also been proven scientifically as well. Dr. Dean Radin has studied this phenomenon specifically in a scientific lab setting. It’s real. We don’t really need scientific studies to tell us this is so, however. We have emotional connectivity and personal observation, which lead us to direct experience – something much more powerful. 
When I write these posts based on telepathy and ESP and post them online, I can immediately sense, via my feelings, when other individuals are reading them. I can FEEL the anger and arrogance and disagreement and the need to discredit what I am writing about. It’s all about control, and many individuals feel intellectually inferior to those that embrace ESP openly and without any doubt. And this is WHY these lower feeling thoughts/emotions are being expressed. Our feelings tell us what kinds of emotions are being directed towards us by other individuals, and because our emotions and thoughts are intrinsically linked, we can tell if other individuals are thinking either positively or negatively about us when they are thinking about us. None of us need the scientific method to know this. We all experience it. When another person is actively thinking about us, we become “emotionally entangled” with that individual, and we can feel what the attitude this individual is expressing towards us. There is no denying this fact of reality. Individuals that are controlling and have poor (authoritative) attitudes towards other individuals do not like it when feelings and emotions are openly discussed. This means they are being figured out for who they are deep down and how they think. Most of the time, their thoughts are not very kind or humble. No one likes it when they are being exposed for who they are deep down, especially when they are mean-spirited, arrogant, and unrefined. All of us can sense good vibes and bad vibes – and these are not just “vibes” (an incredibly vague term used to discredit the perceptions of other individuals) – they are thoughts. Our thoughts determine what kind of “vibes” we are sending out to other people, do you not agree?
All of us, including myself, have big egos that need refinement in some way. This is humility. When we refuse to judge, and we see each other as growing individuals. I choose to refine my thoughts, and I spend a lot of my free time, asking for no compensation from other people, teaching what I know is true about reality. It takes a lot of time to write posts such as these. Most of the responses are harsh criticisms based out of ego, and not out of honesty and humility. These individuals feel threatened by what I am writing, and they should be if they are unkind and refuse to refine their own egos (the expression of truth and humility). A higher awareness of ESP and telepathy is incredibly threatening to the authoritative control freak that seeks power over other individuals. These behaviors and attitudes are rooted in low self-esteem (the need to be better than other individuals). Most of the responses are harsh criticisms, but I get the sense that there are many more that are thankful for what I am writing, because it puts them into a higher awareness immediately and empowers them. These writings are for those individuals that care about other people, are kind, and do not seek power, control and authority over others.
I expect that, after I post this essay, many will begin to criticize it unfairly and be angry about it. They will most likely express that this post does not belong here, has no relation to MBTI, is off topic, is pseudoscience, has no intellectual bearing on reality itself, or any other putdowns or criticisms they can think of for the purposes of DISCREDITING what I have written. Many will attempt to use sarcasm as a hidden effort to discredit as well. Some individuals may even contact a moderator to block me from posting in the future, because they do not like what I am writing about. These are common reactions from individuals that want to control how other people think and what is being openly expressed. If there is one topic – and one topic only – that stirs the hornet nest the most, it is telepathy and ESP. This is because we are changing reality for what it is, and many individuals are just not ready to grow. They want to keep how they really think towards other people hidden, and remain controlling, judgmental Individuals that are bossy only care about power and authority, the do not care about refining the self. There is a direct correlation between higher intellectual functioning, and kindness, humility and honesty.
I am not writing this to outsmart anyone, but to expose reality for what it is. If you don’t like this essay, NO HARD FEELINGS, OK?
A few points I wanted to make:
1.  The emotional states of individuals do not traverse space/time. Emotional synchronization between individuals (feelings) is non-localized in nature. All of us can feel love (high emotion thoughts – kindness, honestly, humility), and all of us can feel hate (authority, fear, control, pessimism). We are emotionally connected, and it does not matter how far our bodies are separated. If another person has a negative attitude towards us and is holding us in their thoughts, or if that person is actively thinking about us to communicate, we can feel the direction of their thoughts. Our thoughts are either loving, kind and gentle, or they are not.
2.  Skepticism regarding ESP does not mean to criticize unendedly. It means that we are also open to the possibility that it is real. If we constantly look for reasons that ESP is not real and put down people that are curious about it, this is not skepticism, this is control. Control can be in the form of derogatory comments, sarcasm, put downs, etc. Skepticism requires us to ask for CLARIFICATION, it does not mean that we detract over and over and over without any sort of objectivity.
3.  We can sense not only direct thinking (telepathy), but also attitude (our vibe) of other individuals. Our attitude is determined by the habitual thoughts that we have about other people. If we habitually think unkind thoughts, have big egos, and look down on other people, we transmit a low vibe towards other people. We may not be actively thinking about another individual, but that individual will be able to pick up our attitude and current emotional state via feelings quite easily. 
4.  Telepathy is obvious when we stop actively thinking within and start watching the mind. When we stop actively thinking, we will see that the inner conversations and thoughts within our minds still continue. All of us hear these voices. There is no schizophrenia. There is only telepathy. We can all communicate with each other telepathically, and we can also communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death.

768,esfj,"It's so difficult to be a wife to someone who makes enemies when you are an ESFJ. He is ENTJ, and doesn't care for creating harmony at the expense of his own pride. I am stubbornly loyal to him, but I NEED harmony, with him but also with everyone in our lives. I end up feeling the need to demonize people that he simply doesn't like so I can feel like I'm on his side and supporting him. 
It's so conflicting, I just wish he cared more about everyone getting along. 
How do I separate my own opinions from his, while still showing him love and support? "
769,esfj,"As an ENTJ, I think he'd appreciate it more if you come clean to him about how harmful his bridge-burning tendencies are, and how unfair it is to you. It will be conflict-inducing, and there will be a fight in the beginning, but in the long run it's better for the relationship because he'll respect your honesty and assertiveness, and gain a new perspective on why his behavior is troubling to you. But if you are going to duke it out, you gotta be strong, and make sure that if he makes you feel like crap to prove a point, you can take it."
770,esfj,"This sub is quiet so I'll give you my two cents. I'm an INTP but my wife is an ESFJ. As you can imagine our opinions are often worlds apart. What saves us is that are values are quite similar. That sounds conflicting but the point is if you share overall big picture values the smaller opinionated differences don't really matter and you need to be able to tell the difference. It's also easier for us because we have children together so her 'love and support' is doing all the mom stuff- which is incredible work that I could never do. Seeing each other's strengths is important, and as an ESFJ I would say this is especially important cause you guys tend to see the world through a narrow perspective. My wife is still very ESFJ but being married to me has helped her become a bit more open minded and I can tell more accepting of the fact that we differ in opinion on things and that's alleviated much friction."
771,esfj,"Ooh this is a tough lesson for ENTJ to learn. They have to know and recognize they have a problem first.
It's an underdeveloped inferior Fi. 
Get him to develop that somehow. You might just tell him?"
772,esfj,"I could write a bunch of stuff, but Im gonna link my latest post that refers to her. Maybe that gives you enough of an foundation to work on.
https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/76r37t/help_me_type_my_crush_for_bored_liketotypeothers/?ref=share&ref_source=link
To sum-it up she is in her mid twenties, kinda ambitious and trying to be organizing events and stuff regarding her studies. When i talk to her it seems like she enjoys traveling,nature and beeing active. 
Gotta admit, i do not know her to well,but hopefully will, after I ask her out. (Wish me luck :D)"
773,esfj,"Sorry for the late reply. I asked my friend who's also ESFJ (I'm an ESFJ dude, figured her advice would be better).
On the surface, she's kind of similar to this girl I know. Her best general advice would be to try and engage her interests, without trying to pretend to be an expert about it (like researching soccer because she likes it and pretending you've played since you were a kid). Just showing interest in what she likes and being willing to try stuff out. 
The girl I asked is a huge runner, and she loves when guys who show interest talk to her intelligently about running (not saying how it's horrible for your knees or joking about how sedentary they were - that's a huge turn off for her). 
Her and I both agree that being clear about your intentions isn't a bad idea. We both hate when asking someone out is a drawn-out process of second-guessing and stuff like that. So keep that in mind.
Hope this jumbled post helps. Good luck!"
774,esfj,"Thank you so much! 
Really helps getting a different perspective on that. Kinda would like to know so much stuff from you both :)
So what would be the best approach to ask her out ? I really like her but I know we INFJs tend to overthink sometimes whether or not we are coming off too strong. 
Appreciate the help! :)"
775,esfj,"No problem!!!
Unfortunately, this is down to personal preference, which can be affected both by personality and individual experiences with dating.
Does she seem like the type of person to want someone to be direct? If so, just ask her straight up. ""Hey, want to do/go to ____ this weekend?"" Something simple. 
That's what I'd prefer, but she may be different. I don't really know what to suggest if she's the type who wants to be chased or something. However... What I wouldn't do is make it weirdly obvious about your interest without actually making a move. I've never seen that one go well.
Whatever you choose, I'll keep you in my thoughts! I know how nerve-racking this can be!  "
776,esfj,"Hope Im not doing this right now 🙈 
I apologize for asking once more : 
The situation we both are in is that she is kinda busy as well as me. So i am waiting for a better time to ask her to grab a coffee but is this the right approach? Or do you think she might lose interest if we dont engage for a while? 
Add. problem might be that Im not a great texter. So I am not texting with her a lot. I prefer talking to her in person. Do you think thats a subject where I should probably engage more? I do not know how ESFJs think about that stuff. 
Last but not least any stuff I should avoid doing with you guys? 
Sorry for being so greedy for your knowledge. Im just fascinated with you guys  :>"
777,esfj,"Not a problem, ask me whatever whenever you need! I can't speak for her completely, but I can try my best to help.
How long will this be for? I understand being busy, but is this going to be for a month or what? Personally, I would try and schedule meetups once in a while and make it known that you're available and will make room for her (reasonably) without putting too much pressure on her to fall behind with what she's busy with. 
How old are you two if I may ask? I was obsessed with texting until I was like 20 and, as a 23 y/o who graduated college, I mostly use texting for making plans. I actually accidentally ghost people a lot just because texting is in the very back of my mind. I can't say if she's like that, but obviously if she's trying to converse with you over text, you'd better answer. :P
As for avoiding, I would just make sure that conversations go both ways. Take interest in what she's saying (don't just say uh-huh all the time lol) but don't ramble on and on. Certain introverts with N (I see this with both Ne and Ni) can just keep talking once you get on a topic you're passionate about, haha! That's not a huge problem as long as you keep it as a dialogue. Other than that, just be friendly and be as socially acceptable as you know how, at least in public. :P
Again, if you have more questions, I'm all ears. Either here or pm. :)"
778,esfj,"Sorry for answering back so late! Little bit short on time lately :)
Im currently postponing it for a better time, maybe a week or two. Maybe longer but no exact date planned. The situation is a little bit more complicated you could say. 
I am 23, while she is 25. Well Im very similar to you then. Accidentely ghosting people sometimes and such. But I do not think that I do that with her. Our conversations are generally not too long via text anyways. Due to me being a little bit averse to texting I guess.
Generally I tend to adapt and listen to most extroverts and add my part to the conversation. But with her, I find myself acting ""strange"". Talking more about myself, which I am not used to. Guess she is nice and asks about a lot of stuff about me. :)
If you dont mind I'll pm you to explain our situation a little bit more detailed. Do not want to keep this thread going forever. haha ^^"
779,esfj,"As friends I find it frustrating, annoying and so different. But then a relationship might be different. As an ESFJ, I find ESFP too fluffy, not having a plan or being organised, just do whatever their heart tells them at any point without any kind of logic. They get hurt because they want to be loved even worse than ESFJs. Yeah, maybe it's just because I'm over the stories of my friend but again as I said, a relationship may be different."
780,esfj,"It's called ""quasi-identical"" relationship by socionics. It's one of the easiest relationships to start and can be attractive and inspire crushes, but over time it turns annoying. The more you talk, the more a certain sense of irritation arises, yet it is also very easy to talk and you'll often have some common interests: MBTI type matches for ESFJs"
781,esfj,"hey dude, i totally agree. i (esfp) had an esfj friend and it fell apart after 4 wonderful years of friendship. i think there's always a restlessness within the friendship, and despite the two being similar in ESFx, there is actually a lot of disparities in communication and values. its too bad because there tends to be some good chemistry, its just hard to maintain especially after big fights/incidents.
just crossing my fingers that relationships are different.y ee e e sh"
782,esfj,"Literally talks and talks and talks and talks to no end with no idea that we're getting bored an exhausted of listening despite one-word responses and grunts... too sensitive to just be like ""dude please stop talking"". She always looks like someone's about to punch her and is more concerned about being everyone's friend than about what is actually good for them... tells the same stories over and over in the exact same way and will just talk at you and trap you even if you're hardly responding or not responding at all. Seems to feel the need to tell people every single detail her brain can possibly rack up and makes that shitty face so nobody gets the cojones to ask her to be excused.  
How on earth do I deal with this person who won't stop talking? I even had a conversation with her telling her, ""hey, I get pretty exhausted from talking quickly so I just wanted to let you know because I don't know how to tell you"". She just defended herself the whole time saying, ""sometimes I get carried away"". You think I don't know??? At this point people avoid her just to keep from getting trapped. Is there any way to go about this or am I just going to have to deal with it forever? I'm stuck being around her most of the time so it's not like I can just leave. "
783,esfj,"Sounds like insecurity. ESFJs tend to have trouble with introspection. Try using your Fe and get deep into her (gross dude...). Do this: https://www.wikihow.com/Practice-Compassion-Meditation Be her ""introspection guru"". Notice her function usage and try to see the reasons behind it. It's like Ne psychoanalysis. Then, take the function she's using into account, her type into account, and work from there.
A lot of people in society need therapists, and they don't know it. This is one of the reasons we see people like that. You may not legally be qualified to be her therapist, but there are things you can do to help.
I'm an INTP who has grown up with a narc and had a low EQ. It warped my sense of self and sense of the world around me. Eventually, I stopped believing anything my parents said. Neither knew what they were talking about, and my mom just tried manipulating. This is why I was so awkward and sucked at socializing. The low EQ caused emotions to seep out in various ways. I'd talk a ton and make way too many jokes, because I wanted attention and validation which I was deprived of.
Perhaps this ESFJ is experiencing something similar."
784,esfj,"I think ESFJs have a hard time taking a hint. I don't know with other ESFJs but I appreciate honest and straightforward people. I prefer them being straight to the point with their feelings because it is harder for me to read their true feelings. I appreciate that because it shows that people still want to compromise with me and still make it work somehow with me, by stating the things that I do that they do not like. So that we can make it work in the future. However, I have already trained myself for this. Others may be too sensitive, depending on the person. Maybe you can tell the person in a more straightforward but nice way. We really have a hard time picking up hints, so I do not recommend that."
785,esfj,"loool
Doesn't sound like an healthy person. These are the people that scare the shit out of me, an adult ESFJ I know is nearly like that and, man, she wants you to feel her anxiety... Even if you're clearly uncomfortable, she'll keep pushing until she's got it all out.
Set boundaries, be clear, offer a compromise. You don't have to be uncomfortable with her, it's not good to neither of you. Assert yourself, remind her that you already told her that you get uncomfortable: ""sometimes"" she gets carried away, ""sometimes"" you get exhausted (regardless of who is speaking, it's the format itself). I'd suggest not to just dismiss her, to rather involve her so she can make a choice and have a chance to improve her behavior. Don't be manipulative, don't be ambiguous, don't be rude. My 2 cents."
786,esfj,This really is what it's like. Include her in what way? Sometimes I feel scared to do so cause it just feels like a trap... as if there's just no way to talk to her that doesn't result in a whirlpool of nonsense.
787,esfj,We get a lot of our self worth from what others think. So it depends how it happens. Saying it’s not you its me is the worst way to dump us. We will blame ourselves. You gotta pin point the actual reason and be honest. 
788,esfj,"Depends on their attachment style, how the breakup occurred, etc.  Big triggers would be shared social network where the Fe function would focus on how the change in group dynamic will effect all the friendships. "
789,esfj,"That sounds like the first reaction they have would be to question if something is wrong with them...
What if the dumper didn't give a good reason, maybe something along the lines of 'I have to figure myself out""?"
790,esfj,"Oh that reason is bad. Happened to me personally. If that is true, well think it’s an excuse because you don’t want to hurt our feelings. Our feelings don’t get hurt by anything expect the unknown. I can handle anything that’s thrown at me except that. 
Side note, is that an excuse or not? I always wondered when I was broken up with. 
Second side note. Do you feel you need to work on yourself because the ESFJ seems so out together. I always get people saying ESFJs  “adult” better than everyone else and seem put together. "
791,esfj,"Yes, that is part of it but also they will focus on how mutual friends will deal with the awkward situations, side taking, etc. They may become isolated because of those situations but it depends on how close their ex was to their group.  "
792,esfj,"Ouch, I'm sorry that happened to you. 
It does sound like an excuse. They also sound like they might be keeping the person they dumped on hold/on the fishing line. 
I'm not ESFJ but I think any type would need to constantly work on themselves. One never stops learning in life :) 
Going by what I've heard, I suppose the ESFJ wants to present the best version of themselves to fulfil the expectations of those around them. As they generally desire to be liked and please a their group of friends/peers, it may be why you say ESFJs tend to appear 'put together' or maybe a better word, the  model figure. "
793,esfj,"Hi all,
 I'm an ENTP male and my ESFJ platonic friend of almost a year have suddenly gotten emotionally close lately . She's a green-eyed Irish gal who I think very much of and whose opinions I highly respect. She's whip smart, cute as a button but often downs herself or semi rejects compliments. Because she works just about every day, I'm lucky to hang out with her once a week for a couple of hours at a local watering hole. We text often  (I haven't touched or kissed her yet) but things really got hot over last weekend and I'm afraid I'm coming on too strong and might scare her away or into silence.  We have texted each other hundreds of times in the past few weeks and she has shown interest. 
Because from what I've read about ESFJ's, they tend to take even the slightest of criticism to heart or may misread signals.  I made a parting text comment last night and I'm not sure how she may have taken it.  I don't want to be a PITA (as ENTPs can get when they have their eyes on something they want) but it seems as though I initiate the daily contact. 
I asked her to text me first next for the PITA reason. Now I'm unsure of how that was taken. She's going through her own family issues and I don't want to complicate her life but I really don't want to say the wrong thing. Do I just wait and see or after a time should I just say hi?  Thanks for your time!"
794,esfj,"I would say just be honest with her about your concerns, and use ""I"" statements. 
""I've noticed you're acting different lately. Is everything okay? Do you want to talk about it?"" Something like that. 
If she says she doesn't want to speak about it, tell her that you understand and that you're here for her support. 
(Not sure what's going on, but she'll become a puddle of emotions at this, and any possible grievances should be forgiven. Eventually, I hope that it will allow her to open up. ESFJs can be pretty closed off during difficult times)."
795,esfj,"Thanks! I'll definitely keep that in mind. I did end up asking if she was okay and as I expected, my ENTP freight train was just too much too fast and I overwhelmed her. 
I agreed to back off, and as the original reply mentioned, talking in person may be best as texting conveys nothing but words. I hope to see her this weekend and get things straight face to face."
796,esfj,"Hey don't beat yourself up. I can understand as I've experienced the 'ENTP' freight train myself and it is actually quite charming lol
The fact that you're going out of your way for her really says something about your relationship, and also you as a person. :)"
797,esfj,"I am trying, I just don't want to try TOO hard. ENTPs are horrible about reading subtle emotions. I can spot a BS artist a mile away, but it's tough to always know how a comment or reply is received. So I freak out (in my head) thinking the worst and what I need to do when often, I don't have anything to worry about. Meanwhile, she may be feeling the same way, not wanting to reply the wrong way! We're all the same and we're all different."
798,esfj,"there's a plus and minus point to that. because I pay so much on those ""microexpressions"" it can be a pain in the neck. I can sometimes lose confidence mid-sentence by focusing on someone else's subtle changes, and thinking I'm saying something that isn't being received well. Hell, they might not mean anything sometimes. I was always very envious about how ENTPs rarely shy away from conflict!"
799,esfj,"Prizing social validation and a sense of belonging so highly, romantic relationships hold a special level of importance for ESFJs. No other kind of relationship provides people with the ESFJ personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming.
ESFJs don't do casual flings – they need to know that their partners will always be by their sides offering unwavering support, and marriage and family are the ultimate goal.
With such a goal in mind, ESFJ personalities take each stage, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about ESFJs' relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs, from creating understanding early on to building mutual respect and support for each other's opinions and goals. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated has a huge effect on ESFJs' mood and self-esteem.
If they feel like this support isn't there, such as when their partners deliver criticism, ESFJs can feel extremely hurt. People with the ESFJ personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to ESFJs than to realize that their partners don't respect their dreams or opinions. ESFJs can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partners are behind them 100%.
Unfortunately, less mature ESFJs may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can be very needy, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partners' approval. This is a terrible trap – not only is it unattractive, it can too easily lead to emotionally abusive relationships, which reduce ESFJs' self-esteem further. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval – it's not uncommon for ESFJs' social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partners than even their own values.
ESFJs are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They are great with practical matters like money management and administrative tasks, and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about, a wonderful quality. ESFJs just need to make sure they take the time to ensure that they build relationships that allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams, with partners who appreciate their care and generosity fully, and who reciprocate as well.
ESFJs are often very organized in how their relationships develop, following established dating rules and traditions (don't call first, third date, etc.). As their relationships enter more sexual stages, ESFJs' emphasis on process and tradition continue with established gender roles and socially acceptable activities.
However, since ESFJs are so centered on the physical world and are quite emotional, they tend to be very affectionate and sensual, and overall great sexual partners. People with this personality type love to find ways to make their partners happy, and this sort of intimacy is a great way to do so. As the two partners become more comfortable with each other, ESFJs are often open to experimenting and trying new things, so long as their partners are willing to reciprocate.
ESFJs have specific needs for their relationships, and certain personality types are best able to meet those needs. In general, partners should share ESFJs' Observant (S) trait, but it can also be useful to develop a sense of introspection that Introverted (I) partners can provide, with maybe one more opposing trait to help ESFJs focus on logical decisions when appropriate, or to be more open-minded in new situations."
800,esfj,"A little backstory to this friendship (this is going to be complicated). About 9 months ago in May 2013, this friend of mine, lets call her K, reached out to me and wanted to talk to me. She was going through a really tough relationship where her ex basically didn't care for her at all but she was having trouble trying to break off. She felt terrible so she kind of turned to me and talked to me. And well, over the next few months we started texting each other much much more, almost on a daily basis. We went out a couple of times for dinner and saw each other occasionally in university. Fast-forward to August, I was suspecting she was trying to get close to me and I was already starting to really like her since we hit it off really well. Then all of a sudden she became a little distant and cold. So feeling really uncomfortable, I eventually confessed to her that I liked her (she was still attached). She thanked me for my honesty and told me that she did indeed consider me as a bf, but she was still hoping for her best for her relationship. Surprisingly, things weren't awkward at all between us even after that confession, in fact we got closer afterwards.
So things progressed and this time round we gradually got closer, met up more, and she felt even more strongly then that I could be a good bf to her. There were a couple of bumps along the way, whenever I made a mistake that she couldn't sit well with, she would essentially ignore me and refuse to talk to me for extended periods of time (1 to 2 weeks). That made me very distressed as I needed the interaction and that I was getting comfortable with her.
She eventually broke up at the end of November, nearly 4 months ago. So yes, we grew even closer again, with her sharing how she felt and wondering why she did not meet me earlier. At that time she was basically behaving wildly and just wanted to #YOLO and go crazy. Eventually she calmed down and sometime in late January she told me that she was basically in love with me. In effect we were unofficially together, but she was holding back because she wasn't sure if I was going to be that life partner that she really wanted. In late February she told me that it would be better for us if we stayed a little further apart. I was pretty devastated at that time but I agreed to it. But with the exception of calling each other every night, we still talked on a daily basis and were very comfortable with each others' presence in our lives, that we would turn on Skype and leave it on while doing our own work. (Yes I'm 25, she's 22, we live in Singapore and the apartments here are at least half a million USD. It's normal in our culture to live with our family until we're married.)
Recently 2 weeks ago, she suddenly gave me a very cold shoulder, stopped talking for several days. I asked her if everything was okay, she replied yeah. So I voiced my concerns but she saw that as me being oversensitive and kicking up a fuss just because we couldn't talk. In the few days following after that, having been ignored for over a week, and finding out a little more from a friend. She said she had decided that we should just be friends and basically stop anything intimate or close (which we've been since 9 months ago). Naturally this made me feel really heartbroken inside, it was kind of like a relationship already, why the sudden change? Things became quite bad and awkward, she wouldn't reveal anything about her daily life, just necessary work discussion, we were becoming hi and bye friends, even worse than when we started.
I decided to find out more from her best friend (INTJ). According to her, K has been thinking really hard about her prospects with me and she couldn't bring herself to love me enough. I highlighted the time period when she actually liked me, but then it felt like an infatuation period all of a sudden. Am I right to say that? Her best friend also told me that all of a sudden, everything that I did to her, or did in general, that was once really charming, became irritating. That she probably realised that me and K had some serious incompatibilities, even as friends. This sudden 180 degree turn just blew my mind, I couldn't wrap my head around it. Her best friend did try to defend me by saying that she was being unnecessary biased, and that K's actions for hardening her heart were because God told her and gave her the will to do (yes she's Christian but let's not go any further into it if you aren't a believer). Perhaps she was trying to justify all her actions by using God as a reason. And to add on, this sudden change coincided with her changing her lifestyle drastically, she suddenly woke up much earlier to do her work (we're in crunch time now trying to complete a major project), and stress levels are peaking for everyone. She also decided to #YOLO a little more and started hanging out with other people and message others, instead of me, which made me really jealous.
Yesterday she was really mean to me in front of everyone, refusing to help me and clearly putting distance between me and her, although she realised later that it was really bad and she apologised and tried to be friendlier to me. She's still really cold towards me.
We have decided to actually talk it out, with her best friend around (she knows everything) some time after our major project is done, which is in about a week's time. And I really want to get prepared and not get hurt. None of us is able to understand what K is thinking right now, our mutual friends (INFJ), her best friend (INTJ) were all just confused with her actions and behaviour and just wondering what she could be thinking, especially with respect to that 180 degree change.
I do know ESFJs are people who feel really bad about hurting others, but this time round it all just seems really paradoxical and it doesn't align with her character at all. After all this came from a girl who considered other guys and still found me to be the best, and yet suddenly started this ""ignore me"" thing only 2 weeks after that comment.
She seems to be running away from her problems and covering it up with a veil, of course hurting me and leaving all her friends really confused as to what is going on. Really, I've been the consistent one throughout the entire time, and her whims and temperaments have been swinging wildly. Maybe I should have taken control of the situation more (I let her control most of the things as I felt she was the one that needed the recovery). But right now the most important thing is trying to figure out what in the world is going through in her head so I can prepare to talk to her, and to protect myself from any further heartbreak."
801,esfj,"I don't have any immediate advice, but all I have to say is to make sure you don't become the (no offense) 'bitch' boy. Know that while you do care for her, there should be a certain point when you distance yourself from her if she keeps putting you on a rollercoaster. You HAVE to make sure you're being cared for too."
802,esfj,Thanks for the heads up. I'll try to talk things through slowly. The reason why I actually asked about ESFJ is because it might help me understand her thought processes and help me to answer in a way that she better understands things.
803,esfj,"i'm happily in a relationship with my boyfriend, but there are times when he won't go out of his way to show how caring he is with me. i know it's not done on purpose, but it makes me feel like there will be occasions where i will get him something when i know he'll love it, or when i go abroad i'll bring him back a present, or offer him some of my food when  he wouldn't do the same in return (he finds the concept of sharing food difficult haha)
i feel that i would do 10x more things for him unsaid, whereas i feel i have to push him to get him to do things which makes me feel meh
he does care about me, but often i'll feel like he does the bare minimum. which is unfair for me to feel since 1) he does, but probably shows it in other ways e.g. physical touch, sex and 2) i'm an ESFJ and he's not, and we're care bear overloads, so it's probably me underrating it?"
804,esfj,"Think it’s the latter. My bestfriend is ESFJ and ever since i can remember, she’s been like this. The type who says ‘i would have done this for you and i am disappointed that you didn’t’;
it is actually a very nice trait that you guys have so many ways of showing care and appreciation to your people but expecting the same back kinda takes something away from it. 
Not everyone has the same methods of showing care and love, if we all did, humans would be a very boring species. This is something ESFJs really need to realise: you cannot expect exactly what you do to be done to you. 
And i am pretty sure you wouldn’t be happy if i ask you to not give so much if it hurts you, because that is your thing. You do it selflessly and nothing can stop you from that. Just work on your expectations and look for what your partner actually does for you even if it’s tiny or non-materialistic. "
805,esfj,"Replace don't chase.
Or.
Accept who you are and your needs, and accept others as they are and their needs.
If you need more than someone is willing to give you, then you have a problem. It means you're either with the wrong person, or your expectations are way high."
806,esfj,"If I understand what you're saying, then yes.
I think we are harder on other Esfjs than we are on other types simply because we see and understand their flaws, and it disgusts us. Plus, it is seen as ""cool"" in society to bash ESFJ-esque behavior, so the internal disgust just increases. "
807,esfj,"I dunno my uncle and aunt are like that and I don't think it is bad for children much. I haven't got many opportunities when I was young to play chess, do karate or swimming as my cousins do. They push a little their children when it comes to studying. One thing that triggers me that one of their children shows some sort of inferior Fi/dom Fe and it is consider for them as bad. Also they indicate she won't make it academically. They literally said that except his other child who shows some sort of cunning abilities. 
Sorry to bother you with that. "
808,esfj,"you aren't bothering me! 
​
You mean the parents think a child won't make it far academically if they have inferior fi or dom fe?
​"
809,esfj,"I will correct two things first it is a boy not a girl and I am ISFJ. 
Also he spends time playing video games which is literally haram for parents I just don't like not giving someone chances or treating him like inferior. Just flashbacks from my childhood."
810,esfj,"Sorry but... I just got confused by your post and could not connect it to what i wrote lol. I was talking about this trope and not actually a mom playing soccer just FYI. 
It's so cool to see dom-Si in action though. I can't believe you guys basically live your life getting an insane number of flashbacks all day lol :D"
811,esfj,"ENFP here married to ESFJ so I don't actually qualify to answer this through my ENFP bias buuuut, he can only handle one of me, and doesn't naturally connect with ENFP friends in his social environments, but we have a lot of fun together and have a very happy marriage (6 years now). I push him toward constant personal growth and adventure and he keeps me grounded and helps me think about other people's feelings. Also his snap judgement of all other ENFPs is that they are shallow. "
812,esfj,"Hello, ESFJs, I'm an INTP. Me and another person were talking about how a lot of INTPs experience this, and which other personality types are more prone to experiencing it. I decided I'm going to go around all of the different reddits and ask. If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, basically it means you don't feel worthy of your successes, and you find it hard to be proud of achievements or accept compliments. You feel like a fraud, and that you got lucky to achieve what you have. You can Google it if you want to know more."
813,esfj,"I have a really good job making 6 figures. I’m definitely not the smartest, and I definitely don’t have the greatest work ethic. That being said, I still work hard and am smart, but some of my colleagues are mindblowingly amazing - and I don’t think they get the credit they deserve.
I’ve been in my field for 12 years, but only started specializing about 2 years ago. I know my “personality” is what gets me in the door because I’m friendly and outgoing. Also, people are happy to train and easy to forgive mistakes because I’m always kind and positive. 
I definitely suffered from imposter syndrome for a while and didn’t feel like I deserved my success, but now I’ve actually gotten really good at what I do! I think feeling that way sprinkled with a little “act like you belong” helped me become as successful as I am now.
So, if you’re feeling that way now, embrace it. Having people want you to succeed because they like you as a person is a good thing. Use it to your benefit and then you can help the next person too!"
814,esfj,"Big time! I feel like no one would ever love me beneath the cheerful polite surface. I don't want to say facade because it's not false, but I really worry about my inability to form deep connections lol"
815,esfj,"Why thank you! I definitely felt like some of my smarter friends (and me) felt like I kept falling ass backwards into better and better jobs, so it’s nice that I finally feel like I’ve earned it by finally excelling at it! Haha 
I’m a female, and a paralegal :) I just recently got into franchising and it’s a whole different world than what I’m used to. The job I have wanted 5+ years of franchise experience and I had zero, but they took the risk and trained me, and I somehow also negotiated a salary a little above what they had posted so I was lucky it worked out for me!
Are you seeing some obvious personality traits shine through in each of the subreddits you ask?
Edit- you’re not the OP, but I’ll leave the last question up anyways :)"
816,esfj,"I just though about that. Maybe it could be nice to chat with some ESFJ. If some people is interested I could start a room on a server.
Btw, don't count of me to preserve our privacy. 
Edit: I'm a ESFJ."
817,esfj,"I would be remiss if I didn't remind you that MBTI is a broad template from which to understand people. There is more variation in each type than pedophiles in the Catholic Church. 
Hi, I'm an INTP. You may remember me from such professions as engineering and programming. I would part the red sea for your tribe, as I do best with people of your transparent good-nature. I love puzzles, sure, but human puzzles are for another breed of personality. Your kind, anecdotally, is easier to read; not because you're less intelligent, but because you wear your heart on your sleeve. I hate reading sleeves for heart-stains, it's such tedious business. It's so refreshing to see palpating, beating hearts on your sleeves instead of extracellular outlines. "
818,esfj,"I love them, too. Its interesting to see how they think and live. My boyfriend is an INTP and sometimes I just sit there and watch him ""being"". We complete each other and every time I freak out for something, he is the one who calms me down. But I can't deny that it took time to realise how the other one works."
819,esfj,"I was good friends with an INTP for several years, and we got along well. I really enjoyed that I could quit worrying about proprieties and jump right into interesting conversations with her. Same thing with my ISTP best friend."
820,esfj,"Hahaha my ENFP friend does the same thing to me too; sometimes she just stares at me when I'm doing my own thing. I feel loved whenever a friend does this to me, because they understand that we have a lot going on underneath. It also makes me feel comfortable just by the fact that they acknowledge and accept this quality of mine, and that enables me to keep being myself. I don't know if your SO feels the same way about it, but I'm sure that they appreciate you a lot."
821,esfj,"And that is the flaw with the plan. Usually only people that i am very close with can tell. And if I am comfortable with them I feel more inclined to share. It is stupid and I don’t know why I do it, I just feel very guilty if I trouble people with myself. Also I share a lot of traits with ENFJs so I might be a little different from most ESFJs."
822,esfj,"I only tell white lies if I am uncomfortable with saying something that will hurt someone’s feelings. 
That being said, I’ll only go through if it doesn’t actually affect anything and won’t make a difference - I’ll usually try to be honest.
The other thing is I have been burnt too many times because I am so candid and freely expressive with my emotions. I have been judged for expressing my feelings even when asked so now I’ve learnt to keep it all in. It’s a bit sad but sometimes I just think I’m too naive to think everyone has your best intentions at heart. I have to remind myself of that often - you can’t really trust people. I still forget though. "
823,esfj,"I am not a liar or a white liar. What I am is too concerned with others' comfort and happiness that I sincerely fail to consider my own. It's not that I don't have preferences, it's just that my primary preference is others' preference. Secondarily, I'll express my preferences, but often times I'm not happy with that because I'd rather just have it your way so you're happy so I can be happy too. So, what may seem like a white lie to others is just me trying to identify their preferences and going along with that because I'll be happier that way. 
​
The older I've gotten and more I've been able to self-reflect, this is an odd quality... but it's also who I am. Does it position us to get taken advantage of by nefarious people? Absolutely. Learning the hard way... "
824,esfj,"Profoundly different. 
ESFJs speak in detail about every little thing most of the time. 
ENFJs speak about impressions that were left (feelings, experiences, etc.) a majority of the time. Also, if you pay attention to the way ENFJs speak they have a tough time being very direct about what it is they're talking about-they speak in generalities."
825,esfj,"I dated an ESFJ and talk to an ENFJ.
Loyalty:
ENFJ are outrageously loyal
ESFJ are loyal until something better comes along.  
Conflict:
ENFJ can handle it way better than ESFJ
ESFJ will break down so fast to conflict emotionally it's not even funny.
Decision making:
ENFJ are a little bit smarter about decisions. They make more future oriented choices rather than choices to handle current needs. Can't handle the short term very well however. 
ESFJ are sloppy decision makers in the long term. However on a day to day or even up to a few weeks basis, they are probably the best at planning down to the minute. 
Energy Projection:
ENFJ project a (less) positive energy into the world around them.
ESFJ project a very high amount of positive energy.
Extroversion style:
ENFJ are more likely to make lasting connections with people at the expense of fewer friends. However a lot more extroverted than myself (ENTP)
ESFJ can make new 'friends' with such an ease that it is not even funny. These 'friends' however are acquaintances and not actual friends. Undeveloped they will have a hard time finding true compatibility with people."
826,esfj,"ENFJs really want to change people from the inside and understand the individualism of each person. So be yourself, but be kind and loving to everyone philosophy. Furthermore, they really respect everyone's differences. Like they're cool with hippie ass people to corporate suits. 
ESFJs just want people to get in order with what they (the ESFJ) think is best. They're more collective with their thinking. They think if everyone is uniform, the world is great. ESFJs are usually cliquey and hang out with one type of group."
827,esfj,"I am ENTP here.
ENFJ are alright for sure. I only know of one which is not anywhere close to how well I knew the ESFJ that I once was involved with. Also using that info with what I have learned about them from their sub. 
Both have weak points and strong points and otherwise I really don't have a terrible amount to say about ENFJ more than that at this time."
828,esfj,"Training yourself to have conscious thoughts when talking to people, or doing things is so fun.
You feel like a whole different person than you were before (you know, less like an air-headed spacey fuck).
For example, when I was young, I wouldn't question what people would say, question who they are, or their motives. Now, every time someone has something to say, I tap into my Ne to find angles. Or, if my friend is telling a story, I'm trying to determine the implications. Yeah, I'm not as adept as most people, but it's fun using Ti for little stuff. Or... like when I was racing Go Karts, I'd talk to myself about what type of approaches made sense for the next corner while I was driving.
Anyways, you almost get a glimpse of what it's like to be ESTP, which I find pretty cool.
I think ESFJs on Reddit most likely use Ti actively. So props for you."
829,esfj,"ESFJ subtypes:
ESFJ-Fe - The feeling subtype is courteous and amiable, but stubborn and unyielding over important to him questions. Due to this can demonstrate excessive persistence. Inclined to finish what he has started. Finds it difficult to stop in timely manner, of which he may regret later. Tries to be serious, unobtrusive, and polite in dialogue, but often exerts strong emotional pressure upon those who, in his view, act wrongly. Likes to take his conversation partners by the hand, to touch their clothing. Knows how to host guests and visitors at home, but does so infrequently because he is more interested in public work and communication. - Full description
ESFJ-Si - The sensory subtype is energetic, work-oriented, and practical. Emotional and sufficiently direct, but also well-wishing, sensitive, and responsive towards other people. Able to correct impressions caused by his sharp statements. Self-confident, daring, and skillful in his ability to become liked by others. Coquettish and pleasant, creates an intimate atmosphere in conversation. Demonstrates physical tenderness, often embraces those who are sympathetic to them. Attentive towards people, very caring, and helpful, yet sometimes may raise a scandal if he doesn't like something. - Full description"
830,esfj,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
831,esfj,"My wife took the test and I did as well.
I have Aspergers and am very logical and reasoning...which means I tend to lag on the emotional front, although buddhism and meditation and studying others has helped a bit. 
But we do have misunderstandings since we got married (1 yr ago yesterday) and I care for her deeply, even if it's not the Love most people think of, as I feel that is not an emotion I can grasp. 
I try and show her, but it's not in the manner she thinks conveys love. Thus, she feels I am disinterested and then becomes very emotional and, to me, an emotional hurricane that I must take cover from...
How can we deal with each other, as we DO compliment each other well from a family stand point"
832,esfj,"I'm an INTJ who has been dating an ESFJ for nearly a year. Take from that what you will.
It takes understanding. My girlfriend has had to study the INTJ personality in an effort to bring peace to the issues that left her unresolved/insecure. It took a willingness for her to accept that I mean well but do not naturally display it the way she needs to receive it.
It has taken compromise. As an INTJ, your mission will be to purposefully complete tasks/acts of service that appeal directly to the emotional side of her. She must understand that you do these things for her in an effort to display love to her in the ways that she needs them. Her initial reaction is to believe that you do these things out of obligation with no real heart behind it when in reality you do things for her because you love her. Emphasize with her that these things are unnatural to you but worth doing because they bring her happiness (feel free to disagree here; I'm just saying what works for me). Examples include: buying flowers, cards, and chocolate, taking her out to dinner, complimenting her on things to which she is sensitive, leaving small notes for her that state simple (emotional) facts such as ""I love you"" or ""I'm happy to be yours,"" and so on and so forth.
It takes motivation. She is worth the frustration. Your relationship is worth more than your differences. You love her. You are expected to make reasonable compromises to meet her half way. Read books, watch movies, YouTube and research all you can about her personality type. Study up on her Love Languages.
That's all I got. Hope it helps."
833,esfj,"It's very important that she understands what you're doing to show her and how that is your language of love.  If she knows that those are the ways to reach you and show affection, it's more likely that she will reciprocate in the same fashion.  At the same time, you should take note of what things convey love to her and though it may be uncomfortable, try to utilize some of those approaches.  There needs to be compromise on both sides though.  If you prefer acts of service and she prefers physical touch, you can't just pick one and make that the official language of the relationship.  
Take a look at where you differ on the Myers-Briggs spectrum.  Introvert and extrovert are simple enough to understand, but unless you know what that means for the other, it can be hard to relate to.  You scored with intuition and thinking and she scored with sensing and feeling.  For me, I need concrete and heartfelt acts.  Written words or physical touch mean the most to me.  Something I can actually look back on and remember the significance.  
I think your best bet would be for each of you to learn about the characteristics of each other's type profile.  I really like this site's breakdown of each type.  ESFJ and INTF."
834,esfj,"That was quite helpful, thank you.
I did read that little notes were a nice thing to leave, and at the time I shook my head and thought ""really?"" DO people need that much affirmation?  Well, I've done it and it works...so that is already in my playbook...also getting flowers...which to any INTJ is a silly thing to do as flowers expense far outweigh their lifespan, but they do the trick.
She still needs help dealing with me...as she gives in a way she thinks she would appreciate and it falls flat with me, and forgets the excitement I gave when she bought me a Flash T Shirt, as she thought it was an ordinary purchase"
835,esfj,"Depends. If we vibe and there's a true connection there after getting to know you, I'm all in and the chase becomes silly. I actually get bored and move on if I don't know where I stand. 
I'm an exfj so my answer may be different.
Do you have an example? "
836,esfj,"I cannot be sure because although I managed to convince her to do the MBTI, I doubt I can get her to do any more testing, she isn't a super fan of computers or tests, however reading enneagram types, I believe she is an enneagram 6 with 7 wing "
837,esfj,"Yeah I'm shit at improvising. I've kinda learned to improve by ""fake it till you make it"" in the moment. 
​
My biggest issue is that I depend on other people for my emotional well-being too much, and end up becoming a doormat."
838,esfj,"probably the fact that i can't take criticism well (end up taking it personally and ruining my whole day + sleep), or that i have low self-esteem so i tend to blame myself for a lot of things that happen which are out of my control
i'm actively aware of both of these weaknesses but it's so hard to snap your mind out of it when you get into the rut"
839,esfj,"Inflexibility is a common SJ concern. We may have to expose ourselves to uncomfortable situations, in order to improve. 
I work as a substitute teacher, which requires a lot of flexibility and improvising.
Can you involve yourself in hobbies that require improvitization? Personally, I play games with people that you have to think on your feet. One of them is called Snake Oil. You have to try to sell a ludacris invention to other players. There are also some Jackbox party games you play using cell phone and a console of some sort.
Side note- some people may struggle with anxiety, which makes adapting to change and trying new things even more challenging."
840,esfj,"haha im an intp
this is mildly amusing to me ;)
and from my experience you have to make it before you can fake it (because to fake it and survive you have to know what the hell youre doing)
my biggest weakness is going along with traditions without questioning them, cant do it (wait, thats not a weakness. hmmmmmmmmmmm)"
841,esfj,"I’ve noticed that I do this a lot. Regardless if I’m the reason behind it or not, I internalize it. I’ve lost a lot of sleep worrying about mistakes that coworkers have made, simply because it’s on a project that I’m working on also. I also tend to take criticism/comments about work done on my projects (even if I didn’t do the work) really personally. I’m working on handling it better, but dang if it hasn’t caused me a lot of trouble. "
842,esfj,"But wait - if you are an ESFJ people naturally like you!  Someone once told me ""you are like Elvis, everyone likes you"".  I guess along with those compliments comes the pressure of keeping up the stigma.  I get you. 
I do feel people are drawn to me because of my ability to make them feel comfortable, including those folks that are way out of my league as far as status goes.  When interacting with them, at times I feel like a fraud though, thinking all I have going for me is my looks and personality.  (female)"
843,esfj,I used to struggle with that for sure. Kind have gone away with age and realizing I can’t control everything. I am very creative ESFJ which seems rare. Naturally been in artsy stuff and its translated well into my eve day life. So I can’t offer much there. 
844,esfj,"Hi! ENTP here. I'm trying to understand a friend whom I categorise an ENFJ (he refuses to do the test, is that a common resistance?) - so obviously the characterisation isn't necessarily 100%. Anyway.
This person is the sweetest being on the planet. We've had this sudden friendship that I'm finding hard to wrap my head around. We basically met up for movies, I slept there, and now we sleep over like four nights a week. We've got startling amounts of physical intimacy, but it's not necessarily.. sexual. How do I describe this.. He kisses me, lots of touchy feely but it's not in erogenous zones/on the lips. HOWEVER he's made indications of RELATIONSHIP interests. I'm not about to jump into a relationship just because this person is the best cuddler in the world, but how do I know that's what he's out for? Is it normal for ESFJs to not go for the obvious sexual opportunities in this relationship? Because I would be open for a casual sexual relationship but not really for emotional investment. I don't want him to work towards a relationship only to be hurt by me. 
I also wonder about his intentions, as ESFJs are supposed to be quite aware of social norms, and the barrage of inquiries about our relationship status must annoy him as much as it annoys me. 
Any ideas? "
845,esfj,"My very best friend is an ESFJ and we get along smashingly well. Throughout university she'd be the one to wake me up for classes and cook dinner for the roomies. Her practical side definitely balanced out my free-spiritedness. We always have fun when we go out because we have no problem hitting the dance floor, meeting new people or doing our own thing. 
Do any of you have ENFP friends? If so what is your relationship like with them?"
846,esfj,"My ESFJ does this as a defense mechanism when he doesn't want to acknowledge how hurt he is about something. If it's me who hurt him he will be cold to me but normal around everyone else. If I ask what is wrong he might say nothing is wrong. It's only happened a couple of times but basically what I did was I forced the conversation by repeatedly saying ""I know something is wrong so please talk to me."" At this point I notice he might lash out and say hurtful things, but usually they don't make sense and I don't get offended. After a bit of back and forth he was able to express what was wrong and things got better. He always apologizes way too much for acting childish but it shows he understands it's unacceptable. In my case it almost seemed like he didn't 100% know why he was upset but just that he was, so that's why it was so hard to get him to talk about it. He was probably just very stressed about everything and it all built up. ESFJs aren't used to focusing on their own feelings, and just like us they try to avoid them."
847,esfj,"Very interesting take on this. My (23/m ENTP (borderline INTP) Ex girlfriend is ESFJ and rather than addressing the problems she was having in the relationship (almost 3 years in) she ended up dumping me, going the rebound route almost immediately and claimed I was making the relationship toxic (believe me I picked apart the whole relationship because I was taken aback by that statement and wanted to make sure that I was not subconsciously doing something wrong.). I have spent the last two months diving into human psychology, psychotherapy, attachment styles and anything else I could possibly find to get the answers I needed for closure at the least.
Looking back she was capable of communicating but only up to a certain point. By the point the relationship ended it was long overdue for some kinds of discussions to work on the relationship and move it to the next step.
It doesn't help that I could see right through her bubbly nature to see how hard she was trying to hide how her past was hurting her and I asked her to face it so she could get past it in time and be happy. (ENTP live and breath self improvement and INTP break shit down to a molecular level like its nothing.) 
Word on the street is she is acting a lot different now and not characteristic to who she is. Basically I'm betting on house money that she is trying to bury me and she will not be successful because she will not be able to replace how compatible we were at the end of the day (not looking at it with rose colored glasses btw). She will be hard pressed as an early 20's girl to find another guy who will be both long term and check off all the boxes I was doing.
I think she is affected by her decision to end the relationship more than she leads on. I definitely think ESFJ cant handle personal development, conflict, or stressful situations at all. I remember having to talk my ex off of basically the edge of tears because of something that was almost mundane to me, but it was very important in her eyes. "
848,esfj,I think it is worth bringing up as a serious issue to him. Say how it's affecting you. There must be some reason why he's acting this way. It might be worth going to couples therapy if he doesn't open up.
849,esfj,"Is anyone here an ESFJ enneagram 4 or know of one and would to share their experiences living as one or dealing with one? I did a bit of research on the enneagram 4 and it seems that INTJ and INTP would most likely fall under this category. It’s strange, but I’ve had friends that initially typed me as an INTJ when I am actually an ESFJ. Because of this, I wonder if it has to do with my enneagram."
850,esfj,"Hi there! (: I’m an ESFJ and I’ve been typed as a 2w3 but as of five days ago, I wonder if I am actually a disintegrated 4! 
I was very in tune with my identity when I was younger but since starting my adult life on the wrong foot, I’ve become a bit of a people pleaser. I’ve never been someone to change who I am just to be liked. Although I do enjoy getting on with everyone. 
I identify with some of the tortured romanticism that goes on in the unhealthy aspects of 4s but I’m still trying to better understand it myself. What are your thoughts/experiences?"
851,esfj,"Hello!
Growing up, I felt socially awkward and different from all the other kids. I was envious that other kids seemed to be so at ease with their lives and everyone else and a part me wanted that for myself. The people pleasing aspect of myself came into play when I wanted to befriend these kids that I was so envious of. Ofc, through trial/error and simply growing up, I found purpose through work and school. What saved me wasn’t a “who”, but the realization that I had a purpose in this world.
I found my confidence and happiness through meeting new people and experiences. Working in a restaurant and being on a team; a team of coworkers, sports or even classmates, made me realize that wasn’t so different from everyone else. 
Fast forward to the future, I’ve left the restaurant industry, but I’m still continuing to work with people in the hospital while going to school full time to be a nurse! I guess I started life on the wrong foot until I realized that my one wrong foot wasn’t alone. It’s silly, but I was born with two feet and I’ve learned to stand on my own through the good and bad days! "
852,esfj,"Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is!

853,esfj,"how do i stop myself from putting them on a pedestal and thinking they're the best type of person?
i've had an experience where a friend has let me down and kind of used me, even though he's mentioned before that he felt heartbroken when he let down a friend for arriving late. he didn't seem like that type of person but kinda let me down."
854,esfj,"Oh man this used to be me.
Honestly, I think what helped is widening my network of friends.
Before when I had only a few people in my life, I idolized them like you. When you have several folks, you aren't entirely dependant on one person. And take the best parts of them but acknowledge that they have flaws too... At least that's what I've been doing. "
855,esfj,"in terms of reactions to similar situations, i definitely have been disappointed by my friends, too, so i relate to you for sure.
do you think it's an issue of having certain (possibly unrealistic) expectations for your friends, like subconsciously holding them to the same standards of thoughtfulness/consideration that you hold yourself to and being disappointed when those standards are unmet? personally, i've been talking to a therapist about managing my expectations, and it's been helpful for me to keep in mind when i approach any situation or relationship. it's like how if you have lower expectations, you're less likely to be disappointed (does that sound sad lol)"
856,esfj,"for sure, i would say that i expect my friends to hold the same standards which i do. but that is totally unrealistic and unfair. i'll have to take the same approach as you hahah, and nah it's not sad at all"
857,esfj,"So I'm trying to figure out this ESFJ (according to her) but I'm having a difficult time.  I don't know if it's because I'm an INFJ or I'm just really bad at talking to her.  I want to get to know her but when we're together, I'm always worried that we won't have anything to talk about (when we are hanging out with our mutual friends, she tends to stay quiet and so do I).  Anyone have any suggestions or tips on if it's just me or what?  I think she might be interested in me but I don't know how to tell.  "
858,esfj,"Edit: How do I let him KNOW? Dang it, I missed a word in my title -_-
So am an ENFJ and female.
Also good to note that he is ESFJ but his percentages all are pretty low and that he tends to act more like an introvert.
Okay we've been best friend since middle school  and we know each other really well. However I'm not sure how to let him know I'm interested in him with out just telling him. I know that if I just went and told him he'd feel pressured to respond right away and I just don't want him to freak about. He is very much a people pleaser. I want to find ways to hint and just put it in his head, let him come to the conclusion that i like him on his own and come to me if he actually likes me and not just cuz because he felt obligated to say he did because I confronted him. 
I hope that made sense...
So what can I do to let an ESFJ that I'm interested in him? What actions of affection do ESFJs appreciate the most?"
859,esfj,"The best thing would probably be to tell him straight away. Speaking for myself, I've always disliked little hints because I was either unsure of myself or oblivious of what was going on. It was easier for me to deal with it all in one go, rather than question what the hell those hints meant. But that might be just me."
860,esfj,"You could be very very touchy feely, but that may be seen as manipulation. 
I am an ESFJ with low percentages as well... As soon as he finds out you like him, he will want to respond quickly; it's unavoidable. 
But being stairs forward and telling him, while saying ""don't respond right away if you don't want to."" Would be best. "

862,esfj,"I have an ESFJ female friend who is nice and friendly, but somehow doesn’t talk a lot. She kinda just listen all the time with minimum replies.
 I’m not sure does she dislike or not interested in me? Although she did self claim to be an indifferent person. But it just feel like there’s a meaning which I did not catch
Even though that may be the case, she should have stop talking to me long time ago.
P.S. She also told me that she’s bad at replying, but she can’t be that terrible at it, can she?
Truly appreciate whoever is willing to lend a hand ❤️"
863,esfj,"I am an ESFJ and do this often. Even if I am with someone I really enjoy talking to, I would much rather listen than make conversation. It is very rare that I find someone with whom conversation flows naturally and equally from both sides, and even then, there are times where I just don't have anything to say. It's not that I don't want to talk or keep the conversation going, I just struggle with coming up with words a majority of the time, and therefore have no issue just listening to others speak. I know, however, that this is not the usual style of an ESFJ, so I may be completely wrong. My advice would be to see how she interacts with other people (who are on the same wavelength - ie, if you two are acquaintances, don't compare it to a convo with her partner or best friend), if possible. If she doesn't say much in those conversations either, I would just think she's a quiet ESFJ."
864,esfj,"I do this sometimes. Usually it's because the other person seems much more intelligent or insightful than me, and I feel worried saying something useless. So I'm constantly evaluating what to say, trying to actually provide something of substance to the conversation. 
I also want to make sure I don't misinterpret what you're saying, so I try to listen more than speak in order to get all of the details (and I have a habit of doing the opposite :X ). 
But yeah I don't think she dislikes you! (Maybe she's also thinking what the hell you see in her aha)."
865,esfj,"I don’t think it necessarily means she dislikes you.
But I do think that she is prioritising other things over you. 
The reason could be that she just doesn’t have many conversation topics in common with you or that she may be trying to distance herself from you. It could be for many reasons. I can’t speak for all ESFJs but I am very good at maintaining contact with people I want to but I also need a reciprocal effort. You may need to see how frequently you contact her and see if she is responding in a similar matter.
She could also just be busy. I briefly skimmed the comments and someone mentioned you need to find her baseline and see what she herself is normally like."
866,esfj,"she could be a quiet ESFJ
sometimes i do this with people that i like as a friend but do want to distance myself from a bit. probably because i find them a bit emotionally overbearing or talking to them stresses me out a little. personally speaking, if it was someone that i really care about then i would be responding a lot and replying straight away
does she act like that just around you? or to other friends in your group? this is key to understanding her"

868,esfj,"I think when I made it, and this is actually unfortunate because I didn't really consider non-US people (so stereotypical of an American isn't it lol). I was thinking more along the lines of Republican or Democrat, and let's face it there are only two parties in the US even if you do wish to vote for an independent (because that vote becomes almost counterproductive). So it's not really a question about are you liberal or conservative but which side do you vote for. And in that sense, sorry."
869,esfj,"I struggle so much with not being able to validate myself. And I was reading on here that ESFJs often use other people to help them make decisions/feel certain ways/ etc. 
I’m going to therapy but I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice that worked for them on being able to validate themself without the need for other people’s opinions. I’m going through a rough time with a lot of temporary people and it’s really wearing me down. "
870,esfj,"Si+Ne helped.
Si allowed me to remember my past and I use Ti to analyze it and understand myself better, I think. It helps me develop some core values to orient myself towards in the world.
Ne allows me to essentially see the positive aspect of situations even when things are really bad. I used to also really dislike myself, but then I tried figuring out ways to see my characteristics as something ""good"" and valuable rather than something to scoff at. Thus, I began giving myself more respect and I became somewhat more confident."
871,esfj,"You just have to create a world with only people you want to deal with. It's so innate that it would be very difficult for you to make your Fe take a backseat. Even if you bottle it up, it finds a way to get out anyways."
872,esfj,"Known each other our entire lives, recently started hanging out more, I started to develop feelings and suppressed them because I didn't want to wreck the friendship as I really value it.
Last week I told her how I felt, and she said she didn't see me in that way at this point. I still want to be friends and she seems fine with that but at the same time I still find myself hoping that maybe someday she will see my that way (stupid wishful thinking I'm sure). That being said, maybe someone here could talk me through why this could or could not be a terrible idea?
I guess I should also mention the ages are me being 21M and her being 22F"
873,esfj,"The question becomes, if in the future she does NOT change her mind, is this going to piss you off/upset you/make you resent the time you spent with her.  If you can't just be OK with her as a friend forever, then I think it would be best if you distanced yourself and turned your search elsewhere.  The ""at this point"" she gave you might have been her trying not to hurt your feelings, it might actually have been ""ever"".  As an ESJF I often try to spare someone's feelings by not putting my foot down as much as I should, she may be the same.  "
874,esfj,"Ahaha fair enough, yeah I posted the same question on the INTP subreddit and got a few more replies than this one. 
But to your point, that's one of those questions that given infinite amounts of time I could probably analyze and come up with the absolute answer. That being said I don't have infinite amounts of anything, so to start I like the way she makes me laugh, I like the way that when she doesn't know what something means she will turn to me and ask me to explain, I like it when she tells stories, and wild stay there listening forever if she had enough stories. I like the way she tries to make me feel awkward and uncomfortable sometimes when we are in a group by saying something inappropriate. I like her smile, I like it when she looks at me when we are talking. I like the way she always tries to include me when I am all alone, and the way she defends me when people say mean things.
I feel like there's probably more, but that's gotta be a half decent list to somewhat answer your question."
875,esfj,"I 100 percent agree with that sentiment. At the current point in time I think if we stay friends forever I would still be fine with it, but I just can't give up if there's any chance that we could have something more. And I get that she might have been trying to let me down easy with the at this point... That being said she is a very blunt and honest person generally so I had hoped that she would be as realistic as possible. That being said, I think just being friends and being there for her if anything happens could lead to her seeing a better side of me, and hopefully that's what the at this point could mean."
876,esfj,"I am with an ESFJ and she is young,18. I love her company and love that she is so warm. But I cannot give her the feeling she wants after some time. And I am afraid that she will take it as a bad response.
I told her about this and she agreed on this. But, I dont think that will work.
How do I make a balance? "
877,esfj,"A quick qsn.. 
I am also an INTP with an ESFJ crush. 
The one and only imbalance is that I cannot provide her with the feelings she needs for a long time.
I want to but I get very tired doing so. I feel bad that I cant provide her with this support.
How can I do the best that I can from my side?
1. Things to tell her
2. Do best from my part
Hope u answer it. I am in the blooming of my cute relationship... 😄😄"
878,esfj,"I'd hate to have you hang on in an unrequited love forever though.  That would be the pits.  :-(  But sometimes an ESFJ will just react too quickly, and needs to see the value of someone so opposite from herself.  (At least for me.)"
879,esfj,"Well, I wish you the best in this blooming relationship 😊
I can share with you what has worked for us and what doesn't work. 
Early on in the relationship, I didn't feel like my INTP understood me, and I wanna say it made me feel more needy in terms of emotional needs. I think the biggest factor was that he was looking to fix my problems instead of listening to understand me.
ESFJ's main function is extraverted feeling. So she is going to share a lot of feelings with you as she processes through life. 
I introduced my husband to the idea of active listening and it has changed everything. (Feel free to do some research on exactly what active listening looks like and how it's applied practically, but if you want, I can give you an example). I feel more secure because I feel understood. I am very low maintenance these days compared to how I used to be. And we've gone through some shit this year... two deaths in the family, and I still feel supported and loved and like we're in it together. 
I hope all that makes sense!"
880,esfj,"Now that is an interesting question, and one that I guess I never really stopped to think about.
I can't think of many things, and the ones I can are not really big deals that bother me but here they are.
It seems like she overreacts to some issues that shouldn't be as big of problems as they become. Sometimes when she loses control of a conversation she gets upset until people pay attention to her (and isn't just happy with some people still giving her attention. 
To be honest I can't think of anything else currently, but maybe I will continue thinking... That was a really interesting question though "
881,esfj,"Thnx for replying. I feel great.. 
Can I ask u a qsn?
Does providing support and listening provide more satisfaction to ESFJs than solving them?
As Extroverted feeling and Introverted Thinking has a common language, when she feels bad she presents a problem or dissatisfaction
Now, the thing is does she desire to be heard and be supported emotionally.
OR does she need to actually solve the problem.
I mean the first thing that pops in their mind.
😊mbti is helping me a lot."
882,esfj,"I don't want to encourage or discourage your choices, but I'm giving my perspective with an ESFJ. Also, since INTP's and ENTP's are somewhat similar, maybe it would be applicable to you. 
The top two things that always caused friction between us was;
i) Her berating me over issues that were big to her, but small to me. At first, I just accepted that she was right to keep the peace. But over time, this actually became a really annoying occurance.
ii) Lack of compassion and emotion she received from me. Even though I felt like I gave alot of compassion and emotion, she still didn't really feel it. ENTP's aren't exactly naturally superb with the feely stuff.If you want to think of it with MBTI, I got the ""you're cold hearted"" problem with a tertiary Fe. I figure that my INTP brethren would suffer from this problem even more with their inferior Fe.
Lastly, do you genuinely find her interesting? Sometimes we can get lost in the warmness from people like them, but we need to have our mind engaged in the long run. Does she satisfy this condition?
I apologize in advance, if I'm coming off as patronizing or demoralizing."
883,esfj,"I think communication is key. I think your default should be to provide support, and she'll make it clear if she wants you to help solve the problem after that. Let me try to give you an example:
ESFJ: Work has been tough lately. My coworker didn't complete a task and it reflected badly on our whole team. I don't like looking like a failure in front of my managers.
INTP: You must feel frustrated that her mistake looked like your mistake as well.
ESFJ: Yes, it's frustrating! What do I do?
INTP: Have you considered talking to the managers about it?
Does that make sense? "
884,esfj,"No need to apologize at all! I appreciate the response. I can see how her getting upset over things I find trivial could get irritating, but maybe it wouldn't be that big of a deal? As for the second point, I would like to think I could be the type of person who is open and honest about feelings and stuff in a relationship, as in my relationships with my closest friends I am very open about my inner thoughts if they are open to listen. And as for whether I find her interesting, I really do most of the time. Granted she isn't always interested in deep conversation but she is really smart in the things she knows. She just graduated recently and always tells the best stories from her placements in the field she is getting into, so I feel like I could be interested in those as long as she is working, and there doesn't seem to be any shortage of odd situations in her line of work. Maybe if this all ever works out I will find that I need more deep conversations from whomever I end up with, by right now I can see myself being happy with things how they are.
But anyways now that I've answered your questions can I ask you a question I have been asking a lot lately? That question is what would you do in my situation? Because at this point I have no other prospects and really don't want to cut her out of my life, so what else can I do?"
885,esfj,"I didn't mean expressing our thoughts and feelings. We can do that because we approach it with an analytical view. What I meant was, can you make someone FEEL loved ( in the traditional sense ).
As for your question, the most logical thing to do is slowly distance yourself (but not cut off) until the feelings pass. Of course, using logic without factoring in emotions isn't very logical either. In the end, you know the situation best and I'm just a stranger from the Internet. 
However, what I would do is maintain how things are for her. Assuming that you're not going insane from your emotions, just be her friend and hold any feelings in. Of course, I don't make the best choices for myself, so...."
886,esfj,"I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?"
887,esfj,"i tend to hate right wing politics as it's very uncaring towards people. especially when it comes to issues like welfare, health care and attitudes towards minorities (women, racial minorities, LGBT)
left wing policies care about people who have hit rock bottom or faced injustices through no fault of their own. and ultimately that's what I value as an ESFJ"
888,esfj,"I think it's interesting being an ESFJ. The SJ stereotype is that we lean toward tradition and order, which is associated more with conservative politics. On the other hand, as an ESFJ, we're also really caring towards people, which I think falls more inline with liberal politics. Personally, I don't consider myself either one but find myself to be more balanced between the two. I primarily dislike far right and far left politics, though. I don't think extremes are good. It's very gray for me. I try to stay away from politics for the most part. "
889,esfj,I have heard we are more likely to be susceptible to media manipulation.  And I think I had that issue at the last election but with the left. So I could see it at older ages but all the young ESFJs seem to very liberal. I have learned a lot from the last election. 
890,esfj,"Well... not exactly.
ESFJs, just like all SJs, base their decisions on their past experiences. If growing up most folks around me are conservative, then I will be too. If I feel rejected by most of the people around me, I'm going to end up trying to find a different route."
891,esfj,"I'm a textbook ESFJ, and I'm very politically liberal. then again, so are my parents, so that may be part of the tradition thing for me! I have three generations of union workers in my family, so maybe being liberal IS my tradition...."
892,esfj,"I would agree with this, I’m fairly liberal but not completely left wing either. Politics don’t interest me very much. Australian politics is much the same, there isn’t much difference between the two political parties - I vote depending on their policies at the time. I’m fairly neutral but lean slightly to the left. "
893,esfj,"that's actually a good point. i grew up in a poor and deprived area of a big city, and those experiences taught me there's lots of people who are doing their flat out best to make the best of their life, yet still being neglected by the government. which i solely blame responsible."
894,esfj,"Just poppin' by to say hello!  This subreddit is pretty dead. any ideas on how we can get it alive?  Saw a comment on an earlier thread saying, we're not here, because we're out and about not on reddit, which is probably true.  If you compare, we have 108 people here, where some of the other Myers-Briggs subreddits have thousands of subscribers.  
Oh well, that doesn't have to stop us from having a great subreddit.
So anyway, how's everyones days going?  Do any of you know any esfj's in real life?  Do your personalities ever clash?  Do you finish each other's sentences?  I don't know any ESFJ's (or at least, I don't think I do), so I'm curious how your relationship is with another ESFJ.
There's really no point to this post, just wanting to say hi, and see if there's anyway we can get this subreddit more active."
895,esfj,"SUP!
I dunno man, I'm an ESFJ but i work a boring-ass job where I don't have much to do besides reddit. (as an ESFJ it makes me... a little crazy) 
Don't think I know any other ESFJs! Not sure if that's telling or what."
896,esfj,"Hey  :) my partner is an ESFJ and I was just popping in to see what you guys had to say (I'm an INFJ). In his case he basically never uses these kind of sites because he doesn't find talking to strangers on the other side of the world that interesting (that's how he describes the internet hehe). 
From what I can see from him, you guys are a lot of fun to be around, but you probably don't think so.. you are really caring and good at practical stuff but somehow get a bit lost on more intuitive and creative things. My partner doesn't seem able to express how he feels very well, and I've seen him been led astray by friends with their own agendas. I feel like he needs to follow what he thinks more, not what others say, especially when they don't have his interests at heart.
I'm curious if any of you know any INFJs and how you relate to them, I know I voice my critical comments or ""idea suggestions"" a bit too much for him, I'm trying to cut down on it! He seems to like my creativity tho  :)"
897,esfj,"Hi redditors! Newest member initiated to the awesome Wolfpack. I currently work in IT for a retail company. I love to see people happy due to my warm heart. After discovering I was an ESFJ, It helped me understand why the dating scene wasn't going too well. Always left in confusion of where did I go wrong? Idk why, but it hits hard when you progress then you're back to square one. I think if we can support one another, we can be stronger. I have financial issue where I go all out to see the people around me smile or go out of my way."
898,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ, and I was recently dumped by my INTP boyfriend :'( 
Its the first time I've been dumped personally so it was a nice feeling to see that yes, its okay for me to be taking it so hard, its part of being ESFJ so its actually helping me in the process to understand why things didnt work out. 
I am currently a warehouse worker and while I worked eight years of retail I actually am finding warehouse work for a small company is great because I'm helping people by getting their orders out to them, and they really appreciate it! (yay!)"
899,esfj,"Hello, redditors! New to the reddit scene and a highly functioning ESFJ. I just recently found this subreddit and agree that it's a bit boring. Anyway, I was really replying to this post to say that I only know one other ESFJ and I often find her annoying. But when we both are hanging out in our group of friends, we get along really well. 
Anyone else have this problem?  "
900,esfj,"Oh man, I would probably go crazy at a desk job.  I mean, I like office work, but I'd need to actually do something too.   What do you do for work?  Actually, it'd be fun to see what other ESFJ's do for work!  I started as a CNA (certified nurse aide...pretty much take care of the elderly at a nursing home), and now work in human resources.  I love it!  "
901,esfj,"Hey!  That's kind of funny :)  My husband is an ISFJ, so we relate quite a bit, but for some reason, he thinks reddit is full of 'weirdos,' whereas I'm on here all the time.  
I definitely have a deep caring side towards people.  Sometimes my practical-ness gets pushed aside, partly because I'm more book smart than I am street smart.  If you've read my other replies, I definitely do not have a creative side to me at all.  
My husband would agree with you.  I need to follow my own wants and desires instead of following the crowd and trying to be more liked by everyone else.  Though, he has the SFJ like I do, that's where we differ.  I want everyone to like me, and I will do almost anything for that to happen.  
Oh gosh yea, I like blunt people, but at a the same time, I'm just like 'omg shut up!' lol.  That's what downfall I have, I don't share how I really feel often enough, because I don't want to piss anyone off.
Thanks for stopping by :)"
902,esfj,"Hmm. I'm not sure about this! I am an ESFJ and have been for the last five years, but man, I have been addicted to and dependent on the internet for about 10 years. I think a big part of my dependence is due to the fact that for a long time I didn't have a physical social circle, unlike now where I actually have people to interact with in the real world.
However,  I really love seeing interactions and reading stories on /r/askreddit and the like, and I feel like that's a big part of my ESFJ self. 
And the only INFJ I know is the one person in my social circle that I don't get along with super well! Uh, not to say that I dislike INFJ's, we just intimidate each other and often don't communicate well. 
I love the Myers Briggs test, but I really don't think it's an end-all be-all of personality compatibility!"
903,esfj,Hi!  Esfj here as well.  I too have a job that allows me to reddit a lot.  But I like my job I'm not always stuck at a desk.  I don't have a boss micromanaging me.  I get to leave the office and do field work it's great.  I do in home computer repair 
904,esfj,"Damnit, i totally meant to reply to you earlier than this!
Yeah, I'm a receptionist and I interact with the same 15 people every day. I used to work for Starbucks and interact with 200+ per shift and it was THE BEST. I really don't miss retail but I super miss seeing and interacting and flirting with a ton of people all the time.
I'm hoping to go back to school for a slightly different field but I am losing motivation for the application process. :"
905,esfj,"Hehe it can be really interesting how we interact with our partners. I quite like being with someone very different from me becausewe have such different strengths and weaknesses, but due to the Fe matching up we are both very caring and focussed on the others' needs. I totally need the practicality he brings to my life too. We can completely miscommunicate sometimes though which drives us a bit crazy, but at least we can talk a lot about it. I will be reading here every now and then, good luck with the sub  :)"
906,esfj,"Yes it'a very true that MBTI isn't everything. It can give some interesting insights, but each person is obviously still an individual.
Haha yeah I can see the intimidation thing, my husband and I actually felt that vibe a little at first, but despite very different communication styles we could always spend hours and hours talking (even the first night we met) so I think we managed to get past it because we have a lot of interests in common and really tried to work on understanding each other. It may have taken us 10 years to get better at it though, haha. It's interesting reading this sub for me, a lot reminds me of him."
907,esfj,"Ha it's all good!  OMG, I so hear ya!  I love working in retail for all the same reasons you said, but I hate hate hate the meanness in people!  Heh, I love filling out applications, but only if their easy.  When I was applying to a college, if the application required an essay, I wasn't doing it.  Thankfully I found a university that is well respected and didn't require an essay.  (oh and had a cheap application fee!)
Totally random question: are you/other ESFJ's worried about their financial future?  "
908,esfj,"It really is. I get to interact with a few new people a day, talk about things, learn about them. and then leave. Get some personal time to refocus and rezone for the next call. Then when im all done it go back to the office for paperwork and some more work. My favorite part is not being micromanaged. Im responsible for my own work and if i want to take a break at starbucks and sit and wait for my next call no one cares as long as everything is taken care of. "
909,esfj,"It's the writing papers part that sucks about applications! (Grad school)
I am... worried ish? Like it is on my mind and I am very very organized financially and on a pretty strict budget with eyes to the future, but I don't / try not to stress about ""in 20 years"" or whatever too much.  So, yes and no? just for me though. haha."
910,esfj,"Oh for sure!  
..are you me?  haha, that's pretty much how I feel too.  I think in the moment, but at the same time trying to plan for the future.  I try to be frugal in some aspects, yet splurge on some things that I want now.  "
911,esfj,"ENTP here. 
​
I have a few ESFJs friends and they all seem to have a requirement for dressing well and a sense of style.

I would love to hear your opinions on why you think this is and what drives it? 
​
The ESFJs I know don't tend to come off the most stylish, but the ones I know have a thing for designer clothes, bag, shoes and cars.
​
This will be especially handy when it comes to gifting; I have a ESFJ friend getting married this year :)

912,esfj,"hi! 20 year old ESFJ here. my appearance is something i always think about. i plan outfits in my head based on weather, who i’m with, comfortability, and how it’ll look on me. i use fashion as a form of expression and i feel like my clothes really reflect my personality and how i want people to see me. i like to look good, and when i do, i feel good. even on my “bum” days i try to show off a little bit and i’ll wear leggings instead of sweats or ill put on a little bit of makeup to look pretty. 
i think our reliance on tradition and sensibility is what drives this. i’m not a very out of the box person and my ideals, while i wouldn’t call them OLD FASHIONED, are typically stuck to some sort of status quo set for myself that i’ve come up with. i stick to what i know and i know the reactions i get from other people are the ones i want because of how carefully i’ve cultivated my appearance over discovering my personality and expressing myself. 
does that make sense? let me know if you have any questions :)!"
913,esfj,"ESFJ here. Used to not be into cloths at all because I felt if I was going to do it, I wanted to do it well. And I never felt I could. I think other ESFJs will relate to that sentiment with other things in life. Not worth doing something unless your going to over do it. I got a few fashion major friends to help me out and I’ve spend thousands of dollars on cloths in the last 3 weeks and I look awesome. I always had an “outfit” and it’s so nice to try new stuff. "
914,esfj,"I'm not so much into specific brands. I prefer to judge an item by it's design and quality. Anyway, most people are judged by other people's first impressions, so it's important to dress in a way that expresses who you are or as the persona in which you're trying to present yourself. The way I dress always depends on the occasion and activities in which I'll be participating."
915,esfj,"I live with an ESFJ male.  He is VERY classic in his tastes, and if I can opine a bit-quite conservative-when it comes to clothes AND the style of his furnishings/decor.  I'm much more artistic and ""bo-ho"" in my tastes which he thinks is ""too casual, too hippie"".  (My old apartment was very 70s Mod and he never said he hated it, but I know for a fact he didn't like it much at all).
I don't shop for him much, but when I do I go for classic lines and prints (very few prints are acceptable to him, and if there is a print, it's going to be small and not overstated).  He dresses up for church, if we're going out for a couples night or if there is an activity at the school for the boys.  He only dresses down if he's working on a project around the house or in the yard-and damn, those clothes are raggedy!  (Like, homeless person raggedy).
He does have excellent taste and an eye for quality, but it better not cost a lot.  He's willing to spend on important pieces (his 2 suits are very nice and he paid handsomely for them, but only wears them on super-special occasions and always has them cleaned at least 3x a year).  His ""dressy"" clothes are what I call Yuppie-Chic-Ralph Lauren, Chaps, some Banana Republic...that kind of thing.  He's always pressed, pristine and sharp.  (I love that about him).
I'd suggest something traditional, with an eye toward top quality-such as crystal glasses for a bar or a luxurious cashmere throw for the living room or bedroom.  Something very nice.  My Christmas gift for him this year was a mahogany valet for his uniform (he wears a uniform daily for work) with brass accents.  It cost me a pretty penny, but gosh he loved it and it matched the style in our bedroom perfectly.  That kind of stuff truly matters to him.  Matchy-matchy all the way (that's not my thing) and definitely surprised him that I got his ""style"" down so well."
916,esfj,"i'm an ESFJ and i'm really conscious of what i wear, and try to make an effort to dress good
i guess it's because we really care what people think of us haha. personally speaking for me, it's more of a self-esteem issue. i'm not that good looking so i care more about what i wear, since it makes me feel like i'm good looking"
917,esfj,"I (Also ENTP) dated one for several years and thus have a LOT of first-hand knowledge about one. They definitely value how they look/dress more-so than I would. Don't get me wrong I like looking snazzy like the next fella but it's not important to me to make a conscious effort every single day the same way she did. She always had a smile on her face when it came to outward projection. 
What I think it boils down to (without getting into MBTI too extreme like others do) has to do with a desire to be approved by the people in her surrounding and receiving their validation as a person into their circles. In her case she was extreme on the extroverted need for validation. Post-break up I have not heard good things about how she interacts with people. Her desire for exterior validation hurts her chances of receiving long-term validation and its become evident since she left me that I was her voice of reason. I'm trying to build a picture here which leads me to suspect the ones who are extreme with style and having the best of things all the time are really lacking a sense of true-north inside themselves or a voice of reason to keep them in proverbial check.
She was Jewish however and to offer a perspective with a different core ideology, she was extremely crafty with being stylish rather than just going out to buy an expensive handbag or an expensive pair of shoes. 
If your friend is the same as my ex-girlfriend she will enjoy gifts which have a little bit of thought behind them. "
918,esfj,"My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.
It would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. 
There would be NO ""tell the person how you feel"" or ""just be yourself"" or ""love yourself at your size"", feeler advice. 
Just cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. 
So I'm taking a survey. 
How many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? 
Additionally....
We are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)
Our test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. 
Of course, your identity would remain anonymous. 
You can send a letter here.

If you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them. We are in the planning stages now, and any ideas are appreciated. "
919,esfj,"Hi ESFJs, I need your help!!! I have an esfj cousin who has been planning to get a tattoo and has asked me to help her design it. So far she has decided she wants a scenic view of the sun setting over a beach, and under it she wants a quote about staying happy or always seeing the light in life. She tasked me, an infp, to help her find the perfect phrase, but nothing yet has particularly stuck out to us. So I'm wondering what are some of your favorite lines about happiness or finding beauty in life? Anything that strikes a chord within you, I want to hear! Thank you 🌞 "

921,esfj,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
922,esfj,"ESFJ's usually have no problem with small talk or following social cues in order to help them take an active role in their communities which is due to there need to fit into groups and social circles. However, ESFJ's tend to deeply care about others and are consistently emotionally supportive. In conclusion, small talk is used by ESFJ's to conform socially but when conversing with one person (Texts are a great example) they tend to stray into deeper conversations which is excellently shown by user BlondeRJ in his comment below."
923,esfj,"Here is a few questions. I have figured out I am probably not esfj but I still don’t understand fe that well.
Do you esfjs usually consider yourselfs pretty emotional?? Sometimes it is seen as you are and sometimes not that much.
Also there is this thing about ESFJ and fe being very linked to empathy. And that you can just feel other people’s feelings. Is this actually true or is it a horrible stereotype?
One person already have given a response to this question and I don’t mean to not listen but I want more answers. But fe people including ESFJ is known as social chamaeleons. What do you think of this? Is blending in to your background intentional or just more natural and you just do it without knowing? What do you think of the whole social chamaeleon concept do you agree with it?"
924,esfj,"Yeah as a male ESFJ I am emotional for a guy I guess. I definitely feel peoples emotions and will get choked up with them. We can be very matter of fact if need be, and that is probably the non emotions you see. But I think our emotions are practical. Not the kind of people who will emote to just anything. It has to have real meaning. I am very empathetic for sure. You'd need to explain social chameleon more, I dont think I personally blend into the background unless the group size is really large. If its a 3-5 person group I'm the one taking control usually."
925,esfj,"I am decently chill most of the time, but sometimes I get in moods and then my emotions will control me. Usually as far as empathy goes, I can deeply understand how most people feel naturally, and I will do everything in my power to understand if I do not. I guess the empathy is a natural thing.
A few years back my mom told me a story about me when I was two. I was at an Easter event and had a bag full of eggs. She said that I looked over and saw a kid with none, and that I gave all of my eggs to the kid. That makes me think that my empathy started at a young age. As far as the chameleon and blending in. I actually greatly struggle fitting in. Mainly because most of the people I naturally gravitate towards are INTP or INFP who have a completely different thinking process. "
926,esfj,"YES on all those things.  
Social Chameleon here for sure.  I sense deeply and find it easy to size up a social situation upon entering.  This allows me to cater to the needs of the crowd without any struggles.  I actually quite enjoy it and look forward to meeting new people or going to events where I'm a newbie.  Much to the delight of my husband who is quite the opposite and whose profession requires lots of hobnobbing.  :)"
927,esfj,"I used to not be emotional, but I was being abused at the time so I shut myself off. Once I started working on fighting that abuse, the emotions just came pouring out. And yes, I can literally feel what others feel. That's part of why I cry so easily, if someone is in pain and they're crying, I'm also crying because I put myself in their shoes. The most dramatic time this happened to me, was when a friend of mine was ""retiring"" from nannying for this family. The kids had just grown up and didn't need a nanny anymore. But she had nannied them since they were babies, she had been with them their entire lives. When she told me she was starting to look for a new job, I literally burst into tears just thinking about how painful it would be leaving the kids. She wasn't even crying about it. "
928,esfj,"I'm a Taurus and I feel like many of the traits accurately fit ESTJs (family oriented, self-care, stubborn, hardworking, personable). My friend is also a Taurus and ESTJ. I'm thinking that theres a slight trend here so adding your own horoscope would be great and interesting to see.

929,esfj,"I’m cancer. I have been told this by people my whole life, and now that I checked my horoscope I now know they were right. 
(INTP, if you care. Horoscopes have no real meaning, they are based on a very poor system.)"
930,esfj,"I'm a gemini. Although, technically the astrology dates for the horoscopes are wrong and outdated. Thus, according to the new dates, I'm a taurus. New dates:

Source. I still identify with gemini since that's just what I grew up telling myself haha. Don't really believe in this stuff but it's fun."
931,esfj,I would say most environmentalists don't care about the environment and simply only do what is publicly visible. Most of the highest impact things you can do for the environment are unnoticed and unsexy and also rarely performed.
932,esfj,And these acts go unnoticed. You only see the things that are visible and so you can only judge based on this. Who’s to say these environmentalists aren’t also performed these invisible tasks? It’s not like it would be on display by your own reckoning.
933,esfj,"So I was hopping over to this side of the MBTI to ask a similar question. I am with an ESFJ and we literally have been hitting things off great. Being an INFP, I don't ever truly feel satisfied, however, I really am falling for her more and more. I love the caring personality you all have. I really don't know what she see's in me, but I feel happier around her. We have been going on 3 months now and she is really supportive, kind, gentle, caring, and smart. I think it's a good match. We shall see I suppose."
934,esfj,"Hey, ESFJ dating an INFP here. We've been dating for ~8 months now, and things are going great! He's a very intriguing person, and so different from my ex (who was an ESFJ too). Sometimes we get into arguments after some miscommunication, and about the way we process things, but I truly feel things are balancing out. He can talk on and on just about anything, but I love how he listens when I want to talk (which is always). My sister is also an INFP, and I definitely saw the similarities between them. INFPs seem to have a lot of depth to them that they keep locked up.
All in all, so far so good. He needs to chill on his idealism though, fr..... Tryna get the bills paid first... "
935,esfj,"I'm an INFP and I've been dating an ESFJ for over a year. The main thing is I'm more idealistic and they're more practical, so sometimes they don't understand how I got so absorbed in something that I forgot to file a piece of paperwork / sweep the floor / eat lunch. And sometimes I don't understand why they don't want to have a long speculative conversation with me based on a totally imaginary scenario.
But, overall we have a complementary set of skills, and we both care a lot about how our friends and each other are doing and feeling. It works really well."
936,esfj,"ESFJs, you're smart. INTPs are also smart, but at the same time, they're also REALLY dumb. 90% of our problems are because we're bad with our emotions. We have trouble at self-analysis, decision-making, being productive, and experiencing emotional states. We have trouble entering states of mind, feel isolated and mentally disconnected from others, have trouble with anxiety and stress, have trouble with existential nihilism and depression, everyday endurance, and have trouble building up momentum. It's because we're emotionally stupid! XD
INTPs will likely deny this, but it's because they're unaware of their emotions and emotional state.
ESFJs may have Ti as their fourth function, Ne as their third, Ni as their seventh, and Te as their eighth, but they also have Fe as their first and Si as their second.
ESFJs are actually a very good match for INTPs. They experience a lot of conflict and can annoy each other, but they can also promote a LOT of growth in each other.
INTPs are imaginative, creative, and innovative, while ESFJs are realistic and grounded.
INTPs often lack discipline, and ESFJs are often disciplined and good about dishing out discipline.
INTPs are open-minded. ESFJs are decisive.
INTPs are objective and analytical. ESFJs are sensitive, warm, and good at connecting with others.
INTPs can have trouble keeping in touch with people. ESFJs are great at this.
INTPs often have social trouble. ESFJs are great at socializing.
ESFJs can be reluctant to change. INTPs are great at promoting change.
INTPs are often emotionally stupid which affects their decision-making, awareness, ability to self-analysis, ability to come to conclusions, productivity, and more. ESFJs are great at sensing the emotions of others.
ESFJs can be worried about their social status. INTPs can help show ESFJs that it's okay to stand out.
INTPs can have trouble getting out. ESFJs are good at getting them off their rear.
INTPs can have trouble with practical things and be absent-minded. ESFJs are great at practical things and are great at remembering things that need to be done.
INTPs can be insensitive. ESFJs are great at developing Fe in people. INTPs often hate following many rules. ESFJs can show them that there's benefit to following some rules they don't want to follow.
The biggest problems they generally have is communication issues, conflicting interests, and they can annoy each other. Although, I think INTPs and SJs get along much worse than they otherwise would because of the society we live in. We live in a time where organizations and politicians try to manipulate Si. This can be a VERY big issue for INTPs in an ESFJ-INTP relationship, particularly because of the way it's done."
937,esfj,"I'm an INTP and my wife is ESFJ. It's really interesting to read this. Seems like the only thing I disagree with is that INTP's are bad at self analysis. I'm wayyy better at self analysis than my ESFJ wife. I'd actually say she's horrible at introspection all together. She's just way more concerned with the outside world. But anyway, we make a powerful team because we are really good at what the other person is pretty bad at. At the same time, we find commonalities in our values which really is the glue anyway."
938,esfj,"What do mean about society manipulating Si?
Anyways I (INTP) tend to get along well with ESFJs. Sometimes I reluctant yield to ESFJ (ex my grandmother) but I don't do that as much with ESFJ friends and in that case the ""clashes"" are mainly correcting each other's stupidity. We might not acknowledge it right away but I think we eventually do and we understand it's coming from a place of good intentions.
I think one challenge is that ESFJs expect openness and INTPs can have pretty high walls but ESFJs are pretty good at getting people to open up and I think once the INTP does that they both feel really good about it.
I also feel like there's certain aspects of ESFJs and INTPs that when they see in the other it's like a pimple they have to pop, like when INTPs are being aloof and reclusive and when ESFJs get too wrapped up in what others think. "
939,esfj,"Every ESFJ I have met in my life I have hated. Overly emotionally needy people and INTP's do not mix. You ESFJ's can not outsmart an INTP or an ENTP, we are always two steps ahead. Your dominant feeling function stands in your own way. "
940,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ too, I once dated an INTP and this pretty much sums up all our differences.  I'm very down to earth, practical, proactive, and connect with people instantly.  My ex often seemed like his head was in the clouds all the time, emotionally clueless as to meeting my needs even when I would spell out the issues I was having, and it was so tough to bring him to any of my social gatherings.  He would physically be present but mentally it was like he was out to lunch and not there at the present moment.  Great guy and we shared some great memories during the time we dated but so not for me.  As an SJ, I really need to feel that sense of security on all levels (emotionally, physically, spiritually, etc) and he just did not provide that for me.  "
941,esfj,"INTPs are great at self-analysis. They have trouble with the emotional aspect of self-analysis. The reason for this is a lack of awareness of their own emotions. It's very helpful to have another person with strong Fe to help with that. I wouldn't say ESFJs are horrible at introspection. They're great at parts due to their Si, but they have trouble putting it into words. It also doesn't help that Ti is their 4th function, Ne is their 3rd, Fi is their 5th, and Ni is their 7th.
Just like INTPs have trouble putting their emotions into words, ESFJs have trouble putting their thoughts into words. I think I'd have a lot of difficulty in an ESFJ relationship, but I think I could make it work. It'd be very taxing at first, because I'd have to practice being aware of my own biases. I know ESFJs aren't stupid barbies, but due to my lack of emotional self-awareness, they can sometimes seem like that to me.
I honestly think I'd have a MUCH more difficult time in an ISFJ relationship. They're great, but they make me very uncomfortable. I want to push, exert, and accomplish. I also want to be pushed but not in a ""my way is the only way"" manner. When I have to pull, be patient, and handle delicate procedures, I experience great discomfort. I think the best way to relay this would be to compare it to being Superman in a world of cardboard."
942,esfj,"Hi there, I meant to reply to this sooner.
In all honesty, I don't think I know of a single ENTP in my life so I cannot fully answer this question.  I know of a:  INTP, ENTJ, and ENFP but no ENTPs!!  Are you one??  They always say INTJs are one of the rarest types but I know a few (both male and female).  I think ENTPs are the rarest."
943,esfj,"I like that you posted in this sub. It's an honorable act of charity. ESFJ peeps could really use this type of information. I think that by nature though, they don't process information like we do and they just see it as ""blah blah blah blah"" noise. It's incredible how disinterested my ESFJ wife is with this stuff. She likes taking the test and having me read her summary to her but really it ends there. Ideally a personality test matches her to some sort of Disney character she likes."
944,esfj,"Oh interesting, I think you are the first one I know now :)
The ENTJ that I know is actually my roommate from college.  We both got along great, we both were strongly J (very type A, structured, and productive people) which made it easy for us to live together.  She was outgoing in a way she liked to be center of attention and one of the funniest people I know.  So mainly all good things.  I think she is the only ENTJ that I have in my life.  
I have never dated an ENTJ but I also always gravitate towards introverts.  The last bf I had was ENFP (he took the test and everything and agreed with his results) but that was a disaster.  I would never date an ENFP again.  Super emotional and intense.  I will say he was the most intuitive person I have dated, his intuition on things was spot on which I thought was cool.  We only dated a few months.  Other than that one exception (I wouldn't have even dated him quite honestly but he pursued me and I was open minded at the time), I stick with my introverts!  It's a happier balance that way."
945,esfj,"XD ESFJs don't like learning for the sake of learning. Each type generally likes having its first two functions engaged the most. Also, this is how ESFJs learn: http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/esfj-learning-style
INTPs aren't exactly the best pitchers nor speakers either. I think you should read Pitch Anything. It's a terrific book on how to pitch, and it explains it using neuroscience. None of those false promises and ""pitching is an art"" stuff."
946,esfj,"us NTPs really love you ESFJ's, as far as the people I know (though again I'm not a strong believer in mbti (except for the preferences), I only come here to further prove my skepticism justified. 
Wow I'm surprised how you got along with her, just curious, not stereotyping here. Since she was typed as a T shes probably low in agreeableness as well. Did you ever feel like she was cold sometimes? Like during fights or the like? if you've been in any? And have you ever been in situations where you were the one who compromised more than the other party? Im happy to see ENTJ and ESFJs got along b/c to me they seem like similar types. 
Lol I have a love hate relationship with ENFPs as well. Aww the relationship sounds cute. Why don't you like emotional and intense? 
Also I'm an introvert too hehe, just a myer-briggs extravert (close to 50% on there too anyways).
Also, how do ESFJs feel about neediness? And how do you feel about ""alpha males""? Srry about the randomness pls I've never met an ESFJ other than my mum lol, and they surprise me so much, she's absolutely amazing but she surprises me so fucking much I dont see how someone can be like that I just don't lol idk how her brain functions so I need answers.
&&& last question if someone you had no love/hate towards (so an acquaintance or someone) were to hit you or slap you or something. Or do something mean to you behind your back, like steal your brilliant group project idea or smth. How would you react? "
947,esfj,"Wow, seriously?  NTPs do love ESFJs??  Funny, I recently read on Quora an article regarding opinions on ESFJs (coming from what INTJs think of them lol) and it was definitely not favorable lol.  So that's nice to hear others find ESFJs to be of interest!
I wouldn't say my roommate was cold, very honest, yes.  I mean she didn't care if she said something offensive if it was the truth but I am the same way so I didn't mind that.  I will say she is one of the most selfish people I have ever met.  Like I can have a conversation with her regarding something in my personal life (something I find very important, not just small chat about my day), she most likely would not be fully listening and/or she will totally change the topic so it revolves around her.  I found it very annoying and would even confront her when she would do that.  Then I just realized over time, she's not a person I can go to regarding personal stuff because she won't even care to listen.  She's also the type that won't go out of her way to hang out, I would need to initiate it.  She's too caught up in her own world.  (To her defense, she is married with 3 kids and works full time).  In college, I had 2 roommates, her and my other roommate was an ISFP.  We were all quite different but managed to all be good friends/roomates :)  My one roommate actually just suggested we all meet up soon (the ISFP of course, NOT my ENTJ roommate).
Oh so you are 50/50 on E and I?  You do think you are def more an ENTP?  I'm 50/50 on S and N.  I'm very close to the N but still make the cut for S and when I read it, it's definitely more on point.  I'm a SJ all the way (guardian temperament).
Omg yes, my ENFP was like a puppy, overly sweet and affectionate.  As in the type of guy who would get me flowers for no reason, bake me treats, give me massages, and would send the cutest messages with 100 emojis lol.  I liked that he was very verbally affectionate because most men don't express themselves in that way ever really but at the same time, I don't find it to be too masculine (meaning I don't think it's normal for a man to behave that way, especially considering he was like that from the getgo, I don't take men like that seriously because I feel like he treats all women like that.  So I don't feel it's genuine enough his gestures, despite how sweet on the surface and how much I appreciated it).  Emotionally intense as in, kind of acted like a girl (not meant in a negative way, just he had qualities that were not masculine to me), something I'd say would be offensive or he totally overanalyze things.  I felt like I was walking on eggshells to shield his heart and protect his feelings.  I need someone who is emotionally strong and not going to sweat the small stuff.  Oh and about neediness, this guy didn't really show that too much during the short time we dated but I could tell he was the clingy and emotionally needy type.  I'm very independent so I don't find that attractive.  I like a guy who makes me a priority and shows that they are loyal to me but NOT a guy who is going to revolve their whole life around me and expect the same in return.  No way, that's not healthy lol.
Which brings me to your question to how I feel about ""alpha males"" lol.  Being ESFJ are all about gender roles, at least I speak for myself, that means I am a very feminine woman and I believe gender roles should still exist, I don't care if it's 2018 lol.  This means that I prefer an ""alpha male"" or more I should say a masculine guy.  I define a masculine guy to be career driven, ambitious, proactive, make the first move (I'm the girl, I like to be pursued!!), and mentally strong.  Even though I like when a guy knows how to be romantic and say sweet things, at the same time, I can live without that stuff if his actions prove that he wants to be with me because I find that to be more masculine dating behavior.  Like I once dated a guy who would want to take turns driving us places.  I'm like, wait, what?  To me, that is not masculine, I associate a man wanting to be in the driver seat and drive me.  Not that I can't drive us, it just feels weird to me that a man is okay with that.  I made it clear that he has to drive us and explained my views on gender roles so he did but I could tell he thought it was strange.  Just two different perspectives.  Mind you, every other guy I have dated always knew to be the driver so this was never a topic of discussion with other guys in my life, just the one!  And surprisingly not the ENFP, a different guy.
Last question, interesting, maybe you can be more specific if it relates to something you need to know in your life personally, then I can weigh in better.  In terms of someone taking my ideas, something like that really does annoy me.  I'm an artist and I care most about being creative and original, that's a life need of mine.  So if someone is taking an idea (without telling me or asking permission first), I would be pretty mad.  If the person is not someone I'm too close to, I would probably not let them know.  Generally speaking if any acquaintance did something behind my back or something to get under my skin, I probably would have the feeling of anger/annoyed/frustrated/etc. however; I have extremely good emotional control in which I would not let the person ever know what I was feeling.  I wouldn't want to give them that satisfaction of knowing that they made me upset, so I would keep it cool and keep it moving.  I would also still be able to keep it cool to their face and act nice on the surface if I saw them but I would not go out of my way to interact with them.  Does that answer the question?  Basically, I would react internally, yes but do absolutely nothing about it externally.  
PS- Are you close to your mom btw?"
948,esfj,"Okay, so I'm going to write a reply Part I to your original mega message from 2 weeks ago that I only got to reply partially.  Then I will reply to the current message with a Part II that you wrote to me 2 days ago! :)
LOL at your comment about INTJs.  I will have to agree with you there based on the what I read on the internet from INTJ contributors.  They do come off overly pretentious and it seems that they are one of the most popular types to write in these forums yet they are considered one of the most rare types.  The 2 INTJs that I happen to know in real life are not like that at all though.  One is female (which is like super rare lol) and she's my cousin.  We don't live close but we have always been close by keeping in touch via email on a phone call (like maybe 3x a year).  Back in the day, we hand wrote letters to each other lol.  The other INTJ is a guy from my college who I reconnected with and currently have a mega crush on.  I forget if I had mentioned this guy at all in our previous messages but that's how I kind of got onto these Reddit forums to begin with, to learn more about INTJs.  Generally, they are so NOT emotional (and somewhat awkward with dating stuff), that it's so hard for me to pick up the signs if this guy is as into me or not so I needed some help via Reddit haha.  Which actually served as an amazing life line!  I can tell you more about this guy later if you want to know.
My ISFP roommate was great too.  I go from one extreme of a roommate who is the most self absorbed person I know (the ENTJ) to the ISFP roommate who is the most genuinely nice and non-judgmental person I have ever met.  An absolute sweetheart.  I consider myself a sweetheart and ultra nice to people but I admit I can be somewhat judgmental (internally like I said, I might not come off that way publicly, I know to keep some of my opinions to myself).  That's why I set myself apart from my ISFP roommate and put find her way nicer than I am.  Despite all of our varying personalities, we all managed to get along great, like sisters.  They both got along well also.  When we first moved in, I anticipated I would be the third wheel lol cause I'm unique and like to be different.  They were both girls I wouldn't necessarily be friends with in high school and as I predicted, in the beginning, they were closer (I didn't try too hard to be bff with either of them cause I had my own friends aside from them) but I guess living together, we all developed a great friendship pretty early on.  I lived with them again my second year.  Then I became an RA my last years of college in which I lived by myself.  I still keep in touch with them and we try to get together at least once a year :)  We are actually trying for next month!   
Random side note on ISFPs...I once dated an ISFP about 10 years ago now.  To this day, he was probably one of the few people I can look back on dating and say we truly had that soul connection.  He happened to be an artist too (I call him an artist and myself one because we both love art and are good at it but specifically he was into graphic design as a profession).  Also my longest relationship of almost 3 years.  I was so young then, he didn't have what I needed for choosing a life partner, meaning if I were to meet him now, not sure if we would have dated long.  But when you're young, you don't think about that stuff and I look back and am thankful for that relationship because it was true love, no doubt and I am happy to have been able to experience that in my life.  Was he ""the one,"" no but a wonderful boyfriend, yes, one of the very best!!  Looking at everything I have gone through since then, part of me wishes it could have worked out because of that deep emotional connection we shared (he was also the only person in my life that I think when we met, it was mutually love at first sight) but I do know ultimately it would not have moved forward to marriage.  
My ENTJ roommate as a parent, I have only met one of her kids I think and she has 3 now.  Based on social media (being she's so self absorbed, you better believe she posts a ton of photos of her and the kids lol), they seem like a happy family and she's very much involved.  A full time working mother but a full time mother to her children.  She's very responsible so I'm sure she's a great mother to them.
Type the ""different guy"" hmm, not sure which one we are referring to anymore haha, if it's who I'm thinking of and by that I mean one I have not mentioned their type yet, I'm actually not sure...he's def an I and probably a T, my guess an ISTJ because that's what my mom is and they seemed to be very similar (mind you, my mom and I are like oil and water with how we think but our relationship has improved over time).  I have quite a dating history (mostly seriously relationships, I'm not into casual relationships or dating for the sake of it) so I'm sorry it's hard to keep track of all this haha.
With the ENFP, the most short term relationship I ever had of like 3 months, I broke it off.  That's a LONG story, too much for this message as this is already going to be a book lol but I will say part of the reason it didn't work out was, I truly instinctively wasn't that into him to begin with.  I was open minded because he really pursued me (they are known to be super charming and they are!) and we had a few commonalities in terms of common interests.  In terms of how we lived our lives and our ambition levels (I'm very proactive and work hard, I would put him in a poor bum category lol), I just didn't really have respect for him as a man.  He acted more feminine with how emotional he was.  However, the main reason we broke up was due to his past resurfacing, him telling me something he had done behind my back in which I considered a major trust issue that I could not forgive him for.  Pretty much character flaws (integrity issues), family baggage, and ex baggage.  As shallow as this is, physical appearance is very important to me (I am an artist person after all, so I'm super visual).  I thought he was cute enough to date but he was NOT my type and he had the WORST style ever.  Like I respect people's taste and wouldn't want to tell someone what to wear but I was so embarrassed by his poor taste in clothing, I once had to tell him he NEEDED to buy a new shirt for a wedding I invited him to.  He had like a rap boy style, made him look immature and trashy (both qualities do reflect him as a person so I guess it makes sense haha).  I think if I was SUPER attracted to him physically and if we had an amazing physical chemistry (which we did NOT lol), I can put up with a lot of things.  I think I somehow ended up telling you all the major details but basically it came down to, ""I'm just not that into you"" but his whole ex situation was what made me walking away an easy decision.  
Another partial factor was the crush I mentioned earlier which had started to develop the same time I started dating the ENFP.  I never in my life was in a situation where I had feelings for 2 people at the same time, it was one of the worst things to go through because these is so much emotional guilt.  It's like, how is it that I have a boyfriend but I'm secretly thinking about another guy that I know I am way more attracted to physically and curious about mentally.  That's also how I knew that I needed to break it off with the ENFP...I just needed a strong reason for me to be propelled to do so.  I actually at one point asked the Universe (I'm spiritual but not religious) to please give me a sign as to what am I supposed to do about this situation.  The sign came that same week when his ex stuff got exposed.  Just the sign I was asking for!  
When you say the PUA videos directed to ESFJs...do you mean directed at picking up ESFJs as easy targets OR that ESFJs are known to be PUAs??  LOL...please clarify...this sounds like an interesting finding.
Sorry to hear about how your dad treats your mom!  Does he treat you that way too or you won't stand for it?  Do you have siblings?  What is your dad's type btw??  An I and a T perhaps...and what else, fill in the missing gaps lol."
949,esfj,"So Part I was too long to post in one post, I exceeded the max LOL...so here is part 2 of Part I...
Yes, I would agree that ESFJs (I can speak for myself) are in constant need of validation.  So what you have read about us ESFJs is spot on.  I wish I wasn't that way because I see how it's an annoying trait to possess and like you said, it's unfair for nice people to be the insecure ones.  I wouldn't say I'm insecure (I mean everyone has insecurities about something but as a general person, I'm very self-assured lol.  In my youth, not so much but over time I developed into a very confident and secure person).  ESFJs really like to make people happy, they live for that.  I will go out of my way to show someone I care about them.  Although this comes natural and it's on a genuine level, I also recognize part of the reason I do this is because in return, I receive validation from the recipient of how happy it made them which makes me the happiest person ever.  I need that to feel good about myself.  
In terms of dating, I don't necessarily need a guy to shower me with all these gestures to get that validation.  Like I said, instinctively, that doesn't feel masculine to me for a man to do that stuff all the time (maybe for holidays...yeah, ESFJs are traditional like you said so we do care about holidays and creating special moments whereas most people see it as just any other day of the year).  I think women are the ones to do that caring gesture stuff and men can show their validation to a woman on a masculine level...such as paying for dates, being a provider, opening a door, etc.  Although I wish men were more emotionally able to tell a woman they love them verbally (I do find words to be just as important as actions), I recognize that this does not come natural for most men and I accept that.  As long as they have other ways to convey they love me and want to be with me, I don't ask for too much.  I'm actually really low maintenance when it comes to relationships.  I like a laid back guy that's practical, down to earth, and lives life with a purpose.  They don't need to be overly rich or be the type to buy me flowers for no reason lol.  Those are all nice extra perks but definitely not necessities.  
About how mom and how she really feels about all this stuff, I'm sure she gets hurt very easily but has the capacity to put up with it as you mentioned to keep things stable (aka not getting a divorce, etc).  Like for me, stability comes before most things including my feelings.  In relationships, I don't have much tolerance though for bad behavior and non sense.  All my relationships were ended by me lol.  However if I was actually married to someone, I would take extra time to make it work vs. me always walking away and ending things with people.  I don't think I would ever be in a situation though being married to someone who would mistreat me.  I would pick up the red flags before I got to the altar.  I guess this is why I'm not married yet haha.  I don't believe in settling!!
So finally to your last paragraph and definitely an interesting topic...so if you gave me the opportunity to hurt someone who hurt me and if I could hurt them back without them knowing...I still would NOT hurt the person.  I believe in taking the high road.  Meaning, let's keep it moving!  No need to waste energy on doing mean spirited stuff to someone else.  I don't feel it's necessary to stoop to someone's low level.  On the flip side, I might not do anything to get back at the person but you better believe, I am extremely good at cutting someone off.  I believe the best ""revenge"" is no contact.  I have also done a lot of reading on this subject when it comes to dating and it is extremely effective.  By no contact, meaning not giving the person any attention because good or bad attention, that's still providing the person with some sort of validation.  If I did something mean back to the person, that means I'm still emotionally involved on some level.  I find the most effective way to ""get back at someone"" is to actually pretend they don't exist anymore and to cut them out of my life completely.  So if that counts as hurting the person, then that is my method lol.  I think giving someone the cold shoulder is one of the absolute worst things you can do to someone.  My intent is not so much to be hurtful to the person (although sometimes, yes, that is my intent) but most of the time, it's a coping mechanism.  That's how I handle getting hurt is to just completely remove myself from the situation...and the person.  I rather surround myself by positive energy and people than to let someone bring me down like that.    
Okay, I think I answered everything!  This took me over an hour to write, I think Part II will be much shorter.  Thanks for reading and chatting!! :)  If you need to break this message up into parts, please feel free to do so!  I talked about so much including answering your questions and adding other random stuff!"
950,esfj,"I'm not really sure if I took the test correctly, but I came out an ESFJ and my partner for over 2 years is an INTJ, I gather from our roommate and this subreddit that this is kind of a weird match. Is anyone else in a relationship with an INTJ? How is/was it?
Edit: Grammar and stuffs
Edit 2: We had been together for over two years before we took the test, so it isn't a big deal. We have a roommate who is an ENTJ and they get along very well, so I guess I'm the only one that has feelings lol and the only bubbly person here :P Anyways, it just explains a lot of stuff, like I always want to do something or party and he always wants to stay at home, and it explains some of our problems. It's just a different perspective I guess :)"
951,esfj,"My boyfriend is a INTJ but it works. He enjoys spending time at home but knows I need time to be out and about. It doesn't bother him that I go out without him, or even not invite him. 
What I do need, is someone who will make me come home at a reasonable hour and be a little bit more grounded since I'll make myself sick being out too much.
On the other hand, he needs someone to pull him out of the house so he doesn't get depressed. It works well both ways. We also live with a bunch of roommates, so both of our needs are easily filled. I can hang out with my roomies, while he hides in our room for ""alone time"".
He will go out with me sometimes, but I like going alone or with friends instead. Not that I don't love my SO, but I worry too much about him when he's out with me. Besides, I love coming home to him all warm in bed after a long night."
952,esfj,"I've just come out of one with a INTJ.
Difficult, it was like a rollercoaster. By the end of it I realised I was walking on eggshells, but felt like she possessed me. It really wasn't a great feeling. She was very Introverted and critical of alot of what I did, and I took it personally while she;d say I should be 'more emotionally mature' and to just get over it. End of the day, I (unfortunately) look back on it and see her as a bit of a self-absorbed bitch....
But that's my experiences haha"
953,esfj,"I can't speak to the INTJ-ESFJ relationship directly, but most of my close/intense friendships throughout life have been with INTJs.
Honestly, I have very little relationship/friendship experience with ESFJs. One of my close friends of 15 years is an ESFJ...but that is the only one.
Do you have any specific questions or scenarios you want to talk over?"
954,esfj,"my mother is ESFJ. i love her like a mother, but god dam i hate her so much i feel miserable around her. so much i already banned possible ESFJ partners from my life. im just subbed here to learn how to deal with you people."
955,esfj,"Yeah, I find it kind of strange for my roommate to say ""well that's the (insert letter) in him"" but it makes sense essentially. We swing, so I always want to go out and party with people for the social aspect, and most of the time he wants to stay in or leave early. We didn't take the test till over 2 years in our relationship, so it just explains a lot of stuff, but we already understood it, so it isn't a surprise. "
956,esfj,"No, it was just interesting to see how different we are, and how seemingly difficult this kind of relationship was to some people. We've been together for over two years before we took the test, so I'm definitely not concerned about the test results, it just explains a lot of problems and stuff."
957,esfj,"i am an intj and how i really feel is defined by miserable. i know it might sound anoying repeating the word miserable but thats what it is.
my mother intrudes too much in my personal life under the guise of helping me. she tries to ""help me"" so that i in turn own her for all the help she has done for me. she does that with others it does not work with me. it frustrates her and frustrates me she does not feel loved because i dont need her i do not feel free because i feel i have to be leashed to her.
she is not clear with her tastes. and prefers to say no a tousand times before i guess the correct answer. she does not like my straight to the point replies because they dont take into ""account the others person feelings"".
she changes things on a whim one day x was the perfect spot to put the plates now its Y because she got bored.
i dont even want to think about it now that she is on a trip. i feel liberated diferent and kowing the date she is comming back has filled me with dread."
958,esfj,"Hi, im an isfp male and i have a crush on an esfj girl. We have known eachother since childhood and as long as i can remember she has always been my idea of ""the perfect girl"". Very cool, easygoing, loving and independant
We've had two long breaks in our relationship, once when i moved away at 14, and once when her ex got jelous and told her to shut me out at 19.
Now we see eachother every monday (because thats the only day my workschedule allows us to meet) and its always fantastic and great and chill. But whenever we're not meeting in person i feel like she wants nothing to do with me. She rarely respond to texts and when she does she doesnt seem very invested. I do tend to send stupid witty one liners and compliments out of frustration and lack of knowledge in what to do when it comes to conversation, or starting it. 
This girl is as beautiful as she is kind, as smart as she is thoughtfull, and as extraordinary as she is loved. I rarely allow myself to dream (typical isfp self doubt), but this girl makes me sleepless at night. My brain tries to make up worst case scenarios, and they are all equally beautiful and worthwhile.
I doubt she wouldnt be able to see past my very poor facade, so she probably knows i have feelings for her, again. 
I myself need constant confirmation to even comprehend that im wanted, but i will never ask for it, as it makes me feel like ive taken something rather than earned it. Its just hard feeling like sje doesnt apriciate me, my forward actions or the barrage of anxt filled compliments. (Last gf dumped me because i placed her too high on the pedestal). 
Ive told her a lot about myself, how i act and think and what my needs are.
Not to stereotype you wonderful, all loving hate haters. But does anyone feel like they know whats up and what she wants or what i should do? Leave her alone? Keep commiting to her? 
I never really allow myself to fall in love so i dont know whats happening or if its just irrational illusions. Any advice is helpfull. 
TL;DR : Wall of text, i dont even know. Spastic brain."
959,esfj,"Have you talked to her about how you feel? Because if not you should! ESFJ's are very open about our feelings so we appreciate outward displays of emotion. While it is nice to send her little one liners or witty comments to let her know you are thinking about her, an open conversation about your feelings might go a lot further. 
Also, I wouldn't read too much into her not responding to your texts. I don't know if this is typical of all ESFJ's but I see texting as a superficial form of communication. I really only text to make plans, but not to have day to day conversation. I would much rather catch up with someone by spending time together (like you guys have been doing).
Best of luck :)
Editted to fix typos :)"
960,esfj,"I want to know people behind the letters.
The best way I know is to chat with you
So let's chat ! =D

I use to be patient an determinated when I have somthing in mind ,So even if the little number in upper left corner become big ,feel free to post anything and I'll answer asap (less than a day usually ,ever less than a week.) ."
961,esfj,"Nope ! ^^
I love ESFJs ,for as far as i've seen.
You are ,people of terrain and of other people, masters of material grounds.
I'm myself pretty incompetent when it's not about ideas : that's why I find you awesome. 
You run simple lives when I wish my life to be simplier. I shoud be jalous ,but I'm simply happy for you. You have done your best to earn the life you have."
962,esfj,"I have !
Question are personnal : I wanted to ask people ,not ESFJs.
Luckily all the people I ask are ESFJs =D
Tell me how you see internet/Reddit ,please !
What is MBTI for you ?
What means being an ESFJ for you ?
Are you as eager to talk about yourself as /u/SavvySmuel is ? It would be great ! ^^"
963,esfj,"Sure, yeah I'd love to answer your questions. Firstly, I view the internet/reddit mainly as entertainment. I also find that reddit in particular is very much a place where different viewpoints can be expressed and debated.
MBTI for me is a very interesting and fun thing that helps you to get to know yourself and others a bit more. It's like someone has read your mind and you are reading a description of the exact way you think and communicate! I personally enjoy it.
Being an ESFJ for me means that you must care for and protect those around you through verbal and physical support and action. The big plus for being an ESFJ for me is that I find it very easy to relate and connect with people. It feels so natural. Then again, the biggest downside for me would probably be that I find change to be very difficult. When someone moves, or if things in my life get kinda shaken up, I have a bad tendency to get stressed and nervous.
Feel free to ask any more questions, I hope that helps!
EDIT:Grammar."
964,esfj,"(You are free to not respond : I won't care at all if you do.)


What is internet for you ? Good or bad ? Inchoerent ?


Why you came on Internet/Reddit ?


What are your interests ?


What does being an ESFJ means to you ?


(That's enough for my point of view : more and it would be an interrogatory ! X) )
Thanks for  your attention !"
965,esfj,"I can relate to this !
That's very precise !
Thanks ! 
Yes it helps a lot ! ^^
I have one :
There is just a few ESFPs on the internets ,I'm wondering what  ESFP could prefer doing instead.
Have you some ideas ?"
966,esfj,"I use to forget that internet is a mean of comunication ! X)
That's what Reddit is made for. And why I love it too. ^^
Racing cars ? Like Bugatti cars ?
Computers ... 
I have a lot to say on !
What happen when you are interacting with people you don't like ? D=
That's okay : you may be a guy of action.
Our society needs people like you ,because others can think all they want if nothing is done ,thinking is useless.
I speak in experience ,here."
967,esfj,"That's awesome !
Seems fair ! 
Especially if you are a sucessful mechanic !
Ahah X)
Please tell me directly if you don't want to talk to me anymore ! =D
It would bother me more if you try to keep this kind of things for you.
I can relate ! =)
Haha ! I'm the opposite here. =D
I constantly find things that don't work if they are done the way they are normally done.
More than I can fix by myself. To the point that I find it insane.
Now I keep finding more but I don't try to fix it ,since I usually can't. 
I deal with it =)"
968,esfj,"That's what I expected ! ^^
So here we go !
I bet you are a man of action ,you can relate ? =)
Normal cars for normal engineering ,for and with normal people : it sounds actually pretty nicely !
More than that.
Difference betwenn N and S ,F and T and P an J. Maybe.
I just can't help it. When I look to an object ,I always try to imagine what I can do with it ,before touching it ,and usually see pretty quckly if it don't serves it purpose well.
It's like sombody was wearing some red jacket ,when all the others wore gray ones. As you we just can't help but notice it.
It works like that I think."
969,esfj,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled my google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
970,esfj,"Hey thanks for responding! One of my siblings is dating an ESFJ girl, and I'd love to know how to make her feel welcome at family functions and what type of things might make good conversation starters."
971,esfj,"I find it funny too! I'm always making everyone I know read about it and test themselves and I'm constantly talking about it. With how social ESFJs are I would think they would realize reading about theories, types, etc. works so well as a ""party game"" and lets people get to know each other better. "
972,esfj,"That's so nice of you to want to make her feel welcomed! Doing things that show you were looking forward to her visiting and thought of her could help ""I brought sugar cookies for dessert bc you mentioned how much you loved them last time!""
Conversation starters should probably be light. I know almost people hate small talk but I actually enjoy it and a lot of other ESFJs I know do too. It helps break the ice and lets people ease into being comfortable talking to each other. Additionally asking her  for help on things she might be good at will make her feel totally valued. ""I have to go to a baby shower next week and I have no idea  what to bring. Do you have any cute gift ideas?"" Or ""I have to go to a wedding next month and I'm between 3 dresses, you always look so nice, can you help me choose and accessorize?"" 
I hope that helps a bit! "
973,esfj,"I do the same thing, I've made everyone I have immediate communication with take one of the MBTI tests. My ESFJ friend seemed to be the least interested in MBTI than anyone else I forced to take the test, his reaction was like ""ok""."
974,esfj,"Hey ESFJs, we made a groupchat on groupme and would love for you to join!
https://groupme.com/join_group/14593377/1y4sFa
Please consider it!
EDIT: Downloading the app will make things a lot easier!
EDIT 2:
Groupme requires my phone number/name :(!
Yes, it does. However, nobody can see your phone number except for you - groupme is actually technically a texting app and can be used via text without the app, that is why. Your name can be easily changed/hidden/whatever you like. However, it's worth noting that ANY inappropriate behavior WILL get you kicked (it has happened before) and there HAVE been irl meetups stemming from this chat. Nobody is out to stalk you! We're chill."
975,esfj,"My little sister tested as an ESFJ, however she doesn't have a facebook, is super shy (at least around me), and keeps only a tight group of friends. She also graduated top of her class in highschool and in my opinion makes silly social mistakes: clingy with asshole boyfriend, casually lies, hangs out with dudes her own age that are sort of losers. She's super bright, and strikes me as introverted.
She's just a teenager, is this common behavior with ESFJs? "
976,esfj,"Could be.
I thought I was an introvert for a long time. Turns out, I was really just afraid of being judged. When I don't care about what others are thinking, I am myself.
If I'm not centered I can also become clingy."
977,esfj,"I don't know much about ESFJ's, I'm an INTJ. I've studied MBTI for about 16 months and am a regular over in /r/intj giving people helpful information about cognitive functions and development.
She's a really odd person, and because of her high intelligence, introversion, and general quiet shyness, I thought she might be more of an INxx. I was blown away when she told me that she took the MBTI and came back ESFJ. I asked her if she felt she related to it, and she believed it was partially accurate. I wonder how many other MBTI types she read about, or if she just read it, thought it was a horoscope of some kind, and never bothered further.
So, I read a bit about ESFJ's, and it seems that her personality that I observe is nearly opposite of the bubbly and outgoing stereotypical ESFJ; however my perception might be wrong. This led me to posting on ere.
I'm just trying to find ways to better connect with my little sister. "
978,esfj,"What I have found is that self taken tests can be quite unreliable. Usually the more accurate option is to have an experienced person interview and help someone determine their type. Even that is not an exact process, so there's always a margin for error. As for whether she took it seriously - I suggest you ask her :)
As for being quiet - there are many different ESFJ's out there. I wish I knew more of em, but even among the few I know, there are both the stereotypical bubbly cheery ones, and quieter, more reserved ones."
979,esfj,"Like I said she is young. But if she past the test herself, she could have cheated but it could require a high intelligence to do so.
The problem here in that kind of things is atheist if you understand what I mean. How can we deal with such a thing with atheist rule on the forum."
980,esfj,"MBTI isn't particularly accurate, for a number of reasons. Here's a quick and interesting read on the matter.
http://cognitivetype.com/2018/05/06/why-mbti-mistypes-everyone/ 
If you really want to understand yourself and others, you have to understand the cognitive functions. There are Eight in total (T/F and S/N, but either with either an introverted or extroverted charge). There are four sides to the mind, but for now I'll mention two. The Ego (Conscious) holds the four cognitive functions that a person most prefers and uses, and is generally where an individual resides, most of the time. The Shadow (Unconscious) holds the remaining four cognitive functions, which are reluctantly used and less often, but they are important at times and integrating the Shadow into part of your psyche is the path to maturity, to make yourself whole (with all eight functions in balance). ESFJ and ENTP are fairly similar as it so happens:
ESFJ: ego Fe - Si - Ne - Ti |shadow Fi - Se - Ni - Te
ENTP: ego Ne - Ti - Fe - Si | shadow Ni - Te - Fi - Se
So they share the same functions within the ego, creating similar traits. But the order greatly affects strength of functions, preference, and ""role"" (how they manifest).
If you want to know more on the topic, I could explain it. But if you're up for more learning, check out youtuber C.S. Joseph, his work is fantastic and he breaks it down beautifully.  
If you just want a quick glimpse of a difference between the two types, without too much background, it's something like this... (context can be found in C.S. Joseph's lectures) both types share the same interaction style of ""Starters"", which are; 
-Informative (explain in more detail, context always matters. opposite of Direct)
-Initiating (mark of an extroverted type, initiates experience/interactions. opposite of Responding)
-Movement (makes progress in/despite chaos, prefers novelty and frequent change/variables. opposite of Control)
So the difference comes down to the Temperament;
-Guardian (SJ): aka 'Past Protectors' are all about the past, duty/tradition, protecting loved ones (via past knowledge), are more interested relationships etc
-Intellectual (NT): aka 'Future Thinkers' prefer to think somewhat abstractly, form their own conclusions, are more interested in ideas/concepts/mechanics etc  
From your little descriptions, your Friend 1 sounds more ENTP, Friend 2 sounds like an ESFJ. Don't let the MBTI ""48:52"" ratios fool you, MBTI doesn't take into account cognitive functions, is horribly subjective, and uses loaded/leading dichotomies (as explained in the link above). Your friend isn't ""48% ENTP 52% ESFJ"" or anything to that effect, it's just difficult to type people when your tools aren't very sharp. :)  
Hope that helps, happy to answer questions. Cheers."
981,esfj,"Hello 
So i quit my job and I'm ready to tackle the whole 'working for yourself'. I'm really good at making plans , except those plans are constantly reworked every minute of the day. 
I've learnt early on that Im not a natural self starter when it comes to tackling down tasks. I did notice that when friends tell me to get  on with it , I actually do. 
So since I'm starting a new chapter , and I know what I know thought I'd ask . 
I can create my schedule and what I want to achieve daily or weekly basis , think where you'd come in handy is kind of checking on me couple of minutes , daily or every other day. You know some positive vibes and some orders.

982,esfj,"So I was friends with this girl in my group who is a sensor...not sure whether esfj or entj, and I was in a really bad place in my life since many months. She was really nice at first and stood up for me everytime there was any controversy of me against my friends. But then after one incident which happened 3 months back (I still regret it, it was completely unfair on her.) She said so many things which were really hurtful (but true, mostly.) And she became really practical afterwards (towards me too) and now we barely talk. We are never ever on the same wavelength. I really cared about her and she cared about me too so I think she got hurt really bad...please any advice on how to solve this? She loves to talk but doesn't talk about her feelings much so idk how to get through to her. I find myself strongly disliking her sometimes and I'm not saying that I want to be best friends with her but I just want to find my peace and be comfortable around her. She's mostly into people and things in her environment and material things that I'm not as much into as her...so it's difficult to even strike a conversation with her. Pls guide me."
983,esfj,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
984,esfj,"At my work we did a personality test prior to being hired, and a strengths quiz after being hired.  This allowed my company to build a team of people with varying skills and strengths, which helps us look at problems together from all angles and provide better solutions for our clients.  It actually works really great for us, but we're a pretty small company.  I don't think its a bad thing for companies to do, provided it isn't used to NOT hire a type of person.  "
985,esfj,"I'm curious though, how do you feel about being on the ""quiet"" side of the office?  Does it make you feel restricted in any way?  Would you be more or less comfortable if they just tossed your desk onto the other side?  "
986,esfj,"I haven't had a girlfriend in a year, but I also haven't been with a girl I really really liked in what feels like a hundred years (my INFP ex-it felt great to be with her; so cerebrally engaged, and adorable). Big sigh coming over me. 
I kind of feel like I have high expectations after a few run ins with non compatible chicks, and I have zero intentions on bringing them down.
No women has ever turned my eye or made my heart jump out my chest. I'm starting to wonder if there are long time single ESFJ males, and if so, how have you guys lived your lives?
I mean we always have a hand if we need a hand if you know what I mean, but goddamn... casual flings are a possibility, but I don't feel confident in myself to do them-so I just toss that option out.
Anyways, I'm into driving... extremely fast on the mountain passes. It's therapeutic in a sense. I wonder how you guys cope."
987,esfj,"Yeah, I'm not very compatible with a lot of women even if almost everyone likes me or is drawn to me. I've even been told that a lot of women consider me to be out of their league, which is ridiculous because I was the quiet, skinny loner with only a few friends in high school lol
Also, I was reading through your comments about your charisma and how you hate to over use it. I totally relate to that sentiment. I wish it I could be book smart, but I'm not, so I often rely on my charisma and manipulating people's emotions. Speaking of charisma, I really hope I can talk my way into qualifying for this one private university's admissions requirement on Wednesday"
988,esfj,"INFP female, 46 here...who has been co-habitating with ESFJ male, 46 for the last 17 months.  Can I tell you that for him to be single for a long-term (as in say, over 6 months) would probably be his undoing.  Before we got together, he was dating multiple women casually and hadn't been in an ""intimate"" relationship for about a year.  He's got VERY high standards (and I have posted to this group before that I always feel so humbled by that because he is very much into the ""best of everything"" which on some level I apparently represent).  The thing with my particular ESFJ SO is that he really doesn't know what to do with himself without an ""other"".  He will improvise as much as he can, but ultimately will give in to the nagging feeling of being disconnected and will try to fill that with a temporary person.  But, since he doesn't really do temporary, these supposed flings end up being drawn out and lasting much too long, resulting in feelings of frustration (with settling for what he doesn't really want) and delusion (maybe if he hangs on it will somehow, some way get better and magically become all he wants it to be). 
When I met him, this is exactly where he was-with a woman who was 20 years his junior and frustrated as hell because she was a lot of fun, but out of control most of the time.  Her lack of self-discipline and the fact that she was reckless and irresponsible were making him crazy.  He's a lot of fun and very adventurous, but he's also very conscientious and for lack of a better way to put it-dutiful.  He knows when to ""power down"" so to speak.  She did not.  He knew that she was never going to be able to harness the things he wanted her to without becoming miserable, so when he met me, I was refreshing in a way.  
We started dating in May, and by October he had convinced me to move in with him.  And we've been together almost 2 years now, and it's been tough in some ways (I'm nowhere near as rigid in some aspects as he is and sometimes that causes the occasional rift) but I will tell you, it's hands-down the most committed, delightful, respectful, understanding and solid relationship I've ever been in...and I've been married before!  He is a person who needs to have That One Person.  And that woman can't just be any woman...so I benefit from his dedication and his attention and affection.  He's pretty damn amazing.
My advice to you is this:  Don't settle.  (I don't think you intend to)  Don't question your ability to wait (you have amazing friends and family who can fill-in for you and want to see you happy and satisfied in your relationships-we love our ESFJ's...we want them to max out their happiness quotient) because you can wait for the person you're looking for.  Just be content to work on your inner life and polish the gem that you already are-ESFJ's can sometimes have rough edges...polish them til they sparkle.  She'll see you and she'll be completely unable to resist you.  (I know-mine had me from jump!  LOL)"
989,esfj,"No comments yet, so I'll contribute best I can: 
My ESFJ girlfriend also has extremely high standards. It's quite the confidence boost for me of course.
She did flings before meeting me in 2018, but at least according to her, they were only with the intention of a LTR. She would never do them with someone she wasn't interested in exploring something with. She spent about 7 months single.
If you are an ESFJ, I think you have the charisma to easily do this."
990,esfj,"Hm, I've been single for about 2.5 years now. Few reasons though:  my ex-wife cheated on me, so I'm going to be a little pickier this time around because of that (did have a temporary rebound flick after that); religions reasons--I don't date, a bit similar to arranged marriage or a traditional marriage of the old times, i.e. courting phase, engagement, then marriage, all within a year usually; I've really been focusing on personal growth during this time because now I have a better idea of what I did wrong in my marriage.  
Coping with single life hasn't really been that difficult for me, though. I've really enjoyed being able to connect with my friends again that I kind of put off while I was married. I get to focus more on my studies since I'm an undergrad student and attending graduate school this summer. I get to focus on my hobbies--I competed in powerlifting for the first time 2 years ago despite lifting for 12 years; also picked up photography. Also used my failed experiences to help my friends in relationships from making the same mistakes I made, which gave meaning to my pain.  
Marriage took up a huge proportion of my emotional energy and now that I am single, it means I get to spread that energy to other facets of my life. These other facets of my life make me feel fulfilled, so I think it makes being single easy. "
991,esfj,"Curious I'm an INTP and i'm also have been single for a while and also miss being in a relationship but I it isn't because I haven't been interested in someone, more like not sure about the meeting and scalating part."
992,esfj,"Yeah, I think INFPs are awesome. Even if you are female and if there's someone you like, you won't hesitate to make yourself known. I like that. Makes my life easier because I'm not the type to want to prospect for women lol."
993,esfj,"I appreciate you posting on here. I thought an eternity would pass by before I do; so I do appreciate you.
You've got a point, but I grew up in a Ne/Ni/Ti/Te dominated environment-so my confidence is correlated to my ability to be smart. Off Eintstein's quote, I'm a fish trying to climb a tree and always have been. I also have a disdain for my charisma because I see how superficial it is, and how inflated it is. It's nothing amazing in reality, and I view it as a joke because I associate my level of charisma similar to figureheads. In summation, charisma is a fucking joke lol. You can seem amazing, but in reality, are you really that amazing? No. Okay, so it's just ""...fugazy fugahzy-fairy dust."" And that my friend is bullshit, and I'm not okay with bullshit. Haha.
As for LTR... I know I'm lying when I think of an LTR developing from a fling. In essence, it's my lure to women, which I dislike-to me, it's an inflated lie which is not okay. It's a waste of their time and it's a lie I create for myself."
994,esfj,"Tbh, I wonder if I lost my libido, but I haven't. I'm either subconsciously holding out, holding back, having trouble finding the one that makes me jump out my seat, or a combo of these. I usually have a gut instinct about girls I know won't make it. I use my Si a lot based on facial expressions a girl makes. Based on the facial expressions and mannerisms, I can sort of determine the personality. Sure, her life story may be different, but her personality isn't. And I guess I shoot for personality-that one is probably INFP. ENFPs don't grab my attention, ISFPs are way too sensitive, ISFJs are dull after awhile, ESFJs are dull and annoying, ENFJs will be at odds with us, INTPs make cool friends, ISTPs well... good luck with that, ESTPs see me as too nice... So I could go about naming every other type, but I'm pretty set on INFP. They have the qualities I like: self-deprecating humor, funny, wit, sexually explorative, intelligent, bubbly, sweet, and has what I lack-the Fi Te perspective which I definitely need. And the last time I ever felt anything for anyone was my INFP ex. So... I guess she set my high expectations. This was like Jr high/High School lmao.
Every other girl was more like a whatever relationship that felt like I had 0 attachments. I stay away from these now. I don't need to waste my time, money, and energy on those girls. I guess I'm a bit jaded the way I phrase it. 
Eh whatever."
995,esfj,"haha, nice tangent. 
i see charisma not as smarts but as the ability for people to feel comfortable around you. 
btw my gf also has no confidence to talk to people as well. its funny because people love talking to her. of course i don't know how easy it is to talk to you, but i'm leaning towards ""similar"" :)"
996,esfj,"It actually is easy as hell lol. I think recovering from a broken marriage was the hard part, not being single.  
Nah, will be pursuing my doctorate in physical therapy. A fitting career for an ESFJ, I think. haha"
997,esfj,"I wish I had a ""Bat Signal"" for INFP females...LOL...they need to know you're out there!  
And, as an INFP female...thank you for your kind words.  We are so weird, sometimes it feels like few appreciate our weirdness as much as we do..HAHAHAH!"
998,esfj,"It's unfortunate. I never like to leverage my charisma because it's bullshit to me. It isn't genius, which I've grown to prefer. The idea of me being charismatic without being even more smart than charismatic enrages me. Makes me sick, but I won't increase my chances of getting it in until I change my perspective I guess.
Well, thanks for sharing your thoughts and support."
999,esfj,"Well, I don't speak for all SFJs, but I definitely appreciate INFP weirdness. 😊. Makes me feel right at home and comfortable. That way, I don't have to judge myself as harshly.
Also, INFP females are quite easy to catch. Most of you have the ""melting smile."" Like the eyes melt a little bit. It's like you, most INFPs, are happily sedated."
1000,esfj,"Well I'm ""smart"" if you consider logical smart. I'm not ""smart"" if you consider wisdom smart.
Assuming you might consider logical smart, I don't see how that equates to me being charismatic. I sure as hell don't win people over. I don't have social skills (actually, I've improved quite a bit here). It was extremely difficult for me to make friends.
I think it might be a ""grass is greener"" thing. You already have charisma, so you want smarts perhaps.
I think you should be proud of your ability to make people feel comfortable. I don't see it as a lie. Most of life is about connecting with people and sharing with one another. Of course everyone has different values, some want family, some want money, fame, power. But you have a skill that makes people open up, and that makes people feel good about themselves. I think you should wear that with pride.
Sorry I kinda derailed. I know this isn't what you were concerned about."
1001,esfj,"I'm saying charisma and intellect are mutually exclusive, but my main concern is that I lack the level of intellect I desire. So I shut off all my strengths in order to focus on my weaknesses in hopes that I improve my weaknesses and make it my strength.
So I focus a lot on critical thinking for every little thing-it's a bit intense, but I rather be smart than charismatic. Being smart can help me make money and excel in hobbies as opposed to being charismatic, which doesn't help me achieve such things. Charisma might work in sales, or politics, but none that I want to do or be in.
Maybe I have a grass is greener thing. I can agree on that, but I honestly dgaf haha. I've completely shut out my charismatic abilities (shouldn't be hard for me to shake the rust off, but eh)."
1002,esfj,"Ah sorry, yeah I was conflating what you said, thinking you were equating smarts to charisma. I get what you mean now!
Still. I think its commendable you want to put so much thought into everything. Not many people take the time."
1003,esfj,"Yeah, thanks man. It's a huge grudge I have against myself, and potentially, just against everyone I've observed with the same personality type. It's hard to not want to improve after you see everyone else's (personality types similar to mine, or yours, in general) shortcomings-it does something unexplainable to you. Like you can't unsee what you saw type of phenomenon. For example, a guy puts his head in an alligator's mouth and gets it chopped off. Why would I do the same thing? Ya know? haha."
1004,esfj,"My favorite is when I'm with a group of friends and everyone/everything is just clicking well. That's the best. Like, everything is in harmony! 
I also love running, even as a beginner, and generally taking care of my health and hygiene. I put a lot of time into this (especially oral care) and it feels nice to be clean!
Also, going to sleep after a productive day feels great. Like that moment when you first get into bed!"
1005,esfj,"I love being around hilarious people that really make me laugh and take me on adventures. I love spontaneous people that take charge of social situations and make things fun and exciting. 
I love having a clean house that smells nice, and taking on new and interesting projects like making my own cold brew (which i do all the time now) or just cool new recipes and DIY projects. 
I love planning things like my wedding or future parties with unlimited budgets just for fun. I also enjoy practically planning. I definitely have a pinterest account.
I really enjoy catalogging (sp?) my daily progress on a goal, whether it is weight loss, fitness challenges, homework/grades, personal goals, etc.
i also just love having a supportive group of friends that i can always count on to make plans with and generally have a good time. I don't necessarily need people i can open up to because i feel like a burden when i do that but i do need to feel like i have a solid group of people that like me and want to be around me."
1006,esfj,"I guess it depends on the person. In my case, I get to tend to be attracted to INFJs. My bestfriends are mostly INFJs and my first love is an INFJ. I love their reliability, consistence, being caring, warmth, being loving, trustworthiness, sense of responsibility, and wanting to make a difference in the world. I also love how they can read you in a deeper level and know what you are feeling and thinking without you saying it. It is even scary sometimes. Sometimes, I tend to hide my feelings because I don't want to be a burden. It feels nice to be understood like that on a deeper level. :D I also love ENFPs. One of my bestfriends is an ENFP and I have a lot of ENFP close friends. I love their fun loving nature, warmth, positivity, sense of adventure, creativity, imagination, etc. :D I generally love NFs when it comes to mbti. :D In general though, I think ESFJs like appreciative people, warm people, thoughtful and caring people, kind people. :D I don't know if this is related to being ESFJ, but I love people who are kind, altruistic, and who want and does things to make a difference in the world. :) These three are the qualities I love the most. :)"
1007,esfj,"To your question about what we look for in a partner, loyalty is very very important and reliability. We need to be sure that you are sure of us. We appreciate consistence. As I said I want a kind partner and who does things to make a difference in the world (I want to make a difference so I want my partner to be with me in these projects, etc.). A funny and funloving person, too, since I want to take the person with me on my adventures. :D"

1009,esfj,"When I dated, I would get attached quickly.  I always wanted to make him happy however I could, even if that meant doing something I didn't really want to do.   My relationships seemed to get serious too quickly also.
It was very hard for me to break up with somebody because I hate hurting people, so I have been in some relationships longer than I want to admit.
Happily married to an ISFJ now, and we complement each other pretty well.  He still doesn't understand why I like to reddit and look at my ""weird stuff,"" yet he's the one who works with computers and technology!  
I irk him sometimes when I want to invite the whole town over and he's just content with his 2-3 friends here.  "
1010,esfj,"I know this is an old post, but I've been in a relationship for over 2 years now with an INTJ. Our relationship has been great, we've had some ups and downs like normal couples, but even in our low points I couldn't stand the thought of breaking up. We are just really good with our communication skills :D"
1011,esfj,"Finally someone I can relate to. 
I've been in more than one relationship that has lasted too long because of this.
I get high on a good social life"
1012,esfj,"So, I've watched Wreck-it Ralph 2 or Ralph breaks the internet if you want to call it that, aaaand I think he is an ESFJ, based on his actions and behaviour and desires in both movies, in the first movie he seeks to change his life because he felt like he wasn't loved, he went to try and get a medal and you know how the rest goes, and in the second movie the plot gets kickstarted when Ralph builds a new track for Vanellope since she wants something new and he wants her to be happy, but when Vanellope fights for control with the player they have to go to the internet to save Sugar Rush  aaaand I would go on with the movie's whole plot, but I feel like it could be resumed, everything Ralph does in the movie is for Vanellope's  sake, and one of the reasons Ralph doesn't like Vanellope going to Slaughter Race is that he feels is not appropriate for her because it's too violent, too scary, etc, despite Vanellope loving the game, long story short he's clingy  and overprotective and learns not to be that, letting Vanellope grow up and pursue her dreams, I feel like his Si was very strong with his desire to leave things as they were... and, what do YOU  think about Ralph? do you think he's an ESFJ? why? "
1013,esfj,"I disagree but I think you're very close! I think Ralph is INFP. I don't disagree with anything you said about him, but I disagree that those things imply Fe. Ralph, in the first movie, is trying to define his role and, to a greater extent, his identity. He isn't satisfied by what he was born into and feels conflicted about his internal belief in right vs wrong. The movie is about him accepting that his role is one of good and that he isn't limited by his title. I haven't seen the second movie yet, but from your description and from what I've heard, it seems to be Ralph coming into another conflict of right and wrong. On the one side, he believes children her age shouldn't be exposed to violence of a certain degree. But on the other, he recognizes why this makes her feel good and why it's important to her, and believes that she should have what she wants. And I imagine the ending is about him accepting that the second one is more important than the first. Am I right?
Fe tends to be quite relativistic, in that it assesses right and wrong based on the contents of the situation at hand, rather than by forming universal rules that it tries to apply in every situation. I think if Ralph was an Fe user, then the conflict of the movie would never have taken place. He'd have seen plainly that Vanellope was competent and that the game was making her happy, and simply accepted this.
What do you think?"
1014,esfj,"Hahahaha!!! I love this analysis!!! 
INFP here and Ralph is definitely not INFP. The guy (forgot his name) who adopted those 15 homeless candy children seemed more INFP to me lol
If you seen the 2nd part of the movie you'll understand why Ralph's ESFJ like. 
He manipulates situations for his own neediness and is madly insecure about his friendship. That's an ESFJ trademark. 
Now I can't type Vanellope, INTJ maybe? "
1015,esfj,"I'm an INTP, with the same functions but in the opposite order. I know one person who is definitely an ESFJ, and sometimes our perspectives just seem incomprehensibly alien to each other. Frequently, she's made me wonder ""What? Why?!"" and she seems to think I'm weird and/or nuts. Not to mention completely different priorities and interpretations of things (we went to high school together. I explained a lot of logical/conceptual nuances to her in english class when she had trouble. And she's explained some things to me as well)
Basically, I'm hoping someone here could explain your perspective in terms of the cognitive functions."
1016,esfj,"As an ESFJ, everything I do is somehow related to how people feel. My feelings are intimately linked with other people's feelings. So I figure them out by looking at how I relate to my environment and other people. I am motivated by making people feel good and the hope that people will like and care about me, because I care so much about them. All I really need to hear to get along with someone is first and foremost that they care and that they will respect my feelings, and I need to feel that they are genuine in saying that. I also really like for people to appreciate that I care about them. I want to feel wanted.
Since you're a Ti user, you probably communicate and bond mostly through your principles, knowledge, things that are meaningful to you personally. So, just like it might be hurtful to you if I dismissed the importance of your knowledge or your inner world, I will be hurt if you dismiss my feelings. The important part here, though, is this is Fe. What what will hurt me most is making you/other people feel bad, or making people dislike me, even more than you explicitly saying that my feelings are wrong--not that I like being told my feelings are wrong, but the way you say things to me is more important than what you say. You have to think about your tone of voice and if you can't control it very well, you should tell me you're not sure how it is coming off. The worst thing you could do in communicating with me is to make me think that I hurt/wronged you and that you need distance from me because I am bad. The next worst thing you could do is ignore me or blow me off. I will feel like I am not valuable and I am not wanted. What I want is a harmonious connection. We don't have to be exactly the same, we just have to respect each other's needs.
But, if I get stressed out enough about something, don't beat it to death. If I ask for space, grant it. I'm probably becoming INTP-like when I get really stressed. I start needing some distance from people and I need to do something calming, simple and factual to reset. Once  I'm happy again I'll probably feel guilty about anything negative I did or said when I was stressed. 
At all times, cooperation is what matters most, and believe me, I am willing to cooperate. I don't bond over things or ideas that much. I bond over the experiences and meaningful communication that they can facilitate. In my rawest form, I am an incredibly direct person. I want deep, loving, mutually gratifying connections to people. I'm sensitive... yes, and easily hurt. But I really care. All anyone has to do is honor that."
1017,esfj,"To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure what I was asking either, it was more general.
What's categorised as Fe with me is just politeness/caring about how other people feel, especially in terms of not making anyone feel awkward or upsetting anyone by being rude. The best I can figure with it being more pronounced is just being better at it, and/or being more willing to focus on feelings than things like honesty (not that anyone's less honest. More that (crappy example:) while someone else might respond to ""does this dress make me look fat?"" or whatever with ""no"", I'd be more likely to say ""you look fine"". Although that's hardly always based on MBTI types).
Also the difference between extroverted and introverted feeling with me is firstly things like phrasing things in a nice way when necessary, and secondly they're not ""mine"" so much as I'm the one feeling those emotions, if that makes sense? While Fi would associate/identify more with their own feelings and beliefs etc. But that's pretty close to Fe for people who have a stronger sense of it. My understanding is that it's more empathetic or just focused on others (hence being an extroverted function), or is there more to it than that?"
1018,esfj,"Describe them please.
I'm a pretty unorganized ESFJ lol. I pretty much plan as I go-usually because I am lazy. For example, my co-worker was upset that we didn't say Happy Birthday to her (huge eyeroll). Instead of saying Happy Birthday to her straight up, I determined because she was upset that we didn't say happy birthday, I decided that we just create a surprise birthday party plan by giving her a shitty day as a prank. I find those things fun, but I'd rather fuck myself than get into long term planning. I also get stressed out from trying to plan things-like trips. That shit is stressful. Ironically enough, I hate when people plan things and it becomes messy. It pisses me off-I know it's sort of hypocritcal."
1019,esfj,"My planning skills are so chaotic most people wouldn't consider them planning skills. Like, if I wanna plan what I'm gonna do in the future, I'll go online and type in ""cheap apartments in the lit city"", find one I can afford, slap together some fantasy chick-fil-a work schedule, scream it at the top of my lungs in public so I can get some feedback, and get everything all yeet sorted out. Chances are my plan is so flawed that it will literally never happen in my wildest dreams, but hey, whatever. For actual short term planning though, I'll just grab my phone and see what's going to happen. Big party today? Sweet, I'll be on my phone until it's time to go. Wanna do errands while we wait? Nice! Where do you want to eat? We can watch a movie. Who wants to come with us? I'd rather have other people do the hard part of planning, because for me if I have to do it, it's WAY more work than the event is actually worth. So lol, TLDR nonexistent"
1020,esfj,"Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.
Here is the link to the survey
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ"
1021,esfj,"I am a big MBTI nerd (INTJ, what can you expect?) and apparently we are incredibly compatible with all of you ESFJs. My source comes from CS Jospeh and his series on social compatibility.  
Thing is, where do ESFJs go for fun? INTJs don't really go out and I've been trying to match with an ESFJ via online dating... it's not going well. :/  
​"
1022,esfj,"Hmm I disagree. I think ESFJs are the worst match for INTJs. INTJs go well with ENFP or ENTP. ESFJs have Fe, which is your polr function in socionics, and will drive you up the wall. INTJ/ESFJ are conflicting relationships in socionics, each knowing how to hurt the other to the max. "
1023,esfj,"This is me and my husband!! We make it work. In a lot of ways we push each other to overcome our weaker areas - he helps me imagine scenarios beyond what I can see (his N vs my S), I remind him to connect with his family (my E vs his I). We explain ourselves and forgive a lot"
1024,esfj,"I'm not too into Meyers Briggs anymore, but I don't know if I could get along with someone so opposite of me, for life.  My husband is an ISFJ and we drive each other bonkers, but I think that's normal in any relationship.    "
1025,esfj,"I'm INTJ and my wife is ESFJ. We will be celebrating our 40th Wedding Anniversary this year and I will take as many more anniversaries as I can get.  We work hard at our marriage because we both want to make it work.  All of the previously discussed annoyances have happened and continue to happen in our marriage, but the positives of the relationship are incredible.  There are aspects of our marriage in which there will never be a meeting of the minds - we've be down that ""solution"" road already and from my point of view there will never be a resolution to my satisfaction but I've moved on because having ""us"" is worth it.  Maybe a different kind of personality matchup would have been an easier relationship for me, but I wasn't looking for easy; I was looking for someone to bring things to my life that I could not do for myself.  She was exactly who I was looking for and waited for and it's been worth it."
1026,esfj,"Funny you say that. This rings true. I know an INTJ and when I ask about his ESFJ girlfriend, he'll roll his eyes and say, ""she's nice but f** she's annoying. She won't shut up."" I said ""Well, I talk a lot."" and he says, ""No, not like that.""  I don't quite know what that means. I'm an ENFP and I can talk BUT maybe I can get the message if someone wants to be left alone. Unless, I intentionally want to make them talk. heheh..then well, RESISTANCE IS FUTILEEEE.. BWAHHHHHHHH. sorry. okay."
1027,esfj,"I think it comes to down to if the person mentally okay or not, as in: are they depressed? Do they have any mental disorders? I had a very negative experience with an ENFP who seemed very giving, but he was also highly depraved. He turned out to have very poor mental health/was drinking/doing drugs. The current ENFP I've been seeing is very mentally stable and mature, and we hit it off great. Again, I think it comes down to that. I'm also an alcoholic, so I can tell you that your friend probably hates herself for it."
1028,esfj,Are you in love with your wife still? Imagine if you had married her for all the benefits without having fallen in love with her (ever) and married her anyway. Where would you see yourself in relation to her now?
1029,esfj,"""she's nice but f** she's annoying. She won't shut up."" I said ""Well, I talk a lot."" and he says, ""No, not like that."" 
My husband is an INTJ and his sister in law is an ESFJ. He says this about her all the time. I had to go read this to him. "
1030,esfj,"""""she's nice but f** she's annoying. She won't shut up."" 
is could be translated to ""person is too full of themself to care about another"" but again the guy could just be venting his frustration on a bad day rather than talking about her over a long period of time..."
1031,esfj,"Hey so I'm a 19yo Male who happens to be an INTJ. I have always been very introverted and spend lots of time in my own thoughts. My mom is an ESFJ who is constantly wanting to have conversations and share her opinions even though I prefer not to talk unless necessary. Of course I am open to having meaningful conversations but only if my mind isn't on something else that I'm trying to solve.
As you can see our personalities clash and we tend to not get along when I'm at home. I'll be living at home until I graduate College and I would love some tips on how to get along with an ESFJ and make sure she understands my needs. Thanks!"
1032,esfj,"My best advice would be to just be honest. When you aren't open to having conversations just say, ""I'm not really in the mood for a big conversation right now."" She might be a little bummed but honesty is the best policy. I'm not really sure I can think of any ""tips"" "
1033,esfj,"Greetings y'all!
I've been running an MBTI themed Skype group for about 3 months now, and it's been a great experience. A really fun and supportive community grew out of it, and the core members have gradually formed a close group of friends.
Conversation is largely casual, but tends to dip into the abstract. Consciousness, morality, metaphysics, psychedelics, and language tend to be pretty big topics. MBTI as well, naturally.
It's all participant directed, so you can take it into whatever domain you're interested in. If you're into some cool niche thing, we'll probably want to hear about it.
We mainly talk through text chat, which is sporadic throughout the day, but if we can drum up enough interest we do voice/video calls as well. If you're shy, there's no pressure to join voice calls.
I think ESFJs are an excellent type to have around in any social group - beyond their well known ability to bring people together, they're often gifted with a no-nonsense insight into human nature. I've been lucky to know a few across the course of my life, and I'd very much like to meet a few more.
If you think you'd be interested, send me a PM with your age, gender, MBTI type, and a short self description (interests, hobbies, etc) so I can get a sense for you.
Hope to meet you guys soon!"
1034,esfj,"Hi guys I’m an INFJ male, my wife is an ESFJ, we have a quite strong relationship and love each other very much.
It’s hard for her at the moment as she suffers CFS and PTSD so I’m picking up most of the slack and working full time and I’m ok with it, but it do see it makes her feel guilty at times but I think she copes the best way she can.
The question I have is i suck with expressing myself in the bedroom, she says I’m hopeless telling stories to turn her on (that I always use a similar one) she says she likes hardcore male in control type fantasies, but not very clear.
I would love to ask the ESFJ community what turns you on and can you offer me any advise on what I need to be learning/researching to make my beautiful wife feel more relaxed than make things uncomfortable, as I care about her enjoyment so much."
1035,esfj,"Not an ESFJ but tell her a story about how you would overpower her and do what you wanted with her. Cherry on top would be that you wanted to pleasure her ""against her will"" before doing anything for yourself. It sounds like she might be into some level of domination, which is not uncommon. "
1036,esfj,I live alone and I'm only at my house mostly for sleeping. I tend to stay busy unless I plan a night at home to clean or meal prep or something like that. And even those nights can get interrupted with plans lol.
1037,esfj,"I did for a year and it was no fun at all. Luckily my job had me interacting with 120+ people a day, but I was still bummed out after being surrounded by friends in college in my living space.
I tried to join community events and stuff, which kind of helped. But where I lived was a sleeper community for DC/retirement area with most people either school aged or over 40. And it was juuuuust far enough from DC for me to go too often, with being busy with work and all. It wasn't the best year of my life, but I managed.
I'm making sure that where I live next has an average age of under 40 lol! "
1038,esfj,That would definitely make living alone harder!! I live in a pretty happening city with young professional adults so there is usually some cool shit going on but it's still hard to come home to an empty apartment.
1039,esfj,"INTP was my first serious relationship. We dated almost three years and we ultimately broke up because we were both graduating college. We were more friends than lovers, but in the best way. It’s the most comfortable relationship I’ve been in and I was most my true self. Pros were really good conversation and a lot of time together was spent. Cons were a lack of emotional understanding and poor communication. 
ESFP was the biggest heartbreak. I was head over heels and it was the only relationship where I felt like I had more to lose. This is the only breakup that I genuinely was blind sided by. Pros included spontaneous adventures and a lot of emotional understanding. Cons were that he was too extroverted for me so I never felt like a priority. The highs were too high and the lows were too low. 
ENFJ was the least fulfilling. He never understood me and we argued all the time. Emotionally, there was a connection but intellectually I felt so unstimulated. He loved me dearly but never listened to what I had to say and really only cared about his own interests. We lasted about 8 months before I called it quits. Pros were emotional validation. Cons were not enough attention to the little details that make a relationship special. 
I would say I get along the most with INFP and ISFP romantically. Timing and circumstances often prevent me from dating the ones I meet though. "
1040,esfj,"My first and only relationship is with an INTP, we have been dating for about a year now and  are both very happy with the relationship. We have our bumps every once and a while, but we have definetly learned to understand one another which is our main issue. INTPs are extreamly caring individuals it is just in a different almost sweeter way than how most people would show it, and I really enjoy their company from what I have seen. Every day I spend with my INTP boyfriend I find myself fascinated and loved in what I think to be the perfect relationship for myself."
1041,esfj,2 months so far. We’re still learning about each other. It’s hard sometimes because I have to pull info out if his head while I just spew all my thoughts all the time. I really like that he’s like me in the way he remembers things about people so well and is very thoughtful. I imagine it will get better as time goes on. Seeing him with his friends make me hopeful for the future. 
1042,esfj,"yeah i totally agree. based on my boyfriend, it's easy for me to care for him and feel like i'm a good force on his life. and it makes me feel good and validated that our relationship is positive for us both
although i'm very extraverted and would want to hang out with my friends after work or on weekdays, whereas he's happy to watch netflix or play PS4"
1043,esfj,"Well, we’ve known each other for a long time; I don’t really have much to say on the MBTI front except for that our opinions and thoughts are very similar, but we’ve also been friends for practically forever before we began dating. She actually considered herself to be an INTP or something introverted, before she took another test; she is an ENTP. We’re long distance, but we’re both very chatty and charming!"
1044,esfj,"Tbh, you just need to fulfill your ESFJs needs whatever they may be. Shit is EZPZ because everything is on her sleeve probably. Just observe and listen. I wouldn't doubt that you've gotten it down by now. Just be careful of how you critique and tone down your banter... unless she's cool with it."
1045,esfj,"What I'm reading is that us ESFJs need low maintenance counterparts in order to feel satisfaction. In essence, having to meet high expectations in a relationship will probably drain us. Also, not being able to meet their needs will affect our self esteem negatively. 
I'm a male ESFJ. Just trying to figure out my woman. Tired of trial and error when I think most of my trials are going to be errors."
1046,esfj,"Oh yeah, what u/kimmychangas said is important.
""Just make sure you verbalize your needs...""
I doubt female/male has an importance in this situation, but being with girls that never told me their needs sucked. I had to do more than I thought to make them happy and by the end, I said fuck them. So if I were you, make sure she knows. We aren't great investigators by any means. So tell her exactly your needs. Make it easy on her."
1047,esfj,"i mean that sounds spot on to me, and accurate from what i've seen from other ESFJs on the subreddit
i'm a male ESFJ as well, it's tough because i was one of the lucky ones who kinda fell into a relationship and it ended up working well since we're both opposites but not completely different. i've learned a lot about myself and how i get satisfaction from relationships"
1048,esfj,"Multiple theories:


You want someone who is your opposite via dichotomies (letters) for balance and learning each other's opposite sides for better growth. So, INTP.


You want someone who is your functional opposite for the same reasons. So, ENTJ.


You want someone who leads with your weakest function or is different from you in all dichotomies aspects except for N/S which can be left alone. So, INTP or ISTP.


You want someone who is the ""mirror"" of you functionally. So, ISFP.


I personally subscribe to the first and third ones, but you do you. I'm an ISTP and I currently have a wonderful ESFJ best friend."
1049,esfj,"What really?! I can see us being compatible with INFPs maybe friendship wise. I'm surprised romantically, however.
The ESFJs I know, myself included, prefer committed, traditional relationships. The INFPs I know have more unconventional lifestyles, and seem into the ""free love""/poly type of thing. "
1050,esfj,"So far from personal experience, I’d say the INTP is accurate. I haven’t met any typed ISTPs yet to confirm. 
ENTJs are (mostly) a miss for me but I’m way too dominant for them to tell me what to do. The one ISFP I know was super unhealthy and has put me off dating. So, all in all - probably haven’t met healthy versions of those types yet. "
1051,esfj,That’s really nice to hear (: I know a lot of theories say ISFPs are our natural partners but my only experience with ISFPs irl blew up rather tragically. I hope I meet more of you guys! You seem so sweet. 
1052,esfj,"I’m not sure. I love them. My first girlfriend was one. They are finishing types and I’m a starter. So it works out well. I come up with the plans and they follow through. And I personally ask people’s opinions a lot and genuinely am interested in the answer so I think they can tell that. And I don’t ask in a self conscious way, more like I am interested in what’s in their brains and though process and they seem to like that I guess. I also think ESFJs give INTJ a hall pass to be excited and emotive. They’re generally very reserved and have no idea about social queues. And they mirror what other people do and they like how outgoing the ESFJ can be at times. And the ESFJ paired with INTJs become super, like super smart. I come up with my best ideas around them because there is no judgement and they appreciate the ESFJ for their intelligence which we have a lot of but people don’t always see. If you meet ESFJs at some point they’re going to tell you they took gymnastics their whole life or have built a house and know everything about it. They just keep it to themselves and surprise people in many ways and the INTJ thinks that’s interesting. 
Also I think I used to annoy my INTJ friends. But getting older you just have to become more self aware and know when to shut up. And pretend your a normal person, not one who wants to word puke up everything in your brain. Even if it’s the most difficult thing you can possibly do. When you do that you start to come off as really book and street smart. I think ESFJs are naturally more street smart but the INTJ is like you human Wikipedia that really cares if they have information right so they will double and triple check before saying something out loud. You can usually always trust they’re knowledge. "
1053,esfj,"MBTI letter configuration is based off of first extroverted function, which throws the introverted types for a bit of a loop. If you configure the letter combination to reflect the dominant function then their values functions would line up rather well. 
ESFJ values FeINTP values Ti
The fourth function is what you want help with, the 3rd function is what you just want others to do for you. So the dominant functions of these two types help fulfill the desire of the weaker valued function of their partner. 
The opposite of ESFJ would be the mbti INTJ. 
ESFJ values FeINTJ values Ni
They literally don't share any valued functions. "
1054,esfj,"I would disagree with ESFJ being street smart. The one I dated was one of the dumbest when it came to natural street smarts. She was a classic ""book smart"" girl but would have been robbed at a bus stop by a blind & deaf person. 
If you are more developed as an ESFJ I think that comes more naturally which is hugely to your advantage"
1055,esfj,"I'm INTJ, gf is ESFJ, everything you said is spot on, but you left out one thing that is important to INTJ, loyalty. We can sense it a mile away and ESFJ has it in abundance. In addition to the outgoing nature we pick up on immediately as well.
Although my gf expects me to lead so all that planning you say you do, is done by me."
1056,esfj,"My favorite thing about him is that he is confident and brings me back to earth. Sometimes I let my emotions get the best of me and he does a really good job of calling me out when I'm overreacting. 
His favorite things about me? I show unconditional love and support for him. I know how he is feeling before he does. And I always strive to help him be the best he can."
1057,esfj,"I think it probably then has to be more about how they go about getting the information that is important to them. Because my parents didn’t really stress book smarts, more practical smarts like building stuff, designing things and learning about people and how they work. I was an average student. I actually havnt met an ESFJ that was book smart so that’s interesting. "
1058,esfj,"Lol my ex was extreme book smarts heavy. I'm talking she lost her nut if her grade was not what she expected by any measure lol. Her family is full of PHD's, lawyers and doctors so I guess the bar is set high lol. "
1059,esfj,"Yeah makes sense. We really gotta live up to whatever standard is in our heads. There is absolutely no excuse for anything less than the best. If I need to be an expert in coding I will be, if I feel I need to learn about whatever the person I’m interested ins passion I’ll be an expert in a week. It’s all about the motivation and it’s all based on people usually. Whether it be impressing them or making them happy. "
1060,esfj,"That’s more to do with prioritising though haha. I’m super busy too! My eager to please personality makes me want to do well so I never disappointed my parents. 
But I was always a curious person, much less so than when I was young though. I have been appointed honorary NT by some of them though (:"
1061,esfj,"Yeah, my parents valued skills like being able to create things, build stuff and understand people. They were consultants who ran their own businesses and they didnt think was super important beyond getting what you need from it to be successful. They wanted me to do decently but understood if my priorities were elsewhere. I am now following in their footsteps of being a successful entrepreneur, funny how that works."
1062,esfj,"For the longest time I thought I was an ENFJ, but I haven't been feeling like I've been 'measuring up'. I've since taken the test twice spaced apart by a few weeks and gotten ISFJ and ESFJ. I feel like these two better represent me. I also may have a form of multiple personality disorder, but that's a different discussion. "
1063,esfj,"I took two different versions of the test and one of them gave me ESFJ. The other was ENFJ. After some research I figured out that ENFJ was definitely it, but I can identify with a ton on this sub too. "
1064,esfj,"ESFJs don't feel as alone as other types. They're home is out amongst people, so they have little incentive to be around their own type. Who needs to cross reference yourself against others when you're a high functioning whirlwind of sass and personality."
1065,esfj,"NTs and NFs, particularly NTs, tend to be the most interested in MBTI due to their intuition. INTPs are usually understood by very few if any in society for SO long in life which causes them to feel lonely. When they come across the MBTI, it feels like they've come across people that understand them."
1066,esfj,"INFP here: I think most introverts will tell you that they like to be invited BUT not shamed/guilted for opting out. They like to know they are a welcome part of the group, but don't want to feel pressured to always be there and always be talking. A friend who is also introverted said this to me once and it really hit home."
1067,esfj,"So I get pretty self conscious around introverts as I'm always afraid of annoying the hell out of you and accidentally being over bearing. Normally, I try to stir up conversation, but if a person responds minimally with maybe a few words here and there, I just stop talking and give them space. I don't expect an introvert to ever instigate, but I just figure that they'd reach out to me if they want to talk, and then leave when they want. Is that a fair enough interaction?"
1068,esfj,Title says it all. I am 23 and have changed so much in the last 4 years since living on my own. I’d like to hear how life has changed for you as you aged and what lessons you wish you learned earlier. Or just anything that you wish you knew younger. 
1069,esfj,"Probably the main thing I learned in my 20s as an ESFJ is that friendships can be quick and intense but they don't have to be forever. (As an ESFJ, i feel all friendships ought to be forever!) 
I've realised my strength is friendship, its like my super power, its natural to me and one of my strengths, but other people don't see friendship that way and can be quite defensive if you try to enter their circle, or some logical types just think 'I don't need another friend'
When I was in my early 20s, when someone would reject my friendship I would be devastated, I'd really take it personally. But I've eventually realised, just take that friendship offer and move it onto the next person, if one person doesn't accept its not personal, they just don't need your friendship right now.
I currently have 2 intense 'new' friendships in my life, 2 separate people in my life who've popped up in my life in the past year, they don't know each other and have never met, but they have both taken to calling me their best friend.
Which is lovely, I'm delighted! But after many years of 'best friends' popping up and then disappearing from my life, I realise now (and have come to terms with) that just because I think a friendship should last forever, most people don't, and more than likely, when my two new friends have moved through the difficult times in their lives, they'll message me less and less and move on.
And I'm ok with that, because I'll meet more new and interesting people to make friends with and go through the same process all over again.
I'm not sure any of this makes sense! My advice would be, to a younger ESFJ: just because you see the offer of friendship as something personal and long term, doesn't mean others do. And you'll hurt whilst you learn that, but also become wiser for it. "
1070,esfj,"when it comes to professional jobs, be prepared for how goal-orientated the world of work is
you'll get people who are ruthless and only care about putting people down in front of others to show how much of an aggressive worker they are. and sometimes, people don't take into consideration emotions when making decisions, but achieving whatever they need to achieve to get a a great grade from their manager or a promotion
also you can put in the most effort at work, always show up on time, do whatever your manager tells you to do and be nice to your colleagues. but that doesn't mean that you're the best worker. if anything, you're average. you need to go beyond your expectations and be extremely proactive while making the best (not nicest) decisions
to ESFJs, this is brutal. my advice would be not to take it personally, especially if you're receiving feedback from your manager. don't think of it as feedback against your character, but things you can honestly do better and what you're capable of. and being an ESFJ, there's something unique that you'll be able to offer the team. there's a reason why you've been hired, so bring your own strengths and use them well :) 
i'm 26 so still fairly young, but in the last 2 years i felt that i've really started to grow up (which sounds weird but eh)"
1071,esfj,"I'm 25.
Always aim to improve. If someone says you're shortsighted, ignore Fe and tap into Si Ti and Ne ASAP. Do not get confrontational, OR defensive. Think of times you were and find ways to improve your Ti.
Read a lot of things that don't interest you to open your mind a little.
Also, whatever it is, just do it. You hate it, don't fuck about. Do it. If you hate accounting, but it's going to make you money so you can do your own thing, DO IT. Fuck how it feels. You're feelings will drag you down.
You can thank me later you lucky young bastard."
1072,esfj,No that sound exactly like me and that’s something I actually recently have figured out because I’m planning on moving and felt like it’s not worth investing in someone I’m just going to leave but it’s not that way at all. Thanks!
1073,esfj,"Wow! Happy I came upon your comment.. I just made a post about this... I’m struggling as a professional. Not standing out, just a “solid, reliable” employee... in the meantime, people around me who cut corners and manipulate situations around me advance... it’s a real struggle for me, but comforting to know other ESFJs experience the same... thank you!"
1074,esfj,"I'm an ENTP married to an ESFJ. 
I do genuinely love her to pieces. We had a blow-up fight last night and I slept on the sofa. The fight was about sex. We've been having sex less and less lately because I haven't been initiating. When she initiates, she gets upset because she says that I'm making her feel unwanted and a girl shouldn't have to do that.
I agree with her, but the problem with our sex life is that I've been feeling stifled. We used to be fairly sexually open and willing to explore new things. Over the years, she complains about this or that sex act and it has gotten to the point where I don't ask her to do anything other than vanilla sex because I feel guilty about it. She won't ask me to do anything other than vanilla sex (occasionally finger her) because she wants to be considerate of me. The thing is, I want to do other things to her that she likes, and I keep telling her that.
A good example was at my last birthday. There's a certain sex act that I really enjoy and she doesn't, but she will do it for me to make me happy. After not doing that for a while, I asked her for it on my birthday. She got upset -- not because I asked to do it, but because I asked to do it before the dinner date she had planned and not after it, which is what she had originally planned to do. As a result, my sexy birthday present was ruined because she complained about it.
The result of this is that I feel like I've been trained to just do vanilla sex. When I ask for something, she complains. When I don't ask, she makes no effort to think outside of the box sexually. And since I love her, I feel guilty asking her to do things that I know she doesn't love.
I talked to her about this last night and she blew up because I didn't talk to her about this earlier, which means that she's felt unwanted for longer than was necessary. I admit that I should have talked to her about this earlier, but once again I feel like I'm trained not to criticize her because she explodes whenever I offer her any criticism whatsoever. The second I even suggest that she did something wrong I usually hear lines like, ""Oh, so it's all my fault?"" After that, I have to switch to damage control mode because she leaps to the worst case scenario and starts talking about divorce and a miserable future together. She cranks it up to 10 at the drop of a hat.
Things haven't been doing great recently between us and I'm trying to improve things. That's mostly my fault. I haven't been a great husband but I feel like I make a lot of progress towards improving the relationship. Inevitably, something upsets her and she says another one of her favorite lines, ""You took 1 step forward and 99 steps backward."" 
I'm just feeling exasperated. I've been trying to be more kind and considerate, and offer things in the relationship that she needs. The first time the slightest thing goes wrong, I have to go back to tripping over myself doing nice things for her while she coldly keeps me ""on trial"" so to speak. 
I know I should take the blame here, too. I can be cold, distant, and I can bottle up my feelings, which leads to a lot of our problems. I just don't know what to do because I can't get her to accept responsibility for her half of the equation without setting off a volcano. 
I'm not sure what I'm asking for you guys. I'm just trying to vent, I guess. If you have any insight, I do genuinely want to improve my relationship. I love her, and I'm sick to death of these ""resets."" Fixing a rocky relationship will always have setbacks, but I feel like I can't get anywhere if every speedbump is a ""Return to go, do not collect $200"" event."
1075,esfj,"As an Esfj myself I find myself feeling somewhat similar with my own relationships. I can't offer much help or even a solution but I often find that I am terrible at conveying my thoughts or trying to explain my emotions. Sometimes I don't even know why I'm angry until AFTER I sit and think to myself for a while. Most of the time I get angry about a lot of little things. 
The point is, communication, Esfj suck at it and you'll need to be better at talking about what you're feeling/what your partner is feeling for life to be peaceful.  My partner has a few of the same problems with me and it all could have been avoided if we just talked about it. Keep in mind that as an ESFJ it is very hard not to feel like you are ""under attack"" when criticized. It may not be the right thing but we can't help it ^_^"" good luck man!"
1076,esfj,I would say that it is just really important when you confront her that you make sure you are coming from a place of love. The best thing someone can do in these situations is to be extremely reassuring. 
1077,esfj,"I'm not following after the birthday scenario. You asked for something, she got upset because of when you asked and not what you asked (as it was already her plan), and then you say it was ruined because she complained?"
1078,esfj,"ESFJs are supposedly super social (correct me if i’m wrong), something i’ve never even dreamed of being. I dunno if it’s like a commitment issue or what but how do you build up confidence in social situations? I try to be more outgoing but I always end up backing away whenever I get any actual attention. I have friends, though, that’s not the issue, I just can’t talk for shit sometimes."
1079,esfj,"The trick is you have to fake it till you make it. Even if I feel nervous I sure as hell dont show it. I also take a lot of happiness from being the social one in a situation but it definitely depends on the group size. Sometimes if I drink a lot the next day I am super anti social and its like pulling teeth to talk so I understand what you mean for sure. 
​
Also other people can tell when your nervous and backing out of conversation and the right people will help you. ESFJs love getting the shy person to take and make them feel really comfortable in the group because I really value the intelligence of most introverts."
1080,esfj,"Definitely fake it till you make it. If you’re feeling super self conscious, just have a few lines prepackaged to shoot out if you’re caught out and so you’re not fumbling for words. 
Once you’ve built up your confidence, you can let your personality seep out. INTPs are hilarious and I’m sure your humour would be appreciated in normal conversation (: If you want to chat, I can give you some pointers! Discord?"
1081,esfj,"Well, no, not our exact opposite, only order opposite. Which means we are actually more similar than we are different.  We have all the same functions so we ""speak the same language"" but our priorities and and interests are extremely different.
Our true opposite would be ENTJ opposite in order as well as type. We ""speak totally different languages"" and our interests are extremely different.

OK, so anyhow. Your issues are likely not because you are INTP but just in case they are, I'll give you a tip: 
This is how an INTP becomes social. You need to develop your auxiliary function, which is Ne. Extroverted intuition. So speed everything up, go get at it. Go Go Go. It is extremely easy for an INTP to become nihilistic and lazy. Go out for walks and hikes, in nature if you can. Gear your thought process externally, get out of your head. Instead of ""how does this work"" think: ""what are WE/THEY/THIS/IT/HE/SHE going to do next?"" Exercise.
OK, here's what I think your actual problem is: 
You are Narcissistic and Solipsistic, but not in a bad way, just in a perceptual way. You're too concerned with what is going on in your head and what others perceive you as that you are too scared to make a move in life, so you unconsciously cower away. What you need to be doing is too stop letting what people think of you be as important as what they are saying or doing. Ask yourself: how can I help this person? What can I do to to help this person do what they want. Focus on them. Not you. You  aren't important enough for people to judge you enough for you to fear social situations. Get into the conversation topic and offer up that INTP genius."
1082,esfj,"Lol!! I'm INTP too and have been on the Intp subreddit ALOT lately after I discovered it like a month ago. Just thought to myself.. hmm I wonder if the other subreddits are as active as ours and I wonder if they are all complaining and asking for help on every post like ours. Randomly chose ESFJ (interesting tho if I may have just subconsciously chose the exact opposite of mine) to see for myself. And then I immediately find an INTP asking for help hahah. No offense or anything, do you- just thought it was funny. "
1083,esfj,"Thanks for your opinion, I really appreciate it. I’ve been trying to surround myself with more social/encouraging people who can edge me on when I want to go hide in a corner, and I think that’s been helping too. Again, thanks for the pointers!"
1084,esfj,Its not about lying. It’s more about acting a certain way until you realize that people can’t tell you are introverted. And eventually you will just feel comfortable around them and act yourself again. 
1085,esfj,I understand what you mean but it’s still against our nature to act any different from what we are. I found myself acting like someone I’m not only for a moment once before and couldn’t shake the sense of betrayal of self.
1086,esfj,"Bored esfj going through various subreddits.  Peek at my history, you'll see I was busy on here a few years ago, then stopped, and then periodically posted, and lately I have slowly gotten more active on here.
How are my fellow friends doing?"
1087,esfj,"I wouldn’t say INTPs are the opposites of ESFJs. After all, we do share all the same cognitive functions but in reverse. I have commented on INTPs before but I’ll say it again. 
Personally, I find INTPs fascinating. The way your Ti works is mesmerising to me. I like to listen to the way INTPs constantly question ideas to fully understand concepts and trace them back to their individual axioms. This is something I really struggle with and I have posted in your sub to help develop my own Ti. I was expecting to be completely ousted from the sub but apart from a couple of trolls, they were mostly very inviting and accepting. I have made a couple of INTP friends in this process and found to my pleasant surprise, that we get along very well.
INTPs have a very rich inner world that I think they have trouble expressing. Most INTPs that reached out to me after my thread was active, mostly either communicated to me either solely through memes or responded in essays to comments of a couple sentences. But once they have overcome that communication barrier (by that, I mean subjectively in a conventional way so that an ESFJ understands :D), I find INTPs fascinating to chat to and debate with. I like the way INTPs challenge the way I think and I think such a pairing promotes a lot of growth.
Basically, y’all great."
1088,esfj,"INTPs and ESFJs speak the same language but have different goals. I'm an ESFJ and my best friend of ~9 years is an INTP, we are really great at helping each other develop our fourth functions. When we look to accomplish a goal, I'm great at mapping, organizing, and maintaining, while he's great at theorizing, developing, and sort of hole-poking. I like his casual ease at using Ti. The best thing about INTPs is that they don't give the slightest sliver of a fuck about ""who"" you are, and moreso ""what"" you are. He only cares about truth. I care about authenticity. Which isn't the same thing. "
1089,esfj,"I am an ESFJ, and I seem to be an INTP/INFP magnet. 3 out of my 7 closest friends are INTPs. So here is my thought on them. Personally I really enjoy spending time with them, and learning about how different types of people think. My favorite thing about INTPs is their ideas and thoughts, they are very thought invoking. Their worst trait however is that they cannot realize their own flaws, and that sometimes that have difficulty understanding feelings. "
1090,esfj,"Based on my experience:
They gave great advice. Interesting insight on the world. I also see that the mature ones attempt polite small talk with me, and I really appreciate that. Some discussions with them were quite delightful
Otherwise communication was exceedingly difficult. I found that they had misinterpreted things I said and vice versa. It's the Fe-dom Ti-dom clash. "
1091,esfj,As an ESFJ I feel like I bring most of the enthusiasm to most of my relationships. It’s fine for friends but when it comes to romantic partners I want someone as enthusiastic about things as I am and if they’re not they bore me after a while. Anyone relate?
1092,esfj,"I've seen this with my ESFJ friends: they are all kind, lively, logical, compromising, emotionally stable, independent, and peaceful! They are just fun to be around. 
Find yourself an ENFP.
I've seen several enfp-esfj couples that are playful and enthusiastic about life together, they all love each other as in soulmates! I've seen older couples as well as younger. One is a close friend of mine who is an ESFJ with an adorable ENFP girl. The other is my wife's cousin (esfj) who has an enfp husband that everyone loves, they have the best kids too. My uncle and her wife... And some others... 
Seems like it's guaranteed to be a great romantic match. "
1093,esfj,"Absolutely, especially if they are ISTJ, having hard time staying focused on him right now, feeling almost like giving up already, but I work on myself, cz it’s been happening, I get bored and fall out, can’t sustain relationship cz I’m impatient "
1094,esfj,"I was in a relationship with an ENFP and it was hands down my least favourite relationship. Sure he wasn’t the healthiest and there was an age gap but in socionics we are in a benefactor/benefactee relationship as ESFJ and ENFP respectively. 
I find even with my ENFP friends I can only handle them in small doses. Love them to bits but couldn’t handle them 24/7. I’m sure they’re some great relationships out there but I wouldn’t say it’s a guaranteed match. "
1095,esfj,"I have to agree. I have an ENFP friend and we clash SO much. Dating someone like that would be awful.
​
I actually get along with ESTJs pretty well, funny enough. There's some clash here and there, but overall I've always felt like we understood each other well and there was mutual respect."
1096,esfj,"No don’t apologise! I was adding in my two cents worth (: I think any type can work together - I probably just came across a doozy ENFP. 
I think it really all comes down to personal preference. I have done a whole trial and error on this if you wanted to hear. I have a bad habit of being able to fall in love with anyone but I generally prefer Ji Doms - so IPs for the short form. 
What type are you and what do you like?"
1097,esfj,"I'm intp, love esfjs.
Theory says intp is best matched with istj, infj, esfj, entj.
And esfj is best matched with estp, enfp, intp, isfp.
I seem to like those four types, both friendship and romance. I get attracted to enfjs, but not romantic about them. And estj, esfp, isfj and intj are my least favourites! "
1098,esfj,"Don't have discord. :)
These are based on cognitive similarity and shared moral values, according to model G stack. Model G is a rather new development in socionics, which is very close to MBTI.
There is a mbti chat on whatsapp that i'm a part of, if you like to join:
https://chat.whatsapp.com/Ey15CEhWJag1Q1sstl8IrA"
1099,esfj,"Ahh, I don’t do chatrooms where my personal info like phone numbers are exchanged. Thanks for sharing Model G though - I hadn’t heard of that!
I like Ne users but I generally like Ne Aux users best. I find Ne Doms a bit too full on but it’s based on my personal experience. I find ENTPs very fascinating but they like to aggravate reactions out of people a bit too much for my liking. Se users I find attractive but our interests normally clash because I tend to like discussions and they like engaging the real world (I’m stereotyping but you get the point).
ISFPs are an interesting subject. I dated one and while I was smitten, he was pretty awful. In hindsight, when you share none of the same functions, it can be difficult without having healthy communication. "
1100,esfj,"Oh, I didn’t mean it against all ISFPs. He was just very immature. What’s their interaction like? And how do they make it work? I tried everything but he just lied to my face and eventually cheated.
Would still like pointers to see past the differences. I also struggled with xNTJs as they all share the same functions. "
1101,esfj,"xNTJs aren't your cup of tea, good noticing that! INTJs are vain and psychopathic, ENTJs are good ppl but formal and dry for your warm Fe personality.
INTJ example: President Trump
ENTJ example: President Obama
My ISFP sister always had a fire burning inside her, she would snap and get angry when things weren't how they suppsed to be, or when someone was being a jerk. Since marrying the ESFJ, and more so after having her first baby, she is much much calmer and very content. I see a different person, that's how much she changed, and for the better. ISFP would push ESFJ to reach his potential. Some ESFJs may lack a sense of self, and compromise too much for peace. And they may need motivation to stand for their rights. ISFP provides that. Meanwhile ESFJ brings peace to ISFP's inner world, and also would act as social glue and help ISFP to live in peace with her community. ESFJ husband is just so full of life. They have two kids now, both are adorable. They have similar perceptions about the world, about their environment, but judge it rather differently. ISFP uses a personal inner compass to judge, and prefers to change environment to suit their needs. ESFJ uses a general sense of right and wrong which isn't personal necessarily, and prefers to harmonize with environment if change is costly. I think they somehow complete each other.
ESFJ coupling with the 4 types i mentioned, leads to 4 different romantic lives and different dynamics. It would be a matter of your personal preference if you like to share precious moments of your life with the free-spirited ESTP, enthusiastic ENFP, logical INTP, or individualistic ISFP. I've seen several great couples as examples for each (all but intp) and apparently it works long term. Every relationship, comes with sacrifices and a willingness to grow, as the two of you share cognitive functions you both are good at, and there is always those functions that you prefer but the other is weak at and vice versa. But if a relationship has a chance of working, I believe ESFJ is the one who can make it work! ;) "
1102,esfj,"I've tried really hard to make our relationship work (and sometimes it does) but whenever we disagree, it ends badly. Before I knew about mbti I tried to explain things as clearly and concisely as I could - using logic (which is really the only way I know how to go about this) but I (predictably) was never able to get through to him. I really could use some help."
1103,esfj,"ExFJs usually put less value on logical arguments than they do on emotional ones. I know it's the opposite of how you approach arguments, but the best way to persuade him is to bring up how things make you feel. Instead of ""eat this apple because it's healthier for you than that slice of cake"", a better way to persuade an ExFJ is to say ""eat this apple because I went out and got it for you and it would make me happy if you did""."
1104,esfj,"The thing that ExFJs have in common is that they use Fe first (your last or 4th function) so they are going to care about the happiness of the group before anything.  By you explaining things as logically as possible, they are reacting the way you would if someone tried to use an emotional response to change your mind.  Try talking like this as much as you hate it and it makes you want to pull your teeth out: ""when you speak this way, it makes me feel like you're not listening to me.""  ""It's hurtful when you _"".  ""It seems like we are butting heads really hard and that's not good for anyone, what do you think we can do to get along better?"".   Especially if he's an ESFJ, you can appeal to the idea of being a great family. But either way focus on the way that you feel and how situation causing the problem affects the ability for everyone to get along. But use the words ""We"" and ""feel"" more than phrases like ""It would make much better sense if...."".
Check out /r/esfj and /r/enfj and look at how they word their thoughts and then try to mimic that.  If all else fails, just work on choosing your battles and limiting your time spent (what I do with my ESFJ mom).
The easiest way for me to identify the difference (whether Si or Ni is their 2nd function) is to ask: is the person really sentimental and into tradition or are they comfortable with change? From my ESFJs are generally more hyper and traditional, while ENFJs are more creative and sometimes like to perform. 
Edit:  Check out this postfrom r/esfj.  Also I just remembered that ExFJs want nothingmore in the world to be appreciated.  So if you are going to have a conversation, start with telling him the things you appreciate about him i.e. how he's been nice to your mom or something, even if you have to stretch the truth.  "
1105,esfj,Thank you for commenting.  From what you said he sounds more like an ESFJ. I actually have tried to talk about feelings (especially when I was going through a depression) but I may have been still approaching it in a logical fashion. I will definitely give this a try!
1106,esfj,"Honestly writing this out and breaking it down by functions really helped me look at how to talk with my mom objectively.  The fi/fe things really makes us bump heads, but most likely for different reasons than you and your stepdad.  I will be trying this too!!!"
1107,esfj,"Ugh.  Yeah, some people can't be reasoned with, no matter what their type. There are different levels of development/maturity regardless of type.  ""Bad"" Fe-Doms have a tendency to get hostile, defensive and extremely stubborn when they're not in a good place.  Check out this segment of a book I really really like about the Fe-Doms in ""the grip"".  They convince themselves of their convoluted logic.  My mom seriously tells herself that something that happened an hour ago didn't happen."
1108,esfj,"Here are mine:


I want to learn to be less envious of other people's success.


I want to be less dependant on caffeine.


I want to improve my sleeping habits.


I want to start incorporating yoga into my life routinely.

"
1109,esfj,"Im still trying to figure it out, but I think reminding myself that the underlying emotion is that I am not upset with them, but rather that I think their success indicates my failure, and that resentment is completely associated with self esteem."
1110,esfj,"i wish i had a strong drive for success
i mean i do, but as i get older i realise that i'm not as good as i thought i would be. there are people who are younger than me and much more smart, more effort and all round better than me
so now i feel like i don't try as much as i should, because i know i'm going to fail lol"
1111,esfj,"I think it's to understand why you want the success in the first place. Envy and competitiveness can be great for certain people; it pushes you to work harder. But at the same time, some of us (i.e. me) tend to lose interest in subjects due to insecurity. I realized that in order to be productive, it is integral that I am more internally than externally motivated. So I do things which I enjoy and focus on ""personal"" goals rather than only what other people want me to do."
1112,esfj,"I am an INTJ female. Currently dating an ESFJ male. He thinks I need to 'relax' and stop thinking 'negatively' all the time because that's what ruins relationships. He said I need to learn to 'trust' him.
I need help explaining to him in a way he can relate to that I am not thinking 'negatively', I am just anxious on the bad things that can happen. Besides, I stalked him on Facebook and I know that he's lying sometimes.
We keep having this issue because I don't think he gets what I'm saying and that I can't just 'relax' until I've thought of the possible outcomes of everything. Help please, especially to the ESFJs who are familiar with INTJs."
1113,esfj,"I don’t have any words of wisdom to help mend your relationship, but I do have experience with having to end a bad one that has similar tones to what you’re describing. 
I’m an ESFJ (female), and my ex is an INTJ (male). A lot of what you’re saying really reminds me of what my ex felt and said. 
In my experience, my ex was super analytical and have to map out every single thing that could go wrong, and then have paralysis when it came to making any decision about the relationship (he could never even commit to actually calling it a relationship until I ended it). 
I’m more of a free spirit and just wanted to live in spontaneity and rapid, carefree decisions. I never got to do anything with him because all of his concerns about what could happen got the best of him, and then he resented me for going out and doing what I wanted to do without him. 
And... that’s an issue. It’s an issue for many reasons. 
One, he lied about things. I don’t know the severity of them, but my ex treated any lie as a betrayal, no matter how small it was.  If it is a huge lie (like he did something/went somewhere and told you differently), then you don’t need to even ask this subreddit what to do - I think you know it’s a huge red flag. 
Two, it’s an issue because he’s on your watch list now. When my ex started having any suspicion and paranoia about me or what I was doing without him, it kept growing and growing until he felt like he had to monitor my every move and text message. He couldn’t let anything go. 
Three, isn’t that stressful to feel like you already don’t trust someone that you’ve (I’m assuming) just started seeing?
I’m not saying the circumstances are the same for the two of you (and hopefully not toxic and abusive), but you might have to come to terms with a little bit of compromise. I hope he’s a caring and compassionate person and is pouring out a lot for you already, but if he isn’t, and isn’t willing to make his own compromises, then I would say why try to keep up such an exhausting relationship?"
1114,esfj,"Well, my boyfriend is an ESFJ, he told me the same, Im an INTP. Why you are always so fatalist? The world is not going to end! ...For me I wasnt so anxious as he saw me...but then I realize that all my ""negativity"" was anxious. I learnt from him to relax and now we laugh of my old anxity. My recommendations is to listen to him, you can learn of what other people tell you, learn to trust yourself, and to trust that everything is going to be OK no matter what. But if he is lying, that doesnt have to do with MBTI maybe he isnt a good person for you in this moment. "
1115,esfj,"I'm not an ESFJ, but I love going on other subs due to my ENFP curiosity. However, one of my best friends is an ESFJ, and I think there's a lot to be said for how they go about things. 
 
I also have two good friends who are INFJ and INTJ, and they are chronic overthinkers. They feel the constant need to rationalize every decision they make and not risk anything until they 100% figure out the pros and cons, and whether or not they could handle the pros and cons, etc., and this causes them a lot of stress. 
 
I think what your man is trying to say is that there's a lot of power in the phrase, ""it is what it is"". Not everything needs to be perfect, or fixed, or make sense. If bad things happen to you, it's okay. It's a part of life. They're not as important in the short term as you think. In the long term, they do matter, and I'm a huge advocate of making a difference or questioning things, but sometimes you have to pick and choose your battles. It's okay to not make sense of something before doing it. It's okay to not think through things. Spontaneity is a huge stress reliever. 
 
In terms of trusting him, you have to ask yourself if you care about him enough to put up with his flaws, even if they don't align with your principles, and learn to respect his differences."
1116,esfj,"See part of me wanted to comment saying it's not a personality type issue but more of an individual issue because like, I'm an ESFJ guy and I'm a huge planner of things and my ex, no clue what she was, hated it because she was super carefree and liked doing things on a whim. Similarly, I tend to be the one who overthinks things and think about things negatively and have to think through all possible outcomes and what could go wrong. Now, nowhere near as bad as your ex (it doesn't cause me to be indecisive) but I know it causes issues because I always think worst case scenario- for example, I'm not a huge fan of tattoos but my ex wanted one but my fear then immediately became she was going to get sleeves or something where in reality she just wanted a small one. 
But in response to OP, yeah I mean if you already have trust issues from seeing that he lies and stuff from facebook yeah i'd say that doesn't bode to well. one of my biggest issues with my ex was actually she never understood me or tried to understand where I was coming from so i get that frustration as well. Sadly, I really don't have any advice on how to make someone empathetic, and it ended up being a huge downfall in my previous relationship :/ "
1117,esfj,"Thanks for sharing your story. I can relate to your ex so much. 
My ESFJ is actually a good person, I've known him for few years now. And he is actually very patient with me. It's just that, sometimes, when I question him, it usually never ends with just one question and he feels like I am watching his words. It's not my intention, it's just that I remember the details he tell me, and I question him if some of them doesn't add up. I think it makes him feel attacked sometimes, and so he tells me I'm just over-analyzing, but my point is, if he's not lying, then why isn't he consistent? 
Then last time, he received a call on messenger and he told me it was his mom. I'm pretty sure it's not his mom ( I know, I researched). And at first, I do not think it's another romantic interest ( I wouldn't have pursued the relationship if I am not sure about him) but because he lied, I am now doubting everything.
And now every time I talked about our relationship, he keeps saying all this negativity is not good and I should just relax. But my point is, you need to address the negative so you can avoid worst-case scenarios. And I can't seem to explain it to him in a way that he can relate to. And I also do not know how to convince myself to 'be positive' and to just 'trust him'. "
1118,esfj,"It certainly feels like he wants me to think in an 'innocent until proven guilty way' when I am more of a 'guilty until proven innocent' thinker. 
How did you tell your brain to shut up about how illogical it is to just relax when it's screaming at you that you have to make sure that nothing could go wrong?
Anyway, he is definitely lying sometimes, it's not about girls though. But it's making me think that if he can lie to me about simple things, then he can definitely lie about big things."
1119,esfj,"Finally, an ESFJ! Thank you for sharing. I think he is actually empathetic. It's just me that can't quite communicate my thoughts properly. Or it's just that, I want him to see my point in a logical way, but he is instead, using his emotions to respond. Or something. But I can't quite connect to it because to me, it's not logical to trust someone just because he said I should trust him. Especially with the Facebook thing."
1120,esfj,"I dont know how I change. I think it was time and that everytime I felt anxious or negative I said to myself, “My anxiousness is not going to protect me of the future events” I thought if I worried and think of all the “escape plans” I would be safer but its just an ilussion, I still get very anxious but much lesser "
1121,esfj,Yeah no I gotcha with the trust thing and yeah I can't be a terrible much help because similarly I tend to think/ argue logically so again idk if maybe it's necessarily an ESFJ thing or more just an individual basis with your bf. Sorry I can't be of much more help :/
1122,esfj,"I can't believe that I have stooped as low as to asking this on reddit, but I am an intp, and I really like an esfj girl. I ask her to do things like get coffee or things I think would be fun, and we do them together and it's quite wonderful.  Neither of us will take a step, or show whether or not we think of one another as more than friends, and my inability to act on anything other than certainty with important decisions is crippling me since I actually really enjoy being friends with her.  Are there super small hints that I could pick up on to help me know what the hell is going on in her head?
Edit: sorry for the title, Esfj is what I meant to say. "
1123,esfj,"I would say perhaps just being more open with her. Telling her things that are more important to you, and pulling yourself out of your shell a little more will help. It's hard to get a read on someone who is guarded, and a lot of introverts seem guarded to extroverts, even if you don't mean to be. 
Letting her know that the things you talk about are important and something you don't often share might be a good first step to see if she is interested. I date mostly introverts, so when they really open up, it helps me see that I more than their one ""extrovert"" friend who they use to go out when they need to. 
My boyfriend is an INTJ, and it took months of talking and sharing before I really became interested because for so long our friendship was mostly based around when he felt the need to be sociable. Maybe ESFJ's are a little dense when it comes to these things, and if it's not out in the plain, we just assume you are being nice. "
1124,esfj,There are so many possible “first moves”. While they have gone out together have they had a “first kiss”?  Or maybe he is wondering about asking her if she wants to become an official item. I find it hard to be the one to make a “first move” in that sense. It took MONTHS of casually dating the guy who is now my fiancé before we become official. I was so afraid to ask because I didn’t want to put pressure on our relationship and scare him away. (Ps. He is an INFP)
1125,esfj,"How do you people feel about INTPs in a relationship? I've had an ESFJ develop a crush on me before. She mentioned my intelligence, wisdom, kindness, and will to help. I didn't feel the same way about her (it was a very one-sided romantic interest), but I found it interesting she mentioned my intelligence and to a notable extent...I think I tend to give people a ""nice guy"" vibe. To be fair, Goku is my hero, I like helping, and my Fi is highly developed."
1126,esfj,"There is a bad stereotype that ESFJs are idiots. We are not, Ti just happens to be our inferior. I have a high IQ, as does my ENTP husband, and he likes that not only am I hot, he can have an actual conversation with me. I find expertise to be incredibly sexy. Just because I don't possess it doesn't mean I don't like it or am unwilling to learn from it. Don't make us feel stupid, we will be v deeply hurt by that. Appreciate our levity and superficiality ~ not every single thing has to be Deep and Meaningful.
You asked about Ne and Si interaction. I tend to use Ne to come up with new ideas for practical problems. I love thinking about, and imagining things, though it is usually about pop culture stuff, social interactions, fandoms, fictional storylines, etc. I'm not thinking about particle physics or gaming battle strategies, though I know my husband is. I can, though, and can theorize all kids of wacky stuff thanks to tertiary Ne. 
Kindness and willingness to help will get you quite far with an ESFJ."
1127,esfj,"INTPs and ESFJs are considered to be ""dual"" match in socionics meaning that your two types are said to ideal matches for each other. If you look into cognitive functions, you share every single one in common. ESFJ type matches and INTP type matches."
1128,esfj,My family is this. Dad and sister ESFJ. Me and my mom INTP. It's not beautiful though. We don't understand each other. Do you have to meet him halfway? I want to connect with them but I'm not sure what to ask you..  
1129,esfj,"I think ESFJs often have their intelligence underestimated. I think a large reason is a bad education system, misinformation, and ignorance of psychology, cognition, MBTI, and communication.
Concerning Ne-Si interaction, I was meaning between two people. Does it cause annoyance or conflict?
I have a pet peeve of modern culture pertaining to ESFJs. I don’t hate ESFJs by any means. What bothers me is when people conform to talking like they’re five (e.g. “who iz u?”)
It tends to be ESFJs. There’s no good reason for it. It lowers standards, makes the person look dumb, annoys people (mainly NTs but people of other temperaments as well), and holds the person back.
To be honest, in general, I’d rather date an ESFJ than an ISFJ. Inferior Ne and dominant Si drive me NUTS!"
1130,esfj,"I wish I knew how to help! All I can tell you is my husband and I understand our differences and we keep that in mind in the middle of conflicts. We also pay close attention to each other’s needs. Like if my husband needs introvert time (he listens to podcasts with headphones), i know to leave him alone. We also know our triggers (ex I get grumpy when I’m hungry) and that helps prevent things from escalating. "
1131,esfj,"This is just an idea, but I think people forget that Ne is imagination and wonder, and that anyone who has it in their top three of their function stack enjoys meandering thoughts. It's how those thoughts manifest that is different. My husband will visualize various miniature gaming battle sequences that he wants to play out with his friends, and I will think about characters on a show I like and theorize about where their relationship is going, or what is going to happen next with the plot, or make up different plots in my head, etc. Fe/Si means I usually take real-world things and inject fantasy, whimsy, or downright goofy thinking into them with Ne. I don't make new things, I play with what exists. ESFJ and INTP both have Ne and Si right in the middle of their function stacks, so we should be able to understand it in each other. I see the problem as more dominant Ti vs Fe. Dominant Fe is really flamboyant and drowns out A LOT of everything else we have going on. Trends, distractions, funny memes... Fe is off and running with that shit, see ya! And also bc we are both really controlling types who demand to have things our own way :) "
1132,esfj,"It's because duality relationships are described as being both complimentary and conflicting at the same time, and this is what keeps them from ever getting too stagnant and boring: Relations Between Duals are Dialectic. In addition, MBTI isn't the only typology out there. Other typologies like enneagram types will contribute, thus any given INTP or ESFJ is only compatible with like 25% of their duals at a very generous estimate and not every person of dual type is going to match."
1133,esfj,"It's been shown that couples who don't fight are more likely to divorce or separate. If you don't ever have arguments this means your partner never challenges you to think differently, which leads to stagnation and dissatisfaction in a relationship."

Stable job that pays well and it’s very relationship-based.

1138,esfj,"I’ve noticed a lot of insultingly written ESFJ characters and parody ESFJ characters.
If you want to see some well-written ESFJ characters, check these out.
ESFJ:
Starfire (Ignorant, because she’s an alien who grew up with VERY different culture but not stupid)
Jenny Wakeman (My Life as a Teenage Robot)
Pan (Dragon Ball GT) (Tomboyish, but look how she was raised)
Amy the Hedgehog (an obsessive ESFJ with a crush)
Supergirl (DCAU)"
1139,esfj,I'm an INTP and my bf is an ESFJ. We are the complete opposites of each other and it can be hard at times. But we are learning so much together. I calm him down and he livens me up. It's all about making use of what the other has to offer. 
1140,esfj,"Sorry to tell you, but I was actually talking about intp's xD  spelling error! Try searching esfj on intp board, it's like finding out I'm a retarded Barbie that people can't stand to talk to for more than 5 minutes. Now I understand my father in law's behavior a little better (he's an intp) polite as he can possibly be but simply uncomfortable with my need for small talk "
1141,esfj,"Oh. Also our communication styles are different. ESFJs pull. INTPs push. ESFJs also aren't persuaded by logic in and of itself. It's not that they don't understand it. Persuasion just occurs differently. This is why so many NTs feel/think that SO many people are close-minded or just not getting something.
An ESFJ may understand it. Logic just doesn't interest nor persuade them in nor of itself.
Meanwhile, INTPs understand logic but are interested in it and are persuaded by it.
It's difficult for these types to communicate and persuade each other, but it can be done and becomes easier with practice. If the INTP feels like they're not being understood as a person nor as an individual nor emotionally, however, they'll struggle to put effort into it.
They also don't care about surface-level things like what their favorite food is. They may appreciate that you remembered that, but they want to be understood on a deep level. This is why they often do well with XNFJs. This comes easily to them.
In the end, while ESFJs and INTPs DO compliment each other, they're still going to have trouble getting along.

1142,esfj,"XD Look up ""MBTI Lenses"" or ""Type Lenses"" on Reddit. It's a thread of mine. That'll explain things and help make things clearer for both of you.
Also, INTPs also often overvalue IQ and intellect. They value EQ and other strengths, but they fail to realize that a unit of measure is irrelevant.
They also think IQ and intellect are important, and while they are, INTPs fail to see the significance of EQ, because they often have low EQs. They won't be aware of many of their emotions until they access them. Try to get him to practice compassion meditation. Tell him meditation is the act of entering a state of mind and that different states of mind. If he needs convincing, use Wikipedia as a source.
Anyway, IQ is important, but EQ is equally important. INTPs overvalue IQ, because they see the importance of IQ but fail to see the importance of EQ. Example: Existential nihilism. The key to getting out of that is personal value, which is an Fi trait. That's their 8th function.
INTPs also often feel depressed and lonely, because they don't exercise their EQ nor Fe. We try to suppress it and think we're not very emotionally vulnerable, but in reality, we're just suppressing our Fe. We just don't know it. There's a difference between being a wuss and being aware of one's emotions.
There's also other things IQ and intellect can't do such as meditations that seem to result in superhuman feats."
1143,esfj,"To be honest, every type is actually stupid in some regard. You can look at it as each type having their own intelligence rather than IQ, intellect, EQ, and skills existing.
Since each type has strengths and weaknesses, and neuroplasticity occurs, everyone is stupid in some regard but almost everyone is also smart in some regard.
If you get him to temporarily stop seeing things as IQ, intellect, and EQ as if those weren't concepts, things become much clearer. It's like ""Oh. Each type has their strengths and weaknesses. That's it. One isn't superior to another."""
1144,esfj,"Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me. I see him as a very emotionally vulnerable person but takes very little care takes of his emotions. I also feel like he doesn't want the responsibility he has but begrudgingly takes care of everyone's emotional issues when he has no other options. 
Intp's seem like a very special group of people to me. 
A lot of what you said helps me to understand my ENTJ husband too (who argues he is is an intp but also that Myers Briggs is lacking in many respects). 
I will try to search in to your thread and see what else I can learn. As you probably know, as an esfj, I'm people obsessed. I'm surprised to see an intp take such an interest in Myers Briggs and it's impact on other people. "
1145,esfj,"Ignorance of the MBTI caused issues for me growing up.
I'm actually surprised at how my Fe currently works. I'm not sure if it's typical for it to be this developed at age 18. I thought this didn't happen until around age 30 or age 60, which makes it seem even weirder.
I discovered the humanitarian nature of my Fe I think at age 16. I didn't realize I was practicing compassion meditation. XD Prior to this, I wanted to help people using my strengths. Dragon Ball Kai (particularly Goku) inspired me to do so. Between age 16-18, I went through a period of melancholy and depression. I came out of it with the humanitarian nature of my Fe surprisingly stronger.
Eventually, I figured out my passion and that passion doesn't stem from any function except Fi. My passion is teaching. The education system is the foundation of the biggest problems in society. Ignorance, poor parenting, poor teaching, political issues, economic issues, psychiatric and psychological issues, strengths are screwed over, people are hindered in success, financial issues, life issues, and more.
It caused psychiatric issues in me growing up. I'm fine now. An anime helped me (That anime has helped SO many people). But that's a BIG part of my life. It now angers me when someone mentions something false about the education system (e.g. ""It's so great teachers mold our youths."" ""This school is a great school."" ""This person is talented!"" ""This person is so smart!"", etc.).
My Fe kind of acts as a motivator for or driving force behind my Ti. I want to help students get the treatment they deserve. They don't lack respect for teachers, because they're bad kids. People don't bully because they're bad kids. Many students teachers claim to be stubborn, slow, etc. aren't. I DO think teachers deserve better treatment. They mean well. Most teachers are ISTJs, resulting in their views not being challenged, and they were heavily misinformed regarding their job. They were told a bunch of lies about kids and regarding how people learn and cognition."
1146,esfj,"INTPs often don't realize the importance of their emotions.
INTPs also tend to not want to have kids. This, again, is because of their inferior Fe. They try to understand it logically, and that doesn't work on its own.
It also doesn't help that we live in a society where kids are raised so ignorantly. I know MANY parents mean well. It's not their fault. It's the education system's fault. They don't educate people on psychology. On top of that, they slow down everyone's education and provide a false sense of themselves and the world around them.
You can actually teach philosophy, psychology, and more to the typical 2nd grader. The problem isn't their intelligence. It's how things are presented. Adults like to pretend they know more than they do, because they pride themselves on their chronological age, their titles, and their degrees. Take a neurologist for example. When a child defines what a field is correctly, they may say something like ""well, sort of"", because they feel the value of what they pride themselves on threatened.
Also, schools present things SO HORRIBLY."
1147,esfj,"So I can tell my gf is clearly mad at me about something. She will take forever to text back and when she does it's usually a one word answer. I've tried calling her several times throughout the course of a few days and she doesn't pick up. She will always say she's ""busy"" even when I can see her on FB online and posting memes. I've asked her what's wrong calmly and reassuringly and she says ""everything is fine, just busy"" . I've even tried to take a shot at what it is by saying ""was it that time i did x and x?"" and it's always the same ""just busy"". How do I get her to open up and tell me what's wrong?"
1148,esfj,"Hey not to be too depressing, but if someone was acting that way to me I'd just assume they're no longer interested. Like, if you two weren't dating and she was just constantly saying ""i'm busy"" and not responding then I feel like that'd be a clear sign of ""okay this girl isn't interested in me anymore time to move on""
You can't really force someone to talk if they don't want to. If you've already tried bringing it up to her in a peaceful way and she's still not talking, then you've kind of done all that you can. Idk if this is necessarily just a ""she's this personality type so how do I fix it"" type solution and more of a just specific to this case & scenario.
At this point, if I was in your shoes, what I would do is move on from it. If she says nothing is wrong and she's just busy, fine, believe her. If she wants to bring something up she can but at this point it's not worth pulling teeth to get it out of her. I'd also stop putting effort into keeping a conversation going. If you're sending messages and she's not responding or is just sending one word responses, then just stop sending messages. If she is interested in talking with you she can just as easily start up a conversation with you. If she does start a conversation, then of course respond to it as usual and don't try to ""get her back"" for not responding to you in decent ways. If, however, you stop putting effort into messaging and she doesn't try to reciprocate/ start a conversation up again, then after a week or so I feel like it'd be time to have a conversation about whether you should stay with her.
Lastly, try to think about if it's worth staying with the person/ be prepared for this to not go well. Now, of course I only know about this incident. There could be a billion more incidents that paint your gf in a much better light and maybe this is just a fluke thing. You know your scenario better than anyone else. And, of course, she could literally just be busy. Posting memes on facebook doesn't take much time/ effort usually but maintaining a conversation does. However, from this post the immediate vibe I get is that she is no longer interested. If she is indeed just ignoring you and is not actually busy, then 1) that shows lack of interest but more importantly 2) that's not great communication skills. Communication is super important and if she wants to act that way that doesn't look great for the long term. And also like, is it worth your time/ effort to try to get her to talk back to you, or would it be easier to move on?
Again, you know the situation better than anyone, so I could be completely wrong. However, based on the information given here, I don't think it looks that well for you. I'm also only 23 and have only had 2 relationships, both were primarily long distance. So I've had to rely on communication more than anything really. But I also don't have too much experience, so take my advice with a grain of salt.
​
Edit: Just saw your reply to someone's elses comment about how she said ""if you keep asking me, i'm going to quit talking to you forever!"", and I gotta say it kind of makes me think it's not really worth it for you to stay in this relationship. The girl I was dating in my first relationship had that type of mindset before and the amount of stress I had about if i did something wrong our relationship could end at any moment was horrible. I'm now in a much better relationship with someone who actually talks and puts effort in and i got to say my life is so much less stressful now. Of course, again, the final decision is yours  just like, it would seem like there's a lot of stress"
1149,esfj,"Very much appreciate your detailed post. I can definitely see where you're coming from, but like I said, she's pulled this at least two other times before and things were back to normal after a bit.
This right here is what's really got me really reconsidering our relationship.
Honestly, I think the reason she's mad is because I'm used to her always texting/calling me first so I just assumed this is how she likes to do things. She always would text me first thing in the morning when waking up. I'm thinking it's possible that she just wants me to reach out the her more often? But if this is the case, why doesn't she just say so after I've asked her nicely so many times? That's my most probable theory, but I could be completely out in left field. Anyways thanks again, for the answer. We've been together for a little over a year, but I do realize it may be the truth that she just wants to end it."
1150,esfj,"Hmm. Interesting. Has this happened before? When I used to do this it was because I wanted someone to basically read my mind. I wanted someone to come to me physically and force an explanation out of me. And then once I said it out loud and the other person expressed why what I was thinking is incorrect I felt really stupid and basically reverted back to my old self and wanted to kinda pretend this never happened. You gotta force it out of her or otherwise the way our brains work she’ll never logically see the reasoning to start talk to you and your relationship can be over just like that. We are scorched earth kind of people. 
ESFJ get they’re logic from other people’s explanations. If she’s mulling this over alone then it’s all based in emotion. "
1151,esfj,"Hey thanks, I know I'm a little late but your response would be very much appreciated. Can you tell me what you mean by this?"
1152,esfj,"Yeah and like, in that case you can try to text her first and see if that changes things or if you have been and it's still not better than yeah... she might just be pulling away.
It's interesting to me though to see the parallels because I mentioned my previous relationship and similarly I was with my ex for about a year and then she started texting less/ wanting to talk less and such too. Good luck with everything though!"
1153,esfj,"yes
I've tried this during another time she was angry a few months ago she said ""if you keep asking me, I'm going to quit talking to you altogether!"". I felt that was pretty harsh. Eventually she went back to her old self, but this particular time seems to be dragging forever. 
I'm basically at a crossroads right now where I'm interpreting this as ""this is your hint to get away from me, and if you don't, it's over "" and ""this is your hint to keep probing and show you care about me, keep going"". I think this move will either make up or completely break our relationship. I there a way to phrase this in a question to see which one of these she means?? This is a special kind of hell for us with low Fe and Fi (ESTJ) :( . "
1154,esfj,"When I was in therapy the first step was recognising when the behaviour I disliked occurred. Then it was coping. My OH knows I struggle so when I say to him. ""Look I need to go be by myself"" and I go to our bedroom, or for a walk or out on my bike by myself to override my ""bad programming"" (from years of my mother...). Generally takes 30 mins or so. I'm much happier when I get back and the urge to be a dick (In my case goading my OH into a fight) has gone. 
If you can see the reaction coming, you can take steps to divert it. Eventually It will become that you just have a sudden urge to be alone or do exercise haha.
It's a little more complex if it occurs when you are out but feel free to PM me and I'll give you some more tips. "
1155,esfj,Maybe it’s time to break it off. Don’t let her have the power and break it off. It sounds like from the little you’ve written the relationship is very lopsided. She’s only doing this to you because she knows she has the power. I’d be like if you continue to treat me like this and you won’t communicate then I need to explore other options with people. That’ll scare her and maybe she’ll start to treat you better. She shouldn’t be acting like that at 31. I really think you need to stop trying to pander to her and stand up for yourself and tell her how you feel. If you have the talk and she feels the same id move on. 
1156,esfj,"So to make sure I understand correctly, when a behavior you dislike occurs, you need to spend some time alone in order to keep from being a dick to them? Cause the only thing she's ever alluded to was ""I don't want you to see me in a bad mood"". However, I would rather have her be sincere about what she's feeling rather than just avoiding me, hiding, and leave me wondering what I did. I would honestly be ok with her even yelling at me at this point over what she's doing now. 
Can you tell me what you mean by this? she did have a pretty strict mother figure and maybe this is related?"
1157,esfj,"Yeah the thing is, I'm used to her pandering to me and now that she is acting this way it seems so out of character. Maybe it has something to do with giving her more attention.  Either way, the no communication ""you should know why"" vibe is becoming unbearable as it's impossible for me to tell. I think I may tell her I may start looking at other options, but we'll see "
1158,esfj,"Yeah, I would think that she feel at least a little conscientious and think ""he's doing EVERYTHING he can to get things right"" but it's just like talking to a soundboard with three pre-set settings: ""busy"" ""everything is ok"" ""don't worry"". Very frustrating"
1159,esfj,"Kinda getting to that point, at the same time it's hard because I think what she's trying to tell me is ""I want YOU to be the one that chases me at least some of the time"" and if I ask her if it's this, it will defeat the whole purpose as she wants it to come from me. Yet, I could be completely wrong and it could be something else like the arguments we have over the way she does things and her kid (whole other story there). Sigh I have a feeling if I give her that ultimatum I will get the same programmed responses and I will have to end the relationship without ever even knowing what I did wrong.  But I literally have headache from racking my brain so much on this that I may just need some time away from her for awhile which may extend to just being done with it."
1160,esfj,If she’s simply not willing to tell you then it’s not healthy. She should be mature enough to be able to communicate that she wants you to try and still enjoy it when you do. I am with someone where I the ESFJ are the very outgoing and the one who does everything and the other person just doesn’t have that built into them. Now if I ask them to they will gladly do it and enjoy the fact that I am upfront about that. I get that she wants it to be natural but she cannot expect that if she’s been the initiator and then someone you know when she pulls away that means it’s your turn. That’s unfair and ridiculous.
1161,esfj,"Personally, I really really love and am fond of INFJs!!! My first love, my bestfriend, and many more close friends are INFJs!!! :D They are very complex and mysterious, but I love that about them. Their presence is also very comforting. They are very caring amd sensitive, to the point that they forget their own well-being. For me, I think they are great mindreaders!!! They always know how I truly feel without me having to say it, which I appreciate a lot! :)"
1162,esfj,Just wondering how you guys handle breakups and how long it takes you to get over them. Little background broke up with an ENTJ (ugh worst breakup ever endured - they are SO cold hearted) and feeling pretty down :(
1163,esfj,"I'm sorry to hear that! Hugs
For me, the best way is to surround myself with friends and/or loved ones if possible. I remember when I had a bad break up way back in high school and I always felt okay at school among my friends and then became sad when I went home. And recently when I broke up with someone, being around my students for the day made me feel so much better. 
Regardless, the pain will still be there, and there isn't much more you can do than just accept that it'll suck for a while and move through life anyway. Don't expect to feel fine tomorrow, but you will soon enough!
Also, nothing wrong with making some yummy snacks!! As long as stress-eating doesn't become a bad habit, food can be a better companian than people temporarily! :P"
1164,esfj,"I take breakups very hard. I think its because relationships are our fuel and we LOVE seeing them thrive. 
I have no secret formula for getting over them. I agree with rubis-surround yourself with people who cherish you- ones that will speak truth to you and remind you of your beauty and worth. Because you are exactly who you were before the breakup - beautiful, valued, wanted, intelligent, and cherished. Remembering these things about yourself is important right now because we tend to blame the dissolution of the relationship on ourselves...but its simply NOT completely our faults. Relationships and people are very complex. Give yourself some time and rest. Keep loving others."
1165,esfj,"This is crazy because the same thing happened to me! I was dating a ISTP and we were practically living together. He dropped all contact with me after he called me (mind you, I was going to be home within an hour) to say he wanted to leave! I found out later that day he dropped all contact with me to be with his exgirlfriend again! I am absolutely heartbroken, but as another ESFJ the only way I know how to fell better is to be around people to ease the pain. Being alone sucks! "
1166,esfj,"Thanks for the responses! I am doing much better but I am still shocked at the way entj's handle things! We were engaged and living together and he was able to go from 100 to 0 contact in the span of one fight and me walking out and never talked to me again even though I tried to get him to talk a few times! Best advice I could give to fellow Esfj's is if you are with an Entj make sure you are ready to conform to every single wish, desire and idea because God forbid you want to do something your own way that they don't agree with, they can literally break all ties and leave you in the dark! "
1167,esfj,"I'm currently dating an ESFJ, and I have a point of anxiety I'm dealing with.
I understand that ESFJs value loyalty, but also that they love to get to know new people. A sort of social butterfly?
I, being an INTJ, have no interest in meeting new people unless I hold some sort of prior interest in them. Romantically or via shared interests. I only go out partying when I'm looking for new romance or people to share a hobby.
I'm wondering how likely is it that while going out and meeting new people, a female ESFJ might find themselves falling for someone other than their current SO. What is the motivation for an ESFJ to seek out new people?"
1168,esfj,"Myer Briggs aside I think first off if you’re in a relationship you have to trust the other person! Also if you feel this way you should talk w your ESFJ bc we’re very understanding and you’re in a relationship! Does she tell you she’s going out? Does she call or text you after she’s hanging out w friends? Does she tell you about her night? I’m an ESFJ dating an introvert. I’ve explained to my bf that I get excitement from going out and meeting new people, it makes us feel good and that’s how we get our energy! the new ppl I go out to meet are other girls. For ex if I go out w gfs it’s bc I’m Social, I need girl time! I’m w my gfs meeting their gfs, I don’t go out on a mission to met other guys. I let my bf know what I’m doing and I’ll text him occasionally through the night (again I’m there w my gfs so don’t want to be in my phone the whole time) and when the night is over I’ll text or call him! I think if you’re feeling this way you should try and communicate your feelings. Is this a new relationship? Have you guys had trust issues? I’m just throwing all these out there bc a relationship to me is more than just someone’s MB :) "
1169,esfj,"Lifelong ESFJ here! It sounds like you’re feeling insecure about your relationship. Yes, we are social butterflies. We are easy to get along with because we show genuine interest in people. We love meeting people, deeply and superficially. I am relatively physically attractive and get hit on somewhat regularly. My personality can make men feel comfortable approaching me (men have this weird thing where they think if a woman is friendly or smiles at them, they’re interested) and because I love people I may not push them away immediately... but I am a very loyal person! I would not do anything I wouldn’t want my partner doing! I don’t flirt, I don’t go seeking romantic attention, I certainly don’t cheat... but my partners can get a little insecure because I can be seen as charming to men. When I ask them to stop and consider the type of woman I am, they know the truth is I would never run off with someone. In fact, if someone started to get too friendly, I would shut it down immediately.
All this to say, I understand your concern. It’s valid in any relationship, perhaps particularly with ESFJ. This is a struggle you might have to contend with in yourself. 
Ultimately, if she’s a good woman and happy with you, no one can take her away. If she’s not, she can easily find someone else... but you didn’t need her anyway! Don’t worry too much and focus on your own value! You’re worth being loyal to!"
1170,esfj,"But in all seriousness if you read about us in relationships and our loyalty we take our commitments very seriously and want to have a life long partner :) 
http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ_rel.html
I love my bf and I would never do anything to jeopardize our relationship. I love spending time with him! He doesn’t need to go out and meet other ppl. He’s quite content with being at home, keeping w his hobbies or going out for drinks with ONE of his friends. I am too, to some extent but if I didn’t have that time to go out w my gfs and meet other girls (bars, girls night outs) I would be unhappy and depressed.  Not bc I don’t love him it’s bc I’m a social person and I need to get out make friends,talk to ppl! whereas social settings make him uncomfortable and he doesnt enjoy them! I think just keeping in mind you both need a balance esp her! You get your quality time together and she needs her space to go out w her gfs meet other girls and brag about you! :) "
1171,esfj,"I recognize I might not get an honest answer, but the loyalty that is so strong when an ESFJ is out with friends without there partner, what if everyone is drinking? Science has proven the restraint part of the brain becomes inhibited. I guess i can see being ok with non-drinking centered activities but if it's a party i would have a lot more difficulty being so understanding"
1172,esfj,"Thanks for your reply!
No, I know that it needs communication, and of course I communicate. It's just anxiety because I don't have that mindset you just described. I don't care about meeting new people unless I have an agenda. So it's hard for me to really understand that thought process.
But exactly how you described it is how she acts so your response is pretty incredible."
1173,esfj,"Literally, I had the same thought first too. You should just talk to her about it. We value honesty and openness about EVERYTHING. I bet you anything, if you talk to her about it, she'll be shocked. I have advice for all people and all situations, but specially for introverts in a relationship. They won't ever fix the problem unless you tell them it's a problem. And by the same token, what you allow is what will continue. All that being said, we like to go out with other people because it makes us happy. Just like introverts need their alone time, extroverts need their people time or we become depressed. We know introverts don't want to go out every night of the week, so it's ok to leave you at home every now and then. It's good for both of you."
1174,esfj,"""men have this weird thing where they think if a woman is friendly or smiles at them, they’re interested""
that is in no way weird....if a girl is super nice to you and smiles at you any normal person would at least consider that she likes them"
1175,esfj,"Thanks for your perspective :)
I don't really have an issue with the loyalty. Just the motivation for seeking out new people, as I have no such motivation. That and the capacity to fall for another while out and about.
One thing you said struck me though:
Throughout the last 3 months with me, she kept talking to her ex boyfriend of 2 months. She swears they are just friends,  and when first dating me she told me they were still talking, but they were planning to meet behind my back (I saw a notification on her phone) and she never told him about me. This really didn't sit well with me, and when I told her ""you wouldn't want me to do it to you right?"" she immediately ended the friendship with him."
1176,esfj,"Sorry to hear you are in pain :(
What do you mean by this?
Is outgoing the right word here? My ESFJ is extremely outgoing (as described in the type), like always putting me first. Before she takes a drink of water for example, she would offer it to me first. This isn't always the case, as she has a selfish side too, but its considerably more than my previous partners.
​
Is worth mentioning that my ESFJ left her previous boyfriends because they wouldn't commit after 3 years. She is into a committed relationship and when she felt they wouldn't escalate to marriage, she seeked out another. No idea what to expect once she reaches the end of that road though. ""Will she really be satisfied after marriage?"" goes through my head."
1177,esfj,"Thanks for your input :)
Kind of an unrelated and minor question, but do you find yourself sometimes getting bored with your partner, even if they show appreciation? In contrast to all the interesting people you might meet."
1178,esfj,"Thanks for your input, I really appreciate it :)
I'm a very open and honest person to a degree. I recently revealed to her some secrets that really shocked her, yeah.
I came here though, because I feel this is something I don't think I can talk to her about. If I tell her, she will think that I'm not happy with her going out which isn't the case. My anxiety only stems from not knowing whether her eyes will fall on another while rotating through so many people. There are a lot of charming people out there. 
I know shes loyal. It's just hard for me to comprehend the need to meet so many people and what exactly is driving that need. "
1179,esfj,"From experience (not ESFJ, just life), this is not a good sign. People don’t change because of others. I have been through this too many times in life (slow learner I guess), but there has never been a man in my life who has deceived me in any kind of way who ended up being a love in my life. Those men cared about one person only. No matter how much control I thought I had (checking phones, asking directly, etc), the truth ended up being that I had none and people ultimately behave as they desire. I caution you. 
Also, I believe what you’re describing is a loyalty issue, 100%. There are issues here, in my view. I do not have the capacity to entertain anyone else if I’m loyal to my partner. Having said that, I was not always loyal to my partners in the past. Idk if that’s a maturity thing or ESFJ. Men were “easy” for me and i never took them that seriously because another one was right around the corner. 
May I ask how old you are?"
1180,esfj,"I'm 33 and she is 26.
She is very attractive as well, and I am easily able to find another girl without effort as well.
We do value each other, but we are both insecure. I know that insecure people often like to have a plan B ready in case things go to shit, which is what I think the ex was serving."
1181,esfj,"Thanks for that.
I think that maybe this was bound to happen for you. I am a little like you that I want my SO to seek in me all their needs. Like, last night she went for a massage, when I wish she would have just asked me to do it.
But you seem to demand a little bit more than me. So when your ex fulfilled her needs with her girlfriend, you felt hurt. But I think I've come to terms with the fact that my ESFJ will reserve a part of her heart for me, and still needs to spread her wings in a social setting and with other people.
But my anxiety only stems from the fact that I don't know how likely it is that her eyes will land on another. I suppose all I can do is just keep her on her toes so she has something fresh and exciting waiting for her at home... Although my personal nature is to slip into a comfortable lifestyle with minimal excitement."
1182,esfj,"Every day is either an argument, or a some form of yelling and screaming at one another. It's not that i have any hatred towards her because i really do love her. But living with her is just constant arguing and is becoming nearly impossible. i know it sounds bad and it makes me upset just saying it, but i am looking forward to leaving for college this year and never returning or speaking to her again. Some of our common issues are her yelling at me to pick up my bedroom 10 to 15 times a day, when the only thing wrong with my room is the shirts are not color organized in the closet, or a gum wrapper is in the corner of the room, or the chair is not perfectly straight under my desk. it literally drives me insane to hear her say it so many times, and worst of all its impossible to get it clean to her standards. second daily issue is me forgetting to do something, even though i have been told 100's of times. for example she always tells me to turn the vent fan on in the bathroom, but no matter what i can never remember to turn it on. i try to tell her that i honestly just cannot remember and that it just slips my mind. Honestly i don't want to make her mad i just forget, But when i tell her this she does not believe me and assumes i am making that up just because i am lazy and want to annoy her. Third issue is her controlling every aspect of my life. she constantly tells me my haircut is ugly and i look stupid and need to get it cut. She will also throw out old shoes and clothes that i like to wear without telling me, because she thinks they are dirty or old. And if i try to wear a pair of old shoes or shorts that don't match my shirt which doesn't bother me at the least, she will yell at me every time to go change or she will not let me leave the house. fourth issue, she thinks i am addicted to smoking pot and drinking. i am a weekend smoker and drinker only. But my mom is taking all my college fund away to try to either send me to rehab, or just because she does not believe i will survive in college without getting more ""addicted"" to pot. let me point out i have a 4.42 weighted GPA, 3.9 unweighted, leaving high school with 53 college credit hours, third in my class out of 300, and founder and president of relay for life at my school were we raised over $5,000 dollars last year. So her constantly calling me an addict and a failure at life pisses me off to no end. her quote ""Only dumbasses are third in the class"". fifth daily issue, she loves to find issues in my life, and then uses them to ground me. it has caused me to develop anxiety and paranoia. if i leave my phone on the counter she will take it to her room, lock her self away with it and spend 4-5 hours reading every last message, looking and every picture, opening every app even reddit and reading old comments i posted from years ago to throw in my face as chance to ground me. she also becomes very emotional when she finds things on my phone same with my computer. i also cannot sit in my room in privacy, she will pick the lock multiple times a day just to ask me what i'm doing. and if there is any uncertainty in my voice she will ask me to hand her my phone so she can look at it. i also cannot make phone calls, because she will hide outside my door to listen to every last word i say. and every time her excuse is ""i was just walking by and heard something odd"". 6th common issue, she thinks i have no remorse for my actions, and need to go to a psychiatrist. when just like i tell her every time, i do feel bad i'm just not good at showing you. But again she says that's crazy and stupid everyone shows remorse and that i need serious help. 7th issue, she has taken control of my bank account. where she monitors every dollar i take out, asking where i spent it or why i needed it. all this money is from the part time job i work. 8th problem is her basing everything i do now as an adult on actions i took in kindergarten or any young age for that matter. she will say things like ""i have been dealing with you since you were born. beating kids up, always getting in trouble in school"", she will basically try and guilt trip me for things i did as a toddler and have no recollection of. and this really bothers me. because it never has any relevance to the situation at hand. 
overall i do not want this to come across as i hate my mother, or think she is crazy. because i know she does all this to protect me because she truly loves me, and i love her too. But i just can't take the daily screaming and fights we get into over the most petty things. my goal here is to see if any other ENTP kids and ESFJ mothers have found a way to get past these differences and live in harmony, and if so can you share any tips you have or ways of explaining my self to her so she will understand me better. because i do not want to never come home or visit, but at this point the anxiety i get from having to live in constant fear of being scrutinized every day is to much. Thanks for reading all this if you took the time!"
1183,esfj,"Honestly, I don't think this has anything to do with ENTP vs ESFJ.  It sounds like your mother is potentially a narcissist and is trying to control your life.  You love her, that's great, but she's not treating you like an 18 year old person about to make their way in the world.  Have you visited raised by narcissits?  I would be immediately looking into ways to separate yourself from her physically and especially financially.  Can you move into a friend or relative's basement until you head to college?"
1184,esfj,"As a 19yo intp with an esfj mom i can relate. They are easy to get along with when your lifestyle matches their expectations. All you have to do is make then laugh a bit and be nice then you can get away with the small stuff. if you look into hee underlying fears or bad traumas about men, she might've attached them to you. So basically imagine the what she wants you to be like, act like that person until you gain her trust and you'll have more freedoms."
1185,esfj,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/raisedbynarcissists using the top posts of the year!
1: That time my sister took me ""camping"".
2: She broke into my house, destroyed my belongings, tried to burn my house down, got caught on camera and red-handed by the police and is insisting she only did it because she loves me.

1186,esfj,"I'm an ENTP and this has no resentment behind it at all -- it's a truly objective question as to why you guys like gossip so much, then get hurt when other people do the same to you. I know that talking about imperialism and communism is boring, so I don't condemn anybody for wanting to avoid the subject, but the vapidness of gossiping while you all try to be so positive and helpful is a bit hypocritical, no, maybe?
This is by no means a personal attack, I just am truly fascinated as to why and what better way to find out than to ask?"
1187,esfj,"I'm married to an ESFJ and from what I've seen she doesn't gossip about people unless they've hurt her in some way in the past. Yes, she talks about people a lot but she generally has more positive things to say about people than negative."
1188,esfj,"I don't think they gossip ""while"" they are trying to be positive and helpful - literally yes, but looking into it a bit deeper, ESFJ really is the type that usually always tries to to the right thing and put the needs of others before their own, which more often than not ends up unappreciated, so they feel frustrated and the only way they can get the frustration out in a socially acceptable way is to let it all out and gossip the people who wronged them.
I had an ESFJ coworker who was an exceptional performer at her workplace, she knew and worked way more than her superiors, but their pay was twice or 3 times as high as hers - she would do all the work and they would take all the credit, and she would often correct other coworkers' mistakes without receiving any reward or recognition for it, because she felt it was her duty to do so, and other coworkers would use that to their advantage and try to make her do their work instead of them on a daily basis.
So what could she do about her frustration other than gossip? If I (an ESFP) had the same problem, I would play nice and stupid and slack around, working not a sprinkle more than I'm payed for, subtly making sure that everyone who tries to make me do their work instead of them knows that they can shove that idea up their ass cause they'd have a better chance of making that plant on their desk doing their work instead of them than of making me do it.
And yet ESFJs are the ""bad guys"" because they gossip, and ESFPs aren't because they're always so positive and fun....if you judged people by their deeds rather than by their words, you would probably have a different impression about ESFJs."
1189,esfj,"INTP here, your friend the dual. Fwiw, studies have shown that gossip is an effective form of group bonding, and allows others to experience a social situation vicariously through a friend. My mother is an ESFJ and I can say I know a lot about whats going on with other people that I never would have cared for, but that I prefer knowing to not knowing.  Accepting the premise that certain items of conversation are public domain to all aquaintences, gossip is a form of communication through a medium of other people .
I would say problems related to gossip are like problems related to driving: Driving isn't bad, but driving like a moron will kill someone, and some people do that anyway.
I'll show myself the way out..."
1190,esfj,"I understand what you mean! I believe maturing is a choice (I mean, I'm 25 but I hang out with ESFJs in their 30s). I will vent to my husband about people's actions, but I'm careful not to attack who they are. Would you call that ""saying shit"" behind their backs? I'm very aware of people's actions, and it would be very easy for me to gossip, but I choose not to. I was so gossipy when I was young though :("
1191,esfj,"I am here looking for advice on how to deal with my super curious mom. We have very different levels of what we're willing to share and she makes an awful lot of questions. She just asks about everything and then sometimes I have to lie, a thing I don't want to do.
Things got more complicated lately as I got in a homosexual relationship with another girl, a thing I'm sure my parents would be against if they found out. She already suspects and she would probably want to say ""I knew it"", but not want it to be true at the same time. I asked my mom to give me space and not find it necessary to know every detail of my life, but even though she said I can do whatever I want, I still sensed resentment in the way she talked.
I want to have a healthy relationship with her, where we have a more understanding communication."
1192,esfj,"I dug around your profile a bit to see if I could find your type... I'm sorry... but I saw that you're istp.  I'm isfp with an esfj mom and hooooo boy, do I feel your relationship conundrum.  Everyone's relationship is different regardless but first and foremost you're going to have to set some boundaries for yourself and you're going to have to enforce them.  I think you might also have to decide what's worth more to you-- a more open relationship with your mom, with the knowledge that your sharing might not lead to a deeper understanding on her part, or a closer watch on your own heart and mind.  And if you're feeling that for all her curiosity, she doesn't really know you, well, it might just be something you need to make peace with and appreciate the easy connections and know she loves you, regardless.  "
1193,esfj,"Hmmm...have you tried initiating the conversation so you can choose the topic and steer it in the way you want?  I think she's looking for ways to connect with you and learn about who you are and how to best support you (very wild guess, sorry).  So if you reach out to her about safe topics, you can help her feel connected but in a way that doesn't feel prying?  Talk about work, or school, hobbies and friendships, but be in control?  Does that make sense?"
1194,esfj,"Why are esfj moms so difficult? I’m enfp, and I have to say the curiosity, the prying, and also the ‘you can do whatever you want’ said in a resentful way that OP mentioned are things that I’m struggling with also. I have to agree with you though, there need to be boundaries, and that’s a difficult task, cause they get upset easily and, I don’t know about yours, but my mom also has the tendency to guilt-trip."
1195,esfj,"Thank you for your input!
I think this is great advice. I will try this, although at the same time I'm afraid it will give her space to make even more questions, or use the information I give to detect lies. She comes to conclusions very fast and makes up stories in her head."
1196,esfj,"I think it has something to do with the systematic and planful judging facets and the control those maybe make a person want to exert and impose.  The manipulation guilt trip factor is real and I'm quite grateful that I'm an adult now and can actually create physical and mental distance when I need to.  Even so, she's a good mom and being able to piece together why she behaves the way she does has gone a long way in improving my perception of our relationship."
1197,esfj,"Hmmm, that's tough.  Have you heard of Grey Rocking?  It's the act of answering prying questions, but shutting down further inquiries and advice.  Try Googling it, or I think they talk about it on the Raised by Narcissists subreddit.  Not calling your mom a narcissist, but there are good resources there.  "
1198,esfj,"I (INTJ) have been dating an ESFJ.  Or I thought ESFJ.  He wasn't able to take a full MBTI, so I used the 16presonalities.com website test which I have found to be accurate for me.  ESFJ does make a lot of sense for his personality, and I think the majority of the description is spot on, but the big difference I am noticing is that he is not one to disclose personal information freely (something that is noted in the ESFJ profile prominently).  In fact, I often feel like I have to ask very specific questions or encourage him to share more.  He can be very reserved - not completely closed off...but I guess he gives the impression of being very private and cautious when it comes to sharing personal details and emotions.  This strikes me as more of an ""I"" trait, and the ISFJ profile seems to fit a lot of his habits as well.  
According to the test results, he was about 35% on the E side.  I realize this is kind of a middle result, and that not everyone fits into just ONE category completely, but I would like to understand more about how the ""I"" or ""E"" preferences function in the ESFJ type.  My only thought/explanation so far has been that about 9 months ago a very serious long term relationship ended for him, and I know it has really been hard for him to move on and to deal with the hurt.  I guess I'm wondering if it's possible that his reservation has more to do with caution in relationships than it does with his personality type.
My question is, for any ESFJs, if you feel that your E preference is maybe not as pronounced, how does that change the way you view the typical descriptions of ESFJs?  What do you feel are the important differences between ESFJs and ISFJs?  And finally, is it possible that circumstances like a very difficult breakup can cause a little more introversion for an ESFJ who would normally be more open?
Any and all input/comments are appreciated!"
1199,esfj,"as an ESFJ with a bit of painful relationship history, I can definitely attest to being less open than any normal person of my type in that regard. I've noticed that in my more depressed and lowly moods, I fall into a sulky introversion due to fear of embarrassment and shame from my actions or circumstance. Perhaps that's the case with your boo. Generally though, it still comes pretty natural just to let my mouth spew whatever information about myself seems relevant. On typing him, I find it much easier to type extroverts because their top function is usually so blatantly used. Chances are, if his Fe isn't full throttle, he's not an ESFJ. Still though, pronounced introversion in a type as people-dependent as ESFJs doesn't automatically mean he's an ISFJ. circumstance definitely matters."
1200,esfj,"I'm ENFJ and I agree. It confused me at times because most people who follow MBTI and the descriptions make it seem like I am totally open. 
I'm actually pretty private about my personal information. "
1201,esfj,"I have INTJ friends, programmer types and whatnot. They are definitely on a whole different wavelength with some things but I adjust to it and don't get offended. The thing that throws me off sometimes is when sharing a story or feeling and getting ""okay"" as a reply, I'm a conversationalist looking for conversation."
1202,esfj,"Interesting. My S/O is an INTJ (borderline E/I) and I think that we fall into the ""complementary"" idea. I think she's fantastic and we get along super well 99% of the time, but we definitely differ in terms of spontaneity especially, and that can be frustrating on both ends. "
1203,esfj,"I'm a female ESFJ dating a male INTJ and I agree with what you said up there. Definitely at first, he was basically the only one to make me feel nervous. I just never knew what he was thinking, because he was always so quiet and contemplative, I was worried he was judging me all of the time. Not negatively, but taking in what I did. Eventually I realized that he wasn't even thinking about me at all. He was just quiet. Not always even thinking of anything. Now I feel a lot more relaxed around him. I know he's not going to judge me for anything. He just going to let me do my thing and enjoy what I do because he cares about me."
1204,esfj,"Heya, I'm an ISFJ and I suspect one of the guys in my class might be one of you people. I'm not really sure because I don't really know any male ESFJs (at least I don't think I do), and while it doesn't really matter anyway, I'd still like to know haha. So what are you like, or even better, what are/were you like in high school/college?"
1205,esfj,"So much of who I am internally is biased on who I was raised with. Family and friends really shape what we think is right and wrong, what is fun and boring, what works and doesn't work.(Si Ti) In high school and college I had a metric fuck-ton of people that I would call friends, but were really just friendly acquaintances. I was called a social butterfly more than once because of my strong desire to get to know as many people as possible ""(Fe Ne). My family and my fiance have mentioned that over time they noticed that I had a different personality, attitude, mask, for every situation, but the core of me was always sweet, caring, and intensely fascinated with the souls of the people around me. If you want to know if your man is an ESFJ, go to a party where he is and at some point drop all small talk and ask him some deep personal questions, bring your own answers, if he goes frothing at the bit for more information (maybe even asks other people at the party to join in) he's probably an ESFJ. Or at the very least a lot like me ."
1206,esfj,"My fiancé and I are planning to get married in the next couple of months, and this is pretty unexpected as he only asked me just under a week ago. The reason why we want to get married so soon is that I have breast cancer and I may need to have a double mastectomy - based on the results I'll receive in September. I feel very distraught about the operation and my fiancé wanted to show me his commitment to me regardless of the results. It makes me really happy and gives me something to focus on at an otherwise depressing time. 
The only thing that's stressing me out is that my fiancé and I had thought it might be easier/less stressful to leave out having guests at the wedding. I can see merits to with/or without guests, though it's worth bearing in mind that in the UK one needs two witnesses, so having a few guests makes sense - plus my grandparents are very old and I might regret not inviting them in the future. 
The one person I'm stressing over inviting is my auntie - who I believe to be an ESFJ. She's incredibly loving and has been really good to me since I've been ill - but her and my fiancé have come to blows before and they don't think highly of each other generally (my fiancé is an ENTP). Also I no longer have a relationship with my mother or brother (my mother is my auntie's sister) and this is a source of strain to my auntie, and I feel that if she comes she will be upset about my mum and brother not being there, and that will upset me and detract from the optimistic vibe I want to have on the day. 
So in light of this, how do you think she would react to not being invited? Is there anyway I could come at this that wouldn't upset her? Do you think I'd regret not inviting her? Your help would be such a valuable insight right now - I want to respect both my fiancé and my wishes but I don't want to crush my auntie as I really love her. 
Thanks for reading "
1207,esfj,"ESFJ here, and I'd first speak for everyone by saying congratulations on getting married and we wish you the best in the days to come. When it comes to your auntie, assuming that she is an ""average"" ESFJ, I believe that the best place to find an answer is directly with her with some open, and likely a bit stressful, conversation. I can say with a good amount of certainty that if you have a good relationship, it will hurt her to be left out because of the importance of the occasion, it may cause her to feel abandoned in this instance. In my personal opinion, I would find time to talk with her and after she is aware of the situation ask her if she'd rather not go, or if she'd like to be there and support you. ESFJs overall want to help those close to them more than almost anything else so I do not believe it would be a ""mistake"" to invite her, she wouldn't want to do anything that could ruin your special day especially if you emphasize its importance to you. In the end, it's your wedding so make sure that you are happy with any decision you come to, so maybe just having a casual conversation with your auntie could help you to see how she feels on the subject and give you a better sense on what direction to take. Hope this helps!"

1209,esfj,"Is it a ESFJ thing to do by constantly flirting with people and leaving them after they reciprocate? Maybe we like a challenge? Are you really picky about who you date? 
I feel like I have short flings and leave them after a month when I realize that they're boring or not a deep thinker/philosophical. I guess it's just hard to find INFPs and ISFPs around me. 
I dated a ESTP for a year and he brought a lot of spontaneity in my life but I didn't commit to the relationship until he decided that we could be together forever. Are ESFJs always looking for the next best option?"
1210,esfj,"I totally relate. I instinctively flirt with everyone, but I'm only interested in women who are more subtle about their attraction towards me. Then, once they make it obvious, I don't want to stick around. Mostly because I don't like to be at the stage where I've made myself vulnerable to them."
1211,esfj,"About that, I'm not sure if it applies only to us ESFJ's. Yes, I really enjoy flirting with people and I do mostly drop it after someone reciprocates it, but I'm not really sure why I do it (maybe just because they're only a flirt and I'm not really into them). Guess I do it just for the heck of IT, because I really like a good challenge, pretty much like I always do with everything in general. And I admit I'm quite picky about who I date. I am very open about dating, but I'm still kind of picky. I always think whether they're worth it or not, and take everything about them nto consideration, not every time, but still the idea is that I do it subconsciously, kind of influenced by the surroundings and everything around me. 
It's very complicated to explain, but you know what I mean."
1212,esfj,"My ESFJ SO was a shameless flirt prior to our getting together.  I don't know how else to put this, but I could ""feel"" him  crushing on me.  It was palpable.  I was interested and so I made the first move (because he was making me crazy with his flirtiness and I REALLY wanted to go out with him).  Full Stop.  He did nothing...for nearly a month.  He was still somewhat flirty, but he never texted or called (I had given him my number and told him he needed to put it to good use) and I was going crazy wondering what I had done wrong.  Nothing had changed, and I just figured I read him all wrong.
Finally, he came into my office and we had a conversation.  He was already dating someone ""casually"" and had apparently been trying to figure out if there was any future there.  He really liked me, but he wanted to be honest about where he was in this relationship.  I told him that was fine.  When he got himself extricated (if that was what he was going to do) to give me a call.  
About 2 weeks later, he texted me.  He wanted to know if I was okay with not getting into anything serious at the moment (I was 8 months post-divorce, so serious was NOT really a menu option I was looking for; he was fun and cute and I just wanted to hang out with him for sexy times) and I told him that would suit me fine.  After the second date, he made it very clear that he was looking for something serious, that he wasn't game for fooling around and that he had every intention of getting married again someday (he had been divorced for a good while when we met).  The woman he had been seeing was decades younger than him and her antics were driving him crazy and he was trying to figure out how to break things off with her.  
It took 4 months.  
Seriously.  4 Months.
I wasn't sure if I wanted the same things he wanted in a relationship, despite us clicking almost instantaneously.  The delay was almost welcome, in my opinion.  I didn't want to be pressured so  I let him work out his situation on his schedule.  Once he was fully out of the other dating relationship, he was in up to his neck in ours.  And I have to admit that it took me way longer to get to that point than it did for him.  I think he knew early on that he was going to commit to me, but I was still very gun-shy from the divorce.  It wasn't him, it was my own stuff.  We'll be together 2 years next month and I'm still crazy nuts about him, and he's still crazy nuts about me!  He just told me last night, ""I have the best woman in the world."" which made me blush like a schoolgirl, and I know he means it.  
He tested me A LOT in the early days, for consistency, character, temperament-there were lots of tests and I frequently called him out on it (and he would freely admit that's what he was doing).  If I hadn't been familiar with his typology I probably would have been a very, very angry person.  But I knew that was something he needed to do.  He still does it sometimes-it's just a part of who he is.  I accept that, just like he accepts my INFP-ness (being scatterbrained and dreamy, sometimes needing to just be by myself).  We make an incredible team.  I love that man, very very much!"
1213,esfj,"My (ENTP) ex is an ESFJ as far as I have ever been able to tell. She also tested that very early into our relationship at the time.
Yes, they flirt with everyone at least lightly. She had a thing where she would flirt with someone and then when they reciprocated, she would bail on them. Basically I was the first guy she did not do that to and I had a long term relationship with her. 
However old habits come back and once she had new dudes in her life the same resumed. Hence why I am here now.
To answer your question: I firmly believe that ESFJ are looking for the next best option at any given time. If they have the 'best option' in their heads, they will cling to it and fight for it fiercely. But if a new option comes along which is better, they will drop you for it at the drop of a dime."
1214,esfj,"Ah I'm glad to hear that you guys are working out super well! ESTJs have a hard time breaking things off because they want to be sure of their decision and to prevent hurt feelngs, it explains why he took so long. Since INFP and ESTJs are the best compatible match, I fully expect a marriage announcement anytime soon from him."
1215,esfj,"Yeah of course! I consider myself and probably a lot of ESTJs to really think shallowly in terms of feelings (more like an air head, we'll share your excitement but have a hard time getting to the root of the emotion of why you feel that way) so I love it when someone is nice and patient enough to explain the intracacies of life/emotions to me."
1216,esfj,"Sorry to hear that. What made you attracted to her ESFJ personality? I wish I didn't have a tendency to seek out the next best relationship but unless I'm deeply in love and completely devoid of potential husband material around (i.e working for years with people I'm instantly not attracted to), I would find it pretty easy to stay loyal. 
May I ask what Myers Briggs you have?"
1217,esfj,"That is exactly what I was talking about! Yes, I'm open and I like you, but I really have to know if you're right for me, that's pretty much the way I think. It's not about me being too judgmental a person, but actually about whether I can see you in my life or not.
Ah, it's actually refreshing to find someone who perfectly understands how I feel about love. A lot of my friends (and mostly my mom) say that I shouldn't care about whether he's the one for me or not, that I should just jump right away into the relationship. Well, I can't, cause I got some values too and am definitely not gonna see someone who just doesn't make me feel like I can go to the next stage with them."
1218,esfj,"She was very dependent on him in some ways, and his biggest concern was for her child (a toddler) who he had bonded with; he didn't want to hurt anyone in this situation.  He's very considerate that way.  He wouldn't want to hurt anyone...unless they struck first!  LOL...
I have no expectations of a proposal (simply because I wouldn't want to anticipate it, just be surprised) but everyone who knows us tells me it's a given.  
Thank you for your kind comments!"
1219,esfj,"I am ENTP but also have a lot of natural tendencies of INTP mixed in. I've been told before that at times I can flip-flop between the two of them with relative ease.
I have written a lot about ESFJ in other entries in the sub because not many people really contribute to what they are fundamentally. If there is a way to search for it I highly recommend it because there is a lot that I had to offer since I spent so much time with one and had a lot of information from learning about her directly for as long as I did.
What attracted me to her:

Her natural positive energy output 
Her conversational style both by text and in person & her sense of humor (ENTP are generally on the offensive side so being able to handle that sense of humor is a big one for me. We had a pretty good flow between the two of us as far as I could ever tell. Only big issue I can see looking back is she probably was less receptive to my...more combative style. While not intended to be insulting or destructive it probably at times did not work and hurt her whether she ever admitted to it or not. When she did I certainly took responsibility and apologized.)
That motherly/supportive caring nature.
Honestly when I had a really bad day the best thing in the world was getting a little support from her. Getting one thing right the whole day (her) was what I needed to get up and go again the next day.
The attention she gave me.
She had a very good drive towards being successful and did not just want to be a housewife. She actually wanted to be something which is important to me personally. 
Obviously I found her attractive physically even though she may not be what society thinks is high on the list of attractive.

Detractors from her personality:

Inability to function at crisis management or make game day decisions. Something ridiculously easy for me to do but she would get visibily frustrated or upset at anything not methodically planned.
Inability to handle conflict. She could handle it for sure if it was my problem because she was not wrong. But if it were something that I had an issue with or she knew was wrong that she did, it was practically the end of the world. I remember her calling me one time in tears because she looked at another dude as if she just cheated on me. It was partly sweet but also party sad because I figured she understood that was not cheating. The ironic thing about that story is about a year later she basically did cheat on me which is how the relationship ended. The last footnote about conflict is that once she screwed up, not only did she not own up to what she did, but she projected her fuck-ups back onto me as being my problems and how I made the relationship toxic. World doesn't work that way sister. You done fucked up lol.
Behaving and living almost....sterile. Let me explain.
Most everyone has issues, if you know someone long enough you know things about them that are....lets just say quirks at best. But she tended to live as if she was the queen and had no problems at all with not only her personality but also trauma in her past which simply were not the case. Brushing your issues under the rug instead of dealing with them only further complicates your own life. Never could get her to see that. With friends and co-workers she behaved the same way in this regards. I only found out very close to the end just some of the unhealthy things she had done in her past. I still did not ever find out the extent of what she had been through that had been affecting her. She never opened up the way she probably should have as a healthy young adult would. 
Coming across as pushy & better than everyone else unnecessarily.
This one I have heard from literally everyone that met her including friends of hers who are now my friends. She has a reputation of being pushy to everyone around her. One of the last things I heard was how she interjected herself in her workplace because someone else didn't do their job how she would like it done (She is not in a position of authority mind you.) Basically she was good at making short term acquaintances but was abysmal at holding them long term because of some of her actions.... As a side-note to say what I am like, I am a lot better at making long term friends and being deep with them than making casual conversation. I definitely can and have done it before but it is not fulfilling to me at all. People that get to know me are generally able to open up not only fairly easily but they are received well almost all the time the more they are willing to share. 
Lack of Loyalty:
Obviously I have to mention this because from my perspective the moment some other guy came into the picture she bailed. I understand that relationships end because both people have had problems but my issue is the sheer ease at which she did it. How anyone can go from a long term relationship to being with someone you only knew for a month or two at the most is beyond me. Furthermore the fact that you can do that and completely lock out the other person who was there. Lets just say that there is a bad taste in my mouth here because quite frankly it is a classless move to make. 
Proneness to drama:
This one I have only come to after the actual break up because unfortunately for me, one of the friends of hers doesn't really like her all that much. He saw what she did to me and got a flashback of what happened to him. So he lost all respect for her and has told me that several times since then. He happens to work at the same place she does just in a different location so for a time they interacted on the frequent side. Needless to say word gets around and I'll just say that a new trick she has learned is related to drama. That does not work out well for you if you are consistently a part of drama in the work place.
Footnote here: Something with my personality that clashes with ESFJ is I can easily see and call out obvious crap like drama as well as bad decisions well before they get ugly. In a lot of ways while together I think this was a compatibility point because I saw myself as her voice of reason whenever she needed help or advice in this regard. When she was hired at her current job she was promoted twice in the matter of two months and I remember telling her that she needs to keep doing what ever she was doing to get promoted that quickly because the people in charge at her company had her on a fast-track to being called up to their corporate positions. She moved up pretty well and things were definitely moving in the right direction for her overall. After the break-up I had found out that she is had been bumped down from where she got to while with me and is just now either a secondary manager or just regular associate and her grades suffered.
"
1220,esfj,"Wow all of my friends tell me to give it a chance and they find it weird that I'm always looking so far into the future (I have to see if they could be my husband). I also place a lot of emphasis on chemistry -- they could be the perfect person but if something's off, I'll wait until the fifth date to see if I should continue. When something's off, I usually dread going on the date which stems from my hatred for wasting time."
1221,esfj,"That is all so true. I mostly live in the present, but if there is someone who attracted my attention then I don't mind looking into the future to see whether they are worth it not (although this rarely happens). I'm very open to the idea of going out on a date, but not with everyone. I mean, my mom once forced me to go out when I was 16 with someone I barely knew (we just exchanged a few words cause I was in a hurry, I actually only saw them as a friend) and it was so horrible that I cried all day after it ended. It was that awful. He kept on giving me all these red lights and it was really awkward, there was no chemistry and I just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. Just like you, there was something definitely going off.
But honestly, if I see someone who looks very attractive to me (I can see the spark between us) I won't say no. Like you've said before it's all about the values."

1223,esfj,"Hi,
I'm an INTJ and need some help from my ESFJ friends across the aisle. 
As you can see, we are oppose in 3 traits. I am working on a critical situation and I am reporting to an ESFJ. The relationship dynamics have gone down the drain and it's not strategic for me to allow this to continue.
Being so opposite, I don't ""get"" ESFJs.
I was hired as an expert to assist on a large difficult situation. My boss does not understand the field. At all. She is way over her head. Yet she will not dare to admit this. As an INTJ, I even take delight in admitting what I don't know. Being knowledge-seekers were are natural subject matter experts in our chosen fields. I've been doing it for over 20 years. 
The situation above gets exacerbated with an intense, insatiable need for her to feel in control of the situation. I have never in my life being more micromanaged than I am now, and for an expert, this represents hell. I am a super-performer and extremely accountable to deliver excellent work in accordance to the expectations I have set. Even though I have already done this for over 2 months, her insatiability to be in control, to know everything that I am doing, and to not trust me, and to put in her EXTREMELY DETAILED input, is driving me insane. If it was just a matter of entertaining her while I do what I need to do, no problem. However, she wants to see that her input is implemented, that everything she asks is done as she asks it, and does not understand at all the huge implications of her spontaneous decisions.
To make matters worse, we clash on the N and S. I am Abstract-First - Tangible Second. I seek agreement on the direction and explain the huge implications of things in abstract ways. It's like I'm talking Chinese to her. She wants to see, touch, smell, and feel whatever it is that I am doing. EXCEPT, that I cannot quite give her that when the foundations (which are conceptual first) are not in place. And she has zero patience in my explaining. She labels me as ""theoretical"". Nothing could be further from the truth. I've managed crises situations that have hundreds of millions of impact. No professor here.
I admit my ignorance (see how I don't care about being wrong?) on how to deal with ESFJs. I do not think, at all, that I am superior. I know I am just different. So please, humbly accept my request for help and tell me, how to deal with someone who shares who is a strong ESFJ and who I cannot help in seeing the light of what needs to be done.
I've tried everything that I know, and I can be extremely accommodating. Nothing has worked. The dynamics have gone down the drain. 
In the meantime the clock is ticking....
TL;DR: Tremendous personality clash between ESFJ boss and INTJ expert are making the work environment a living hell. INTJ has tried everything he knows. Help."
1224,esfj,"Let me know if you find a breakthrough. I am an INTJ boss with two ESFJ people reporting to me. They complain about the workload, stand around talking, and snark/downtalk me. I just want the work done."
1225,esfj,"Geez this sounds awful! I'm not sure exactly how the dynamics are with this project but I know as an esfj how she wants control. I have been accused of being smothering and too controlling. It probably isn't her intention. She might not even realize she is doing it. Could you propose coming together once a week (or if that's too long for an hour at the end of the day) to recap everything you've each done and go over tasks you each need to do next? That way there is a set time set aside for collaboration, recap and planning and she won't feel a need to check in all the time? "
1226,esfj,"20F INTJ here, clashed with a 44F ESFJ late last year. It was ugly, and the place we worked at had no human resources department and when I reported her to my boss, he didn't do anything about it. She was constantly trying to undermine me and wouldn't take direction well (I was her manager). She'd send me emails asking if she can ""drop in"" when not scheduled just to hang out with people or send me back to back emails minutes apart pleading for my attention, asking to be scheduled more and more. I stopped responding and she'd just ""drop in"" anyways before I sent her away. Ultimately she was trying to undermine me and get me fired.
I know a lot of people say that any type combination can get along if both of the adults are self-aware and able to work through differences but in this case I really didn't know how to approach her. My ESFJ nit-picked absolutely everything and when I did try to step back and explain things to her in a clear and concise manner, it still didn't register with her.
I still pick that part of my brain trying to figure out what went wrong, but I think about it less and less now because I was making myself miserable over someone who isn't worth it. I'll never have to work with her again but I still see it as a huge failure in my young career. What helped me during this time - even when she'd just ""drop in"" - was my not responding to her. I limited her as best I could. I found that anytime I'd just her even a small task she wouldn't do it the way I'd like it to be, and if I explained it to her, she'd get frustrated because ""that's not what she's used to"". I try to find the positives in the experience too, for future reference. I appreciate how down-to-earth ESFJs can be and it is sobering. Our perspectives were different in the respect of our clients as well, a bit like the good cop/bad cop thing (but she was trying to impose bad cop a bit too much on me). I also liked how she could work with a schedule and could show up on time. I guess that's my takeaway. You might also want to try to look for the positives in your very contrasting relationships so even if this conflict results in some kind of change in the work arrangement, you can be better suited for the future."
1227,esfj,"Have you told her your thoughts that you are telling us now? If not, the onus is on you. You should be telling her what you don't like about her management style and what you would like instead. This doesn't seem like a personality clash, more like a social competency clash. You need to tell her what you want from her in a professional way and you haven't done that."
1228,esfj,"ESFJ here :)
I can't say that I have a solid solution here for you, but I just worked with an INTJ for thirty, 10-hr days straight and I think I can assist you, a least a little bit, with your issues here. I know this post is a tad old, but whatever.  
I actually adore that INTJ...can't stop talking about him. He was so great. ANYWAY. 
Okay, here's what she see's you as:
Quiet, meticulous, and a curiosity. She (like you) is overwhelmed with trying to figure you out, and the weight she is already carrying is enough to wipe her out, let alone deal with and try to understand (essentially) an alien that she's somehow in charge of.
She probably feels under qualified, and just wants to please whoever's upstairs. She feels like she's sucking at her job, and wonders if it's worth continuing.
Unlike the beautiful INTJ mind, when the ESFJ mind panics, it's obvious externally. Try and remember that for better or worse, sometimes we ESFJs succumb to worrying about how our lack of control may appear to those we are trying to please.
If we feel as though people see how we are struggling, we fold. Instantly.
The good news for you is (I hope), that her behaviour and how she treats you is absolutely nothing to do with what you've done and how you've corresponded with her. I would bet that you've performed far beyond expectations (probably blown them out the water).
Truth to be told, she probably gravitates to you because you're chill and focused...something she is desperately lacking in her own life. 
I often found myself struggling to make conversation with my INTJ colleague, because he was so relaxed and I had to learn to be comfortable with silence.
He found this hilarious when I mentioned this, and joked that it was no wonder I was stressed all the time-I felt the need to always talk! 
The reason she is nitpicky is because she probably feels she HAS to be in order to appear in control. Clearly this is unnecessary.
Hope this helps...I'm afraid we're 12-13% of the population, so you're bound to bump into another one of us...sorry :p"
1229,esfj,"I am afraid I found no resolution. I am out of there in a few weeks.  
What I can tell you is that ESFJs love freaking detail and tangible things. Don't confuse them with concepts. Find ways that they can audit things, or find gaps from rules, or anything that is alike. Their stubbornness and inability to comprehend complex things just blows my mind. "
1230,esfj,"Thank you for the sympathy. It actually feels good to be understood, particularly by an ESFJ. 
I have tried that. I have tried talking to her, being patient, bringing her up to speed, bridging the expertise gap (i'm an excellent teacher), etc. --- but she has had no interest and time. She seems visibly annoyed when I even want to ask her a question and has given me absolutely no time.  I said to hear that I need ideally (some of her) time and trust to do be successful on this massive challenge (which is her accountability). I can still do it with one of the two... but I cannot if she doesn't give me either time or trust. That's why I feel that I am between a rock and a hard place. "
1231,esfj,"This is exactly my reality.
I've spent over 72 hours non stop struggling with this in my mind. What did I do wrong? How can I do it better? a very INTJ trait.
It seems to me that is her #1 modus operandi
Good advise. 
and by the way... 
You lie. There are no female INTJs ;-)"
1232,esfj,"Hmmm...not sure really. I think our approaches to life are so different. If you come across an immature or overly stressed type, then they will probably act on it. At least that's my guess.
Tbh I'm not really the one to ask. I grew up a 3rd culture kid and as a result glean joy from understanding people that are different from me.
While ESFJs tend to want to provide for people, and thus they will probably dig for that understanding quite blatEntly, they also have an extreme dislike of conflict. 
If she sees your confidence in your area of expertise as a threat or even as something that she is incompetent at in her time of stress, she may just go straight into attack mode."
1233,esfj,"In Jungian theory, types are divided into 4 Quadrants : Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.
NTPs and SFJs form the Alpha quadrant : We all use consciously Ti Ne Si and Fe functions.
Someone on /r/entp thought about making a chat for the Alpha quadrant.
So :


What do you think of that ?


Do you want to make it real and chat a bit ?


Which chat system you prefer ? (Discord, IRC, something else ?)


Can you bring some ISFJs with you ? (NTPs are not people I would qualify ""difficult to find. =) )


In any case, have a nice day ! Cheers !"

1235,esfj,Any other ESFJs out there that kinda hate social media and much prefer face to face contact. I personally just don’t see the use for it at all. The only thing I use is reddit and that’s mostly the news section. 
1236,esfj,"Duuuude. I thought I was alone. People love to put us in the ""ESFJ's love gossip therefore they're obsessed with all forms of social media"" box, and that couldn't be further from the truth. I got off Facebook in 2010, I was only on Instagram for about a year and a half, ditto Snapchat. I'm only on Reddit (and I'm not friends with anyone from my real life on here) and Pinterest, which I think you could make the argument that neither of those really fall into the ""social media"" category because they're largely impersonal. People complain to me on a regular basis about how inconvenient it is that I didn't see their post on whatever whatever . . . Ever since I got off Facebook my philosophy had been this, ""If they're really my friend, we'll be friends offline."" If they really care about you and want you as part of their life, they'll send you cute pictures. They'll tell you the mundane parts of their day. They'll invite to such and such's party. I found it a really easy way to cut out fake people."
1237,esfj,"Always prefer face to face contact, but I also have many friends in almost every state in the US, some of which I consider close friends, so social media is really nice to see a glimpse into their lives, superficial as that may be. "
1238,esfj,"That's fair and I totally get that. For me, there are those that are closest in my life, and I keep in contact with them pretty often and don't have much of a social media relationship with them. But I also care about a ton of people, and it would be far too difficult to maintain the same kind of relationship with all of them as I do with my closest friends. I def feel like a typical ESFJ in that I like to know what's going on in everybody's life and see how they're doing. Social media makes that very easy. 
Actually, my ENFJ friend pretty much adopts the same mindset as you. She's kind of anti-social media and doesn't care to follow people's lives over social media. If she wants to know how a friend is doing, she'll message them personally.  "
1239,esfj,"Also I’m more anti social media because I think its really fake and is only there to make you feel bad. I would enjoy social media if there was something more personal for just your friends but quickly my IG and Snapchat get to be all my old high school people and people I meet at bars and such and I don’t want to be mean and remove them so I just use my own social media, group texting lol. I also enjoy reading Twitter because it so not personal but still is."
1240,esfj,I’m also super into group dynamics and ESFJ love control. So I am very interested in how to position myself in a group and how big it should be to give me the most FaceTime and leverage. I always am thinking of where to sit at the table so I can talk to everyone equally. So that’s why I like to curate my own group chats and would love a social media where you can choose that more. snap and ig are too much of a free for all for me.
1241,esfj,"I see what you mean. It definitely gets superficial, so I take it with a grain of salt. I do at least get to keep up with factual events, like a friend getting accepted into a school, starting a new job, moving to a new place, etc. Also, to be fair, most of my friends are from my church and very little are from school/work/etc. Not to generalize, but most of my friends from my church aren't as superficial over social media compared to my other friends, so I don't deal with it as much I think.   
I also like having discussions. I often make FB posts about stuff like scientific discussions, fitness, and stuff like that. Not politics, though. haha"
1242,esfj,"Interesting. haha it's funny, I think I like to sit in a spot where I can see everybody and the surrounding environment, in case something happens. I feel like I'm always watching over everyone's safety. "
1243,esfj,"To your first:
Wit (sarcasm), finding ways to deliver a message, similies & metaphors, problem solving, thinking of possibilities, irrational romantic dreaming, etc.
To your second question:
I try to determine their angle, and think of possibilities. I try to figure out what it can be and can't be. Then, I pretty much estimate where they're going with it-I'm usually wrong, but I'm usually right haha.
I wouldn't say I'm a healthy ESFJ. I'm not one to eat others' dust because I was ""happy-go lucky."""
1244,esfj,Same. Most of my Ne discusses possibilities with how I can improve the relationships in my life and how I can approach people differently to make the best connection possible. So I like it when people open up and talk about things like that!
1245,esfj,"We don't have great Ne.
I knew s/he was joking cuz Fe-Ti, but didn't make the April Fools connection. (Granted, it's barely even a ""joke"" because it's so shitty, so maybe that's why it didn't register...)"
1246,esfj,"I would encourage you not to let the past shape your future. Yes, you have been mistreated, yes, you have hurts that may never fully go away, but if they (ESFJs and your mother) did ruin your past, don't let them ruin your future by allowing yourself to be eaten up with bitterness and resentment. I've heard it said that bitterness is a poison you take, hoping that it will kill someone else, but it eats you alive while not affecting your enemy one bit. I hope you can forgive those who have made your life hard, and that you can be freed from these heavy feelings of hate."
1247,esfj,"I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.
This is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/esfj would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESFJs.
The ESFJ survey link:

If you are not an ESFJ please find the correct link for your type here:

​
Thanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in r/mbti once the survey is completed."
1248,esfj,"For example, in college, I abused the shit out of ratemyprofessor. I woud pick my classes based on the professors that had high ratings and were easy af (because they give out study guides with a question bank). I, however, put out mediocre grades that ranged from C+ to B+ grades. I had more B's than C's though. 
Also, during group projects, if someone wanted to take charge, I fucking took the back seat because I thought it would make my life a piece of fucking cake-which it was. ^.^
I wouldn't say ""trying"" hard is a word in my vocabulary for school. Maybe I'd do my best, but there definitely was a limit to it. Like game my grades by determining the weight of each test, score, quiz, and hw. Luhhl.
I'm not proud of my lack of accomplishing, but shit I think I accomplished a lot for not doing much. But fuck dude, I'm in a shit career position now-well... for now. lmao. Well.. actually, I'm not doing shit here and still getting paid. So that's kind of nice. I guess the only reason why I didn't try was because I valued the real world a little more. But... like I'm not really trying out here either haha.
In addition, I sucked at high school.
I guess I'll only ""try"", by that meaning, show effort, is if I know people are watching.
I was wondering if any of you guys relate. Asking for a friend."
1249,esfj,"Can't relate. I think I tend to be more of an over-achiever (see my comment here).  
I'm a bio major, so I've taken Gen chemistry 1 and II, physics I and II, A&PI and II, organic chemistry I and II, and of course all the upper level bio courses. In basically every single lab group, I've been the one that did most of the work, most of the communicating, and most of the teaching. The only class that I've ever not put in the most work in a group is my current advanced pathophysiology class and the reason for that is because it is a graduate nursing level class; I'm not a nurse and I'm not even a graduate student, so I'm completely below everyone in my group and they're the ones carrying me. I feel like shit lmao, but it's nice because they understand my situation. Additionally, I didn't even have to take this class. In order for an undergrad to take this class, it has to be approved by the department and personally approved by the professor. I took this class because I wanted to prepare for physical therapy school which I start this summer. I'll have to take pathophysiology in the fall so I figured I would get a leg up on grad school by taking it now. 
Also got a 4.0 in community college and graduating with about a 3.5 this spring.  
However, the overachiever life wasn't always who I was. In middle and high school, I was one of the worst students. I was actually only one of two students who were held back in the 7th grade because I failed every single class except gym and art. I never did my homework assignments, I never studied, and I never did any of my projects. I just showed up to school and took the tests, but dared not study for them. I wised up a little bit after being held back since it was humiliating af, but I was still a lazy little shit throughout the rest of my time. Fell in love with working out in 10th grade, and fell in love with learning about the human body. Lots of stuff happened during that time until I started college 4 years after I graduated high school, but I got my act together and became a new person. But I really owe my current love for academics because exercise was my gateway to the desire for more information."
1250,esfj,"I am definitely an over achiever. I take classes way above the normal person my age, and I even took an extra online class this year to skip a grade. Everyone comes to me when they need help understanding material, and I make a ton of quizlets as well. (For reference, by the time I am 16 I plan on attending a major college)"
1251,esfj,"I relate to gaming to system. I definitely did that. I didn’t do that well in school. Mostly Bs and few Cs here and there but 90% Bs 8% Cs and 2% As I’d say. I strongly tried at projects and took control but never studied at all for tests. Projects are what saved me in school. 
I would love to know how you used rate my professor 😂 I always tried to but never had good enough info on it to help me. 
My friends know me well for my various “life hacks” also. Not all all of them are ethical..
I personally really care about being successful in my life so I try hard at things that I feel actually make a difference. I don’t care about school since I think a lot of it is useless."
1252,esfj,"I’m by no means super smart but I have tendencies to be a bit of an overachiever. I took double the amount of subjects most people did in high school and did pretty well considering.
I’m pretty lazy now that I’ve been out of school for a bit but I’ve just started my postgraduate studies and so far so good.
As for everything else, I work hard for the things I have and bought a house last year by 24. I probably am just super tenacious."
1253,esfj,"I'm an underachiever. Hate to say it, I wish I was able to put in more work, but during school, I did the bare minimum. I just didn't care to be there, and I'm sort of just wondering what to do with my life. Sounds more depressing than it is, but I'm figuring out how to be my own person and what I like and shit."
1254,esfj,"Ratemyprofessor pro here (not really, but my tips):  
It's kind of like reading reviews for anything. Try to discern when reviews are driven by emotion versus objective analysis. I also usually ignore reviews if the reviewer has terrible grammar and overall just sounds like an idiot. I wouldn't trust a person saying a professor is hard when that person can barely synthesize a coherent sentence."
1255,esfj,"Maybe you weren't given enough information? I would read everyone's comments if they had one. For the professors I couldn't find info on, I just had to roll the dice. TBH, I could have used the Facebook forums they had for my graduating class and I could have sent out an APB. Lol.
Projects saved me as in I didn't really do shit, but my part and I did waaaaaaaaay alright. lmao."
1256,esfj,"Thank you!  
Could be that since that was certainly the case for me. I think when you become really passionate at something, feel called to it, and feel like you have something to offer, then usually you want to put your heart into it.  
Also, I will say that your answers here will be a little biased. You're more likely to have people reply who are overachievers than underachievers. 1-it's an opportunity for low key virtue signaling if I'm being honest with myself, 2-overachievers are probably the type to respond to these kinds of things anyways haha. So with that, take it with a grain of salt."
1257,esfj,"I guess, I'll be underachieving until then haha.
Yeah, true that. I guess I can assume the 1400 something out of 1403 that haven't responded to this are the underachievers lmao jk.
A grain of salt indeed."
1258,esfj,"Everything feels natural and easy and we're exclusive after the second date. I want to make sure I don't mess this up (because I genuinely like the guy; I'm female) and could really use some tips. (read as: I don't want to smother the dude.)
Can I please have some advice? I like him a lot and want to make this work. I've posted in /r/infj and got ""give him space"" which I've taken to heart - seeing as I can sometimes be quite introverted too. "
1259,esfj,"INFJ here. I'm afraid I did not see your thread on /r/infj. Personally, and with a little bit of experience, the best way to ""not mess up"" your time with an INFJ guy is to be genuine. Please show him your emotional vulnerability. Transparency will make him fall/stay in love with you, for all INFJs for that matter. Honesty please."
1260,esfj,"I'm married to one. If you have specific questions, feel free to ask here or pm me.  I could just ask her about stuff I do that she doesn't like and warn you, haha. I'm male ESFJ married to a female INFJ. "
1261,esfj,"I'm starting to, to be honest. He and I are very cognizant of our differing communication and perception styles, and always try to translate for the other person or meet somewhere where we both understand. "
1262,esfj,"Hi! I'm designing a self-care app for FJ types in the Myers Briggs system. 
I'm an INFJ myself, and I really care about doing this project right. If you could share your thoughts on this survey, I would appreciate it immensely: https://goo.gl/forms/witvsfsiwK7rsMJz1
Just fill in what you feel like answering. Everything is anonymous & I don't ask for any personal info. 
 Any little bit helps. Thanks so much!!"
1263,esfj,"Well. In those positions, you're usually dealing with the scum of the Earth. I've worked in restaurants and retail, and when people suck, they suck HARD. I definitely wouldn't say I love everybody. People often have that misconception about us. We like to be agreeable, but if you're a turd, we're going to flush you."
1264,esfj,As much as possible. We both live pretty busy lives so sometimes there are hours in between where one of us can't respond. But usually i still send messages and assume she'll just respond when she gets the chance
1265,esfj,"All day every day. Phone call on the way to work. Respective work google hangouts sporadically during the day. Phone call on way home. Skype or date night. When we can’t sleep together, we fall asleep on the phone. Never run out of things to talk about and randomly go on tangents. He’s not an ESFJ either, but it works great for both of us! It’s been about 1.5 years of this. We also have tons of hobbies - I’m super social and go out almost daily, he’s big into exercise and basketball. We still maintain what makes us “us”, but spend a ton of time together!"
1266,esfj,"I was looking at an ""ESFJ Brain"" diagram in Google Images, and one of the sections said ""burning love for everybody."" Could you explain that in detail? ESFJ's have a burning love for everybody? How does that work?"
1267,esfj,"I'm not that sure about it as well but when I think about it, I looooooove people!!!! All people!!! I often just look at a person, and no matter what random thing that person is doing (eating, laughing, talking, etc.), I often just think about and feel how much I love that person!!! I have a special place in my heart for my loved ones who are special to me, but I think I love strangers, too. I think I was born to love and serve the people. I think its my life purpose. :)"
1268,esfj,"I think it also has to do with our desire for everyone to be taken care of, and be doing well.  We're happy, we want everyone to be happy, because how much better would everything be if we were all happy?  "
1269,esfj,"Heck yes. IDK about falling in love, but people constantly think you're flirting with them when you're just being what you consider normal. But normal to us means something else. I think what it comes across as is showing more interest, genuine interest, than that person is used to receiving from people, ESPECIALLY if it's someone they just met. Hence, why they think you're flirting. That being said, I wouldn't say I LOOOOVE everyone. I actually tend to have a somewhat misanthropic view on the world and people in general, but that may be more due to my childhood than my personality. But I do always want to believe the best of people. It's rare that I meet someone and my immediate reaction is distaste. But when it is, it is STRONG, and it is never wrong. That person always turns out to be a garbage human."
1270,esfj,"Yes!!! A lot of people think it's romantic!!! I can't help but care for everyone!!! And people often times think it is romantic, but it is just my default version. Like for example, I have an officemate who got sick and I bought him orange juice to help him get better. Apparently, my other officemates thought there is something romantic in that. Also, if I am very close to someone, people immediately think it's romantic. But it's not. It is just normal for me. I guess what is normal to me is not normal for other people. I can offer so much of myself no matter what kind of love it is, even platonic. But I think other people only offer all of them if it is romantic. As for me, I can offer all of me, if I love a person, even to those I love platonically. Maybe we just have too much love to give? :) If it is romantic, I will do reallyyyyyy romantic things like write the person poems, make hamdmade crafts for the person, write love letters, etc. I am very straightforward with my feelings. :) Maybe I also do extra things if I love a person romantically more than what I do with everyone. :) When it comes to people falling in love with me, I think no one has fallen in love with me. There was a person who got kind of obsessed with me, but I think that was not love. I only remember that one person who got interested in me seriously. I always find myself in an unrequited love. :( I am a hopeless romantic by heart."
1271,esfj,"Dominant Fe (EXFJ): I am warm and enjoy taking care of people. I consider how decisions will impact everyone involved. Is there anything I can get you, to make you feel more comfortable? I can’t be with people who don’t treat others with respect. I want to acknowledge not only what each of you has done in the group as individuals, but also talk about what we can do, or have done, together! You did an awesome job with that; you are so talented. I don’t approve of what you are doing, because it’s inappropriate and will have a bad impact on others, but I am willing to talk it through and will accept your apology, without any bad feelings. I feel so at ease offering affirmation, and am deeply hurt when others don’t do the same. I want everyone to be happy, but am not afraid to say what I feel if I need to.
Auxiliary Si (ESXJ): The last time I tackled this project, using this technique worked, so I feel confident in my ability to succeed using the same technique. This restaurant is laid out different than it was the last time I was here; those tables were on the patio, and they had red curtains, not green. I’m happy to provide you with the details of why I am making this decision. I recognize this street, so I know where to turn! This holiday is meaningful to me, because it allows me to connect to my family or my culture. I’m disappointed if we can’t celebrate it together every year. If we’re going to do this project, let’s do research to see how others have done it before we start. I like to reflect on my own past experiences when making decisions in the present, and believe I can learn from others’ mistakes.
Tertiary Ne (ESXJ): Oh, that new idea is interesting! I’d like to talk about it with you! But I need to be somewhere in twenty minutes, so let’s keep it on track as much as we can. It feels like you are not tied to reality with this idea; can we pull it back to something tangible? I think I have several ideas as to what really happened back there. This discovery may help me discover my greater purpose in life. I suspected this was going to happen…
Inferior Ti (EXFJ): I want to be objective in our conversation, but I’m having a hard time not feeling upset that you have shut me out. I don’t feel comfortable discussing this person like they are a thing or a problem to be solved. How can you be so detached? That feels heartless to me! I want to get things right, so I will study this until I understand it, then take what I know and use it to help others reach their own understanding. I’m okay with calling a problem a problem, and willing to analyze it.

1272,esfj,"Yes I agree with that first comment. Something heartfelt. If you're buying a gift, get something we've mentioned in passing, stuff you see me pin a lot on Pinterest. But homemade is great, really shows effort as well as forethought."
1273,esfj,"I agree with the two comments. Something you have thought of based on my likes and interests, even if I have mentioned them only in passing. Or something that is of sentimental value to both of us that will remind me of you. Handmade gifts are highly appreciated! It shows how much efforts and care you put into it! :)"
1274,esfj,"I was curious about this sub because there was this one ESFJ I've met and she literally confused the fuck out of me- not intentionally, but for a week I kept wondering why she acted the way she did and stuff. Usually I think I don't get much personal interaction with SF's, let alone an ESFJ.
Anyways, why the hell are there so many other INTP's lurking the sub xD. I don't have a problem with it, but... actually yeah I have a fucking problem with it- WHY?!?!?!?!??!?!
CLAIM YO LAND, ESFJs! CLAIM YO LAND!
Oh wait... that's exactly what makes the difference- us INTP's are lurking here feeding our brains while you ESFJ's are out in real life accomplishing and claiming shit."
1275,esfj,"Also, for some reason INTP/J seem to love themselves some ESFJ's. They seem to come here the most asking for help trying to understand us. And like you said, while you guys sit here looking for answer, we just straight up ask you about it.
Source: I'm with an INTP."
1276,esfj,"INTP kinda just curious exactly how you process logical issues. Are you guys frequently bad at math? Are you typically poor at making unbiased decisions? Not trying to be mean, just wanting to gather information."
1277,esfj,"I don’t think logic and math are related THAT much?  Once you get into higher math, I feel like it’s more related to how quickly you can grasp concepts more than count numbers... I took Calc3 as a freshman in college and got an A if that’s any point of reference. I’m definitely not bad at math. 
I’m not incapable of making logical decisions. I just tend to make ultimate decisions based on gut intuition. I often realize in the moment that I’m being illogical but choose to ignore it because there’s some undying feeling inside of me that’s pointing in an illogical direction. 
I think we’re given a bad rep about this, and unfairly so. I just take different things into consideration than my friends who are thinkers. How many people will this affect? Will I feel an unresolved guilt about this later on? Will anyone I care about get hurt?
Am I bad at making unbiased decisions? Maybe yes. But not because I’m incapable, I willingly choose to. "
1278,esfj,"It's interesting how this notion that ESFJs are emotional and irrational is propagated, because I've yet to see it with the ones that I know in my life. I only know three, and they're all women, but I'd say they're some of the more logical friends that I have who happen to be very social beings, one of which is a math major.  
For me, I really value logic--removing my emotions from my decisions and especially my arguments. Basic Logic was one of my favorite classes in community college and also one of the most influential. I think I'm naturally not very logical, but I like to think that I'm pretty aware of when my emotions are becoming excessive, so I do a decent job of keeping it at bay.  
In terms of bias, I've actually been reading about cognitive biases a bit more than usual lately and have been trying to understand my own personal biases that influence my behavior as well as recognizing it in others.  
I'm also a biology major and I think I'm pretty passionate about science in general, so it's also pertinent for my success. Granted, I'm pursuing my doctorate in physical therapy and not becoming a biologist, but still, critical thinking is extremely crucial in the field regardless.  
In terms of math, I'm not really sure I'd say I'm bad at it, but I wouldn't say I'm good at it. Calc 1 last semester was one of the easiest A's I've earned in the past two years, though. Stats last semester was an even easier A, though.  
I'm also a borderline ESTJ, so I know my Te is also really strong. It makes sense that if I'm an ESFJ, then I would really value Te because it would be my role function. However, the inverse is completely off the mark for me--Fe as my role function does not resonate with me if I were an ESTJ.  
Regardless, when it comes down to it, I value other people's feelings the most even when I recognize that it might not be logical. In fact, in a way, it makes more logical sense to me to consider people's feelings more than considering what might actually be logically valid. For example, a friend of mine who I've recently began to despise has been getting on my nerves due to his hypocrisy, lack of critical thinking, lack of logic, lack of self-awareness, and overall being a piece of shit. He's really into spiritual bullshit, into some bizarre conspiracy theories, is anti-science, and etc. I really want to tell him how much of the stuff he believes in is bullshit, but instead I just listen and try not to judge. I know that if I were to speak up, then it would be fruitless. His ego would be hurt, he won't change his mind at all and would likely cling even more onto his beliefs, and his trust to me as someone that cares about him would be betrayed. I realize that at the end of the day, most people aren't logical and being logical with them doesn't work sometimes. However, I can be loving to them and see far more positive change that way. "
1279,esfj,"Even within the Myers Brigg system, there is gradients or spectrums . I'm technically an ESFJ, but my E S & F are very close to being middle of the road. I'm about as far J as you can get though.  But this means I understand logic and math, as we're using for an example, but at the same time, I'm going to look at the bigger picture and also address my feelings for a situation, and not rely solely on numbers. "
1280,esfj,"For me if I put my feelings aside I can become very logical. I feel as though logic is not my natural instinct, but I can be logical. I always hate it when people think that I am stupid because logic isn’t my natural instinct and I find it slightly insulting especially if they are close to me. I know I am extreamly smart, and I am able to think logically. I just put a mental block on myself sometimes that just tells me to follow how I feel. In addition when people discredit my thinking I feel very uncomfortable and sometimes close off and start self doubting myself. I am also great at math and school in general not to brag. "
1281,esfj,"I’ve always done very well in math. When I make a decision I often know the logical thing to do is, as well as what will benefit the group most and what is most practical. Every personality type has skills and  deficiencies that fall within stereotypes. Each individual has their own set of skills and interests."
1282,esfj,"Logic and math are very related.  
Here is a cool chapter from a book that covers the relationship between math and logic:  https://www.academia.edu/10485318/The_link_between_mathematics_and_logical_reasoning_Implications_for_research_and_education_book_chapter_   
There's also this wiki page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logicism"
1283,esfj,"Logicism
Logicism is a programme in the philosophy of mathematics, comprising one or more of the theses that — for some coherent meaning of 'logic' — mathematics is an extension of logic, some or all of mathematics is reducible to logic, or some or all of mathematics may be modelled in logic. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this programme, initiated by Gottlob Frege and subsequently developed by Richard Dedekind and Giuseppe Peano.

1284,esfj,"I think it's cuz of Fe and Si. We enjoy sharing emotions with others. Small talk = pleasant, simple, and non-controversial, very easy going interaction. Furthermore, Si is detail oriented and ""small"" talk is how we learn about another person and possibly be able to deepen the friendship. People get really surprised when I can remember something they mentioned to me in passing, and they usually seem to appreciate it. "
1285,esfj,"Small talk is fun. I enjoy talking to people so it’s a way to fulfil that need of mine when there is not enough time or you don’t know them well enough to delve into deeper topics - like say when you first meet someone and you don’t know if they’re into the same wacky things you like.
Small talk may lack ‘depth’ but it has the potential to go deeper. I enjoy getting to know people, even if it’s in a shallower capacity. Small talk can evolve into more, it establishes a friendly rapport with the other person if you see them regularly enough. Small talk can bring you anything, it’s more like going with the flow and potentially you’ll make a great friend out of it!
I also work in healthcare so sometimes being friendly is all it takes to make someone’s day. People enjoy talking about themselves so I let them do that. Small talk to me is less about the actual conversation topics and more about the atmosphere and connections you make along the way."
1286,esfj,"This shit's hilarious bro. 
INTPs have an ESFJ way of forcing shit down people's throats. This is too funny. I'm sure you mean to incite a reaction, but still, it comes off forceful and a bit offensive. Lmao.
My god, you guys crack me up sometimes.
-ESFJ."
1287,esfj,"i do this all of the time, no one ever notices it though. i am constantly building a profile of every important person in my head and making many judgments and intuitions as to what their motivations might be (although i usually wait until i am absolutely sure my judgments are accurate before releasing them)
if small talk was only pleasant, i could get behind the idea, as pleasantries are in no way bad by themselves
simplicity always helps, but i almost never encounter any simple social situations, so this seems to me like a corner cut
the non-controversiality of small talk makes it so that little to no opinions/ideas are being communicated, and thus little to no progress is achieved. without any risk of insult, there can be no gain of information (in a social situation)"
1288,esfj,"meh, i see potential connections everywhere, but i never act on it unless i see potential shared interests (that amount to a substantial amount of our thinking processes)
so most of my connections are through band (which makes a lot of sense, as we are all forced to work together, and music makes you smarter, and we all share a similar interest and spend a substantial time working on music)"
1289,esfj,"I never felt that OP was forcing anything down people's throats? Sure they didn't speak in the most tactful manner, but they said what they thought. Once they got new information, they were quick to change/adjust their ideas. 
​
I do agree with what you said about the ""cold truths"" though... INTPs would rather follow their own truths than anything else. And they rarely seem to admit that. "
1290,esfj,"since when did that a) work, and b) make logical sense?
well thats stupid, so theyre just blindly agreeing?"
1291,esfj,"Idk about the first thing you said. In my experience people were surprised when I remembered things. Also ...
Can't help you there. 
Depends on your perspective I suppose. I learn all sorts of details the other person. Then, my Fe uses this information to figure out how I can get closer to them. It's a slow and methodical progress but can be very effective. If I establish enough times that I am a caring, unassuming, and considerate person, someone might eventually be comfortable opening up to me about something troubling them that they don't want to discuss with others (this has happened several times to me tbh). And maybe I can provide emotional support/give them my 2 cents which might help them out. Etc. 
Progress doesn't always have to be revolutionary. The little things can be meaningful too."
1292,esfj,"I guess that’s what I’m trying to highlight. That we care about the potential connection regardless of shared interests. We are interested in it most of the time. I like to branch out of my comfort zones with people so even if there’s not much potential shared interests, maybe I learn something new. "
1293,esfj,"Hey man, I like to give it raw too-with permission of course. As they say, consent is sexy. ;).
Moving forward, it's the process that I'm laughing at, not the content that we, counterparties, provide.
Cold truths? Who gives a fuck? Life's a joke. Ya born, ya die, and ya dead. Ya so what man? Everyone has their own ""truth"" and they adhere to it the way they want to. Why change it? Idgaf. The more you try to shift people's realities, the more they usually dislike you and the less influence you have over people. You think I like wiping my own ass?
If you want to find like-minded people who think like you do, find them. Don't waste your time bro, or do. Who the hell am I to tell you what to do? 
It's interesting though, you INTPs develop an Echo Chamber. The moment something is logically sound to you, you'll stick to that thing like glue. And you kind of just want to hear the same shit from other people. If anyone differs, they're a dumbass. That shit cracks me up. The parallel here is ESFJs judging people who don't adhere to the norm-all of a sudden they're a fucking weirdo. Lmao.
Fuck it, who cares?"
1294,esfj,"I could be wrong but in my experience, INTP's seem to go with the flow in a conversation and expand on the words you used. But that may not exactly fit the widely agreed upon definition of ""force"", i.e. ""make (someone) do something against their will"". "
1295,esfj,"Sure. That, and I trying to also point out that it just feels good sometimes to emotionally bond with someone in an easy-going manner. It's like a form of junk food you can say. Doesn't help really, but it makes me feel better in the moment. "
1296,esfj,"In small talk situations  like an elevator or something like that. Dude come on... Let's face it you can't talk about for instance ""Hegel's philosophy"" in 40"". One thing is to be an INTP but another is to force everything into an horoscope-like way of thinking.
You may like it or not that's just how it is. I personally don't like it but I understand it."
1297,esfj,"I never asked you to do anything. I simply share my thoughts if I disagree with what someone wrote, and try to also learn about other people's views. I did the same thing for the OP on another comment. "
1298,esfj,"My mother is ESFJ and her husband is ISTP.  They've managed to stay together, whereas she usually runs men off fairly quickly with her extremely controlling, manipulative nature. He's sort of immune to it all so doesn't mind. 
I think ISTPs are patient and tolerant enough to manage an ESFJ relationship. "
1299,esfj,"I'm an istp female currently separated from an esfj male. We butted heads A LOT. I am very direct, love new things, and couldn't really deal with his flirtatious nature. He on the other hand, loved anything familiar (total mummy boy), routine, crappy tv - a simple life. It just wasn't very much stimulation for me and I found my head wandering away when he came home and all he could talk about was the office gossip. I'm impatient and he didn't really ever deal with things efficiently. I'm not sure about anyone else but do ESFJs have a tendency to moan about their problems a lot and never do anything about it? I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. 
And he loved to be centre of attention, jokes at his own expense, my expense and he could exaggerate and lie quite a lot. Yeah, my respect for the guy kind of dwindled away..... "
1300,esfj,"The biggest issue typically is when I'm having a really introverted day (more so than usual) and she feels the need to try to draw me out of my shell. So in a way it's a space problem. But, I do tend to over-rationalize issues when she is upset, and that causes more issues. Instead of being a sympathetic ear I try to fix everything. I guess when it comes down to it, we just try to fix each other in the way that we wouldn't want to be fixed"
1301,esfj,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner?
If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you?
Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
1302,esfj,"never been in a relationship and i dont think i will ever cheat on somebody. i sometimes talk to several guys at a time (nothing serious though) but once i'm interested in a guy, eventhough we're not actually dating, i dont feel like talking to other guys. i'm weird i know"

1304,esfj,"Hi all, INTJ male in peace here! I married my girlfriend of just under 5 years last month, and out of curiosity persuaded her to do an MBTI test, having found I learnt a lot more about myself and how my personality comes across to everyone else by doing so. Having found out how diametrically opposed our respective personality types are and that these relationships rarely work, I was very surprised!
Despite our often vast differences in personality (as can be explained by our MB personality types), we do have some great times together and are very much in love with one another, but finding out she was an ESFJ and doing a bit of reading has really helped me understand her motivation and character, and why the disagreements we have between us can sometimes happen.
Fairly characteristically of an INTJ, I'm very analytical and sometimes honest and critical to the point of perceived bluntness by others, a fairly unpleasant INTJ flaw I am keenly aware of and trying to temper at every occasion. Of course, this ""cold and calculating"" outward impression paired with an ESFJ tendency (I hope I word this correctly!) to be very open, deeply empathic and in tune with the well being of their loved ones, and to be hurt by indifference or perceived criticism from those they care about, is a clear problem area. It's something that personally, I find myself thinking afterwards, damn, am I really being such an arsehole to my wife, of all people? What at the time I see as being just my honest interpretation of something, in a purely scientific, emotionally indifferent way, will be perceived by my wife as more critical, or worse still, unloving. It's a flaw of mine for sure, but one heightened by our differences too!
She also frequently talks of the need for respect in a relationship, which I totally agree with in my own analytical INTJ way, however, understanding now that this includes what she feels is very important, real support and approval from her loved ones and a dislike for disharmony or conflict, is much easier for me to understand now. Apologies if this sounds at all condescending - this is how I understand it, but some (probably far better) insight from you guys would be really appreciated too.
In my own slightly selfish way, I hope that my wife will come to understand my obvious flaws better with the knowledge of my personality type. I'm sure you have heard the same from INTJs on here before, but there is a warm person to be found under the outwardly mechanical personality. When we upset our loved ones because we come across as heartless or emotionally indifferent, it does make us (or at least me) feel thoroughly crappy aftwerwards. I of course find it hard to articulate my emotions and passions well, but my wife, as an ESFJ, is a truly warm, caring person who has drawn the very best out of me emotionally since we've been together. Being an ""E"" to my ""I"" means, as a couple, we have some great friendships, and she is always suggesting new things, places to go and people to see which I would probably have never done myself. 
I'm obviously trying to improve myself, and being more understanding of her desire for emotional support from me, while maybe not being my strength, is something I am working on. Part of me wonders if there is any plasticity in our personality types, and that I can get more in touch with my ""S"" and ""F"" side.
I hope that all comes across well enough, and sorry for the wall of text. I'd love to read something from anyone with experience or insight into this sort of relationship, or if any of you could perhaps explain what drives an ESFJ better than my current understanding, my wife will thank you! =)"
1305,esfj,"Can't say I've seen an intj/esfj pairing, but then you intj's are pretty rare. That being said, it sounds like you're doing great in trying to work on communication and understanding. The fact that you're still pursuing this kind of thing after five years together really says a lot. :)
The MBTI is great for understanding how another person works. And the ""pairings"" you read about are broad stroke generalities that don't mean anything when you get down to your own personal relationship. If you love your ESFJ - that's what matters. Isabel Myers didn't marry her ""best match"" and she'd tell you not to worry about it, but to use what you know to help make your marriage better (which you're doing - bravo).
I like to think that marrying someone with a lot of opposing ""preferences"" can help to even you out and force you to appreciate qualities in others you may be more apt to dismiss if you only associate with people that think like you. My two cents. :)"
1306,esfj,"I applaud your efforts as I am with an ESFJ as well.  I am an learning about Jungian typology has really helped me understand our relationship dynamic.  I remember having bad arguments where I would be sitting there asking myself, ""What the f*ck?"", is this for real?   There are unresolved conflicts between my critical approach to belief systems and her desire for traditional and provisional support.  
Another point of contention is her Fe emotional approach and my Ne Ti quest for knowledge and truth.  For instance, if I am busy researching something particularly interesting, I may lose track of time and be unreachable or irritated if when interrupted.  I am trying to download information into my brain to be analyzed.  I am intensely fascinated by possibilities.  She expresses extreme anger when she feels ""unloved"" or ignored.  She finds this introverted, seemingly, detached state foreign and takes it as a sign that I don't care about her or have fallen out of love with her.  She also pushes emotions outwards (which I feel attacked by) and tries to rationalize her feelings rather than understand them.  
I am often repulsed by her behavior and emotional outbursts even though I understand her deeply emotional nature.  I am trying to  meet her half way and console her emotionally but sometimes there is a major disconnect.  I try to use logic to communicate but it often makes the situation worse because she doesn't process information very well.  
I've been working on ways of recognizing emotions and displaying comforting emotions.  I've found it helps to discover the emotions she's feeling and apply the correct emotional antidote.  This may sound a bit manipulative but i haven't yet found a way to communicate with her beyond that.  
On the bright side, understanding her type has had great benefit.  I am more able to notice, evaluate, and value her strengths.  Thus, I am more empathetic to her perspective.  She's incredibly loyal, persevering and dutiful. I truly respect those qualities and her caring sensibility.  She's also really cute :)"
1307,esfj,"If I really had to pick: Palace by Sam Smith
It reminds me that real love is never a waste of time, now matter how much it hurts. 
I like songs that really mirror my current feelings and circumstance. They each have a line that resonates with my entire being. 
A bit overkill but this is all that is currently in my break up playlist:
Baby, You Make me Crazy - Sam Smith
Love You Anymore - Michael Bublé
Truthfully - DNCE
Hotel Ceiling - Rixton
One Day at a Time - Sam Smith
I’ve Told You Now - Sam Smith
Still on Your Mind - Ethan DeRose
Impossible - James Arthur
Without the Love - Demi Lovato
Tears Dry on Their Own - Amy Winehouse
Sorry not Sorry - Demi Lovato
I Won’t Cry - Jay Ollero

1308,esfj,"Actually have a whole playlist of songs I listened to after my ex broke up with me: https://open.spotify.com/user/1243496029/playlist/6IDkOD70fpnhQpQ7IetYUr?si=nrrfAU8cQuWIraUbkcle5A 
If i had to pick one though, it'd be ""thank you for being a friend"" by Andrew Gold (https://open.spotify.com/track/5yNUgA66PbcPIJPOU2eBwR?si=IQaAl2yWQ0ChGo_OxoYyxA)
It has a nice message to me and is a good send off in my mind. To me i viewed it as ""Thanks for being a friend, but now it's over""  
Similarly the song ""Stole the Show"" by Kygo is along the same lines. The lyrics   
"" No heroes, villains, one to blame
While wilted roses fill the stage
And the thrill, the thrill is gone
Our debut was a masterpiece
But in the end, for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on 
[Chorus: Parson James]
We used to have it all, but now's our curtain call
So hold for the applause, oh
And wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
'Cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show
Least we stole the show "" (Source: https://genius.com/Kygo-stole-the-show-lyrics)  
really resonated with me personally because  
To me stood out as like, it's no ones fault this didn't work out, it's just ending  
but in the end for you and me
Oh, the show, it can't go on""
For me the start of the relationship was kind of amazing. It was my first and a lot of people were happy for me and so it seemed like a big thing. Both me and my gf at the time would post quotes from each other that seemed like cute couple things but as time went on those became less and less, so even though the beginning was great, it's not so great anymore  
so hold for the applause, oh
and wave out to the crowd, and take our final bow
'cause it's our time to go, but at least we stole the show""
We used to be great, but now it's time for this to end. Give one final wave/ bow, but now this is ending, and me and my friends won't be seeing you again. Or at least that's what it meant to me with my situation  
""Flowers On The Wall"" by Eric Heatherly was another song I listened to a lot after the breakup. It's about a guy who's depressed about the breakup but is trying to come off like he's not.   
Sorry this comment was super long wasn't sure if you were asking for advice on songs to listen to after a breakup or just curious in general

1309,esfj,"Is it faux pas to comment a week and a half late? How does this whole commenting business work? I was excited to find this subreddit then disappointed when I saw it wasn't very active then realized I had no reason to feel disappointed when all I ever do is lurk and only get on reddit every couple weeks!
Here's my list, I got a little carried away! I know there are a ton more but this is all I got off the top of my head. It's been many moons since my last breakup so these are a bit dated, and all over the place genre-wise. 'd ones just might* be ones I'm guilty of listening to on repeat.
Umqua rushing - blind pilot
I would be sad - Avery brothers
No children - the mountain goats
A better place a better time - streetlight manifesto
Ponytail parade - Emery
The long fade - king creosote
Bonsai tree - Peter and the wolf
Almost all of Damien Rice's songs on his first two albums, especially 9 crimes, rootless tree, cannonball, and accidental babies
Fire/fear - the head and the heart
Trailer trash - modest mouse
The chain - Fleetwood mac
All hail the heartbreaker - the spill canvas
My girlfriend's dead - the vandals
*A perfect sonnet - bright eyes
Somebody I used to know - gotye
Nothing better - the postal service
You don't know me - Ben folds
Cold shower Tuesdays, and also life after Lisa - bowling for soup
You were meant for me - jewel
Everything will be alright - the killers
Andria - la dispute
Diamond ring - moody blues
Telescope eyes - eisley
Gentleman caller - cursive
Someday you will be loved, and we laugh indoors - death cab for cutie 
Do you realize - the flaming lips
I'd love to know if anyone else loves any of these songs or has been able to relate!"
1310,esfj,"I am either a really friendlY ESTJ or a ESFJ that doesn’t like to think about her emotions or consider herself emotional or don’t admit it to herself. I don’t know if there is such a thing Or don’t tell people I care about their emotions or don’t admit that to myself that I actually care about them? I find that I care and worry about others. I know everyone, and find that I can be really super friendly.
So I want you to tell me about yourselfs. How your ESFJness works and what differences you have with ESTJs?  "
1311,esfj,Hey if you want to pick my brain a bit feel free to dm me. Sadly I don't know too much about all the differences between the personality types but if you had any specific questions about how I'd process situations or anything specific about personality I'd be willing to answer some questions! Sorry if this doesn't help much but wanted to offer what I can! 
1312,esfj,"I found this sub really enlightening. I was half doubting myself but I think I figured out I am not ESFJ..
But I guess I don’t understand fe so I could ask some questions.
Do you generally consider yourself emotional? I know fi people certainly do. I can see you guys as not always seeming all that emotional. Or is it that you consider yourself emotional but less emotional than you let it be shown?
Or maybe that’s just me?"
1313,esfj,"Hey there. Yeah, I think I have figured it out looking at your sub just was like nah, not me. It was really enlightening when I dug. I was like maybe this is the way to do it.
I think it is the motive. See I also know everyone too. And I think it may be stereotypes. Because esfj is seen as knowing everyone and their personal life. ESTJ just focus on work. But I am easily the most sociable of the students. I know quite a bit of who everyone is and what their life is like. Not just their job and what they do, or not just being really acquainted. I am a student currently, but I would imagine work being like that too.
I care a lot about people and about their issues, I have often been burdened with them. I think I care more than I let it be knownn. I try to help out other people and sort of worry about them. I tend to follow up on their issue quite a bit. It’s this concern for them in a sense. 
Could be fi all of this really.
I do tend to adapt myself to the situation or people tend to notice that I do more than I do which may be a 3 thing.
So I guess my question is also when you folks and you folks are called social chamaeleons blend in to your background do you know you’re doing it or do you just do it?
I have been in and out helping with special education for quite a while. I feel this passion for it could be fi all of this, really. But okay. Anyway. So I tend to take on there problems kind of help them out and I am kind of known in a lot of places as a good adapter. I get asked how to do things serve as an unofficial and unpaid consultant. Well, people just ask me questions. But anyhow. I get known as this person who can kind of keep them in mind and make these sort of adjustments.
Also, I tend to attract them especially during school like flies, the special education students.
Also, I tend to have a thing with drawing people out of their shells, even the most introverted of people. Not sure what it is.. People tend to tell me problems unsolicited.
I also get a lot of te stuff though so I don’t know."
1314,esfj,"So it's interesting. I definitely have emotions. Like, I'm not a robot lmao. However, when I'm arguing with someone or someone is trying to explain something to me or I'm trying to figure out what someone will do I often will not consider emotions as part of a thought process. So like, for example there was one time I was arguing with my parents and my mom said ""you're just not thinking about this emotionally"" and I said ""...yes? that's how you argue?"". I have days where I have break downs, feel sad, and others where I feel immensely happy. So it's not lack of emotions but it's lack of emotions during thought processes. Even my friends have said at times I can come off as cold hearted because I often negate emotions when thinking about how someone should act or when giving advice about what someone should do. 
So, the way I view myself is being able to remove emotions from an equation easier than other people seem to be able to. Even when I'm in emotional distress I'm often able to stop myself and think about what would be the best course of action. Granted, that doesn't mean I always do the best course of action lmao sometimes I rather just take care of my emotions. But I've never been in a situation where I felt my emotions took the better of me? It was always me thinking about the logical and emotional outcomes and deciding which was best based on my needs in the moments. I never just lost myself to emotions. 
I do also feel I mask emotions well. If someone asks me about my life I'm more than happy to go on about it and how things make me feel. But on a day to day unless someone asks I don't think people can often read what I'm feeling. My best friend for years couldn't even tell things were off with me at times and when I explained it to him he remained skeptical because to him nothing seemed off. 
If you want me to go into more detail with anything let me know! Glad you were able to find this sub and use it to get some help! Some resources:
This guy has made a video for each of the personality types. I really enjoy them and you might find them interesting: https://youtu.be/iRYBKdKsu2s
This is a website that explains all the different personality types pretty well I think. This is the page for ESFJ's : http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESFJ.html"
1315,esfj,"I don’t think I’m ‘stereotypically’ ESFJ in that sense. I am very in tune with who I am and I feel ‘off’ if I feel like I’m being someone I’m not and I’m flat out against it. 
I am a social chameleon if you mean that I can be drastically different with different people. I have lots of interaction techniques purely because everyone is different and I interact with them in different ways while all still feeling like me. Unless I’m not being true to my feelings, it’s all fairly second nature. "
1316,esfj,"Okay I added to my post if you want to reread the end I should have just replied again. So you mean to say that this social chamaeleon type of effect is very much conscious?
Does what I think may be fe not sound fe to you? It may not be at all and I am just overthinking this not understanding it. I can tell and type someone as fe but don’t know in general in application terms and there is somethings I don’t know about fe. But this is education. Hahaha!"
1317,esfj,"Ah so you'll have to forgive me if I don't quite answer this correctly because outside of knowing my personality type and reading descriptions of it, I don't actually know much about what each thing means. That and I don't think I fit ESFJ perfectly though it's super close to how I view myself- closer than anything else- which is why I consider myself one. So i'll try my best to explain. I'm assuming the Fe is for feeling yeah?
So from what I've read and seen ESFJ's make a lot of decisions based on their own thoughts on a matter/ have sort of moral compass that guides their decisions. I feel this describes me to a T as the way i make a lot of my decisions on how to treat people or deal with situations is based on what I consider is right or wrong. I feel I suppose a strong way usually when it comes to moral decisions and generally hold others to the same standard I hold myself- though am often disappointed when people make different decisions that I feel are the ""wrong"" ones, based on my own personal beliefs.
I also feel I can read people/ read a room generally better than others which I attribute to being able to understand emotions and seeing how that effects the people around me. From that website I linked to ""With Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJs are focused on reading other people. They have a strong need to be liked, and to be in control. They are extremely good at reading others, and often change their own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment."" again describes me perfectly. In the video I linked to the guy mentioned that ESFJ's tend to use emotional manipulation to get what they want and I also have to agree with this. I'm pretty sure I've always stopped myself when I found myself trying to use guilt/ emotional manipulation on someone but it is a thought process of ""wow this person is feeling this way and so if i say/ act like this right now this could tip their opinion/ actions/ thought process in my favor"". Like i said though, I stop myself when that happens because i feel that is wrong. But I feel that skill/ preference comes from being able to understand feelings and use them accordingly
But uh yeah, if I misunderstood what you're asking please feel free to let me know and I can try to adjust my answer!"
1318,esfj,"It very well could be, just unhealthy. Fe is still capable of being their own person, just that they value the harmony of their environment more than their individual happiness. I don’t see it as social chameleonism, just different interaction types. "
1319,esfj,"Are you sure you’re an ESFJ? I know what fe is good enough that doesn’t seem like a fe thing. That sounds very fi. Fe is others emotions and knowing those and fi is knowing your own, you seem very fi. Actually. I know what fi is very well and know a lot of fi people.
Are you sure you are not an ESFP."
1320,esfj,"Yeah I mean, I've taken the test a couple of times and I've always gotten ESFJ. Sorry I couldn't have been of more help, though like I mentioned I do feel I can read others emotions well in the moment and usually know how to comfort people and such. So idk, I could be just a mix of the two lmao"
1321,esfj,"You can’t always trust the tests. I can ask you some questions. I think I understand fe now. Your fellow esfj people on here kind of explain it to me and that seems really different from what you are saying. I know what fe is just not in a pragmatic way. So I know what it is I was seeking some examples which I got quite a few here. Yours was not an example of fe. Actually matched up to my definition of fi I have.
If you take the test and it’s dichotomy based it could be very easy to confuse.
How much do you notice details? Do you notice your environment quite well and is very focused on it. Do you get effected by atmospheric aspects like how your environment is. Are you drawn to environmental details?
Also how good is your memory? How good is your processes for facts and figures?
Is your sensation more In the moment or do you tend to compare your environment with previous environments and stuff? 
Do you compare world views with previous notions of such, and how about knowledge? Do you tend to intigrate this in to what you already know?"
1322,esfj,"Hmm I'll try my best to answer these!
Let's see I wouldn't say I notice things too much in detail. Often I find I can spot things others overlook in my surroundings but usually when I'm in a new place I look around and ""Scope out"" the new area to kind of get a lay for where I am. I've also been able to notice things like animal trails in the woods when others didn't. Though I usually attribute that to just the fact I grew up in a really rural environment so I have experience with it. But if I'm in a place I've been before usually I don't remain that focused on the environment. usually just a passive awareness but other than that usually i'm spacing out/ not paying much attention to it. Though in college/ in restaurants I tend to like to sit in the back mostly because then I don't have to worry about anyone behind me but also to kind of keep an eye on everything.
Not quite sure on the atmospheric aspects unless that was answered when I said i just kind of take stock of everything around me in a new place- same with environmental details. If something sticks out to me then sure i'll pay attention to it/ try to figure out why it caught my attention but other than that It's just a general ""let me see my surroundings"" and then move on
My memory is okay. I often rely on my calendar to remember things. I also tend to forget things easily in the short term/ if something isn't that important to me.
For processing facts and figures I like to say I fact check/ ask for sources on a lot of stuff but usually for stuff that aligns with my point of view I don't really so I don't feel i'm especially good at that aspect. 
Don't really know how to answer the sensation question. I'm not really a high thrills person so there's not much ""sensational"" going on around me usually. If i'm hiking or something usually my mind is wondering as I look at the woods around me. 
Usually I have a view of the world and unless something credible comes along to change it my view doesn't shift. I'm quite stubborn but that goes for my ideals/ thoughts too. One of my friends has said he actually enjoys how stubborn I am because then i'm really predictable. So he knows if he comes to me with a certain problem exactly what my position/ reaction will be because even though it's been years my view hasn't changed for the most part. Of course some things have changed as I've come across new information that proves me wrong. So yeah I guess I integrate new information with old as long as the new information disproves a previous belief. Though it usually takes a lot for me to be convinced i'm wrong. 
Actually, same friend who said he enjoyed my stubborness I had asked to do a description of me- my personality traits/ strengths and weaknesses. One of the things he said in it was ""Very stubborn in arguments and discussions. The only way to get through to him is to make it clear that he is understood and for him to have faith in your intellectual capability. That said, he doesn't suffer from feeling that no one understands him. He generally assumes that he is understood."" and i feel that is a good description for my stubbornness. "
1323,esfj,"No offense I don’t think your’e an esfj. I am also si and you don’t seem like si. I think toards the end your fi showed up. I think your stubbornness is this very firmly held conviction you have, a very strong moral compass. And you seem more aware of your environment than I am. I am not bad by any stretch of the imagination but se and si are actually different.
I don’t change because I have this constant this is normal, this isn’t. I notice everything that is not normal or usual or something of that effect.
I think si people also has a better memory.
Nothing wrong with being se though. You have strenghts I don’t have. If I had more se maybe I could find my way around wide open spaces better as a blind person haha! But my se is my sixth and it’s honestly not that good.
Si is a different type of sensing. The normal meaning of sensing used in normal non-mbti conversation is se. Not si. Si is kind of weird and isn’t truely what people mean when they say sensing in a non-mbti conversation. I do more memory recall even with facts and to that effect my memory is superb. It’s almost photographic. I don’t have to study for tests. And I get as or bs."
1324,esfj,"We ESFJs tend to be strict and like to abide by the rules, but every now and then a very uncharacteristic wave comes over me and I just want to do something crazy! 
What’s the craziest thing you rule-following ESFJs have done?"
1325,esfj,"Oh man, on my 21st birthday (just a few weeks ago) I got super drunk for the first time to celebrate but then also made the drunk decision to get cross faded. And I did just that and I don’t know why but I felt like getting crazy that night. It was fun though!"
1326,esfj,"I was at the hookah bar relaxing and getting into a good state of mind, and everything was going great! Up until I decide to leave for the night. Walk outside and realize my truck is gone. Call the police and find out it has been towed. This set off my FE response in a bad way. I became very angry very quick. But the good news is, I realized what had happened and was actually able to calm myself down. So all in all, it was good experience to help me further control my reaction to plans not going to plan.
Tl;dr - truck got towed, got very upset, but was able to see it and calm myself back down."
1327,esfj,"What you ,ESFJs think about bringing some INTPs (Like me) and INTJs here ?
It would bring some nice activity here. I've seen some of you were a bit sad that this subreddit weren't as lively as you wanted to.
So I had this idea.
I wanted to know how you felt about this before making it real.
If I have dozen of you who are okay ,I'll put a post on /r/INTP and /r/intj and bring some people here ! ^^

Plus I love chat a bit with you guys ,so if you have anything to say please tell I would be happy to answer or discuss !

Agreements countdown : +3 (3|0) ,7 more to go !

Have a nice day ! ~~
Thanks for your attention !

EDIT (April, 19^(th)) : 
I keep an eye on this thread ,so don't be shy ! ^^  
I'll count aggrements by PMs too ! "
1328,esfj,"Sweet !
Can I count your post as an agreement ?
I live my extroverstion pretty much in the same way so I yo what you are meaning ! =)
Uh ... 
It's somthing I know too but from the other side ...
I'm glad to read this
I wish you both the best !"
1329,esfj,"Hello guys, I wanted to know what could be the meaning behind an ESFJ ex that did not want you back, but after some month of self improvement, forgave you after an apologize letter, started chatting with you again irl, followed your current girl on instagram, seems disastified when seeing her name on a common friend phone, has one of her friend talking to you, starts talking about her activities with her current bf when you're like 2 m from her
Is it what fun look like hue"
1330,esfj,"I really like her and I am afraid to make any move. I feel anxious about what it may turn into.
Please tell me about what qualities in an INTP do ESFJs like and how I can grow it?
Hello from the other side. 😉"
1331,esfj,"Hey there,
I love INTPs! My little sister is one and we are exact opposites (as you mentioned), but we somehow make it work. She appreciates my unreserved love of people and how relaxed my joy is.
Things I like:
I enjoy her quirky humor (although puns don't really do for me what they do for her), as well as her sharp mind for processes and problem solving. She also tends to be quite calm, and will listen to anything I say and then offer cold, unbiased advise. Not always  fun, but if you're honest with yourself then you do appreciate the advise.
Things I don't like about her:
- Sometimes she's a little too cold/withdrawn
- She can be a bit too dismissive of a fun time
- She can be a bit quiet for me
Hope this helps!"
1332,esfj,"Data, analysis, fun facts & 'did you knows' and all things that would make your Ti have a happy dance. Counterintuitive, but this is probably your best bet in wooing an ESFJ. It's all in pleasing that inferior cognitive function. It's a blind spot for us all but its where we go when we feel vulnerable and just want to feel comfortable. And what better way to woo someone than to make them feel comfortable? 
For example, as an ENTP, my inferior cognitive function is Si. I believe that if anyone found out the songs and movies that are soundtrack to my childhood through college years, that's likely the easiest way into my heart. Si and Ti are the easiest functions to exploit in this fashion. Fe and Te might be the most difficult. Good thing she's not trying to woo you in this case then init ;)"
1333,esfj,"TBH, it don't matter your MBTI type. You also aren't restricted to being a status quo holder as long as you know you're narrow-minded by nature. You have to accept that first as painful as it is. You also have to accept that you aren't always right and that you aren't the most important being in the planet. Also you aren't a victim of your circumstance just like how you aren't victim of your personality. Essentially, acceptance of your perceived flaws will shrink your ego, which will help you move on. 
As long as you can keep it cool, take feedback from the people around you without being defensive, and stop being overly sensitive (by being aware of it), you'll be just fine. I can say I had an unhealthy and obsessive desire to ""discover"" myself/change who I am, which made me jump into these communities.
After a long and tough discussion with my ENTP best friend and praise from my INTJ best friend, I've realized this much...
It isn't you, but your approach that needs to change. It's like how mass never changes, but weight does (there's one for you science folks). You can always trim the fat. It all takes time, patience, awareness, acceptance, conscious thought, understanding, and effort.
From there, I've changed in almost an instant (of course it took time). I went from an unhealthier ESFJ to a healthier ESFJ than yesterday-progress never stops. Also, I wanted to post this without being condescending. Also, hopefully my revelation isn't super obvious, but it's pretty fucking obvious. Anyways, you guys never knew me in the first place, and never knew me in the last. To be honest, I could have gone without the post and the time would have still moved, but I thought my lesson was gold. I will no longer be lurking this place. I do hope I incite conscious thought. Ciao."
1334,esfj,"Ironically, what helped me most to identify my faults wasn't the MBTI reddit community, but the 16personalities.com description of ESFJ. I think getting too engaged with the MBTI community can become pretty toxic. Good for you, mate."
1335,esfj,"Honestly, you're right. I perfectly understand you. I just recently jumped on the MBTI bandwagon due to some issues I'm going through right now (it's a really long story; problems seem to particularly like me) and to try to ""get a better understanding of myself"". I've so far been categorized in just a few days under a just enough number of MBTI types, and I'm still unsatisfied. Why did I do it? Probably because I wanted to feed my ego.
This test and the difficult times I'm going through made me realize that I don't like labels at all and that sometimes trying to force yourself into being something you're not can be damaging.
I too am saying goodbye to this otherwise amazing community for an indefinite amount of time. I really met some amazing people in just a few days, and I'm glad that I did so, but I just don't like labels that much. And my happiness doesn't have to depend on it. I just need to be myself and try not to pigeonhole myself into something I'm not. It's not you, it's me.
You're not alone."
1336,esfj,"I firmly believe that MBTI is only useful as a tool for self improvement. People who use it to look down at others or form cliques or excuse their bad behavior are just damaging themselves, and that's a lot of the people here.
I think you're on to something about how unhealthy it can be to try and discover yourself. Of course self-knowledgebis all very well and good, but it can cross the line into naval-gazing very quickly. It is very rare for anyone to be the most interesting thing in their own life. Stop qorrying about who you really are and start thinking of all the awesome things you have left to do! You'll get way more self-knowledge by experiencing life than you evrr could in the echobox of a forum.
Sounds like MBTI stopped being a helpful habit for you so you moved on--I think that's amazing, and a trait that will serve you well in the future."
1337,esfj,"I'm also very certain that there are a lot of mistyped XXSJs on the main MBTI forum. And because of that, they pretend to be a type they are not and spread incorrect information. Furthermore, lots of non-SFJs quite frankly don't fully understand us either. It was frustrating for me, as I was trying to earnestly learn about my own type."
1338,esfj,"Yup, quite frustrating indeed. I came to the MBTI community so that I could understand the different types and why they think the way they think or behave the way they do. And, for the most part, I did gain that. But, I also often observed people bashing other types and thinking their type is superior. It's a cesspool of insecure people misconstruing the point of MBTI, or at least in my opinion of its purpose. But yes, it is frustrating that I'm here trying to understand why someone else thinks differently than I do, while instead of trying to understand me, they choose to flex their superior type or make fun of mine."
1339,esfj,"I am an INTJ with an ESFJ younger sister. I am the oldest (18) and she is 13. Recently our parents divorced and it has been pretty hard on her. Being an INTJ i'm not exactly as open with my emotions, and i guess you could say i have a smaller need to social interaction. I am trying to step up and help her as her older brother but i feel that the way i currently am don't really understand how she thinks or how she feels. I was wondering if any of you ESFJ's were in my sisters situation what would you want/ need in that situation."
1340,esfj,"Sorry about your parents. I'm sure this is tough for both of you. You sound like a great older brother.
My ex is an ISTJ, so slightly different from you, but what he never seemed to understand was that I didn't want rational explanations when bad things happened. I just wanted him to wrap me in his arms, tell me he loves me and that everything was gonna be ok. 
That being said, your sister is at an age where something traumatic like this could really affect her for awhile. Counselling/therapy could help her work through her emotions."
1341,esfj,"I would say to ask about how she feels and just sit and listen to her talk. I really like to vent sometimes, especially in stressful situations. But if she doesn't take the bait and doesn't want to talk, then I'd just let her know that you're there to listen if she ever does want to talk. Even if she doesn't want to, it'll feel good to know she has your support.  "
1342,esfj,"I'm an INTJ and my wife is an ESFJ. Based on our experience together, probably the best you can do is focus on spending social time together. Take her out to dinner, give her a ride to her friend's house, etc. -- and be on guard for her falling-in with the wrong crowd.
If you have any more specific questions, I'll do my best to help."
1343,esfj,I've only had the opportunity to meet a few (2) and both of them have been extremely intelligent.  Their view of the world steams from a desire to strip away everything that is not essential to the bigger point and the most objective truth. They tended to be lazy in day to day matters because in the long run it simply didn't matter to them or to their larger conceptualization of the universe.  They are probably the type most likely to accidnetly slip into an academic lecture on their topic of interest and redefine their surroundings based on abstract and logical frameworks.  They were refreshing to be around because they brought a unique and meaningful view of the world to the table.
1344,esfj,"I think a good fraction of the readers are INTPs who are interested in knowing how the subreddit of their directly opposite personality looks like.
I never saw lurking or posting on reddit as a ExFx sort of activity."
1345,esfj,"Existential crisis kind of depressing? The world is doomed kind of insight?
I feel like my tendency towards over thinking revolves around execution of a plan.  The focus being more towards movements of persons and groups.  The INTP brand of over thinking I imagine might take on a different manifestation.  "
1346,esfj,"I’m an INTJ, and my girlfriend is an ESFJ (originally, she told me she was an ESFP, but she recently re-took the test and this time she had a slight preference for J over P). Despite our differences, we seem to have a good relationship, and I want to keep that going. So, what advice do you have for helping me show my ESFJ girlfriend that I care about her in our conversations? How do I ask the right questions/find the right topics?"
1347,esfj,"As a fellow INTJ with a ESFJ girlfriend I can relate your worries. Let me summarize what I have learnt so far.:


First of all, you MUST find out why you really like her, so you have reasons to stick to your relationship when you find yourself in doubts


Show her you really care about her in your own way: You don't need to be corny or even fake any kind of ""normal"" behavior. Pay attention to her even when you know you will probably remeber anything.


Support her: If she tell you about her problems give her your opinion but emphasize that's your opinion. I usually say something like ""even thought.... IMO.... I'm with you and I really support you, so count with me""


Ask her how was her day. Tell her she is gorgeous.


When you feel you should gift something to her. YOLO. Do it! She will appreciate it


Just ask her ""do you feel I care about or like you?"": When I read bout INTJ+ESFJ relationships the very first thing I did (after thinking a lot about the whole topic) was ask her how was she feeling about my relative ""coldness"" and how I express my feelings. Just by doing this I was showing I care about OUR relationship and my will to build something together"" her answer was ""Yeah, I think that's actually cute (for her) and I like you just the way you are"".


If she likes you, she likes you. If you like her don't let her go. Show her you care. 
Finally, realize when you're being  dick (the INTJ karma)
I hope this will help"
1348,esfj,"You can't figure out your MBTI from a test. You need to examine the hierarchy of functions and read about the close matches. Decide from there. Also women and men have different cultural expectations which can skew the results. For example, I am ENTJ but women are not expected or accepted when they lead, even though I can see into the distant future where a plan might end up. "
1349,esfj,"Hey there, ESFJs (and non-ESFJ lurkers)! A few months ago, my good friend /u/ashirviskas developed an MBTI Relationships Survey to determine which MBTI Types had the best relationships with which types, what each of the genders rated their ongoing/terminated relationships, how their intertype friendships fare, etc.  By chance, I happened to see this guy post the survey in /r/intj asking for some input for the presentation of his results, and so I’ve been helping him out with it since then… and this is what we’ve come up with (so far)!  We invite you to tell us how your relationship with your Duals, Mirrors, etc., fare in this relationship survey! 
  
 
Link to Survey
Link to Survey Data
  
 
About the Survey:
All together, the survey is going to ask you about 1-2 romantic relationships (current and former, as well as duration), and 1-3 friendships.  It’s okay if you haven’t been in a relationship! We’d still love to receive your feedback based on your friendships/relationships with other types… if you’re not 100% sure about your friends’ or past/current S.O. types, try to give a best guess as to what their type might be (unsure is an option for friendships, but this isn’t as useful for finding correlations in the data).  
  
If you’re not confident about doing this, maybe try asking the person to take the test (a good quality cognitive functions test, rather than “preferences” tests that can be rather inaccurate), or read about the 8 cognitive functions… and see which ones the person most likely uses as their dom/aux configuration; an assessment on the inferior (which can result in the “grip”) or your “stressor” function might be useful as well. 
  
 
Personal Biases and Stereotyping:
Try to remove personal biases that you may have regarding other people in your current (and past) life! It’s not helpful to us (or to you) if you stereotype or inaccurately categorize people (i.e. “I dislike Person X because they’re so literal; they must be a Sensing Type”, since Intuiting types can be prone to such behavior as well), resulting in a lower rating for a given person/type.  
  
 
Be honest with yourself, even if this results in a rating that contradicts your initial beliefs/biases in the system; the truth is what matters the most in the end!  If you think you’d want help judging on what someone’s type may be in your life, I can try to help you out a little bit...  but, try to decide this for yourself/do good quality research and analyzing first! Some stereotypes that should be eliminated:
 


Not all Sensors are poor at (or can't handle) abstract or philosophical conversations, and not all Intuiting types are unrealistic, impractical, and disconnected from reality.  There is simply a preference for one or the other (and perhaps an imbalance in some)! And, on a related note, not all smart people are Intuiting types, and not all dumb people are Sensing types (or vice versa)!


Not all Feelers are illogical and irrational, and not all Thinkers are cold and detached.  For instance, being irrational can involve absurd, inconsistent logic, and sometimes being reasonable involves a practical and fair approach that requires considering other people's feelings.  A reasonable person will use both aspects to make sound, balanced decisions, but will typically prefer one over the other in a ""tiebreaker"" between the two. Not considering or actively disregarding one or the other is not superior in any way; this is just immaturity (in some regard) expressing itself!


Not all extroverts are loud and obnoxious, and not all introverts are antisocial recluses that never talk.  Being sociable isn't always the trait of an extrovert, and being socially anxious isn't always the trait of an introvert.  Also - some extroverts will not find conventional social affairs very energizing and stimulating; it can depend on the group of people for extroverts just as well as introverts.  Look into the cognitive functions!!! I cannot emphasize this enough.


Not all judging types are overly rigid, rule abiding, and ""stick up the ass"" kinds, and not all perceiving types are chaotic, lackadaisical, and scatterbrained fools.  We all have judging and perceiving functions, all of which can be prone to a form of narrow mindedness or disconnectedness.


  
  
The cognitive functions are supposed to educate us on how people introspect/reflect on things (introversion), and also how they interact with the environment (extroversion); how is a person interacting with their environment, and what kinds of biases do they try to mentally remove (introverted functions usually eliminate environmental biases, and extroverted functions usually eliminate personal biases in their respective domains)? 
  
  
Remember: we're all going to have traits that are introverted, and some that are extroverted in their expression! It's a matter of which ones will be this way... this should also be used as a guide to eliminate any ambiguity with regard to this orientation (thus, people start believing they're an ""ambivert"" - a term I personally cannot agree with).
  
If your family members are being considered as one of your friends for this survey, that’s fine too; any relationship will do, provided that you know them on a personal basis (since strictly going off of someone’s “professional” face may be not only counterproductive for this survey, but detrimental in your personal relationship(s) with that person[s] ).

If you want to PM any of us regarding a given topic, use these roles as a general guide.  Currently, I’m the most active and involved of the three, so if you want to talk about other stuff with any of us, I'd be the most available!"
1350,esfj,"3. Feedback Sought After
 
 
We are currently (and very actively) looking for some feedback, including ideas/suggestions on new data points that are simply not listed or unintentionally omitted without an explanation, data points that could be compiled that aren’t (as of yet), etc. 
 
 
Charts
This is one of the main things that will need a good amount of time to implement.  There are plenty of charts found in the excel version that I have in my possession; however, Google Sheets didn’t render them properly (surprised? I’m not).  As a result, the entire charting process needs to be taken back to the drawing board… I had some really cool double-sided bar charts for male vs female comparisons made and everything.  What a shame!
 
 
Mobile Users
As of 1/1/2017, this document isn’t very mobile friendly; this file is TREMENDOUS.  There are a lot of calculations being done on this Google Sheets document (I mean, thousands of them on the “General, All Types” tab alone, not to mention the “individual type analysis” tab...). Eventually, I would like to make a more mobile friendly version of this, which would simply import a lot of the data instead of doing the calculations directly on the document (if that would make it faster… I’m no programming expert!)
 
 
Sexual Orientation
As of 1/1/2017, I haven’t really done much to perform calculations on the basis of sexual orientation.  This wasn’t a very high priority for me to be honest (my apologies), since I thought that for now, having the genders was sufficient.  The calculations required for this were attempted a while ago along with gender and types, but they became overwhelming and very intense, making the document nearly impossible to open and maintain.  
 
 
I’m unfortunately not well versed in pivot tables, which would make this (along with other data points) much more attainable.  If anyone is able to create something like this for the survey data [or could share some really good pointers - does Google Sheets even have this feature?], that’d be splendid (and I’d love to learn)!
 
 
Volunteers
For the most part, I’ve been doing this stuff by myself (since /u/ashirviskas has a lot of school work, and /u/kun42 focused on doing statistics for his blog on this survey)… I’m sort of in over my head at this point, and I’ve slowed down on implementing the content we want on there considerably due to how overwhelming the work I’m assigning myself can be.  
 
 
If anyone wants to actively participate in making changes, suggestions, etc., I’m all for ideas and such! I would really like to work on getting well over 1,000+ (aspiring for over 2,000+... let me dream) responses on this survey (easily achieved), and implementing some charts.  I think there’s a lot of interesting data and insights that can be found in the results… I’d love to have someone to collaborate with on a regular basis about this stuff! I don’t bite, I promise… PM us if you’re interested (I know I am!)."
1351,esfj,"2. Document Table of Contents/Structure
 
 
Survey Responses
The raw survey responses - self-explanatory (hopefully!). Contains filters for the purposes of debugging, as well as examining data not organized into one of the other tabs of the document.
 
 
Overview (in the works as of 1/1/2017)
Gives an overview of Gender, Type, Socionics, and Temperament survey results. Includes a vast majority of the charts on the document [charts not readily available on Google Sheets version - import from xlsx wasn’t so streamlined and nicely executed]. Compiles information from the “General, All Types”, “Gender”, and “Temperaments” Tabs, and presents them in paragraph format.
 
 
Introduction_References (in the works as of 10/25/2016)
Gives a general overview of the concept of MBTI/Socionics (and will also give readers a general idea of the extent of knowledge/competence we the composers have), as well as explaining various things throughout the rest of the document.
 
 
General, All Types
Summarizes survey data on the basis of individual type; mostly consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data. Is used as a reference for other sheets, particularly the “In-Depth Analysis” and “Overview” Tabs.
 
 
Gender
Summarizes survey data on the basis of each gender for the types; consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data.
 
 
NOTE: The issue of gender-type-relationship duration configurations was separated from “General, All Types” due to the calculation intensive output that would have occurred if each rater-type-gender-duration and ratee-type-gender-duration calculation was performed; this resulted in a table that was well over 15,000 rows long, and made the document excessively slow in a previous version (not to mention extremely cumbersome to navigate). Thus, the creation of the Gender Tab came into existence! We apologize if an intensive gender analysis is a highly sought after data point…
 
 
NOTE 2: There is a gender assessment being worked on, and has been included in the “General, All Types” and “Overview” tabs…! Not yet implemented in the individual type analysis tab.
 
 
Temperaments (in the works as of 10/25/2016)
Summarizes survey data on the basis of the various temperament groupings presented in the “Introduction_References” Tab.
 
 
Individual Type Analysis
Summarizes survey data on the basis of the individual type selected. Will be more type specific (and eventually more intensive as a result) than the data presented in the other tabs. 
 
 
NOTE: This tab hasn’t been updated in awhile, but will eventually include a temperaments and gender based analysis such as what is found in the “Overview” Tab...!
 
 
Socionics (NEW and in the works as of 12/27/2016)
Organizes survey data on the basis of the socionics intertype dynamics. Gender based data is being worked on as well...!"

1353,esfj,"ESFJs: You're currently very grossly underrepresented in the survey data! As of 1/4/2017, there are 3 respondents that were reported as being ESFJ.  I'd like to hear from more of you guys, and see things from your perspective! I'd really appreciate it if you could just take a moment of your time to give us feedback on your relationships with other types... thank you for stopping by!"
1354,esfj,"Generally speaking, these are current distributions for the different temperaments for those who rated romantic relationships [as defined by MBTI). As you can see (as of 1/4/2017), some of them are grossly underrepresented (there seems to be some rounding errors/deviations here... keep that in mind)!

There's an exaggerated/skewed number of introverted intuitive types; we're attempting to collect more data on the types listed above! But, of course - all types are more than welcome to partake in the survey; we're just in high need of certain groups for a more fair representation!"
1355,esfj,"Hello, I am an enfp (f) engaged to an esfj (m). My fiancé and I have been together for about a year and a half, and I have hardly ever seen him depressed or angry. Well, some family drama has started happening between his divorced parents, and I saw a side to him I have never seen before. He got depressed and angry to the point he was inconsolable and started pulling his hair and saying his chest hurt. In situations like this, in my family I was always the ""fixer""...able to help my family members feel better through analyzing what's going on and cheering them up by talking about solutions. Well, with my fiancé, this ""fixer"" role DOES NOT work. I have heard that ESFJs rarely show their emotions, and I'm not sure how to help him with this. It does not help that I am a therapist either, because I want to therapize and fix the problem, which doesn't seem to really help. I'm used to being successful at my role as a helper, but in a (healthy)romantic relationship, I'm finding this really doesn't work.  ESFJs do not have Fi, I'm wondering how they do deal with their emotions. My fiancé said he's just going to ""not let it affect him"" and ""just ignore it and decide to not feel it anymore."" I know these things to not be helpful when dealing with anger, therapeutically speaking. Anyways, I'm just very concerned. If there are any ESFJs out there, what have significant others done for you in the past that was helpful in times like this? 
Also, random side note: he got very angry at the pile of dishes and our small apartment before getting to the root of the problem, which was family stuff. Maybe a way to help is to tidy up? "
1356,esfj,"I'm an ESFJ, and this is a tough one. When I get to the very rare ""overly depressed or angry"" stage, I usually cannot be approached or settled down until I have decided that's what I want to do. Despite having my (then) significant other settle me down, it wouldn't work.
Something to mention, is that while being in this state EVERYTHING bothers you. Any mild issue that would typically not be a big deal will seem outrageous. I feel that is what happened with the dishes. It was just something that was slightly irksom, but in that state of mind it is just another thing. (for instance, loud chewing for whatever reason pisses me off to no end.. but only when I'm in that bad state).
What I have found to help me, and granted this may not work for him... but just having you in the room with him while he chills and thinks it through. I would just lay on the bed/ couch and my significant other just lay there with me and rub my head... we'd just sit there until I was able to calm down enough to decide to talk about it, or at very least just settle down and table the discussion for later.
I hope this helps. "
1357,esfj,"Intensely negative emotions and ESFJs have a tumultuous relationship. With a personality that produces actions that prioritize others, there is often a lack of self maintenance; this development is usually able to be handled but if something intensely provoking arises, the defenses to handle the negative emotions may not be present or properly fortified. In this case, I believe that is being displayed through his bottling efforts as an alternative measure that I can warn personally leads to an increase in irritation, anxiety, and stress. If I had to make an educated guess based on my personal experience, finding a proper release for his emotional bottling would be a positive turning point for him. He likely believes that his feelings are a burden since he has expressed the desire to ""ignore it"" and is thus less likely to open up. Making sure he does not feel alone is what I would suggest, being present and providing assurance is the best place to start. After feeling more secure, opening up is less of a challenge and provides some release. Hope this helps some."
1358,esfj,"That is very helpful to me, and definitely what I have sensed works for him as well. Just being present seems to do a lot. I am not used to this. In my family I was always emotional caretaker, and in an unhealthy way. He helps me sort of outgrow this constant caretaker role, and I can always trust that he will come out of it on his own, without me intervening psychologically/emotionally.
Thank you for your response!! It makes a lot of sense and helps me solidify what I can do when this happens again!"
