0,esfp,"Sup everyone, ESFP male here. I have recently been on a few dates with an INTJ girl and so far things seem to be clicking. Have any of you dated one? What kinda of tips or words of wisdom do you have toward dating an opposite type?"
1,esfp,"I'm an INTJ.
Try not to keep secrets from us if you can tell others. Just stay honest, because not knowing something is often much, much worse to us (or at least me) than knowing a bad truth. Also, I will give constructive criticism to almost everything, even if I really like it. I may seem really cold sometimes, but I really, really like affection; I often can't stop thinking if there's something I've done wrong, if I don't get enough affection (once again, maybe just me). In fact, I often can't stop thinking in general, sometimes it can cause me to worry over nothing, or text at really bad times. Keep in mind, MBTI tests and every other personality test give extremely generalized results and really aren't used for many important things anyways."
2,esfp,"Dated an INTJ for a year and a half. Don't let their complaining or criticism of you get to you.  It will happen. Remember your needs, don't only focus on theirs. I think a lot of my problems stemmed from her being pretty narcissistic and somewhat abusive and me either giving in or not knowing what to do. It was a hell of a roller coaster ride though, some of the best and worst times of my life.  Try to avoid arguing without giving in though and suggest compromise after compromise if you have to. Good luck! I'm sure it will be great, just understand that she is the complete opposite of you and that you both think through things very differently!"
3,esfp,"I'm an ISTJ Male and my girlfriend of 22 months is an ESFP. I feel like this is significantly different than your situation though, because Extroverted Males are much different than introverted ones. If you'd still like to ask me questions about either of us, I'd be happy to answer."
4,esfp,"I'm glad I found this thread because I was going to open a similar discussion. I'm a male INTJ and my most memorable relationships have been with ESFP females. It really is as if opposites attract. She's the water of chaos against my immutable sandy banks of sanity. It takes both of us to create a dynamic, but stable, flowing river. That old TV series ""Dharma & Greg"" was a perfect illustration of the ESFP & INTJ couple. Is there something like that on TV these days?"
5,esfp,"Hey! I'm an ESFP lady who just married a goofy INTJ man. We've been together about 8 years. I have so much wisdom to give. I'm having some beers, so I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I do have one important point: 
In a strange way, INTJ and ESFP are not actually opposite. As my husband can explain much more competently, we have the same ways of thinking, we just use them in the opposite order. In that sense, it becomes an opposites complement each other sort of relationship, rather than a we dont understand each other sort of thing. I'll bet I can convince my husband to weigh in, on the off chance you want to hear more about this.
I think one of the harder parts is just the partnering of an introvert with an extrovert, as the couple has to be willing to do things separately more than usual.
ask any questions that come to mind!!"
6,esfp,wow thanks! appreciate the insight. I figure I should learn about the hard parts prior to experiencing them the hard way haha. I am slightly worried with opposite types but really really want it to work!!
7,esfp,"Fuck the Reddit hivemind lol. Can't express a different opinion without being bombarded with downvotes. I also hate how people on here tend to hyperfocus on one detail of what you're saying and then build a whole new, pretty irrelevant argument out of that. Just for the sake of putting you down. Why don't you try that in real life too, bitches? Come to LA and we'll bust a cap in your ass. "
8,esfp,"I feel every feeling in every movie. I cried a few times in movies that to other people aren’t even emotional. I very much enjoy being so immersed in the emotions in the movie, even if I can’t 100% relate to what’s on screen."
9,esfp,"Be pleasing in all manners of aesthetics because they will first notice all sensory details about you, and then carry yourself in a way that makes it seem you hold the secrets of the universe in your mind. (I'm joking, but I'm not.)"
10,esfp,"offer us opportunities to go on adventures, have fun and do (depends) daring, reckless and unconventional things. we like excitement, and if there's one thing we can't resist, it's someone who can keep us on our toes. (i'm an esfp) bonus points for great banter and an open mind."

​
ESFP Strengths
ESFPs are naturally friendly, outgoing, exciting, and flexible. ESFPs always try to make the most of each day, and enjoy doing new and exciting things. They are also warm, kind-hearted, and generous. ESFPs make friends easily, and are excellent communicators. They focus on the here-and-now, and prefer to take things one day at a time.
ESFPs were born for the spotlight, and love being the center of attention. There is rarely a dull moment when an ESFP is around! They enjoy nothing more than spending time with friends and family. They are accepting of others, but often hold grudges against those who have wronged them in the past.
As much as ESFPs love the spotlight, they are rarely self-absorbed. They are incredibly observant and are very aware of others feelings. ESFPs make excellent confidants. They always are there for others, offering a shoulder to cry on after a bad day. They have the ability to develop strong bonds with others very quickly. They also have the ability to connect with animals and children easily.
ESFPs are very practical and observant. They are more concerned with the real-world impact of things, rather than big, complex theories and ideas. They prefer to rely on information they can observe, rather than intuitive feelings.
ESFPs live in a world of possibilities. They love trying new things, and have developed very refined tastes. They enjoy the finer things in life. They appreciate things that are aesthetically pleasing, and take pride in decorating and organizing their home. 
​
ESFP Weaknesses
Because they enjoy living in the present moment, ESFPs can often have difficulty planning for the future. They may find themselves getting so caught up in the excitement of their day-to-day lives that they forget their long-term responsibilities.
ESFPs are constantly seeking out excitement, but if they are unable to find it, they get bored very easily. This may lead to irresponsible choices and risky behavior. This tendency may also cause problems in romantic relationships — ESFPs may be afraid of commitment because they are afraid of being trapped in an old, boring relationship. There is nothing ESFPs are more afraid of than losing that “spark” in their relationship.
ESFPs love for aesthetic beauty and poor planning skills may result in irresponsible financial choices. ESFPs may find themselves focusing on the short-term benefits of their purchases, rather than the long term consequences. It may be challenging for ESFPs to set budgets in general, and they may be frivolous or materialistic.
ESFPs often seek out the opinions of others, but may have a hard time accepting criticism. They may become reliant on others’ approval to validate their self-worth. Others may view ESFPs as overly-sensitive and emotional.
​
ESFP Parenthood
ESFPs are very fun-loving parents. They are constantly looking for fun and exciting activities to do with their children. They encourage their children to try new things, and understand that their children must step outside of their comfort zone for learning to happen. When their children try and fail, ESFP parents are always there to help pick their child back up, encouraging them to try again.
ESFPs certainly do have rules, but may have a hard time enforcing them. ESFP parents do not like feeling as if they are strict authoritarians. In addition, ESFPs do not like conflict and are especially hurt when their children are disrespectful. It is important for ESFP parents to remind themselves that sometimes you need to enforce the rules – the rules are there to help and protect your child!
​
ESFP Romantic Relationships
ESFPs are free-spirited and fun, an energy they naturally bring into their romantic relationships. ESFPs do not want to slowly get to know someone, they want to skip ahead and experience all the excitement that life has to offer! They are constantly looking for new and exciting date ideas and getaways with their romantic partners.
Because ESFPs are constantly seeking out excitement, they may have a difficult time committing and staying in a long-term relationship. ESFPs dread falling into a boring routine, so anyone dating an ESFP must keep things exciting and fresh.
​
ESFP Friendships
ESFPs make very loyal and kind friends. They are always there for a friend in need. At other times, however, they will make sure that everyone is having a great time! You will never have a boring evening with an ESFP.
Many people are naturally drawn to the charismatic and friendly nature of ESFPs. In turn, ESFPs are accepting of all others, even those who have very different personality types than themselves. They often make great friends for introverts, who don’t mind sharing the spotlight.
​
ESFP Work Habits
ESFPs are very giving and are willing to help others when needed, and this is apparent in the workplace. ESFPs are great team-players. They enjoy working in groups, and are both flexible and practical when doing so. ESFPs are often described as hardworking and willing to help.
While ESFPs can get along with most people, people who enjoy a great deal of structure and routine may find it difficult to work with ESFPs. They may view ESFPs as too free-spirited and irresponsible, and will quickly get frustrated.
People with this personality type have trouble dealing with conflict, and will to go great lengths to avoid conflict. Although they may seek affirmation from others, they are very sensitive to any negative feedback. Oftentimes, ESFPs take negative feedback very personally, and will harbor a grudge about it later on.
​
ESFP Career Paths
ESFPs thrive in careers that allow them to be creative and interact with others. They often are well-suited for careers as artists, actors, sales representatives, social workers, designers, consultants, or photographers.

12,esfp,"I like this ESFP description a lot. It's not constantly talking about imposing will and taking charge all the time. I feel like this is a more pleasant portrayal of ESFPs. I'm glad this was posted, thank you! "

14,esfp,"Please help me out! I want to understand it a bit more since I am trying to be pretty serious with my crush. We've been seeing each other for over a month and I have been letting him have free range because I know that's what he needs! But I know he will continue to keep coming back again and again. 
How do you get into a relationship? Are you usually looking for one? Is it an accident? Do you like a relationship label or is a label unnecessary? Would a label feel constraining? Or would it make you warm and fuzzy inside?
Spill the ESFP Beans Please"
15,esfp,"I'll be doing my usual thing, meet somebody, we talk, we keep talking, we hang out, keep hanging out, realize that we actually really like each other, and once it hits the point where I only like them I let them know and boom! relationship."
16,esfp,"That’s helpful. Yeah he told me he wasn’t meeting with anyone else and he wants to cuddle all the time, but I don’t know if that’s because he just hasn’t found anyone else or because he actually wants to just be with me."
17,esfp,"with ESFPs you kinda have to be careful that it’s the former tbh. This is just a generalisation but we have a tendency to be serial monogamists. 
Having a label would be necessary imo, I wouldn’t say that it’s “constraining” but establishing boundaries early on is important in any relationship. If he really likes you, it would make him feel warm and fuzzy inside ! "
18,esfp,"since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?"
19,esfp,"Meditation is practice and being in the moment of that is just taking it all in as it comes the sounds, the thoughts that's what meditating is. No one is always going to find meditation easy and some days will be harder than the other, meditation is also a play to think not just a place to be in the moment you engage your thoughts instead of ignoring them.
Or you have a bad meditation day you can get comfortable, can't focus, can't get the light feeling it just depends on your day and even if you have a hard time focusing you still meditate.
I'd request headspace, it's an amazing app that can train your mind and your awareness plus many more healthier things!"
20,esfp,"I'll give you a simple answer because I think the other commenters might be making fun of you: Intelligence, or the lack of, is not directly connected to any type of personality. It's a person by person measurement."
21,esfp,"IQ does bias a lot towards Intuition since a lot of what it does is measure pattern recognition.  I would say it's not entirely abnormal, but it's also a really, really bad measure of real intelligence.   
Unless you had aspirations for joining Mensa (which seems to be a large circle jerk), I wouldn't worry about it.  "
22,esfp,"Howdy all - I'm currently going through a career crisis as I'm not enjoying my job at the moment. 
I feel like I'm too immature for a lot of responsibility and can't have as much fun as I crave in such a professional environment! I also really struggle with doing anything related to planning or long term thinking which is kind of crucial for my current job. 
SO. What are some of the jobs that you ESFPs out there have and absolutely love? Or even what jobs do you not love?"
23,esfp,"I am a nurse and I absolutely LOVE my job! Nursing school was definitely not a picnic because it was hard work over two years. However, the hard work was definitely worth it, I couldn’t see myself doing anything else. I work in an emergency room and I love all the action, it’s like watching a crazy movie all day. I get to interact with lots of people and my fellow coworkers. Quite a few of my nurse friends are also ESFPs so that makes for fun shifts. I recommend nursing to people all the time because there are so many different types of nurses! You could be an elementary school nurse, a flight nurse, a medical floor nurse, a travel nurse, or even a sales nurse who teaches. Literally the opportunities are endless AND you make great money.  There are always shortages of nurses so you always have the chance to job hop if you hate the one you’re in.  A perk for an ESFP is that if you work for the state you’ll get a pension so then you don’t have to do all that long term planning for retirement, it’s win win!"
24,esfp,"Omg I can freaking RELATE.
I am a coder. I sit 9h a day at a desk in a very small office, where my job involved immense focus, lack of social interaction, constant planning, and abstract ideas/concepts.
​
I am totally lost career wise once I realised I chose the whole freaking wrong path in life. Still young so I can change, but I am kind of paralyzed by a lack of certainty on anything. Such a shitty feeling!"
25,esfp,"Ugggggh   I hear this.  I went through something similar. It took me until almost my 30's to find a job I was excited about and could stick with.
I felt that all the ""real"" professional jobs had too much responsibility and were too high level and abstract for my Se brain to be equipped to handle. Waaay over my head.   Or the other end of the job spectrum where it was mundane clerical work which intellectually I could do but my soul would die.  So because of my lack of direction combined with love of people, I kind of defaulted into low paying-barely-above-minimum wage customer service jobs for YEARS.  
I eventually found my way into the airline industry and I love it.  I am still customer service facing but it is faster paced and  incredibly challenging at times but in a hands-on figure out a solution in the moment kind of way which works for me.  It still isn't the most lucrative career but for me the value is in the life experiences it allows me to have.  Yes shift work is hard, but it also means your schedule is completely flexible and you are not locked into a 9-5.  You are feeling bored, need a break or adventure?  Trade your last few shifts this week and head to Mexico for a few days!  No problem.   Once I was there for a few years and was feeling a little stagnant professionally, I moved into a teaching role at the airport as well.  I've always loved teaching and somehow just ended up taking on the role of training  wherever I worked anyway, but being an actual teacher at a elementary or high school felt way too structured and demanding. So it works great for me on all levels right now.
Not to say I will in this industry forever, but for now it checks all my boxes.  You just need to find your version of this!   Challenging in the right ways, hands-on, work with a big team of people by your side and FLEXIBLE!  Work need not be a prison
Good luck on your job search :D"
26,esfp,"I don’t have a job yet, but I’d like a job that’s flexible and allows me to talk to people and sit my butt on discord too haha, and have a lot of nice co-workers that I eat chick-fil-a with every Friday and have fun outings with lol!"
27,esfp,"Don't really have a job yet, but I'm finishing up school for commercial photography! I'm entirely focused on portraiture (big surprise) but haaate having to setup and organize so much stuff for shoots. I actually plan on working in portrait retouching for a bit simply because I need the money and it's much more stable and I also don't have to worry about much discrimination thru my gender transition. I find portrait retouching great because every photo is different, and I'm very involved with at least a face 😂 I want to work more with lifestyle photography and fashion though, I love the more candid nature and reality in it. Product photography makes me want to DIE I'm actually great at it but hate it so much. I want to be talking with someone and creating a photo based on their emotions and what they're acting out. My biggest problem is I just don't do good at organizing and setting things up"
28,esfp,"I hate my office job, not because of the people or the processes, but just because I'm stuck in the office in the first place. What I really wanted to be is a fireman. Or a stunt double. Or a film director. Or, if I knew then what I know now, I'd have invested more in sport as a kid, and would become a sport instructor. Say, gym and snowboard instructor."
29,esfp,"I strongly disagree with nursing and customer service, function wise it's terrible for an ESFP(if it works for you then by all means continue). Sounds a lot more like careers suitable for SFJs
The best careers for us would be in business, sales, entertainment, personal instructor jobs, diplomacy, interpreting. Just picture your dream job and put in the work to get it. Easier said that done, but that's pretty much the only right way to do it. Also try not to put too much pressure on yourself about it, just choose what feels right and stick with it"
30,esfp,"I worked in what was basically a factory, packing food trolleys for airplanes. It was extremely repetitive, like how I would describe an office job, there were no customer interactions and we weren’t really allowed to talk too each other much. It drained me and I would frequently cry before work or have anxiety attacks in case my job called. It was an on-call job, so I had to be available to work immediately or the day after. It developed into serious anxiety, especially after an incident at work, so one day I just stopped picking up the phone. 
It took me over a year to finally be somewhat ready to apply for jobs again, so now I am hoping for a cashier job at a grocery store near me, where I can interact with as many people as possible, feel helpful and productive, and most importantly just be happy. 
My “long term” plan/goal is to get an education as a pharmacy technician so I can work at a pharmacy, which honestly sounds like a dream job for me!"
31,esfp,"I agree with those saying nurse and sales rep. Both are reputable jobs that work with strong personalities and confidence. Nursing school was something I tried and realized I didn’t want to clean up poop though so... anyways, I work in the ER as a Medication Reconciliation Tech. I go in, ask about what’s meds they take, type it all in, and I’m done. It’s similar to what a nurse does in the sense that I go into a patients room and talk to them about their medications, but it has none of the negative parts of cleaning up or breaking your back, which is nice. "
32,esfp,I came here to say this! I love love love being an Rn as an ESFP. I work at a wellness center/med spa and my job consists of talking to people all day to help them tweak their diets/how hormones work/meaning of blood work. Basically teaching individuals who care immensely about their health (we get that population because it is a holistic medical center) how to be optimal in their lives. Plus I get perks at the spa. Seriously dream job status. 
33,esfp,"Similar, except I'm 31, which is not young in career years, and I don't have specific skills, so I would have to start completely from scratch, and I am barely making it financially, so I don't have the resources to pick up something else, where I would have to pay for a course. I'm sort of terrified that I will be stuck in a job where I will be dead inside for life."
34,esfp,"I am personally kind of thinking to go back to sales. I didn't enjoy it much when it was more phone based, but I could enjoy it in person.
Do you genuinely care for what you sell? I find it is very hard to fake it if I don't genuinely love the product/service."
35,esfp,Sales here too - it makes a lot of sense for ESFPs. Reading people and making the experience memorable is really the core of good salesmanship and that’s just our way of life! I work for a home builder. 
36,esfp,"31 isn't old at all. Why not study to be a sport instructor or any of the other things you've mentioned? Changing your lifestyle around like that might be challenging in the beginning, but I guarantee you it will be worth it 10 fold"
37,esfp,"Funnily enough I could happily go to work on sure rather than remotely. The thing I enjoy most about it is the knowledge sharing, brainstorming and teamwork so I'd probably lose the last few pros by going remote (before I was ready), but flexibility is pretty important to me too. "
38,esfp,"Relax. Just trying to help by inputting my own experience. 
I did speak for myself.  I said ""my"" and ""I."" As in, referring to myself.  And I never said I was stupid. I can do a lot of things, but I know myself and that style is not one of them.
  I purposefully did not speak for everyone or all ESFPs as even if someone shares the same general type, everyone is different. "
39,esfp,"I can't explicitly fake it, but I've learned how to turn it in my favor. My face is easy to read as well so I just take advantage of it. And I like some of my product - but I fully enjoy the industry I sell in so that makes up for it. "
40,esfp,"This is actually my job working in IT. I speak with a lot of developers and project managers on a daily basis. Fortunately my environment has a lot of young people so I made a close knit group of 10 people and we chill on the regular! Not saying that you should go in IT but the environment is what you make of it. :D
Edit: We eat lunch every day lol."
41,esfp,"Mostly, because I don't have the resources right now. I spend 9-10 hours at work every day, then dedicate my free time to playing American football, which is a passion of mine. I'm soon to retire, but coach suggested to train me up, to eventually replace him, so I might get into coaching and try it for size. It's a hobby league, that doesn't pay, but at the same time, I wouldn't have to pay to get the coaching experience. Other than time, finances are a major issue. I keep telling myself, one day I will pick something and go after it. But I'm pretty undecided."
42,esfp,"Fair enough, but you did say ""my Se brain"" instead of just ""my"" brain. I'm offended because saying things like this further promotes negative stereotypes about our type, aside from Se having nothing to do with it"
43,esfp,"I'm actually planning to go into it! Haha. I'm an INFP though. I worry sometimes that I'll be surrounded by INTJs and INTPs who don't socialize, so it's cool to see that there are some SFs and NFs doing it. :)"
44,esfp,"Also fair. I get the negative stereotype, there's a lot of S hate and I can see how the wording may be judged. I put Se as for me this is what I relate to the most. It is my biggest strength and my biggest weakness (as is the way with most things)and coupled with my other traits it makes for a very specific skill set.  I just wanted to have an example of knowing your strengths and how to make them work for you. And at the end of the day, I'm not here to prove anyone wrong or right. I'm just putting forth my own experience hoping that someone may find it helpful. "
45,esfp,"I just have one question. Is it normal for you to feel introverted in public places? Then extraverted to family and friends? In public it's not to the point where I straight up avoid people, I just prefer being loud and annoying to my friends only, you feel me?"
46,esfp,"Cognitive extroversion isn't social extroversion. You can be an ESFP, and still be quite private, and like your time alone. It's more that your primary focus is to the outside world, and affecting it, as opposed to primary focus on introspection. Outside world does not necessarily mean people. Or conversation.
I am an ESFP, but don't like a lot of social situation, and mostly do the 'extroverted' stuff with people I consider 'my' people."
47,esfp,"Yee I feel you. It’s called being an Ambivert. A balance between introvert and extrovert. I used to be pretty loud in public places when I was younger but now that I’m older I’m only loud with certain friends or family. 
Every once in a while I get anti social and don’t want to talk to anyone and lock myself in my room but after like half a day I have to leave to go socialize because I get bored being alone hahaha idk man. "
48,esfp,"You mean you're reserved in a situation where you don't know anyone? Most people would be ""introverted"" in that scenario, especially if everyone around you is with someone they know. But I don't really feel introverted in public, I can easily ask people for directions or make small talk(although as a teenager I was more anxious and shy). At the same time I don't actively look for social interactions with strangers and don't really like a lot of group activities that most people enjoy. 
Being loud by yourself in public would be pretty weird lol but with friends I can be obnoxious in both public and private
Anyway, what you're saying sounds pretty ESFP to me"
49,esfp,"Well, like a true ESFP I’m a social butterfly so I generally get along with everybody. However, INTJs can be pretty emotionless and arrogant which are quick ways to put you on my nope list. I’m patient enough to withstand being around INTJs but dear god I can’t imagine dating one. I’m sure it goes both ways too though, they probably can’t stand us!  "
50,esfp,"I love INTJs! I married one! Ok, he's a little boring and never plans any surprises for me but I make my own fun with our kiddo (Getting a second one soon!) He needs 4h of ""downtime"" everyday to ""reset"", which I think is ridiculous, but he tries hard as a dad, eats my cooking sometimes, and gives me hugs most times I ask.
I will (and have!) left him because post-partum he got stressed and didn't give me enough love or time for 1.5 years and prioritized his job. He's stubborn and didn't listen to me. So I left. 
I would do it again. We lived apart for 6 mo and shared time with kid before I moved back into his place again and things have been great since. We're better as a team.
I like him cause he's smart, good looking, funny, good with tech, and can beat me in video games. He probably likes me cause I'm more fun and pretty. I appreciate that I can be artsy, creative, spontaneous and he'll go with most of my shot calls on fun stuff :) He's introverted so I don't have to do his boring computer stuff. It's a win-win from my perspective.
A lot of what I've said I say the word ""most"" maybe even ""some"" of the time. It's because he never lets me make decisions for him. Is that an INTJ thing? It's actually good that way, I know my decisions are spontaneous so he's like my sanity check. Unchecked, and dude, I make some stupid decisions. I need that guy in my life. Don't tell him I told you tho."
51,esfp,"I love INTJs! They are among my favourite types. I look up to them because they can help me aspire my Ni and they are generally very willing to do so. For some reason, I don’t experience the same thing from INFJs. I think Ni Te just works better for me than Ni Fe. 
Could be biased though, since I am close to many INTJs. "
52,esfp,"One of my best friends is an INTJ and I always wonder why he likes me. He hates so many things, many of which I feel like I embody, but for some unspoken reason I made the cut. We can talk for hours about anything and everything and it’s so organic."
53,esfp,"Congratulations on your baby! :) I'm an INTJ and I hate having decisions made for me. That's actually one of the things I really dislike about the ESFP that I know. Everyone is different, but I definitely think that's a common INTJ thing."
54,esfp,"The simple easy solutions. 
INTJ's over-analyze problems, then peruse their ultimate complicated solution. We will pursue a quick and easy solution with no regard of what will happen. Most of the time, the quick and easy solution worked, and there are no problems.
Here is an example. Say we want to jump over a wall. The INTJ will check to see what is on the other side of the wall before jumping. The ESFP just dives over and figures out what is on the other side of the wall while flying face first into it. Most of the time, there is nothing on the other side."
55,esfp,"I don't know you personally, so this could be wrong... but a lot of INTJs I know have a problem reading social cues.  
I sent a funny video to a friend of a girl hitting on a Dutch guy and when we were discussing it later, it turned out that he didn't get the punchline.  He thought I sent it to him to show how nice Dutch guys are.  Once I walked him through it, he could understand the humor behind the video but he totally missed it when watching it on his own."
56,esfp,"At the time, I took the ""fire is hot, avoid throwing gasoline"" approach to conflicts like this, due to a great many beatdowns from similar events.  I've become much stronger since then and have learned to better phrase things when asking questions.  My foot still fits quite well in my mouth, however, and no doubt it will continue to do so.  It's what follows that counts."
57,esfp,"I've always felt self-conscious. Then I remember that I'm weird, and if people are going to talk about me (or my paranoia says they do) then I might as well give them something good to talk about.
-continues to dance to beat while unloading packages at work-"
58,esfp,"This. 
I remember always being told I did things weird or different, and eventually it made me really consider my actions before I do them. I probably won't change what I'm going to do, but I definitely think about people's perception of me a lot."
59,esfp,"Is this a question from another ESFP? Or is this a question from a different classification looking for advice from an ESFP?
If it's the former then I don't think you're actually an ESFP if you find it difficult to talk to people. It's one of the key attributes ESFP
If it's the latter then the best advice i can tell you is don't be scared to start a convo. What helps me a lot is that I generally keep a shallow knowledge on a very broad list of topics so that no matter who i talk to I can have something in common with them to keep the conversation alive. It's an inch deep and mile wide type of situation. I can talk about everything from working on a car and sports to fashion trends and music preferences. I don't find it taxing at all because I really enjoy talking to people. "
60,esfp,"Take a genuine interest in your conversations. Most people love to talk about themselves and what they are into. Do your best to relate to what they are talking about and share your input. If they are talking about something you don't really know about or don't have an innate interest in, use the conversation as a learning experience."
61,esfp,"I started off by just 'pretending' to be confident. I told myself that if people didn't know I was nervous it wouldn't matter, and it was worth just putting myself out there.
Not for everyone, and don't mistake my advice for telling you to be someone else. Be yourself, but just assume everyone likes you!"
62,esfp,"My advice is truly stop caring what other people think of you and take an interest in yourself for once.  Are you okay with you?  You shouldn't care what others think of you, only what you think of you without the influence of others matters.  
Tl;Dr-Don't give a fuck about people's opinions.
Being social is like finding a plate of thousands of different types of cookies and taking a taste of each one and deciding which ones you like the most and would eat every day, deciding which ones you're okay with and could give or take, and finding those few that you really hate and want to burn with a flamethrower.
Tl;Dr-It's like food
When i talk to people in real life I basically just say whatever comes to my mind.  Like it could be my weirdest thought ever and the only person I have around me that is available for conversation is a gorgeous girl whose name I don't even know yet (notice i say YET which is how I think of new people is that i have YET to meet them but I will eventually) and I could turn to her and say ""Have you ever just thought what would happen if you glued your butt to a chair and had to walk to the hospital or call an ambulance for it?"" (this is not my weirdest thought but it was a thought that distracted me while I typed this).
Tl;Dr-Don't worry about what other people's reactions may be to your random topics of conversation."
63,esfp,"I have an ESFP friend who is definitely extroverted but is very shy. Extroversion and introversion do not refer to social skills, it refers to how much of a kick you get (or don't get) from social interactions. So it could be possible  that an ESFP has poor social skills."
64,esfp,"I'm an INFP. 
I know it's one of the key attributes so I came to talk to a personality type that is good at it.
I can do that too with music. If I listen to enough music from enough different genres that should give me something to talk about. 
That's a good idea to keep shallow knowledge on a lot of topics.
It's just that for some reason I get nervous when I talk to people. Not so much online but in public. 
Thanks for the advice."
65,esfp,"Assume everyone likes me...
That'll be sort of hard 
I'll just try not to assume that they don't dislike me.
Or are somewhat indifferent.
It actually makes me less nervous to think that the majority just don't care so I'll go with that. 
It's kind of evident when I'm nervous though. 
So I can tell myself I don't look nervous but that would be a lie.
ha anyhow no matter. 
Regardless I'm going to have to learn to talk in public eventually.
Thanks for the advice. (I'm just difficult) "
66,esfp,"I would've chosen different examples, but these are all very much in line with being an Se dom. If it makes you react in such a strong way then you're probably mistyped, judging off the posts I've seen you make I'm pretty sure you're an ENFJ"
67,esfp,"This is what healthy ESFPs are like in socionics. I know right? But if you read the socionics Se description it's pretty accurate. 
I thought it was fucked at first too. To this day I still don't know why Se devolved into this barbaric garbage during the transition to socionics, lmao. I'm sure this is intended to be separate from MBTI though, myers-briggs ESFPs who have their mental sanity in tact are not like this."
68,esfp,"Hey, PuttingitaIIoutthere, just a quick heads-up:
seperate is actually spelled separate. You can remember it by -par- in the middle.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
69,esfp,"Well, comparing this video (which includes an evil king treating an innocent women like trash, a guy screaming in the microphone, muscular dudes threatening each other, and in general people cussing into the camera), to the ESFP personality type descriptions, you can see that there is a massive difference.
I'm not saying online MBTI descriptions are scripture, but they aren't completely inaccurate. ESFPs, as I have read and come to know throughout my research in MBTI, are not forceful, threatening, authoritarian and power-hungry sith lords. The ESFP personality type I have come to relate to and associate myself with is absolutely the opposite of this video. 
Keeping this in mind, as I read about Se in socionics, it makes me want to puke. Ngl.
And on top of that, people are now agreeing that ESFPs like taking charge, being aggressive, and exercising power. Keep in mind that my absolute distaste for manipulation and imposing will on others has stayed the same throughout all of this. 
I guess I shouldn't have stated that the description itself is barbaric garbage as a fact, and instead clarified that it was just my opinion. Either way, I really disagree with this perception of ESFPs and I'm glad to find that I'm not the only one. Then again, I'm still learning and if this is what ESFPs are really like, I guess I'm going to have to accept that, but I'm still shocked nonetheless.  "
70,esfp,"This is the 16p description, which is absolutely terrible. The things you quoted from there specifically are the worst part about it, because they make ESFPs sound like ESFJs and ENFPs. Obviously I have nothing against these types, but that's like telling INTPs that they are sports-loving social butterflies, who hate video games. As far as I know 16p is exclusively based around dichotomies and the Big 5, so the ""ESFPs"" they describe will be very different from the SeFiTeNi ESFPs
Then I'd recommend doing a bit more research on what dominant Se, especially in combination with tertiary Te, really is. We aren't really authoritarian and we don't have to be threatening most of the time, but the rest of this is very much true. As I've mentioned before, ESFP is among the leading types, but unlike fellow Se doms ESTPs, we are more diplomatic
Again, a very typical ENFP trait. That is one of the most telling differences between ESFPs and ENFPs, we usually want to be in control and have the leading position(unless it restricts our freedom in a big way), while ENFPs are not power driven and don't like feeling superior to anyone
I'm not a big fan of this montage either, but the things you are criticizing are all ESFP traits"
71,esfp,"Feeling superior to people makes me feel sick, and I hate leading so much. I'd rather be sitting amongst the people eating potato chips and making dumb comments, not commanding. Well, if those are ESFP traits, I guess I need to question things more. I just would have never thought ESFP would be like this"
72,esfp,"my boyfriend and I are kind of homebodies so this may not work for others but we text almost all day, start & watch shows together (probably our second fav activity), video game together, have a lot of sex and often do mundane things together like homework or laundry or cooking. These are the things that excite us or rather keep things interesting. "
73,esfp,"An ESFP girl lead me on a lot, and then just ghosted me. I do find this totally disrespectful and I cant possibly understand what kind of person would do this?( please don't feel attacked I know most ESFPs aren't like this at all) chances are she is still very immature.I tried not to push it,  waited about a week before trying contact again, didnt work. should I try to contact her in some time, and maybe bluntly state what I think, or just act like nothing has happened and be friendly? or most probably just let her go. 
I know I wont get closure, so maybe you guys can help me understand what could have happened and give me your opinions on what she did, and if you have ever done something similar, why you did it? 
let me know if you want any more detail on the situation. love yall"
74,esfp,"Dunno what was going through her mind, but as a male I hate when people try to ""play it cool"" and would prefer for you to say directly how you feel. Honestly, it doesn't seem like she's interested in a real relationship, so if I were you I'd just probably ask her what's going on and if she doesn't reply then just try to move on
Personally, I never behave this way. If you're really someone I like and value as a person I wouldn't play you like that and if I don't really care about you then I won't give you any false hopes. I hate being ignored, especially in a situation where you're showing emotional vulnerability"
75,esfp,"Leading on is a very pregnant statement. What do you mean by that? What was it she said or did?
​
It can be a lot of things. It could be how you acted. Or it could not. It could be that she was interested, but not enough to go all in, and she got cold feet, which happens. And anxiety. The only reason I haven't ghosted some people is the level of maturity, and being able to put myself in the other person's shoes. Say, there was this really lovely guy last year, that we started something with, and even though he was amazing, I had a lot of baggage at the time (which he knew), and on top of that, I just didn't feel the spark, and for me, that's it. That's not something you can force or develops over time. What happened to me is I had severe anxiety when I thought about how I'd break it to him that I don't want to continue, because he was truly lovely, and nothing was wrong with him, and I didn't have a tangible reason to call it off, and I knew he was really into me, and also got his soul crushed by an ex. I really didn't want to add to that problem. And I didn't want to make him feel any less. So, initially, I just didn't make time to meet up, telling myself that I'll face this head-on, but always deciding that not now. However, I'm an adult, and I know that it's worse not to know what's happening, so eventually, I grew a pair, and formulated what's on my mind, and said clearly where I'm at. It was tough. It was really hard for me to say, and definitely hard for him to hear.
Often, ghosting is just the result of anxiety of the person who wants an out, but doesn't have the courage to say so, and doesn't want to 'hurt' the other person. It always ends up hurting more if you're ghosted, but it's the result of a lack of decision, whereas facing it fair and square takes courage and accountability, and that's extremely hard.
​
Idk how old you are, but just think on it - have you ever been in a relationship, where you got in it, because you were really into that person, and then over time, months or years, you realize, that you just don't love them anymore, and don't want to be with them. But at the same time, don't think they're bad, or have done something wrong, it just fizzled out. Did you sit the partner down as soon as you realized, and told them in the face something along the lines of it's not you, it's me? Or did it take you a long long time, sometimes months or years, just telling yourself you'll do it, and then putting it off until some other time, just hoping the person screws up, so you can blame it on them, but they don't?"
76,esfp,"I totally get your point of view, it literally just happened to me, I talked to this girl on the bus, and asked her on a date out of the energy of the moment but getting back home I realized I don't actually want to, and now I don't know what to do. 
But I'll probably follow through, you know give her a chance, which is what I wish this ESFP girl would give me, I know we hit it off and we can get there again.
The leading on thing was she said she couldn't wait to start dating and she wanted to go to Disneyland and felt lonely without me, wanted me to make good memories with her..."
77,esfp,"okay here we go story time!
I met her at the gym and she gave me this ""I want you"" smile, so I did, we hit it off so well and after that we couldnt stop texting, which almost never hapens to me evryone always responds hours later to every text, but she didnt, we met for some coffee some days later, all so awesome and I told her I wanted to take her on a date.
As the day approached her contact became more spaced out and when the day of the date came she cancelled cause she was sick, but after she got better we met another time and the vibe was great, the next day I was going home for christmas and the first week she talked to me all the time, drunk texted and all she told me how much she wanted to see me and missed me, the next day she send a ""Im off to work now"", like she had been doing I told her to be safe and all, that was the last time we properly talked.
She answered days later after I had already doubled texted, which is a bad sign, we had a couple of texts shared and then again she didnt answer for days, then she send a happy new year, and I try to answer with a quirky""Hope one of your goals is to finally try my food"", cause we had agreed on that would be the thing we would do after I got back.
No answer, ever, then I doubled texted her about the coffee I was bringing her back from home(something she told me she really wanted), but just about the same time she posted on insta that her line account got deleted, so I asked her for her knew account so that I could add her to a line group we had with some friends of the gym, and she sent it, but without any ""oh yeah thank you"" or anything, just a simple screenshot, then she accepted the request, I said something in the group, but nobody answers in there anyway.
And I tried sending her a similar text about the coffee since I assume she didnt get the previous one, but she still decided to ignore it.
and thats how the situation stands, its been since new year's eve that I've gotten any proper communication form her and even wha tshe sent was a simple bland happy new year with no soul put into it"
78,esfp,"Want my guess?
She found you, or finds you attractive, and enjoys the conversations. But, she's either decided that she's not that into you, or simply got cold feet, or some personal baggage reemerged, and she doesn't want to continue down the same front with you. Doesn't know how to tell you, probably because it's more to do with her than you, and doesn't want to hurt you. She probably won't initiate, hoping you get the hint and drop it.
However, if you want, you can private text her something along the lines of, Hey, I thought we hit it of nicely, but I've noticed things have slowed down and you don't seem comfortable. Is everything okay? I'm into you, and if you're interested, I'd want to explore where we go. But if you don't want to, that's fine. Just let me know so I know where I'm at.
And mean it. If she says she doesn't want to go on, say, thanks for letting me know, and drop it."
79,esfp,"Absolutely easily. You meet someone, and there is chemistry, but you enter relationships, or start dating on blind faith, that it will work, and that you will connect on all levels. You don't know each other long enough to know everything about each other, and to know that you connect on a deep level. So, she got into you based on chemistry, that was there, but some of the other things didn't match up.
That's what happens as you get to know someone. You either find out they're compatible, or you don't. It's a 'let's figure it as we go' kind of situation, which is the natural way of doing relationships.
​
If I had to make sure I'm absolutely committed before I even wink at someone, I would still be a virgin and would have never known love at 31, because you just can't know that early on. You can see some potential, but that either translates, or it doesn't."
80,esfp,"I can't speak for everybody, but it's a weird combo of personal values and anxiety. An I don't want to hurt you and the fear of breaking it to you, which results in ghosting. Which is worse. It takes a lot of courage to turn someone down respectfully."
81,esfp,"She answered
""I'm sorry I haven't texted you back, I've been so busy with work I haven been looking at my phone.
I also like you as an amazing friend.
I'm sorry... I was really busy and couldn't do anything else. I'm so sorry if I offended you""
So, yeah, frienzone, I don't like to use that word but... Yeah, what do you think? "
82,esfp,"I'm with OP though, it's hard for me personally to have those feelings change so quickly. I'm also an ENFP and change my mind very quickly (much more quickly than some others), but definitely not when I'm really really into a person. It will take longer for me to not interested in someone I feel a lot of chemistry with. I think that's a huge way in which ESFPs and ENFPs differ. Also, as I get older, I'm a lot more self aware whether I'm actually interested in someone or not and so my flirtation level is now very directly correlated with how interested I am. I've been much less likely to be accused of leading someone on because of that. Wonder if it's the same as ESFPs mature. "
83,esfp,"This is true I think. I’m an ESFP female and this is kind of what’s been happening with me. It takes me real effort to keep talking with someone when that ‘moment’ (however long that moment takes) is over. And I’m waiting till I feel that again, which can happen if they don’t flood me and just let me be. I don’t want to text saying ‘hey, this isn’t working anymore’ because that’s not how I feel it.  
But too be honest, I’ve only ever had that with people whom I have some form of doubts about. So if I 100% fully like someone... that ain’t happening. 
Hope this helps? "
84,esfp,"I don't think there's a timeline. Brace yourself, and when you're ready for the answer whatever it may be, send it. It's only key that you understand that there are other answers than the one you want, and you must be in a place of mind to be able to accept it."
85,esfp,"I think you have your reply. She values your friendship, but doesn't mean to move it into a different level, even if she initially thought she would. Seems like a constructive, fair response.
So, you can make decisions on what you want and don't want do based on the information there. If you value her friendship, then you have a friend. If you wanted it to be something more, and would only use the friendship to see if it can get there, I suggest you do that."
86,esfp,"I see a huge difference between chemistry and intrigue, and between love. Chemistry is mostly physical, and can be immediate. Intrigue is early on, when the person is interesting, and you want to know more. This is typically where ESFPs might get with someone and wing it. But that in itself is not commitment, and not love. Chemistry is a prerequisite for a relationship, but in no way is it the sole criterion. Say, you find someone hot. They seem nice. You hit it off. But you quickly figure out that they have a different dynamic to you, and that the flow seems to not benefit you, and that they don't have the same values, or that there is little overlap in interests, and you're reduced to small talk, which you are initially invested in, because you hope to unearth the common denominator, but you just don't. Which is really disappointing and stressful.
I'm an ESFP, and I don't avoid dating altogether. Because so many people are way too fragile, and don't claim ownership of their own well-being. That's too much responsibility to place on me. I'm fine with being honest and straightforward, but if a partner, especially a new one, bases their happiness on my compliance, then it's a horrible feeling. Truly, deeply horrible. Because I want out. And I don't know how to do it without hurting the other person. Which then means, that whatever I do, it seems to be wrong either for me, or the other person. And sorry, I won't be intentionally heartless, but I put myself first.
Hence, why I only date Gammas. They're reasonable, and have the same approach to relationships as me, so it's easy and natural to navigate. That said, it's not that I exclude people from dating based on their type, but in the last million years, when I was actually attracted to a person enough to give it a go, they always turn out to be Gamma."
87,esfp,"It hurts a lot when it happens though, especially if this isn't communicated (which of course, it wouldn't be if you don't know them that well). Especially because ESFPs are so forward when they like someone, that person usually thinks that they really, really like you. Other types tend to be more reserved until they grow to really like someone so it's a little easier to gauge how the they feel. "
88,esfp,I agree with this 100 as an ESFP it's just hard keeping in contact when you aren't there with the person. Like the conversation never flows as well and it isn't as real. I don't feel anything when I'm texting but being in the same place as a person and having the ability to see them and have a shared experience is the only thing that will ever seem 'real'. I do it all the time and I  feel really bad but I don't want to endure a boring text convo with you but its like if you were in the room it would be a different story
89,esfp,"I answered ""got it, thanks for letting me know"" 
I do think I want to leave it up to her now if she really wants to be my friend. 
because I would like to keep her in my life, but I feel like I already invested too much into her. 
which is completely my fault, I know. 
I just feel I need to focus on something else for now. "
90,esfp,"That’s fair. And interesting - thanks for sharing! I think maybe because of my tendency to see the bigger picture, I can tell pretty quickly right off the bat if I’m going to like someone for a long time or not. I’m usually right. I think ESFPs and ENFPs are very similar in that we can be very deeply affected by someone else’s emotions. It’s stressful for me too to be around someone who is in a bad place, because I can’t ignore it. But I do try to face those things head on by being as a caring as possible, even if I have to break up with them. I’ll do whatever it takes to ease the transition - whether it’s sitting and talking with them for a while, reassuring them that they didn’t do anything wrong, etc. I care deeply about others and want to do as much as I can to help them. Wonder if it’s the same for ESFPs or if that’s something you don’t have patience for. 
What’s a Gamma?"
91,esfp,"Some do, some don’t🤷🏼‍♀️ Depends on the level of attraction and what the other wants out of it, and how they themselves cope with stuff like this. 
I have friends with whom this happens as well, and they know and accept it. 
If this kind of behaviour isn’t something you are comfortable with, I’d suggest letting them know that without judgement. And then let it go, because that kind of behaviour probably won’t change. 
Edit: And to add: sometimes life happens. I’ve had it happen that major changes happen and upend almost everything in my life or major parts of it. And then I am so focused on those, my brain has no space for other interactions. And then it’s a couple of weeks later... and I’m like.. oh sh*t! "
92,esfp,"Can understand that completely, which is why I personally try to be upfront about the possibility of that happening. Scares some away, others don’t believe me and there are a few who can accept and/or roll with it. 
But not every ESFP knows this behaviour as being typical (and not every ESFP has this of course!), or can’t be that open about it. 
On the flip side of the coin, because I get really enthusiastic with people I like, men often think I like them waaay more than I do. This leads to painful, violent and/or awkward situations. But I am not able to reel in that behaviour because then I would no longer feel like myself. Men don’t understand why I want to cut off any dating that was happening because they can’t correlate the way I acted with what I have decided. So... ghosting then occurs. 
To clarify: what I wrote above isn’t true all the time and/or for any other ESFP’s of course, but I thought I might give you some insight into my mind and it’s workings. "
93,esfp,"Do you know about cognitive functions? I'm borrowing the term from a different taxonomy. Socionics separates the types into four groups. Each group values the same cognitive functions, but in a different order.
Alpha - ENTP, INTP, ISFJ, ESFJ
Beta - ESTP, ISTP, INFJ, ENFJ
Gamma - ESFP, ISFP, INTJ, ENTJ
Delta - ENFP, INFP, ISTJ, ESTJ
Although even within a group (a Quadra), the types are different, and prioritize different cognition, they still value the same four functions. This means that there are certain commonalities in the group, even if the functions are in the opposite order. Gamma is the most individualistic of the lot, and tends to have a business attitude even to relationships. That doesn't mean that they can't truly love, but rather, that them falling in love will be based on things that can be related to business - what value can I offer? What value does the person have for me? Is there return on invest? Although falling in love is emotional, the components will be similar to deciding entering a business.
Hence, why it's easy for me to date within my Quadra. We see eye to eye. We have similar cognitive values (even though personal ones aren't dependent on typology), and we have similar focus, and need to address the same things. And we value directness and bluntness. So, if I start dating, I will first give a set of paradigms that are important to me, and a set of variables that the other person needs to count on. It sounds awkward, but other Gammas appreciate it.
To others, Gammas seem cynical. We don't feel that way about ourselves, but are perceived as such by others. We look at what is right now, and what will be in the future, and focus on individualism and efficiency.
Quadras that value Si and Ne (Alpha + Delta) are more sentimental and idealistic.
Quadras that value Fe (Alpha + Beta) aren't individualistic in the sense that social norms/dynamics and harmony matter to them (even if they go against the grain, the focus is such)."
94,esfp,"Ha, as an ENFP, I relate. I’ve always been used to being the person who is less interested or who changes her mind, but ESFPs give me a run for my money....Thanks for your insight, very much appreciated and interesting!"
95,esfp,"Your narrative aligns so closely with my mo. I’m newly single at 33 after ten years of marriage and had just assumed I’m not great at dating. A frustrating component for me has been that when I have tried to be open and honest about not wanting to continue, they sometimes make arguments about the way that my strong, early interest made them feel. Like I’ve introduced this emotion and they want to try to discredit my expression of disinterest because how could that possibly be the case when I made them feel so seen and known and good before??"
96,esfp,"I do but I’ve never heard of these groupings before. Thanks! Although I think it’s only one way of looking at compatibility. ISFPs often run into similar issues with ESFPs being unwilling to commit, and I know a lot of INTJs in real life who end up with ISFJs, surprisingly. Also, ENFPs seem to hit it off with ENTJs from my own personal experience and observations. And my closest friend, a verified ENTJ, is even more of a romantic than me. She always wants her relationships to turn out like they do in the movies and fortunately she has a great partner right now (I think an ISTP). But I will keep this in mind, thanks for sharing. "
97,esfp,"Conpletely and exactly that! I’m newly single at 31 after two back to back relationships which started when I was 17. 
I can understand it can be confusing for others. But for me there is no other way. I am completely going for someone, I am seeing that person and I am having a great time. So that means I am enthusiastic and will give it my all. 
All up until the point something changes or I don’t feel I can give it my all anymore. 
I am not discrediting the other persons confusion or perhaps hurt feelings, but so they shouldn’t discredit mine. 
I have come to the conclusion that I can’t reign in those feelings and don’t want to. I am upfront about it thought to the people I date and I leave it up to them if they want to continue dating. 
If they do not want to, or get unreasonably upset at the end... I know for sure those people were not compatible with me. And that is fine.
Don’t feel frustrated with the dating game! You’re just honing your skills and own intuition."
98,esfp,"honestly, at first, I thought I’m going to delete everything I posted here, coz I wouldnt want to help that dude, but then I changed my mind that thinking  “we” (me and that dude) should talk and share our experiences, because based on what you wrote here, you (or him) appeared to me as a nice person"
99,esfp,"Of course there are other ways. Any one method may have merit, but may be extremely reductionist. Say, according to Socionics theory of relations, the ideal pair are Duals - from the same Quadra, extactly the opposite stacking of valued functions - ESFP-INTJ, ENFP-ISTJ, ENFJ-ISTP.. you get the hint. And from my experience, it does work great, but only at a certain level of maturity, and there is often initial antagonism between this pairing, and they usually only realize the good match after they've had to interact on a one-on-one basis for a bit.
Either way, you could have an ESFP from one cultural background, and an INTJ from another, and in theory, they're a good match, but their values differ too greatly.
Or, you could incorporate Enneagram, and certain pairs work better together than others. Or you could incorporate instinctual variants, and you get that again. You see where I'm going with that ;)
ISTP and ENTJ do quite work from what I have seen. Especially if the ISTP is a dude and ENTJ is the chick.
Personality theory can only take you so far. There are always variables. I've even seen ESFP and INTP pairings, and they're conflictors. Sometimes shared values, interests and experiences can carry you through cognitive incompatibility and bond you well."
100,esfp,"I work with three intjs and today one of them said that she wishes she could just move to Spain and figure things out as she goes. I insisted that she should do it, that it's possible and if she really thinks it will make her happy she should just do it. 
After a good twenty minute conversation/debate the intjs kept trying to tell me I was wrong and that financial security is the smarter priority. I had to just sit back and laugh at how the intjs brought up and agreed that they wish they could do something spontaneously while continuing on with every justification possible as to why spontaneous action isn't warranted.

101,esfp,"Came across this neat website today: www.talentoday.com.
Complete the 10 minute test and a ""personality radar"" with 5 clusters will be generated according to your answers. The clusters are: Communicate, Manage, Dare, Adapt, Excel. They cover the main personality traits that employers seek in individuals. They say it's how you describe yourself.
At the end, there's a part that summarizes your strengths and weaknesses in career professional lingo. I will probably add this to my resume or LinkedIn profile.
Thought some of you may be interested. Share your results if you like. It's free too!
I'll start, here's mine: http://i.imgur.com/xfQRN2T.png"

Something that really surprised me was one of my improvement areas: You would benefit from distancing yourself from the opinions of others to develop your own ideas.
I think this stems from the fact that I'm early into my career and am still absorbing best practices from my peers."
103,esfp,"I don't know where you are in your school or work career, but make sure you pursue a career path that you're passionate about. It's hard to muster up enthusiasm when you're doing something you don't care about. "
104,esfp,"Get in a rhythm, a good habit of work ethics. 
Do the same routine everyday when getting ready for work. As an ESFP it's important we get scene changes throughout the day. Going outside for a smoke break is a good example of this.
Things to remember to be a productive ESFP:
• Have a rhythm set for your day.
• Make time for scene changes. 
• If responsibilities get boring take a break, forcing yourself won't make it any more fun. Find a new way to approach your responsibilities. "
105,esfp,"I'm a 3rd year in college right now, studying a new major called Liberal Arts and Engineering Studies. It's really interesting; its goal is to create extremely well-rounded individuals that can pick and choose from majors both in the engineering and liberal arts fields. So we have people who want to do animation, who choose Computer Graphics and Art/Graphic Design, and sound engineers who study Electronics and Music.
We joke that we're the best of both worlds, like socially-capable engineers or academically-adept liberal arts majors. 
However, this degree imposes a worrying amount of freedom on us, which is where my hesitation starts. You've got to pick just the right niche that's a growing field, pays well, and you love. It's extremely difficult to narrow it down, especially when college students are so young and expected to know exactly what they want to do from the start. The University I'm at is particularly notorious for cementing undergraduates into less-than-optimal major choices that they blindly/unknowingly walked in to.
But I digress. It just feels like I'm running out of time. "
106,esfp,"I did. Everyone thought I was really weird because I was way too hyper (when I say everyone, I mean everyone. My class size was 15 in middle school). They got quite vocal about it, and made me feel terrible for being that way. I'm still ""way to hyper"" to this day, but now that I'm in college, my high energy levels (meaning that when I get excited, I'll run around in circles) seem to be the thing that my friends admire the most about me :p. Lol. They make 19 sound old "

108,esfp,"Lol spamming is actually when you send the same message many times in a row within a period of, lets say, a minute. I didn’t do that so don’t hit me with that inaccuracy. Ur Fi is so triggered it’s funny. "
109,esfp,"Spam - send the same message indiscriminately to (large numbers of recipients) on the Internet.
Time period doesn’t matter. You’ve sent your link 13 times in the past week and that should be enough times to get the message across the majority of people don’t want to join.
Real immature to try attack the person just because your argument was shit. So why don’t ya stop hitting us with that inaccuracy and that spamming "
110,esfp,"No. Spam is considered spam ONLY when its in a short time frame of 1-15 minutes, I haven’t sent it to the same reddit so it doesn’t count, ive only sent it to this Reddit probably twice, three at the most and there were DAYS in between. Ur argument is clearly bad because you can’t even define spam correctly, and clearly because over 40 people are joining my server every day since u posted it the more I post it the more effective it is. So if u got anymore shit to say go on myserver and say it. Because anyone knows that time period is key. If you went on a discord server and posted a message a week that was the same every week, NOBODY WOULD CARE. You are a dumb ESFP- with clearly Fi triggered so go back to ur mother and cry. 
And clearly the majority of people want to join since my posts are getting upvoted daily and people are joining and dming me how thankful they were to have found my server. Fuck off u idiot, your IQ is probably in the retard level"
111,esfp,"Why don’t you take a minute and look up the actual definition of “spam”. Why don’t I help you out 
“to send the same message indiscriminately”
“unsolicited usually commercial messages sent to a large number of recipients or posted in a large number of places”
“: [message] that is not wanted : [message] that is sent to large numbers of people and that consists mostly of advertising”
“irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware, etc.”
Taken from multiple sources, none of which mentioned a time period. Spamming is spamming, whether or not it annoys someone is different. But in this case, it obviously hasn’t taken the best liking.
If 40 people are joining each day, how much you wanna bet are bots? I’d bet a lot. Also I’m not gonna go on your server to say it because all you’re gonna do is spew shit at me and ban me.
Well this hasn’t been a week, you’ve posted your link every few hours. Yet again whether it annoys people is a different story, people have not liked you posting this. 
I’ve never seen a lie more disprovable, why don’t we take a look at your last posts about this:

If you need help doing the math, that’s 27 posts about the same exact thing with a total of approximately 13 points. I could go on as these are only the posts in the past nine days. Clearly people are upvoting this daily right? RIGHT?? Keep telling yourself that. If this isn’t spam, then I don’t know what is.
TLDR; Just stop, you’re being a toxic little child who can’t even use the internet right. "
112,esfp,Definition of spam according to the Oxford dictionary:
113,esfp,"Besides, who says i have to use those definitions from those sources? I am my own source and I can formulate my own understanding of the english language. And NONE of the people who joined were bots. Posting the same message in one reddit 10 min at a time is spam but not when ur doing it in a bunch of Reddit’s. I love that ur giving such inaccurate information. Bias is inevitable and all those websites, and you are biased. "
114,esfp,"Well why do i have so much karma then? If you’ve noticed there are lots of posts with 3 and 4 points. And i do not post my link on the same reddit every few hours. I spread them through all ur Reddit’s. Congratulations, you spent all that time wasting ur own time to try to prove a point that I don’t even care about. Im an INTP- I wouldn’t ban u if u didn’t break rules. You can go on my server right now. You will notice that there were only 12 bots on my server and almost 300 members. So if u don’t have proof don’t give me dumb shit."
115,esfp,"If you weren't so self absorbed then you would notice a lot of your karma came from your posts that WERE NOT when you spammed discord links. If you didn't care about this then why are you still replying and insulting me? I guess you really don't care then, hope you have a nice day ;)"
116,esfp,"Yep i don’t care- but i love that i am wasting ur time when you don’t even have the guts to go on my server and SEE THE PROOF. Insulting you is fun. And besides, of course I’m self absorbed. Every animal has a survival instinct, and we are all inherently selfish- I’m just not afraid to show that off since its the truth. If you didn’t care you would ignore the post and move on. You can choose to ignore the post, block me, whatever, this post is for the people who actually want to see this, which are plenty. If you don’t have proof about who joined my serve you should go on there and see the truth. Everyone there can show u that no bots in the past month have joined the server, and besides, you replying shows you care, and I live off of people who waste their time on me. It’s honestly hilarious to see ur salt. You haven’t even responded to other things with your lousy illogical arguments. I’m having a great day thank you, because you are just proving urself wrong. 
Are you just scared?
If you ain’t scared come on my discord and lets talk, if ur really unafraid to see the truth. I’m nox- the owner find me- inaccurate idiot."
117,esfp,"Well i can assure you, there are plenty of english speaking individuals who do not speak english. And I am happy to stick to my own dictionary ;).
Also- good job wasting ur time. If you think ill stop you are delusional"
118,esfp,"How do these things effect you? When I smoke weed I either become extremely talkative and interested in just about anything... but if i'm too high my inferior Ni kicks in and gets me paranoid about things. Alcohol however makes me more of an ESFP than I already am. Friends constantly ask me to go out or party with them cause they enjoy my presence. Maybe most SP types enjoy the effects of alcohol?
Do either of these things cause you to act drastically different than what I am saying?"
119,esfp,"Weed occasionally makes me anxious in social situations especially around people I don't know very well. However when I'm alone it usually makes me euphoric, more creative and introspective and is therapeutic emotionally. Alcohol makes me more confident and less self conscious. Which, depending on my mood can make me very outgoing with no filter at all or just very content to be inside myself at peace. "
120,esfp,"Weed makes me very sociable and I'll strike up conversations with just about anyone cool around me. Except on the rare occasion I get some bad shit and I wanna curl into a ball. Alcohol just kind of makes me less coordinated and blurry. I never feel like I'm drunk, only that I'm acting drunk. I don't care for it."
121,esfp,I blacked out once and on my way home my friends and I saw a couple gangs engaged in some heated conversation. After we passed them my friends kept walking and I stopped to talk to them. I don't remember what I said but my friends told me that after I was done talking to them they were all hugging and giving each other knucks. Mission accomplished 
122,esfp,"INTP curious about what happens when two ESFPs are in the same room.
One of my buds wants to do a podcast and I was thinking of introducing him to my other ESFP friend in the city to possibly be on the podcast, would it be like a crazy banter back and forth?  Do they generally get along or tend to ratchet things up? One is pretty chill and married and the other is a more upbeat A-type single guy"
123,esfp,"AYYYY ISSA PARTY MAN 9999/10 #partayy #lit 🔥 🎉 🎈 🎊 
It’s super funny because we vibe so hard and well ❤️ it’s stoked! 
And if one of us says something the other doesn’t get initially, we just throw it back and forth until we get it and laugh 😂 all about that good time man :) "
124,esfp,"No we don't start going crazy or even talking a lot. It's just a vibe of mutual understanding, it might be quieter than when we're interacting with most other types, because what's understood doesn't need to be said. Haven't met that many ESFPs, but that's how it goes from my experience. It can also turn into a competition"
125,esfp,"I've had 2 ESFP encounters while being an ESFP myseld. With my female counterpart we are both really just upbeat and hype things out. Definitely never shut up though but it's always fun. As for with the guy, he is a bit immature. I still had a lot of fun with them minus the bits where it felt like lies and trying to one up me constantly but overall not a bad person. Also who am I to judge, maybe his stories were real. Just expect it to be a good time if their ideologies line up."
126,esfp,"That really depends. Do they have stuff in common? Similar values? Interests?
Since I play American football, I'm where it's at, when it comes to ESFPs and ESTPs. I know quite a few. Some are fantastic, and I'm good friends with, and I dated one. ESFPs who don't align with my moral values bug the shit out of me."
127,esfp,"Back when I thought I was an ESFP there was one literally shouting and being really fun in class, but we were like way too off tbh. She didn't seem interested in talking to me or anyone outside her friend group for the matter at all, and I made a fool out of myself trying to get to know her lmao. I think I'm approaching this wrong"
128,esfp,"Get ready for a conversation on lifestyle, and life hacks. ESFPs are practical more than anything, and don't just chit-chat. They exchange relevant information along with personal stories to underline the relevance of the information. It can get annoying for others, because ESFPs are very self-referential, and also very down-to-earth, so they tend to share personal stories, but those stories often have information to be extrapolated and applied in a similar scenario.
You lift too?! Awesome! Just lift, or for a sport?
Oh, I play American football, it's part of my pre-season regimen.
Uh-uh. What's your deadlift?
I've been injured for a while, and just got back to it, but about 120kgs. Trouble is, I tend to overkill, so sometimes I blow out my back.
Yeah, that happened to me too in the beginning. What a friend recommended me is XYZ, and I tried that, and it really helped. So, when I started with that insert funny story, but honestly, it helps. Just make sure you try...
​"
129,esfp,"Haven't found a lot of pages talking about this, so I figured it was high time for me to make one.  
So, recently reevaluating myself after coming off of my SSRIs, I realized the reason I started taking them in the first place; my true and utter hatred of Extraverted Intuition.  
Now, while I think Ne CAN be useful, and don't think it is a function that should be wiped off the face of the planet, I find myself shockingly antagonistic whenever I'm having to deal with it. For instance, when I'm hungry, I HATE it when 15-20 minutes are spent talking about ALL the possible places to eat in the area instead of just picking something that sounds tasty and then going; in other words, when Extraverted Intuition is unregulated by any judging function and allowed to run amok.  
Being an action/fantasy/sci-fi writer, I have been extremely envious of those capable of using Ne to generate fresh, new ideas (rather than doing what I do and recycling old ideas and then changing details so that they seem fresh). When I actively TRY to use Extraverted Intuition to generate a 'new idea', it often comes across as half-baked. However, whenever I go through being moody and insecure, my brain just naturally sets off on an unanchored journey through intuition-land; when this happens, I entirely disassociate and start to exhibit symptoms of Borderline personality disorder, jumping to conclusions, panicking, suddenly feeling like my identity and sense of self is being threatened by all the possibilities, what I COULD be.   
In one online source (forgot the link; sorry!), I read that Demonic Ne in ESxPs tends to manifest as ""confusing possibilities for realities"" or ""jumping to conclusions"". Many, MANY people over the years have accused me of ""jumping to conclusions"", and I myself in recent years have noticed I have a tendency to confuse people's ""might be"" with ""is/will be"", because with sensing there is often an ""is"" and an ""isn't"", and so I don't operate well on ambiguity.  
How about you guys? How does your Demonic Ne manifest?"
130,esfp,"Hey. INFP here. My ESFP cousins best friends are 2 INFPs and an ENFP. And honestly I often get annoyed with the whole question of where to go at because I'm just like ""Who cares? Good food is good food. Let's stop wasting an hour choosing which place to go and let's just go somewhere."" I also get annoyed with people when they can't choose which movie to watch or something. End up spending so much time tryna find which movie to watch we don't have time to watch it. This is all super annoying. 
But you know what? I find INFJs actually have more of this problem than ENxPs. I think it's an inferior Se that causes it and not Dom Ne. Ne usually doesn't care where they get it from, or they are really set on one specific place for some reason. "
131,esfp,"Interesting! I'm an INFP with an ESFP partner and find our Ne-Se goes together well. His brainstorming tends to be more grounded in reality and mine more random - it's good when I have unrealistic ideas and he can do a reality check on them. We both like sitting and chilling and brainstorming ideas for fun. 
There are times when I can relate to you when I ask what we can eat and he's so easygoing he doesn't have a preference. I feel best when he's being a decisive boss and I just follow him around. :) But I see that as separate to MBTI and more of a relationship dynamic thing.
I can't think of any examples where he jumps to conclusions scratches head Usually that's me! I'm the one with demonic Ne 😂"
132,esfp,"I personally think it's mostly a load of bs from a judgemental intuitive lol what are your thoughts?
Extraverted Sensation is the easiest function to understand as it simply coincides with what we observe in the outer reality, usage of the body, force, where objects are located in life and biological factors as well as observation of societal tradition and ancestry.
This type's thinking and feeling are mostly guided by the objective reality in general. They are the most ordinary in society and live life by the standardized rules and regulations. Depending on the subtype, one's ethics (Se-Fi) or ideaologies (Se-Ti) may keep them from going overboard as far as hedonism goes.
Se dominants with Se subtypes are more hedonistic and have less developed auxiliary functions. (A few rappers belong to this type. Ted Bundy may have also belonged to this type and of course was an extreme case.)
Most MBTI blogs don't mention the portion of Se that observes and celebrates ancestral history. However, Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop have brought this up. It is also a huge piece of information because it is why Ni dominants are said to at times worship ancestral figures or believe they are in ""spiritual communication"" with archetypes. (Feeling angels watching over them and etc.)
Se doms are very much interested in biological facts and scientific research based on dissection of plants, animals and etc
Se doms were the majority of western civilization during the time of Jung, Von Franz & Van der Hoop.
[ Inferior Ni ] Se types are often good at writing Science Fiction stories or telling ghost stories for fun. The Sci-Fi movies are mostly based in fantasies that manipulate biology because they are aware they are absurd and have no chance of coming true. (As opposed to the Ni dom who is more likely to believe in things such as ghosts & etc.) Paranormal horror films such as The Grudge, Idle Hands, Pet Semetary& Sci-Fi movies such as Jurassic Park, The Fly and Tarantula are great examples of great extraverted sensing creativity in movies. (This isn't to say they are Se types but Se/Ni has been applied.)
They are the best at knowing how to use force, aggression and the body to reach their goals. This is why they are often said to be amazing athletes.
[ Inferior Ni ] -- During times of stress, they may deviate away from their normal mode of common sense and become paranoid that others are doing things against them
[ Inferior Ni ] -- In stress or considering people they dislike, they made attribute inaccurate intuitions about them
[ Inferior Ni ] -- May suddenly become interested in eastern philosophy , unconventional spirituality or become interested in basic forms of parapsychology such as the ""daily horoscope"" and such. However, they truly don't understand the concepts of such things and leave that to Ni doms.
One of the most efficient and happy-go-lucky types out of them all. They can be happy simply being alive and make the most out of the moment.
They may like a neat and aesthetically pleasing house, dress according to the weather and sometimes like to flex material goods.
[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may have an intense ego if they are unhealthy and accumulate tons of money. They become flashy, extravagant, shallow, and egotistical. (Some rappers belong to this type.)
[ Unhealthy Se ] -- They may expect special treatment due to status and can be classist. They may set certain standards concerning who's ""allowed"" to be seen with them or not based on morals or ideas surrounding materialism. (The women from the movie Jawbreaker and Mean Girls are included in this type.)
Sometimes Se types confuse themselves with feelers because reflexive emotions are sparked with sensations at times and can be intense. ( A woman may get a sudden intense sensation during sex or a man when seeing a woman he is super attracted to.) However, emotional intensity is mostly caused by perceptive functions instead of evaluative ethics.

133,esfp,"The original source for this information is Jung(who was clearly an intuitive) and the person who compiled it together and spelled it out identifies as an INTJ, so it's basically like two olympic sprinters discussing molecular engineering, neither one of them understands what it's like to be a sensor. 
About hedonism - I think that all people are hedonists in the wide sense of the word, we all want to increase desirable sensations/feelings and even in the sense of overindulging in physical pleasures I think that it's still an accurate thing to say about Se's, so I'll disagree with you on that one. 
Yeah the part about sci-fi and ancestral history is subjective bullshit and has nothing to do with Se. The part about ""using force"" is also pretty subjective, your Se doesn't have to manifest in that way, especially if you're an ESFP, I don't think that we're the best athletes or inherently aggressive in any type of way. 
The only thing I really agree with in this description is the inferior Ni part, it can definitely manifest in some irrational beliefs(so basically as intuitives they only got the part about intuition right). I don't know how Jung came to these conclusions, but it seems like he barely spent any time observing the real motivations and behavioral patterns of sensors."
134,esfp,"lol I don't know how that can possibly make sense to the person who wrote it. If some Se dom is conformist then it has nothing to do with Se, especially if you combine it with Fi. I mean Fe is the typical conformist function and it's the opposite of our second function and is only tertiary for ESTP's"

136,esfp,"Every time I see a celebrity saying something like this, I'd love to see it juxtaposed with interviews of the 1000 (probably magnitudes more than 1000) people who attempted the same thing and failed, and what their advice is.

138,esfp,"Hello I am an ENFP and I recently made a post wondering what was going down with my ESFP friend's attitude. 
She's been blunt, rude, quick to lie, ungrateful, and anti-social for the past several days. 
She's been like this before, but she always apologizes soon after and explains the reason why. It's usually related to anxiety. However, this time it's lasted for almost 5 days. 
The only times she has been normal are when she's back around her boyfriend. She randomly will be amicable and laughing but only when she's making fun of me. 
She's always been sort of pretentious, but always kind and complimentary. I know she's going through things with her family lately, and she can't go back home to see her family since they were affected by Hurricane Florence. They're all safe though, and last I heard doing fine. 
If she ever looks grumpy, or angry, and I ask her what's up, she gets frustrated at me. 
The other day, I gave her and several others a ride to a film festival 30 minutes away, and she didn't say thank you when the others did, and was a backseat driver the whole way. She was rapping along to her rap music, and I could tell got frustrated when I asked her to change the music because it was distracting. 
My question is, 
any idea why she's acting like this, and also what's the best way to approach her and tell her that she's hurting me (or if that's a terrible idea), or if you have any idea when she'll stop?
EDIT: We worked it out and figured out that she was just really drained that week, and it was partially due to my sheer energy level. So we reached a compromise of how if she feels drained because of that, that she should tell me because immediate communication is a lot less messy. "
139,esfp,"First: You’re sure she’s your friend? 
Also how did you come to the conclusion that she’s ESFP?
And I don’t really think there’s a magical “ESFP way” to approach her or deal with this, she just sounds like passive-aggressive person and isn’t very interested in having a genuine relationship with you from what I read. It’s really up to you if you want to approach her about it or not but either way it isn’t healthy to cling to people like that."
140,esfp,"Shes being passive agressive and isnt adding value to the relationship. Best thing is to confront her or drop her. The reality is that she just doesnt seem to give a shit how you feel and there isnt some magical thing you can do to make her care. You either value someone or you dont, and sge doesnt seem to value you."
141,esfp,"Talk to her about her stank attitude. Come from an approach of understanding her anxiety/reasonable stress, but those factors don't give her the right to treat you like crap. Most people I know who deal with anxiety don't understand how they may be hurting people. If you bring it to their attention it may freak them out a little, but if they're a decent person they'll try to treat you better. 
-and/or-
Find someone who treats you better. 
​"
142,esfp,"Hey, pheonix940, just a quick heads-up:
agressive is actually spelled aggressive. You can remember it by two gs.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
143,esfp,"I think that in the context of mbti ""healthy"" is a word you have to be careful with, usually people only believe that their subjective beliefs about how things should be are what ""healthy"" is.
Contrary to what others have said, I barely ever lie(in the sense of making up things to make myself look good) and have always been good with my money. To me unhealthy ESFPs are the ones that are caught up in their inferior Ni. It can manifest in becoming existential, paranoid or believing crazy conspiracy theories. Craving attention and having random sex are not really signs of an ""unhealthy ESFP"""
144,esfp,"For me being unhealthy meant lying a lot to escape my responsibilities which led me to becoming really paranoid with everyone, and being completely disgenuine all the time I wasnt alone. I am as naughty with spending money and partying now as a more healthy person than I was when unhealthy. Probably more so actually."
145,esfp,"As an INTP I can relate. I'm really good at being unhealthy, if I'm not constantly vigilant. Luckily my kiddo keeps me straight and narrow for the most part, though I can overindulge when he leaves to his dad's. I was curious about the ""making little lies"" and why you believe that is a pattern when you are unhealthy? My son is an ESFP, 13 years old and I can tell immediately when he's lying, and even though he knows I know when he's lying he seems compelled to lie a lot. Did you lie a lot as a kid? Was there anything your parents were doing that compelled you to lie a lot? What is the impetus that makes this appealing? He seems to really love lying, just for lying's sake. Should I get him into a creative writing class or something?"
146,esfp,"for sure! that's why it's important to me to ask ESFPs how *they act when they're unhealthy. Or since you're an ESFP you're probably better at spotting an unhealthy one than a non-ESFP, if that makes sense. "
147,esfp,"I've seen people say that drunk INTJs resemble ESFPs and I think that it makes sense. Basically, I think that being unhealthy in the mbti sense would be trying to act like someone else or not truly being who you are"
148,esfp,"that's when you're unhealthy or that's just who you are? I guess I get way more avoidant and in my head when I'm unhealthy, but I guess I try not to lie as much as possible because I wouldn't want others to lie to me. "
149,esfp,"Constantly slamming on the cannabinoid receptors, which are important for memory and learning.  Also suppresses REM sleep which is incredibly important for healthy sleep & cognition.  Although, you can do things to make it better, such as smoke some CBD bud after you get high, and then take melatonin before you fall asleep (restores REM sleep)"
150,esfp,"I am an ESFP and love talking to people (my friends say i never stop talking) and get a huuuuge amount of energy when in school or when i talk to people etc, compared to my friends who are more boring and talk less (which is fine as long as they are not speaking negatively towards me). 
So basicly IRL I get a huge amount of energy and liveliness around people BUT when I for example am speaking with a group on discord who are talking about way to nerdy stuff (like weird numbers and theories) I tend to get bored and drained, even though I'm ""around people"" or maybe not, I don't know how it works. 
Basically I dont get the same energy around people online as I get IRL. Anyone else experiences this? Also I like playing games :D League of Legends ftw <3"
151,esfp,I'm the same way! I love league of legends too haha I used to play a lot. It's not so much because its nerdy talk but I hate how online talking people talk over one another and I just have to sit there and wait for an opening or not talk at all. I'm the same withgroip calls in general
152,esfp,"My favorite part of going to one of my part-time jobs is getting to talk to people. When a customer comes to me for advice or has a question.. I get extremely excited on the inside. Interaction and extraversion is like a drug to me. My heart races more, I get very happy.. I LOVE interaction. 
​
HOWEVER, if I have to interact with people that I don't like.. it is the complete opposite. I want nothing to do with them and I want to be very far away from them... I think that is a general human rule though."
153,esfp,"No, it's consistent for me irl and online. I also don't talk that much and am usually not that lively, unless I'm extra happy. Getting bored when people talk about things that don't interest you is also not type related at all"
154,esfp,I get so freaked out about nothing and always have. Literally him just talking about ghosts had me jump onto my bed screaming... lol good to know other people are as jumpy as i am. At least i don’t believe it’s actually a ghost but my mind does play tricks on me and i don’t evaluate before acting 
155,esfp,"Cursory observations that become hauntingly mysterious due to avoidance of examination.
If the stimuli doesn't feel good, ESFP refuses to investigate further.
Lots of screaming and hollering about things that don't feel good."
156,esfp,"I’m in a relationship with an ESFP, and it has been great so far (for a year and a half), up until a few months ago. I took a new job several months after we started dating, and I told her I would only take the job if she moved with me. It wasn’t a dream job, but it was a small step up. The move was hard on both of us. I hated the job when I first started, she was unemployed for 3 months, and when she got a job she hated it. Yet she wouldn’t quit. We don’t have any friends in the new place, and it’s a small town, so it’s been difficult for us to meet people. 5-6 months after the move I noticed some changes in her personality. She was no longer bubbly and enthusiastic. When we first got here and I realized I did not like the job, she was a huge support for me and said I should give it a chance, find the best in it, etc. However, when I noticed her becoming somewhat depressed, she wouldn’t listen to the same advice she gave me. And she refused to quit her job because she didn’t want to seem like a job hopper. I also suggested that she see a therapist, but she said it wasn’t that bad and she didn’t need it. She finally resigned from her job but then has gone home for a little while to “get help” and have some “time and space.” I’m just so confused over her reasoning for doing this the way she did. 
As I see it, our situation here is very simple: she hated her job, and we have no friends here. That’s a very dark place for an ESFP to be. Why didn’t she take my suggestions to quit sooner and look for other jobs? I’ve asked her if she wants to break up, and she says no, but at the same time she won’t let me help her. It’s like there’s a wall around her emotions (fear, insecurity, whatever) that she won’t let me break down. Is this a coping mechanism? Or could she be incredibly hurt from some past experience?
ESFPs, please help me understand what is going on inside of her head. What is she hoping to accomplish? I just want to help, but I don’t know how if she won’t let me in. How does an ESFP in distress want to be treated? Should I ignore her, or should I be persistent?"
157,esfp,"She didn't want to hold you back so she decided to make the move with you because that's the condition you set for taking the job. 
Now she's having a tough time fitting in and doesn't like her situation. 
Maybe she doesn't want to upset you: from her perspective, it might be that you'll think she's flip flopping and being whiny by first agreeing to move with you, then not having a good time. 
Maybe she's prideful and stubborn and mad at herself: ""I agreed to move with him but this place fucking sucks, but I'll make it work because damnit it was my decision, and if I quit I admit I was wrong."" 
Maybe she's mad/resentful at you: ""I never really wanted to move here. I thought it would end up okay for me, so I only agreed because it would make him happy and fulfilled. I ended up making a sacrifice I didn't forsee making at the time and now I resent him for putting me in a position where I'd be selfish to say no to the move.""
Based on how she's behaving toward you, my money is on something like the third.  "
158,esfp,"These are all things we've talked about and things she's said. I don't think she resents me at the moment, but she is prideful and stubborn and generally displeased with ""her situation"" (she uses the same phrases you do!). So I told her we would get rid of our house and residential neighborhood (which we shouldn't have gotten to begin with) and move into a brand new apartment development with more people our age (no children), social opportunities, and spontaneity. I've also pleaded with her to look for jobs here, rather than moving back home. I believe that would be a step backwards and will not make her happy long-term. She actually wanted to move much more than I did. She hated her job back home, and a lot of our friends at the time were moving away, so when this opportunity popped up, we both saw it as an escape, albeit to a town we knew would be much different but only temporary. It's like she's now forgotten all of the circumstances around why we moved and can't see that returning home will be a mistake after about two months.
​
So how do I help an ESFP who's in this mental state? Do I give her space? Or do I let her know periodically that I know it's been hard on her, but I'm here if she needs me, and I think we'll ultimately get through it?"
159,esfp,"ESFP female here.
My boyfriend and I went through something incredibly similar.  A few years into our relationship he got a job in another province in a small rural town.  It wouldn't have been my first choice to ever move to that type of place, but the view that it was an ""adventure-""  new experiences, people and places to add to my life list of things I've tried and done/met is what won me over.   
However as soon as the novelty wore off (about 6 months in) the day to day incompatibility of this place really started to grind me down.  Small town with nothing to do or try, no friends, brutal winters, can't go out and find trouble if you tried there.  All these things.....hell on earth.  
One of the worst things you can do to an ESFP is put them in a box.  and a box with no people to keep you company, no less!  I would say our biggest fear is losing our freedom.  We NEED to have choices and options,  to ""sway where the wind blows"" (or at least feel we have the option to sway if we chose to!) to be able to thrive. It caused a lot of issues in our relationship as I became depressed and what I felt was a downer...Most of the time I am quite the optimist and to live in that world was dark.  I became resentful and would lash out at my boyfriend. He was trying to find a job somewhere else at that point but the job market was tough.
About 3 years in I cracked and applied for a new job in a place I wanted to be. I was fully prepared to live in different provinces and just be long distance until he found a job and caught up to me eventually, as that situation would be far more bearable than the current hell-prison.  Luckily he got a job just a few weeks after me.  Crazy lucky.
I would say your girlfriend moved because even if she wasn't super keen on the area, ESFP are definitely not afraid to try new things.  The novel adventure of the unknown is what excited her. Unfortunately she hated the place and her work...and had to escape.  I can't say why she wouldn't quite her job at first, as Im  usually not one to stay at a place(or situation) I hate, but could be for social pressures (look bad, like she made the wrong decisions-what ppl think of them means a lot to an ESFP)  or she felt there was no point, trapped is trapped....she hated the town and another job would be same shit different pile?
ESFPs are generally not future oriented, we are not big planners or if we do it's VERY broad strokes.  She likely does not have an ""end-goal"" in mind per se,  she just needed to relieve the pressure of the cage that was that place and went to a place she knew had comfort and friends(or at least more than where she was), all those things she was missing.   I would say  as an ESFP opinion... your relationship is in jeopardy.  Maybe not immediately so, but definitely could eventually cause a breakup.  ESFPs live almost entirely in the moment and that includes relationships.  One of the best ways I've seen that sums up how we operate: ""For people with the ESFP personality type, relationships aren’t about slowly building foundations for the future, or planning out a life – they are bubbling, unpredictable things to be enjoyed for as long as there’s enjoyment to be had ""   It doesn't mean we're not very committed day to day,  the love is real.  It's just things can change, and when they do they do not stick it out ""for the sake of the future""  because we don't plan that far ahead. Whatever happens, happens.
I don't say this to worry you, just give you insight into what could be going on in her head.  It will be hard if you are not living in the same city to have a permanent solution.  I would say, barring getting a new job where she is now (or getting a job in a city she would love or find desirable) the best thing you can do is not get super insecure with her about the relationship    but also not TOO much space .....because they live in the present you need to also be in the present with her.  Just don't smother her as that can be a big turn off.   Acknowledge the things she's feeling.  and do something FUN together.  She needs a spark, some fun, an adventure, an excitement about being alive,  try something new and exciting and do it together.  She needs the reinforcement that your company provides all those things and will need some positive moments to get her through all the harder ones.
I would say......you can be the closest person in an ESFPs life, and be their favourite person who they love to bits...but you will never be their everything.  You have to share them with the world :p

160,esfp,"Hey, 
So happy I found a community for ESFPs. I'm just wondering if anyone else of you have ""problems"" with settling down. I know it's not a must but what makes you to settle down with the one and only? I find it extremely hard to find the right person. I hate that I miss the feeling to be in love. I go on dates but blah. ESFPs won't settle and sometimes I feel it's a problem. Sorry for this opening up but jeez, I just feel lonely right now. "
161,esfp,"I'm also an ESFP and I find that it's not I can't settle down, more I can't find the perfect one. I'll be up front and say I have an image of a perfect girl in mind and though I know a person might never really be like that, I tell myself I don't want to date till I find that person. I'm fully aware that it's a problem on me and not society but I think I'm happy knowing that I'm ok flying solo till the perfect girl in my eyes comes by. "
162,esfp,"Totally. I read something hilarious somewhere (this sub maybe), that said 'ESFP's don't seek out a partner, they just don't get sick of someone for long enough for it to happen.' Exactly my situation right now. My bf is 5 years older than me and a lot more about settling down, whereas that almost scared me off at points. 
​
I think realising that anything meaningful has to begin small is important. Maybe someone can become the perfect person. The best relationships offer growth for the both of you. You learn from each other and can try to make small changes that are big for you partner, and vice versa. 
​
We can't live in denial and think we are going to meet someone perfect, and realistically, we are nobodies perfect person either, because we are not perfect ourselves! We all have flaws, and the idea of the perfect person is only going to stop you from putting yourself out there. 
​
Essentially, if the pros outweigh the cons, and you are both growing, they can become your perfect person, and you need to date a bit for experience to not lose them when you find them!"
163,esfp,"I don’t know if this is an ESFP thing, but I always want what I can’t have. I go for girls way out of my league and when I get one to like me back I don’t like them anymore. I’ve done this so many times and I regret not dating them. 
I legit think I’m afraid of commitment. "
164,esfp,"This seems to be where I am as well. 
The person I would want to be with is someone I'd be excited to talk to/come home to and can keep up with me. I have yet to meet a man who can do both. Lol. 
I also reevaluate relationships constantly. I feel like it's normal, but I may be too critical when I do so. 
If I would have to choose between no marriage and being with someone I'll eventually just have to tolerate, I'd rather not get married. "
165,esfp,"Yes, never settle. I can relate to you a lot. Flying solo is great but there are these moments of super loneliness. But I am happy I am not in a relationship like my ESFJ friend, marriage, 1 year old and another coming up. And no love between her and her husband. I don't want to end up in a situation like that. Guess ESFPs event won't. For me it would be too much, lying to myself and to the other one. "
166,esfp,"Yes. Totally agreeable. It's no use to lie to yourself. I find ESFPs to be outsiders in so called normal society where you get married, a career and eventually kids. I just want to travel and experience it all. No room for routines and average life. "
167,esfp,"ISFP has this more laid back feel vs ESFP imo. Like while ESFPs are more of the “LETS DO THIS LETS GO LETS TRY THIS NEW EXPERIENCE” feel, ISFPs are more selective when it comes to what they want to do, like a “hmm I think I’ll try this instead” vibe"
168,esfp,"Title.
Ive taken the Myerrs Briggs test 3 times. The first was more or less a year ago. The second was about a month ago. The 3rd was this morning. All 3 times, I have gotten the ENFP-T personality type. However, after spending on some time on /r/ENFP, Ive found that I feel differently than them. They seem a lot more carefree than I do, to put it as plainly as possible. I would point out more specific examples but the point is...
I was recommend to check this type and I feel, according to the 16personalities website, that ESFP fits me just as well. Like, both descriptions resonate with me but this board seems to have more like minded people, despite the very little amount of discussion.
Little bit about me:
I love making jokes. Ive done stand-up exactly once and I did very well, IMHO. Ever since I saw Jay Leno on the tonight show in 3rd grade, Ive wanted to be a comedian. It is also a lot of peoples go-to compliment about me.
I have 2 groups of friends, both large. The two groups dont get along though, so they split. I feel like I get along with everyone at my high school. I have at least one friend in every clique and there are very few people that truely get on my nerves. 
I enjoy company of others. I like being alone too, but long weekends alone get me really bored. Im usually the first to text because Im very talkative and want to stay close and start discussions.
Anyway. Thats all. I dont know if I have my true type nailed down quite yet but I think this is a good place to ask. Thanks dudes!"
169,esfp,"So I've recently gone through like a week of classes at my university about the Meyers-Briggs stuff amongst other personality factors. One of the psychology professors mentioned that everyone kind of has a base personality. For me, it's ENFP. When I was in high school, I think I resonated well with INTJ due to some things, but when you go through certain changes in life, your personality can change, albeit briefly. For example, I have found that when I go through depression (like actual depression, not the classic ENFP down-cycle), I become more of an NT instead of NF and am very quick to be judgmental and whatnot. So I hope that helps. I mean I'm not a psych student or anything, but yeah. "
170,esfp,"You could try this one
Careful with the N/S typing though, especially in tests. There's such an N-bias that I think a lot of us get mistyped as Ns. Good luck in figuring yourself out!"
171,esfp,"i just ignore the problem, hang with them separately. im not their mother, i wont baby them. they are fully capable of maintaining their own relationships and making their own decisions, getting me involved would be immature and childish. if they make it ur problem, tell them youre not responsible for their own happiness and friendship issues, and that you like them both but you dont want to choose"
172,esfp,I went through this exact situation in hs. I basically focused onakng the both of them enjoying spending time with me to the point they could get over it. There were a lot of time we'd hangout and they'd only talk to me and there were no group discussions but eventually they grew out of it and get a long real well now. Granted they were friends before and went through a point where they just couldn't stand each other
173,esfp,"Thanks for the responses guys haha. Currently the hatred isn’t that strong so I’ll ignore the problem for now. But when the going gets tougher, I would probably try to make peace with them, and if that does not resolve, I would retreat.
Cheers people 💙"
174,esfp,"hi esfp's! I'm posting here because i (male, istj) dated an esfp in the recent past and she was the most compatible person i've ever dated!  I can't think of a single moment i did not laugh.  She was just full of life and couldn't stop talking.  I mean the stories would just keep repeating themselves and she would sit there trying to catch her breath telling me stories nonstop, i'd find it adorable.  She was also extremely nice to everyone.  The issue was that even though everything was 'amazing' I didn't feel complete compatibility for a couple other reasons i don't really want to lay out, it would just be rude.  That said, you guys are amazing and I just wish there was a way for me to focus my dating on esfp without the trial and error and randomness of dating that is what we currently do.  where do i find you guys?  The fact that she verbally adored my (flexible) structure and easy going focus was awesome.  And the fact that she could verbally walk me through a number of scenarios on things i was thinking about and help select the best option was super cool.  I finally think i figured out a way to find an actual compatible match... But how to find you guys in the first place apart from chance? :)  Thanks!"
175,esfp,"Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.
See you there (:

176,esfp,"Read up on what Se is  and what Ne is, and see where you feel like that's how you operate. Also look at Ni and Si, and what they are. Those are functions you won't use much/well, but think on which you value, based on the description, and what you seek in life from others. ESFPs are Se-Ni, while ENFPs are Ne-Si.
ESFPs focus on the real, tangible, observable, in the moment, and tend to at all times scan and exist in their environment physically. They observe the physical, but don't retain the irrelevant. If I was in a room, and some crisis happened, I'd be the first out the right door, or the first to leverage the environment, because I'd already be aware of what is where, that's what I was observing primarily. However, if I was in that room for an hour, nothing eventful happened, and I walked out, and then you asked me to describe it, I'd remember the overall image, but few details. ESFPs, from this realtime, physical observation, tend to seek for a direction, where they can take being able to be present and take opportunities, so that they have a goal, or one area of focus to invest energy in, to make something of their nature.
ENFPs don't focus on the tangible, they focus on possibilities, and multiple lines of connections, associations, options. They're intuitive, but broad in their focus. They don't deep-dive into one scenario as much as they see a multitude of threads unraveling from one point. That is why they can be so random, and you don't often know how they came up with certain associations. This allows them great creativity, but seemingly (from the outside perspective), no sense of direction. They focus on possibilities, and how they move forward is by seeking reference to how things have changed from a point in time (say, the last crossroad, or last decision), which in turn triggers more possibilities and tangents. They seek reference points rather than a direction from others.
They both share their judging axis, so their decision making and values will be focused in a similar manner, but sourced from different axis of perception.
​
I like to think of the difference between Se and Ne by focusing on two words - opportunity versus possibility.
Opportunity (Se) - a window in a single point in time, right now, sensing leverage, to be able to achieve a specific outcome.
Possibility (Ne) - an intangible one of many options, going forward, based what you already know. There are many of them, and they have less specific variables."
177,esfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbtitypeme] ESFP or ENFP? help!

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
178,esfp,"I think for the fears I can somehow relate to both... I read that sticking to the tried and true is sometimes typical of Si inferior (like going to the same restaurant and ordering the same thing, or collect memorabilia from their past..) and I very much do these things, while an Se dom would not care about preserving the past, because that's dead and gone and only the present matters (according to what I heard) 
I also relate to the fear of wanting the wrong thing and failing, for example in choosing the wrong degree and having to stick with that for the rest of my life, without having the chance of living all of the other possible lives I could've lived.. (is this Ne? Or Nah?) 
As for the here and now, I'm not sure. The future seems a little vague and oppressive to me right now, because I chose a very long degree course (6 years) and I can't see the end of it as for now, so I'm trying to live in the moment. 
Which I admit is not being very good for me, as I am more and more struggling with instant versus delayed gratification (ex. Videogame now or study now and videogame later? I'm finding it harder and harder to ""study now"", because I have problems with conceptualizing the fact that no, I'm not going to study forever, I can have fun later).
I probably should've posted this in r/mbtitypeme I realize lol, so sorry for this. If anyone can help me figure myself out, I'd be very thankful."
179,esfp,"I'm too lazy to reference this (but you can google it), but cognitive functions manifest physically in how a brain operates, as observed by EEG (Dario Nardi).
Se-dominant (ESFP, ESTP) brains show activity in areas that focus on reaction in environment, and have more areas of the brain ON at all times, but at power-saving mode, so that if triggered, they can react quickly, because there are already some reference points, but so that they aren't too un-economical at the same time. Much like when your phone is on, but the screen is off when you're not using it.
Ne-dominant (ENFP, ENTP) brains light up like Christmas trees - brain activity switching off and on in random areas, much like a Christmas decoration."
180,esfp,"It's not exclusive to them, but it's more of an Ne dom thing"
181,esfp,"Alright, I couldn't help it. Here's the pdf that covers it. It's an interesting read -  https://www.pdx.edu/sysc/sites/www.pdx.edu.sysc/files/neuro-systems.pdf 
​"
182,esfp,"Hey, so my mom, my roommate, my best friend, and my ex-boyfriend are all ESFPs.As you can see, I'm sort of drawn to you guys. And for good reason of course!
I was wondering if someone could try to explain ESFP stackings and how it affects your experiences and decisions in everyday life. Something along those lines.
Thanks!
Edit: formatting mistake"
183,esfp,"Basically we are v observant and we are mostly patient until you really step over the line into something v offensive to us. And well we can plan stuff and all but it’s not a priority bc going w the flow is much easier lol. Also pls don’t go into theory bc it’s boring for my brain (I don’t like to process stuff like that) 
Yeah that’s about it"
184,esfp,"One-on-one with my ESFPs are fantastic. They are enthusiastic and are quite logical in discussion about most topics, but don’t always like to go into abstract theory that an INFP may like to do, so there’s a slight disconnect there. But as an Infp, I can also get enthusiastic about certain topics, and that’s when the Esfp and I hype up off of each other. It can be lots of fun. 
I think there’s also a disconnect when talking about feelings. For instance, because of Fi and Si, I want to talk about feelings attached to experiences. It seems like the ESFP tends to shy away from getting thoughtful about their emotions, so i imagine they just feel things in the moment, then maybe think about aspects of the experience later on without attaching too much to the feelings involved (this is just from my own observations. I don’t really know this to be an overarching theme, so please correct me if this isn’t accurate in the slightest lol). 
In general, I’m attracted to extroverts. I just need space sometimes... I think the cue to knowing this is when your introvert friend or lover gets quiet. They’ve probably already retracted into their minds for a little bit, but they’ll come out to talk again soon of course. "
185,esfp,"Hello ESFP, I'm an ENTJ having a crush on an ESFP and I need your insights.
We've been talking for like 2 months, went on a date once, I think we really have the spark. I like her so much, shes beautiful ,energetic, fun, unpredictable, It's been years since I like someone so much.
So I'm posting this to ask few things:
-Is there any best way to tell her that I love her? ( were not official yet )
-How can an ENTJ like me make like her happy? 
-Your opinion and experience on ENTJxESFP relationship? Will it workout? Advantages and Disadvantages? Long-term problems?
-Do you ESFPs even dig ENTJs? Your thoughts on ENTJ partners?"
186,esfp,"Hey I'm not too familiar with MBTI stuff but if I'm not wrong ESFPs are known for being fickle in a sense. They'll find something that's interesting, and spend lots of time with it until all the interesting is gone, then Move on. It's kinda what happened between me and my ex I was the esfp and kinda didn't feel if after a while. Maybe it's just me but just a. Word of caution. Good luck! "
187,esfp,"I am an ENTJ(M) dating a ESFP(F). I am proposing this year. I believe it is the best and worst relationship at the same time. It is the best because as an ENTJ, you like to improve yourself through a structured logical approach. Also, in terms of raw fun, ESFP's are the most fun. ""Fun"" being defined how Hollywood would describe it. In a relationship or a marriage, you are a team, my team now has more P, S, and F. We can be more detailed, more emotional and more carefree. However, as I want to be more balanced, it is very hard to accept what that means. They will talk about every single detail. A story that should take 1 minute takes hours. It also upsets them if you rush it or doze off. You will definitely gain patience.
I agree with the advise on here about saying you love her. Depending on the age, it could feel like there is no were else to go, making the relationship more fun. Remember, most P's like to live in the moment, not the future.
You will make her happy by two main things. (Personality perspective only). Make sure she can be social. They won't want to be controlled in social environments. However, you can also set boundaries (not rules!). Second, have patience with their details. They want to share their feelings on situations and friends and they want to share them in detail. Always be interested. It is tough sometimes. 
ESFP's value the ""fun"" and ENTJ can bring with their E. They also admire the structure. However, ESFP's prefer direction not dictation. Give an ESFP freedom in a structured way. An ESFP can view pieces of the relationship controlling. Always ask them to communicate if there are areas that feel that way. If there are, work on them. ESFP's love and hate the controlling aspect, so you need to use their F to make them feel free and safe in the relationship. Its not if they are free and safe, its if they feel free and safe.
A bunch of thoughts."
188,esfp,"My best friend is an entj (10 years) and I absolutely love her! We're travel buddies! I always say if I could find a dude like her, I might consider settling down lol
Keep things fun! And always do new things. We like people who open up, not tooooo much though. We love affection. So be touchy feely. Don't be too bossy or controlling. That grows old for me. Mention how much fun you have with her. I think it can work. Watch her body language. It'll tell you everything. Just be yourself though, we love differences in personality and I find entjs to be super interesting! But that might just be me haha!
I wouldn't use the L word just yet... I would mention how much you like her though. 
I do have a hard time with intuitives because don't get me wrong, I love how you see so many different ways things can be done. But sometimes things just are, and just let them be. Or when they try to ""read between the lines"" makes me a little crazy. We're very straightforward, most of what we say is exactly what we meant. I'm not very passive aggressive. I can't speak for wall. Anyways I hope that helps. "
189,esfp,I agree definitely don't tell her you love her just yet. Not unless you guys are like crazy for each other. Keep her happy by doing fun stuff together and being enthusiastic. We like fun people who are optimistic. I personally never had a good ENTJ relationship but they were probably just shitty ENTJs. It has a good chance of working out just as long as you aren't too controlling. Personally I don't like ENTJs but as I said the ones I've met have been particularly jerky.
190,esfp,"I'm dating an ENTP, NT and SF can be a really interesting combo!!!!! There are moments where he applies logic to social situations and thinks about stuff in a way more...I guess technical manner and we get a bit clashy- but I think it's good to balance each other out. You may find typical P stuff (not being so well planned out, not attacking things in such a well-judged/ rationalised manner) a little bit tiring at times but again, it'll be a balance.
Sometimes it's really nice to have someone that grounds me with different functions like that.
I wouldn't use love straight away because we're quite intense with feelings...but then again, as I say, we're pretty intense with feelings...if you're feeling mad love chances are she's probably feeling it too BUT as general advice wait a little bit. 
You can make ESFP happy by paying attention to their emotions, what drives them, doing sweet things that you think will make her feel the warm and fuzzies. Well at least that's my experience with it :) "
191,esfp,"Thank you, this is exactly what i'm worrying about. ESFP as far as I know are very fun loving, spontaneous and that make them... less committed in a long-term relationship? ( Just my thoughts )
And for an ENTJ like me, I want a deep, long-term soulmate-like relationship... well..."
192,esfp,"Thank you for your reply
I know that ENTJ nature can be assertive and controlling so I've been working on it. Around her I try my best to keep the conversation light, fun and spontaneous, Also I don't control her in anyway, I just want to preserve and protect that fun and spontaneous bubble, she is like that to me.
Although I've always wanted intuition partners but shes just so perfect for me so far, we get along, we can talk all day. Now I just hope that I can make this relationship work, even though the differences between ESFP and ENTJ isn't small, we look at the world so differently :)"
193,esfp,"Well. I don't think ESFPs are incapable of sticking to a relationship, I guess it really depends on the kind of person you are and the kind of person she is. I really suggest not telling her ""I love you"" for a while because that's really what scared me off the last relationship. I realized that I didn't love her and I quickly broke it up after. "
194,esfp,"Esfp's do want a long term committed relationship. Keep it light, be willing to do fun things and then talk to her right after it happened (like even 5-10mins) later about what you liked about the experience. They love reliving the good fun times and love when you smile! Don't forget to smile at them...it hooks us esfp's! For life! We will get stubborn and cranky. Just start playing with our hair and sit next to us and listen to us vent. We will get over it and will be giving out happy vibes again soon. And much sooner if you don't get angry when we get emotional. Thanks"
195,esfp,"Yeah, what you say about saying Love word makes sense. 
I just don't want my heart broken by some easy come, easy go girls anymore, which happened to me in the past with my ESTP ex. Gosh, whats with me and ESxP girls xD"
196,esfp,"I would love to work more on making this subreddit more aesthetically pleasing. I would love for us to have a banner on this sub! Is anyone interested in making one? If you do, feel free to post them on moodboard. One of them will be selected and used. 
Thank you so much and have a great day!"

199,esfp,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.

200,esfp,"When you're feeling trapped, stressed, confused, down-trod... what would be the best thing to hear from a friend?
What works for me won't work for you guys (Fe-Ni vs Se-Fi) and it's too hard to guess what you'll connect best to.
Eg. I like being told that everything will work out and it'll be ok, and reminded that I'm doing the best I can. 
I have tried;
You're doing a fantastic job!
You got this!
Patience m'dear! It'll all work out
One step at a time"
201,esfp,"I can only speak from personal experience as I am a female ESFP: 
Being understood means more than just encouragement.
1) I know how you feel. Take some time to relax.
2) Wow, that's rough. You'll get through this.
3) I can see how much this matters to you. You're handling it well.
I would find these very encouraging and uplifting. Hugs can be very effective if you have that kinda relationship. Keep in mind that even though ESFP's are extroverts, a lot of our stress comes from dealing with our Ni, which means we'll need time alone to truly recover.
Again, this may vary for each individual. Hope this helps you in some way. :)"
202,esfp,"Depends, I guess. I don't find silences awkward unless someone makes them so. There is huge merit to companionable silence.
I'll just check in once in a while to see if all okay, or if they want to join me in some activity, but if they're good, I don't tend to break it, unless I have something I want to say."
203,esfp,"I try not to talk too much cuz I tend to ramble and have a bit of social anxiety, honestly I've been learning to embrace silence and try to enjoy just the presence of the other person. But yeah no I'd rather there be talking 😂"
204,esfp,"I do too. I realize I go to great lengths to avoid awkward moments. 
I feel second-hand awkwardness/embarrassment so strongly from people that it almost gives me a light sense of social anxiety.
To others, it looks like I have great social skills because there are no awkward moments, but in my head it is taking so much mental power haha."
205,esfp,"Don't really care about it honestly, I just stay quiet and then start a new conversation or just move on with whatever I was doing 
What you're describing tho is someone ignoring you, which I definitely can't stand. It's not as much awkward as it's annoying. I just ignore them back the next time they start talking to me and in general stay away from these types of people"
206,esfp,"People not talking back kinda hurts my pride haha. But it’s alright, I also sometimes intentionally lead conversations to deadends when I dont feel like talking so I understand when other people do it. I used to be very self conscious with awkward silences, but I grew to not really care and now they’re just silences. Maybe that makes some people uncomfortable but that’s the price I pay to be comfortable myself."
207,esfp,"Tests give you results based on dichotomy (e.g. I vs E, S vs N) rather than cognitive functions, which make up all MBTI types. You can't be half I half E (other any other letters) even if the test give you 50-50 because cognitive functions don't work that way. This may help: http://eilamona.com/post/131780972956/mbti-terms-vs-conventional-meaning"
208,esfp,"I thought I was ENFP and am in the ENFP subreddit but someone commented I might be an ESFP because of all the things I want to do:
​
​
""Unemployed currently but when I get a job I aspire to save money and buy equipment to start a YouTube channel to showcase my acting and humor and writing. I also want to act, write, and direct film and TV. And write books and comics (and draw comics). And be a comedian. Maybe a talk show host. A singer in a band or solo or both. A detective. A superhero (I legitimately was studying science in college with the aim to get a genetic engineering degree and make me super). Many other things.""
​
​
I have studied the functions and thought I was ENFP but now reading about ESFP and the differences between ENFP and ESFP I don't know! :O I seem to possess strong parts of both. I have strong Fi and can use Te pretty well too which are common between them but I can't figure out if I lead with Ne or Se. And as for Si or Ne I'm not sure I fully understand them to be honest.
​
Ne:
​
I have a basically unlimited imagination. I saw a test once where you had to name 5 or 10 other things you can use a fork for (or a spoon, can't remember). I can name 10 easily. I can name 50, 100.
​
I can think of something random like Godzilla waltzing through a city with a mop, sweeping all the people into the sea, but knowing in the prophecy this would happen dolphins built an underwater shopping mall that he people can shop and walk around in while they wait for Godzilla to die of exhaustion. Then they will rebuild their city in his bones and remember him with a traditional ceremonial needlepoint contest.
​
I can think of a solution to any problem, 10 solutions, more.
​
I love to read fantasy books. Regular literary books set in the ""real world"" seem boring to me.
​
I am always looking for new ways to do things. It sometimes is about efficiency which is very important to me because of Te but I can actually think of so many ways things can be improved or made faster, more efficient, streamlined, etc.
​
​
Se:
​
All my sense are extremely keen. I'm a visual learner and I see something I can understand it instantly, as opposed to trying to read about it. I can always notice details and things no one else can, for example I always see hidden animals that no one even noticed. My ears are very sensitive to any noise and I can't sleep unless I have a fan going to block out any noise that might occur. I am a supertaster and find many things way too bitter to eat, like most vegetables and coffee, etc.
​
I also have always been naturally extremely gifted at any artistic endeavor. I have always been able to draw very well even as a kid and was always the kid everyone wanted to draw pictures for them. I can paint well, sculpt well, do any kind of art well without training. I can see extreme details in art and when creating art.
​
As you can see I am also very interested in performing arts, acting, singing, comedy, dancing, improv, etc.
I also don't like philosophical conversations like ""why are we here? ""What is the meaning of happiness?"" ""What is good and evil?"" Something I've been known to say is that philosophy is just mental masturbation. It goes nowhere and has no point. It's asking questions with no answers, just opinions.
​
When I'm reading and see a description I can picture it very well, extremely detailed. If someone says something like ""chandelier"" I can picture the chandelier in extremely detail down to the decorative metal designs. I can picture the ceiling, the windows covered in velvet drapes, the color of them the texture. I can see the whole room and all the details.
​
​
As far as focusing on the future and possibilities or the present I don't know. I don't know what I'll be doing in 5 years, 2, or even tomorrow and I like that but I still dream and imagine future careers and scenarios. I do sometimes talk about different ways the world is changing and will change in the near future. I don't often talk about people and what they doing, rumors, etc. but that may be because I have no social life (see other post about having no friends).
​
​
I'm lost here. What am I?"
209,esfp,"as somebody who is truly 50-50 some days and other days majority one or the other....
i think the easiest way i assess this is if you have all these ideas but how much to completion do you achieve? if you reach 100% more often youre an ESFP, if you reach 20% more often youre ENFP. but i can be completely wrong here haah"
210,esfp,"I think you're an enfp, no one's good at typing imo I think unless they're a professional. One thing that is a common trait to enfp is starting something and not finishing, I say if you think you're an enfp then you are however if you believe you're an esfp then feel free no judgment.
tldr; do what makes you happy"
211,esfp,"We only have one token ESFP and want more of you lovely bunch. ;) Last year we made an ENFP GroupMe which expanded to include other types. It's been a fairly large and sustainable community, so today we decided to add some more people for some new friends and perspectives. Come say hey!"
212,esfp,"The socionics post on us gives a pretty good description.
""He typically wants to make all decisions that concern sensory aspects of his life for himself: what he will do, wear, eat, look like, etc., and resents any attempts by others to make these decisions for him (conflicts over sensing). However, he is willing to make use of other peoples' suggestions, advice and ideas, as long as he plays the most visible role. He usually values first hand experience, lives life experiencing it ""on his own skin"", and will gladly teach it to others whom he sees as less knowing and aware of the realities."""
213,esfp,Whatever jumps out at me most and is most exciting. Has potential for most opportunity/enjoyment. Think this is more enneagram than mbti. It's mostly instinct though. Thinking is more like rationalizing what I already chose to make sure I won't damage myself somehow in the process.
214,esfp,"im a piece of shit when it comes to applying my self to classes even though I'm intelligent enough to blow them away, I just enjoy the social part of college a LOT more. when I do what I need to do when I need to do it, i'm able to do what I want to do when I want to do it"
215,esfp,"I noticed that I can learn a lot when u sit down to study. Most of the time in class, I lose interest way too quickly. The social aspect is awesome especially because I go to a big school. There's always someone new around the corner. "

217,esfp,"Everyone is active on the internet these days. There are multiple factors at play here, but the fact that the INTP subreddit is 35 times bigger than this one seems to contradict the statistics that say that there are twice as many ESFP's as INTP's in the general population"
218,esfp,"eh... like you said, there are multiple factors. my fiance is an ESFP (the reason i joined this sub), and she couldn't care less about what type she is, or interacting with others of her specific type. i find it interesting, so i joined the sub for both my and her types. does the fact we're almost polar opppsite types have anything to do with it, and why? maybe. could be plenty of reasons. either way, both of our examples are anecdotal. "
219,esfp,"Half awake and didn't read what subreddit this was from; voted as an INFP and messed up your results. Sorry for the silly mistake. 
The three books were 'Overlord' Vol 1 ( light novel), 'Lord of Opium', and 'What the Hell Did I Just Read'."
220,esfp,"I was very shy as a child. I remember being in kindergarten and my teacher telling my mom ""glitter4020 is starting to come out of her shell a little!"" I had like one maybe two friends when I was young. Painfully shy. "
221,esfp,"I'm an ESFP and my and my INTP boyfriend get into fights about music a LOT.
I love any music that excites me, as might be expected, or that I can really relate to. Panic! at the Disco is my favorite band. Other faves include Dirty Heads, Walk the Moon, Twenty One Pilots, First Aid Kit, and Alt-J. I often end up enjoying shitty dance music.
Meanwhile, my boyfriend, who's an audio engineer (which makes him act like he's the authority on music), enjoys this sorta... progressive electronic music? He talks about the mixing of it and how it's like... logically good? He has me listen to it all the time, since my music is practically off-limits around him, but it's very rare that any of them actually stick in my head. In complete honesty his music bores me to tears, but in my mind, if he enjoys it he's free to enjoy it.
He does not feel the same. If my music taste comes up, he often tries to talk me out of enjoying it. Of course, this only accomplishes me getting really irritated with him. In his mind, it's totally objective, while to me it's almost entirely subjective.
ESFPs, or really any type who sees this, what kind of music do you like and how objective/subjective do you think music taste is?"
222,esfp,"As a fellow ESFP (and musician) I completely agree with your argument. I feel that every music has its merits, I try to never put down a genre or band that I don't listen to. I don't eat seafood, but I don't denounce it as a food because of this. Entirely subjective.
I should add that my favourite type of music to listen to is rock, but have a soft spot for chart tracks for their catchy hooks. Would be interesting to see if other ESFP's are similar."
223,esfp,"I listen to progressive rock and I completely agree with your boyfriend. I think that the taste for music is objective: it is based on your knowledge about armony, melody and rythm. 
Of course, sometimes I listen to Infected Mushroom or whatever kind of electro trance music just for fun. But when I listen to my favorite albums, all that matters is the sound and its structure. 
As an ESFP I'm a very worried person about aesthetics and art, I feel that the sensual pleasures are my world and I must refine my taste in all that sensual pleasure involves.  "
224,esfp,"INTP here. I think the technicality of music is objective, but the enjoyment you garner from it is entirely subjective. For instance, there is some simple music that I love, and some technically complex music that I dislike. I know music theory, have been in chorus for 3 years, have been singing for 7 years, and screaming for 3. Complexity is impressive, but it isn't always enjoyable. I mainly listen to and perform -core (Metalcore, Djent, etc) genres, as well as many types of ""genuine"" Metal (Folk, Progressive, etc.). Some things I like are very instrumentally simple (For instance, Asking Alexandria), and some things I like are very complex (For instance, Periphery). Enjoyment is subjective, technicality is objective. "
225,esfp,"Anyone with knowledge about the MBTI has little grasp on how Se works, especially as a primary function. We are blessed with the ability to be aware of our surroundings on a constant basis. Do you feel that every day life is a 'stage' for you like how we are described? 
For me I don't see life as a stage BUT the way I dress heavily influences how I would like to appear outside of my home. I don't feel like I need to entertain people but I do feel like I need to present myself nicely. 
In a bar or social setting, I feel like I can hear everyone's conversation at once. It gets annoying yet I try to concentrate on what I am doing. My Se makes me feel like Spider Man at some points; I am way too in tune with multiple conversations without actually being apart of them. 
I also hate having Se in the classroom. It makes me worried to raise my hand or ask questions. I am too worried about someone elses view toward what I think than my own. 
What do you think about your Se?"
226,esfp,"I'm also very conscious of how I look. If I look like a slob it is because I actively chose to look like that that day. I don't wear makeup usually unless I am meeting someone important or looking to pick up guys. But I always coordinate my outfit, otherwise I feel like a dumbass. I mean realistically it doesn't take much effort to make sure your shirt matches your pants, so if they don't match I assume everyone notices and thinks I have no pride whatsoever. I feel awkward walking around with stained clothes too, I want to take them off immediately.
I also have super sensitive hearing and pick up info from everyone's conversation. Which can be cool learning tidbits from everyone but then again it usually leads to me never saying anything because all I can do is fuckin hear everyone else. And then people ask why I'm not talking. I'm not shy dammit I just don't like talking over people.
Overall though I like my Se. I don't know what the hell I would do with Ne. I would probably be too weird to function."
227,esfp,"For whatever reason I've seen plenty of people think we never shut up. Personally for me it's not the case at all. I definitely talk more than INTPs or ISTJs for example, but generally I don't talk any more or less than most other people and I get annoyed when someone can't get to the point or endlessly goes off on tangents(or just keeps on telling cool stories about themselves). ENTPs, NFPs and SFJs(even some ExTJs) talk wayy more than I do. What is your experience with this?"
228,esfp,"I would say it depends. In groups, I'm more the silent observer, or I just quip something here and there, and respond to people who talk at me. But one on one, if you ask about something on a topic I'm really excited about and passionate about, I will fucking hold you hostage :D
Obviously, just kidding, but not really. People who share interests with me find me enticing and enjoy these passionate conversations. People who asked, just to be socially polite but are actually disinterested wanna kill themselves, because they're the types that were socially polite to begin with, because it's the way to be, so they're the same type that won't tell you in your face that they'd prefer a change or topic, or for you to shut up. They think it's rude. But don't think it's rude to talk about you to other people when you're not there."
229,esfp,"In a room full of strangers who don't give a crap about me? No. Catch me on my phone. But when I'm really excited and I get the chance to talk about my passions, share stories with someone, and feel welcome into the conversation, I can sit and talk for days at a times lmao, no matter who it is, as long as the window is open"
230,esfp,Only when I don't feel intimidated in the slightest. If I can feel someone is awkward then I'll find it even easier to talk lots to make them feel more at ease. Otherwise if I feel like it's hard to be heard or these people are cooler than me I'll be pretty relaxed just listening. Overall I'd say I'm chatty but never overbearing. I definitely get annoyed at people who talk too much if it's about nothing I'm interested in.
231,esfp,"It all just really depends on how I'm feeling... like, sometimes I'm just not really awake yet 'cause it's the morning and I haven't had any coffee breakfast or energy from people. As the day goes on I pretty much always get more, and more energy naturally. 
Or if I'm like, mad or worried about something I can get pretty quiet and self-conscious. I actually have social anxiety disorder but I've been on treatment for it for years now and feel pretty much like me. 
Once I'm comfortable, and in a decent mood, I can quickly become by far the loudest most obnoxious person in the room. My voice tends to fill up large areas and be heard a long way away. I often even end up unintentionally irritating quieter, more uptight people and feeling bad about it because I want to be liked, and don't like conflict."
232,esfp,"I am an INFP who dated an ESFP for about 7 years, and recently ended the relationship. As an idealist I hoped for years that the subtle red flags could be overcome with time and hard work. Things did continue to get better and better for us. We weren't fighting, and generally got along as best friends would. But recently I felt like we reached our peak and I still wanted more... He did everything he could have, and I love him very much but I have realized I am just not IN love with him. He was totally shocked and heartbroken by the breakup, so now he wants a detailed explanation of reasons I feel this way, and why I am not in love with him as I once was... but I am too afraid to hurt his feelings and selfesteem... He told me he needed answers for his sanity, so I tried to as lovingly and tactfully as possible explain some of my motives, but he still can't wrap his head around it. Is it best to keep the details of why I want more to myself or will it actually help him to move on  by telling him what was unfulfilling for me? I am so afraid to hurt him more than I already have but I want to help him cope with this as much as possible. Is this a ""he thinks he wants to know but he really won't feel better after finding out"" scenario? I can't imagine explaining to someone I care so deeply for that there are traits and perspectives they possess that make me feel they are not the person I would be happiest with... like yes you made me happy, but I felt like I could be happier with someone else. What to do?  "
233,esfp,"I've been in this situation and I've pushed the person to explain it to me.  Often it was things I was already insecure about.  It definitely hurt a lot but I asked and wanted to know. Have you considered he can't wrap his head about cause it's truly an insufficient answer?  That you can't imagine wanting to know is just another expression of how wholly different you are as people.
And frankly, sometimes it's good to just hear things. Once something is out there, it's just like. 'Oh, that's it?'
One time I was really bent out of shape from this guy ghosting me after being quite affectionate. It really bothered me. Like a year or so later he gave me an explanation: ""I didn't like how you kept choking on my cock. It ruined the blowjobs for me"" and I was like what, that? That's it? That's what made you throw away the thing we had?  After all the cuddling, falling asleep together, nice times.. That? It was infuriating.
While I doubt your problem with this guy is blowjobs my point is that the moment he said that it allowed me to reevaluate everything. Hearing what someone didn't appreciate about you, hearing what they want, and contrasting it against what you brought to the relationship... it's very good for healing. It would be good to give him that opportunity instead of keeping him in the dark through what is frankly partially and probably a self protecting need to not be the 'bad guy' in his eyes"
234,esfp,"This is probably the truth. I'd definitely like to know what I did wrong to be able to move on. It'll hurt, but he'll for sure get over it. It's like ripping off a rotten bandaid. "
235,esfp,"I honestly think the best course of action would be to tell him the truth. While I've never been in the same situation, I am almost certain I would behave the same way as him if I was. I think it will be far harder for him to move on if he is not given these details. 
You see, knowing these things would be helpful for him to move on. If he truly cares about you, then at the end of the day he will want you to be happy. If he can know that you will be happier with someone else, it will likely allow him to let you go. Sure, it will still be hard, but I think it would be best to just be honest with him. I know I would have an exceptionally hard time letting go of someone if they broke things off and did not give reasoning that I viewed as sufficient. If he can know what areas he struggles in, it may help him in the long run or just simply in any future relationships. He can know ahead of time what areas he may need to work on or what things he may need to try and work through. 
I apologize if this answer was sort of all over the place. I was trying to write out my thoughts, but I've been having trouble finding the best way to word everything. Please let me know if you have any questions about anything I said, because I know I communicated it all in a fairly scattered manner."
236,esfp,The thing is i did tell him 4 soild reasons with brief explanations but he just nit picked them apart and essentially argued that my feelings are invalid... and now wants MORE detail as to why I'm not in love with him. I understand he needs reasons but to detail every little thing he's ever done seems cruel. 
237,esfp,"Cruel to who? If you feel it's cruel to you, then don't do it. You've done enough.  If you feel it's cruel to him, do it anyway. If he's anything like me, this is just something he needs in order to get over the situation. "
238,esfp,"If everyone just vanished today would you be fine with it? Could you keep yourself busy or would you go crazy?
I don't get lonely and am always busy watching,reading or listening to something that I never get bored.
In my relationships my significant others have complained that I don't give them ""enough"" 
I'm wondering if my feeling of not needing people is affecting me from being a good partner. Or maybe I just haven't found the right person."
239,esfp,"From what I've read and feel. When we like people we WANT them in our life, Not need them. I think that's lovely, to be wanted. Take a step back and figure out if you really don't give them enough time or they're just not being reasonable. I feel as if because we give so much, its always expected. I always feel selfish saying this but we need to help ourselves too.
I do love company, but I also have no problem keeping myself busy. If I feel down, lonely or stressed. I get up and do something about it. That's kind of our thing, As esfps. We're the masters of making ourselves and others feel good. And with a genuine heart! Toot Toot. "
240,esfp,"I can totally relate to these ideas.. Personally, I feel like the  'not needing people outlook' is sort of like a coping mechanism. I spend a lot of time with people but I also spend a lot of time alone. Because of my lifestyle and such, I do not feel extremely confident in many of my relationships. However I do find confidence in myself. I don't really ever seeing it being the other way around.. I just find a lot of success in the mindset of setting my standards low with people. I choose not to expect anything of others. Lately I've just been trying to live for myself, and I have been enjoying it.
Hopefully this makes some sort of sense to you."
241,esfp,"If I'm flying solo I usually hit basic familiarity/proficiency with my hobbies pretty quickly and burn out on them just as quickly after that unfortunately. People are much more interesting and varied, so having others around to do things with means it's never quite the same the next time around. 
So no, I don't think I could stand being with just myself. "
242,esfp,"I would go crazy. I always question if I'm an introvert since I spend so much time by myself but truth is it's not by choice. If I actually didn't talk to anyone I would literally go insane. You sure you're an extrovert?
As for relationships I can relate, I never give much o myself either, I think I just don't care enough about anyone to fully latch onto them. Or there's just not much of me to give. Not really sure what it is. I just have been on my own so long I guess relationships aren't a big deal to me."
243,esfp,"Same.. How often do you have these kind of days? Literally my goal in life feels like to avoid these types of days.. 
I mean I'm fine when I'm alone honestly, and some days I'd rather be alone for whatever reason. 
But yeah just seems like a waste of a life when there's 7 billion people out there and you don't get to be with any of them.. "
244,esfp,"So I'm a mellow ass guy, I'm happy to take bull shit if it means avoiding confrontation (something I'm currently working to change), but my anger always seems to come out in a sharp, intense burst which last no more thant a second or two. But by then the damage is usually done, I just launch shit at walls or at other shit (Never at people) but the ammount of holes in my walls is just stupid. 
So, do I have anger problems? Is this sort of explosive anger common in ESFP's? Do I just need to wank more??"
245,esfp,"I get the same thing. I'm a very calm person usually, however when something or someone pushes me over the edge I do explode spectacularly. I've been known to punch holes in my wooden door, often injuring my hand in the process. Same as you, as soon as that happens I revert back to being calmer. 
I just need a punching bag in my room."
246,esfp,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
247,esfp,"I like to use small talk as a way to feel out the other person. Just because you're not talking about deep things doesn't mean what someone says doesn't tell you a lot about them. 
It's very useful to use small talk to gauge how people will react to certain topics, and how to best engage or avoid said topics in a conversation with them, for example. Or if someone is super positive all the time, vs someone who's super sarcastic, vs someone who's super negative, etc. 
Small talk is a low risk way to figure out how someone operates socially, at least on a surface level, which is super useful to know. 
I think it's important to make the distinction between forced pleasantries versus small talk where you (or preferably both parties) are actively trying to learn more about each other to build comfort and rapport with your conversation partner. The former is what a lot of people really hate IMO. "
248,esfp,"People like to shit on small talk but you have to start with small talk. Imagine someone comes up to you and asks you ..I dunno, whatever deep question, right off the bat. Aren't you a little thrown off? Most people would find you pretty weird and probably not associate with you unless they're weird too.
It's just a risk not starting with small talk. It's like a cue you don't have social skills. Or you'd have to be pretty skilled/charming to pull it off anyway."
249,esfp,"For me, small talk never really happens, when I talk to someone, I dive deep, intentionally, if I'm making insignificant time with small talk I feel like I'm wasting time, i like to get right I there and find them deep secrets, wait wait, let me rephrase, any time spent talking to someone is never insignificant, I love talking to anyone and everyone I can, it's like a hunger I can never get full of. While I think small talk has its place, no one ever really has to have small talk as long as both ends are willing to contribute to a conversation. "
250,esfp,"I don't feel like any talk is invaluable. I'm not one for saying ""the weather is nice today"" I'm more so get right into they're likes and dislikes. Ask questions, I have a three question start and that gives me a feel for their personality. And then I'll start joking around a lot. And keep it light hearted, depending on how much I like them. "
251,esfp,"For me, small talk is what I do at work, talk with a customer or a co-worker you're not total friends with, just to buy time to prevent awkward situations of silence, ALSOOO I'm  not really good with small talk as I'll just try to talk to anyone about anything given the proper setting, like I work at a high end wine shop(college job but fun either way) and I'll talk to customers for as long as I can out of genuine excitement about learning of them. So to me, small talk is only as small as you make it! As for a general definition, I think it's as I said above haha just buying of time to prevent awkward silence!"
252,esfp,"I completely agree. 
Everyone is interesting to me in their own way! A high end wine shop? I bet you meet a ton of interesting people there. I actually miss working in a customer served type setting. Lol I made more money on tips back then. Now I get paid more, but no customer contact. I miss that!
Hope I'm not being to invasive but what are you going to school for? "
253,esfp,"Not invasive at all, I'm going for nursing! I love being around people and medicine is something that's always intrigued me, and I certainly do meet a lot of interesting people! Anywhere from your average joe, to filthy rich meanies who drop 4 grand on a few bottles of wine hahaha"
254,esfp,Interesting! I've been considering going to school for nursing. I also enjoy people and medicine! I worked for an herbalist for a while and it was one of the most fun jobs I've ever had! What year are you in?
255,esfp,"Haha, I wish, more just family issues, mainly just me not dedicating myself to the craft like I should have, I soak up my environment like a sponge, it's easy for me to get distracted, which makes it crazy difficult to do well in school "
256,esfp,"So I just retested to see my percentage scores in each of the E S F P traits. Here is what I got:
http://www.humanmetrics.com/hr/JTypesResult.aspx?EI=89&SN=62&TF=-62&JP=-78
do you think that these percentages matter that much with our type? I'm sure the ""on the fence"" ones matter"
257,esfp,What makes me different from other ESFP types? What about types that are borderlines feelers and thinkers? Or ESFP types that are an ambivert? If the percentages don't matter would that make all types a cookie cutter example? I'm just really curious about this.
258,esfp,"The MBTI is more about the cognitive tools you use to perceive the world than your personality. In my opinion the types should be called 'cognitive types' rather than 'personality types.' Under the theory, everyone is both a thinker and a feeler. The types designate which function takes precedent.
The E in 'ESFP' designates a dominant extraverted function, Se (Extraverted Sensing) more than it designates 'outgoing'. Se is the primary tool ESFPs use to perceive the world and it's one which harnesses their five senses in relation to the outside world. In-the-moment, physical, carnal experience is one of the things their lives are predicated on. You can be an introverted or ambiverted ESFP just fine, and yes, types are cookie cutter examples. They're archetypes."
259,esfp,"I'm an ESFP and all my really good friends have been, and are, intuitives (ENFJx2, ENTJ, INFJ, ENFP,).
I find while I have lots of sensor friends I enjoy, I don't actually connect as well as the N types.
Does any other ESFP find this? "
260,esfp,"I think it might depend on your upbringing too. I'm an ENFP and I have an ISFP brother, and ISFP mother, and an ESTJ brother. That means I'm really really comfortable around Sensing types even though we still clash sometimes because we're just not the same. I really appreciate the balance that sensors bring to my world and my closest friends are sensors who share my values. My ISFP brother loves hanging out with sensors, but ultimately finds them not interested in talking about the bigger picture, abstract topics he and I love talking about and I can only imagine that the reason why is because I forced him to exercise his Ni for about 25 years. :)"
261,esfp,"There are N types and N types.
ESFP uses the following functions - Se Fi Te Ni. As you can see, the last one is an intuitive function. Therefore, they'll relate to Ni users, to some extent. ENFJ, ENTJ, INFJ all use Ni as well. ENFP on the other hand is on the other perceiving axis, and uses Ne and Si.
​
I find that for a long time, it was hard to find people in my life that use Se and Ni over Ne and Si, so it was frustrating. But I get along with other Se users as well as Ni users.
And yes, I also have Ne friends as well."
262,esfp,"should actually be phrased as
the need for communication is one of humanity's greatest flaws; please do your best to master language to avoid problems.
this sort of makes sense, as esfps (and isfps) are (generally speaking) the most spontaneous of the sensor types, making it a lot easier to connect with and understand intuitives. (what surprises me most is how you got close to an infj, as thats really tricky even for other intuitives)"
263,esfp,"ESFP
Extravert(22%)  Sensing(1%)  Feeling(25%)  Perceiving(56)%
You have slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (22%)
You have marginal or no preference of Sensing over Intuition (1%)
You have moderate preference of Feeling over Thinking (25%)
You have moderate preference of Perceiving over Judging (56%)  
What is any of this s'posed to mean?"
264,esfp,"Jeez, I found that one even worse. Just yes/no is one thing.. Trying to fit myself into one word or another was even more of me staring at the screen like ugh, this reminds me of the personality exam for my last sales job.
I like that the first test is at least longer and gives you a breakdown of how you tended to choose, this one was like 25q's.. Oh you're a tough one, 5 more and then here's a percentage breakdown of where you match up. Uh, Ok?
Edit: thanks for the input, though."
265,esfp,"I took this one and found it to be extremely inaccurate. It even had to ask me 10 extra questions to get my answers. I just thought I'd share that so you could change your ""100% accuracy"" to whatever percentage it is now that I fucked it up. Hahha. "
266,esfp,"Thank you. I've been searching Google, Wiki etc to learn more.
Still think it seems a bit of bullshit (I'm biased against self reported and testing things like these) but this does describe certain aspects of my personality down to a T:  "
267,esfp,"Yea. This one is actually based on people who are that type responding to the questions.
And so far (from my experience) has a 100% accuracy.
Could you post your results (with the percentages)? As I said, the key is too look at the functions, not the letters."
268,esfp,"Now that you've explained it a bit more, that test seems even worse since its foundation is built on self reported types ""improving"" the results. 
So if the author's methodology is answer x to question y indicates z probability of gggg type but then at the end tons of ""oh I already know my type, this test is wrong people"" hit the 'if you already know your type, help improve the results' button and give their ""real"" type, their answers to the questions start shifting the probability towards whatever they self report, right? 
I really dislike this one compared to the other. It's shorter (smaller data set may make it difficult to draw meaningful and significant results) and doesn't include the percentage sway for each personality point, which I thought was at least somewhat useful/helpful with the regular test. 
I just wanted to get an idea of what Myers Briggs is.. Thanks for trying to help but I already have a deep grasp and understanding of who I am and aspects of my personality. 
Like I said before, I have a bias against self reported things like this. 
Edit: is your experience yourself btw? Lol. I don't remember the percentages but my top results are EP across the board and NT/NF/SF"
269,esfp,"That's the idea.
It's adaptive. The test changes depending on what you answer for the previous questions.
The results you posted in the OP are inaccurate. Myer's-Briggs is based on the functions (described on that website I posted), not on the letters. The letters are just a mapping. So you can't be ""more"" E than I for instance. That makes no sense. I types can be extroverts and E types can be introverts. MBTI has nothing to do with that.
It's actually the opposite. It causes people to misunderstand myers-briggs, and then they reject the system because of their misunderstanding. Most internet tests have questions that determine I/E, N/S, F/T, and J/P. Then they provide the percentage that you've answered one way or the other. Which is wrong. Doing it that way, I'd be an INTP. But I'm not. I'm an ISTP.
I'll sum it up then. Myers-Briggs is a variation/spin on Jung's personality types. Those are based on 8 different cognitive functions. 4 types, each with an introverted and extroverted versions. The lettering system maps each type to a series of four letters.
The four cognitive functions (and their extro/intro versions) are: I/E Thinking, I/E Feeling, I/E Sensing, and I/E Intuition.
Here are the functions matched up with the lettering system. As you can see, ESFP has extroverted sensing, introverted feeling, extroverted thinking, and introverted intuition in that order. That says a lot about how you think and how it shows up in your behavior/personality (provided you actually are an ESFP).
Alright then. I have a fairly good grasp on my own. Which is something I thought I had at one point, but it turns out I was depressed and misunderstood my actual personality (letting the depression get in the way).
The important thing to note is that Myers-Briggs isn't a test. It's a typing system. And it doesn't need to be self-reported. It just commonly is (and it's the fastest way of doing so).
Edit:
I'm talking the people who I know (myself included) that have taken the linked test, along with my own typing of them, and then their own responding to general type descriptions as well as what the typing means/describes. All of which have agreed that the particular type described them."
270,esfp,"While I always come up with an ESFP, and it makes a lot of sense to me, I struggle with introversion when I become sad or self-critical.  How do you guys combat that? Without throwing yourself into a social situation and ending up even less satisfied."
271,esfp,"Hi! I have depression and I've been seeing a psych about it. It's about mentally PUSHING yourself out of those moods. I've also been reading about the 5 second rule, and whenever you feel yourself starting to get OVERLY sad or OVERLY critical, to count 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and snap yourself out of it.
That being said, it's normal to feel sad, or self-critical to an extent. Where it becomes debilitating or you spiral into a mental pit is when it's not okay"
272,esfp,"Hrmm... my anxiety comes randomly so I can't relate... but what if you force yourself to snap out of it and focus on one of your passions or hobbies, or listen to a motivational talk (like on tedx)? Or happy music also helps as a distraction! All stuff that isn't social :)
I also wanted to add.. don't think anyone is extroverted or bubbly when they're sad or self-critical.. so what you're experiencing is normal. I don't think you should force yourself to be extroverted when you are in such a mood?"
273,esfp,"I don't think I'm prideful until my bf points it out to me. 
I tend to take critisism very poorly. I also am very proud of the things I make or put efford in to. I am also a leo, if that helps describe me. Im not very big on astrology so I attribute most of the ""leo"" characterstics to bei ng esfp."
274,esfp,"<--Male ENFP.
I just started dating a very nice girl (Japanese born and raised) who is an ESFP and I'm just curious what parts of her attitudes and actions might be more ESPF or more culturally Japanese?
Any thoughts, insight, ideas will be greatly appreciated.
I really like her so I want to be me but at the same time understand her without offending her.
thanks"
275,esfp,"Ehhhhh, tbh I'd just treat her as any other person instead of a conceptualized mishmash of characteristics resulting from her MBTI type and culture. MBTI only really describes personal tendencies and trends, and isn't an end all be all script for someone's life. 
But yes. To answer your question, Asian ESFP here. "
276,esfp,"are all of you the bold, daring, rule breaking, sports playing, alpha male jerk kind of personality that the internet makes you all look like? i scored ESFP on the official test 2 out of 3 times and i’m none of those things. i relate to Se for the most part, but not at all to the stereotypes, which is what makes me doubt everything about me being ESFP or even ESTP. "
277,esfp,"haha definitely not. The stereotypes are idiotic. Sure, there can be trends among different types, but ultimately people are individuals. Feel free to ignore stereotypes. I would focus more on the cognitive functions.
You see, Fi is often a value system. For me, breaking rules would go against my values. I am fairly good at sports, but I don't choose to play them. I am a natural leader, but my other ESFP friend is far from it (much more of a people pleaser). Every ESFP is going to look different from another."
278,esfp,"thank god! i do relate to the functions and some of the reactions from it (wanting everything RIGHT NOW, perfect example is Homer Simpson, another ESFP, saying “40 seconds? But i want it now!!”). maybe you don’t relate but i def do. also i do like to be active, love walking with my headphones in and just taking in the world. 
and yes i totally relate to the idea of a value system. however i don’t think mine is too well developed (i’m 19. also out of curiosity, what’s your age?). then again my actions speak otherwise (hate bullying and people committing crimes, thinking they’re above everyone else). 
then AGAIN, i’m very uncomfortable with my emotions and feelings, unable to verbalize them but wanting to, and think of myself as weak for having them. it may just be denial that i’m a feeler, because as a guy, i don’t feel as manly as the other men in my life (ALL THINKERS)."

280,esfp,"I am an ENFP in need of independence and space. These things help me grow. My mother is always well-meaning, but she will always annoy me with the littlest questions that have obvious answers. 
An example: It is 11:00 pm on Friday. I am sleeping soundly. My mother comes to wake me up asking if I need her to drive me anywhere tomorrow, knowing that my car is in the shop (major engine repair). She means well. She genuinely cares about me, but it always comes at the worst times. I do not react well to this, because if I were in her position it wouldn't be something I would wake someone up for. Tomorrow is Saturday- not an important day for transportation. Not a school day. I tell her that she needs to give me space when I'm sleeping (admittedly in an upset tone). She doesn't hear my message at all and says that that is not how you speak to your parent. 
Why does she seem so compelled to come wake me up from my sleep to ask me questions that have obvious answers? 
This happens quite often. I would often be in my room, studying with the intense focus of a thousand lasers. All of the sudden, she comes in and asks me to drop everything and immediately go help her take the groceries from her car to the kitchen. She never understands that I need space, and she takes my reactions personally as if I don't appreciate her. I can't always be ready to help her do these small tasks at a moment's notice. 
My father, an INTJ, always knows when I need space. I tell him in a calm voice, ""Can you give me some space, I'm working hard right now."" He'll usually respond with, ""Ok come out when you have time"" or ""I need your help with something in half an hour."" And that's that. He backs off, gives me space, and I go help him when I'm able to. 
Anyway, how can I better communicate with my mother? I know she means well, but these constant pokes and prods are incredibly annoying to deal with. 
Thank you for any insight you may provide. I really appreciate it. "
281,esfp,"I don't think I would be annoyed by what she does. I understand it can get bothersome, but it's not a big deal. To explain without going into MBTI, she wants to take care of things when she thinks of it before she forgets because she will forget. You can be frank with her and have a talk. I don't like it when people are passive. "
282,esfp,"I never thought of it that way. This is too true! 
It's just difficult for me to get in the zone. When I'm disturbed or interrupted with some little thing, it just breaks my rhythm, and it can be hard to return to the task I was working on. 
It takes a lot for me to be so inspired about something to work on it that much, but when I am in the zone, little nuances become magnified. 
I'll talk to her about it then. I just want her to think things through a bit more. "
283,esfp,"i had my last crush shortly after my ex and i broke up. this guy was my ex's best friend, but also my best friend too. break up was about 3 months ago.
my crush supported me throughout the break up and was really sweet and lovely, and i fell for him real quick. turned out we both like each other, but we both agreed to not do anything bc it'd be disrespectful to my ex and also bc we're better off as just friends.
we flirt at school and ppl can c the chemistry even tho we try keep it subtle. we giggle a lot and get physical/tickle each other/shove each other around. he makes fun of me and i tease him, and we know a lot about each others lives and interests. i think i know him the best tbh. we text almost everyday and talk all the time at school too.
he got a girlfriend, and i got involved with a guy (we're now fuckbuddies and i still dunno how i feel about him). 
still my feelings towards my crush are pervasive. i c him everyday and really like him, he's so sweet. he talks abt his gf sometimes, but when we're together we usually just talk about whatever. he told me he still liked me a little, and that made me get major butterflies.
i accidentally made a move on him at a party. i got really drunk (and yes its my responsibility, im accountable) and sat on his lap and kissed his cheek a few times, and told him i still liked him. he was fine with it, it was a little awkward afterwards honestly but things seem back to normal now.
anyways. he still asks me if im ok every few days, and tickles me, and we giggle in class together. and i still look forward to seeing him everyday. i love him so much even just as a friend, and feelings will die down, but im just so happy to have him in my life ! im glad his gf makes him happy and i would never get in the way of that again. 
hope i fall in love again soon

284,esfp,"I'm an INFP with an ESFP sister. She does have ADHD, but even so let's say she is messy, leaves things around the house, is not following on a decision through in a smart way, just anything... When i mention it, instead of taking the responsibility or even just listening to what i'm (or frankly any of my family members are saying) she just screams OKKKK I WILL and then never does it.... or just proceeds to yell that everyone is attacking her. All we are saying though is just to PPICK UP THE REMOTE UCHHH. It's so frustrating. 
I found what helps is saying in a calm voice something like ""There is this thing on the floor and it's preventing the room from being messy, since these are your things, can you please pick it up?"" Like breaking it step by step i guess helps...
Does anyone have any other suggestions? Drives me crazy!!!!!!
Thanks"
285,esfp,This isn't an ESFP problem it's an I have an immature sibling problem. I mean I have ADHD and it's no excuse to be irresponsible if she is medicated. hopefully it will improve with age but I think this is the wrong place to be asking for advice. Any type can be a brat.
286,esfp,I am an ESFP and I think I am trying to turn into an ESFJ. Pls 2 halp. Hacking into an ESFJ's brain is fucking hard. I'm also having trouble coming out of inferior Ni grip. Any solid solutions and steps I can take? I'm trying diet and exercise but mentally it's really damn hard. Plus I have ADHD which makes it even harder.
287,esfp,"Sup dude. I had this same problem when I had to take the MBTI in my business classes. The infp who originally showed me MBTI told me to check out the functions for each type to truly understand what I am. I also have ADHD, but go figure considering who we are. First, think about Extraverted Sensing as your primary function... if you don't have a strong grasp on how it works do some research on google. It already sounds like you understand inferior Ni... which I fucking hate to have as well. It will make up feel anxious and worried out of nowhere because we are wayyyy too in the moment. Sure you could say that you're 'trying' to turn into an ESFJ but look at the functions of an ESFJ and conclude whether or not you could transition to that type. Also keep in mind that us ESFP's are natural actors wherein we can put on the mask of any type. stay true to your actual functions "
288,esfp,"I feel this. I'm an ambiverted xSFP but I spent most of my life trying to be xSFJ. Trying to force Si and Fe and organizational skills was just making me dig myself into this big terrible hellhole. 
Just understand your functions and learn to accept how they effect you"
289,esfp,"I'm an INTJ male with a ESFP female friend.
I've noticed recently that there has been a lack of conversation and general get together.
I understand ESFPs normally need new experiences to keep interests. As an INTJ, I have trouble with this. 
I've considered just letting her go for a bit.
Would that help maintain the friendship or would that disconnect us completely?"
290,esfp,"In my experience ESFP usually desires some sort of immediacy, whether it's physical, digital, etc. 
I think if you leave her alone for a bit, you'll just drop off her radar honestly. We stay busy with whatever's in the near future."
291,esfp,"I agree with the other person, let her go and she will probably stay gone. We stay in the moment and unless you're like a BFF we'll probably move on. If you ever wanna reconnect in the future it's kind of 50/50 whether she'll be down for it. Some people I stop talking to and then reconnect months or years later but occasionally I get mad at people for losing contact and never talk to them again."
292,esfp,"ESFP here. If I love someone be it friend or more than a friend, they will always be apart of my life. I'm okay with doing the same things over and over with them because it's what they like doing, and I care about them, and if you're truly friends they will also do new experience with you as well. You can't just say, ""well I'm an ESFP and this is how I work, if you don't work this way our friendship won't last."" That's just ignorance and a lack of care for loved ones. A friend is a friend regardless of there personality type, there is always give and take on both sides of a friendship. If you want to stay connected, make it known to your friend, and if they are a true friend they will stay connected with you. Hope this helps!!"
293,esfp,"ESFP here. I have a problem with keeping ""new"" friends because some of them just fade. I'm active on OKCupid and most of the time, the date fades into a friendship and fades further into nothingness because there is nothing new to keep me interested."
294,esfp,"Alright, I see what you mean. We've been friends for about 4 months and she's stated that I'm her ""Best Friend"" and I consider her as my Closest Friend at the moment (Though I feel this might mean two different things for ESFPs and INTJs) Would such a declaration allow me some off time? (I think she's become a bit bored with me, also I have anxiety issues that link with her [That's a whole 'nother deal], that's why I'm a bit in need of a small break from her, but I really care about her and enjoy her company)
Thanks for the reply! :D"
295,esfp,Just tell her that. You enjoy her but sometimes you need a breather. I had a hard time understanding that a few years ago. But now I get it. Certain things drain different people. For me it's overly emotional people lol for you it's just people lol
296,esfp,"ESFP: Can I write in this book?
Me, ENFJ: Yeah, sure. 
ESFP: Wow, thanks! I like writing in books because you are not technically supposed to-- but doing it just makes me feel free and like I can just live my life however I want to.
Me, inside: You just do that. Live your free life.
ESFPs are some of the funnest, cutest human beings in the universe. "
297,esfp,"just curious. going thru 1 myself (2/3 months ago) and was wondering if its similar for yall ? 
for me, the first month was absolute shit. i cried all the time, drank for a week straight and emotionally rebounded with a good friend. the next month, i felt a little calmer + honestly numb but i would randomly start crying with random triggers ? eg. i could easily joke about the break up and stuff but then at some point when someone asked me what happened (plenty of people have asked before but this 1 time) i just started crying for like 3 hours.
​
its been 3 months now and im recovering but i was wondering if its normal to feel like thsi ? i feel really numb most of the time and when i c him i dont feel much except for awkwardness but when he crosses my mind , thats when i feel sad ? ?idk
anyways. share ur breakup stories i guess yea !"
298,esfp,I recently broke up with my gf of 8 months. Best time of my life. It didn’t impact me as hard as yours for some reason even though I really loved her. I always guessed it was because of paranoia and trust issues that it didn’t affect me too much originally. I was depressed for a week then was fine. We had decided to be friends but I couldn’t stand seeing her anymore (ldr) and we cut ties a few days ago. It’s been a stressful week and I’m not sure how I feel in all honesty 
299,esfp,"Hey!! if whoever you are, you'll be just fine. I promise. I have been cheated on twice. one after a 1.5 year relationship and the other a 5 year. it's tough. like that shit is beat. Buuuut after half a year, I found I love myself and that person doesnt deserve me. It takes one step at a time but if you tell yourself once a day, one day at a time, that you love yourself, you WILL make it through. Stay health, take care of yourself  and love yourself."
300,esfp,"Oh no... break ups are the worst. I'm so sorry :(
Every one of mine has been different and it always depends on how strongly I feel about my ex. The worst I've had so far was my first boyfriend and I was 14. I guess I have horrible taste in men cause my other boyfriends through my teens were all douchebags... breaking up with them was never sad. I'm with an amazing guy now (3yrs) and I imagine breaking up with him would absolutely crush me.
is this your first relationship? If not how did you react to your other breakups?"
301,esfp,"hey thank u for replying!
im so sorry  to hear all that shit man, you deserve better and you'll find someone who actually deserves u, dont ever settle for less !!
thanks for ur advice. i'm starting to exercise and cut down carbs, so my health is probably imrpoving ! xox"
302,esfp,"hey ! im 17 , this is my first serious relationship and i got dumped :( 
i suppose thats the same with me, my first ""relationship"" lasted 6 days hahah. the breakup process was easier except that he was my best friend, and stopped talking to me for 2 years afterwards
do u think the poor taste in men thing is a teenage exclusive thing in ESFP's? cause i sure hope i find someone right for me soon.
and how old were u when u met ur current guy? "
303,esfp,"Overall I’m still just as energetic and lively as I normally am, but towards the breakup I’ve been told I seem numb or less attentive as normal when I’m questioned about it. For me it’s just common to sort of push back problems which makes me seem numb, I guess that’s a coping mechanism. Other times I overthink situations which also makes me seem numb "
304,esfp,"God that is so rough and I can see why it would be hard to recover... Wishing you all the best <3
I honestly don't think anyone knows what they truly want/need from a partner until they're an adult, so having poor taste during teenage years is probably something all types experience
I met him when I was 12 but we were best friends until we started dating when I was 19 (him 23) ... almost 3 years together now
You'll find someone amazing and perfect for you - just hang in there :)"
305,esfp,"hey thank you for the reply !! u r too sweet 
and yeah i think u do have a point, teenagers are pretty inexperienced and dunno what direction they're going. i'll just wait and try understand what i want !
thank u sm !!! oxoxox best of luck with you and your wonderful guy"
306,esfp,"I've (22M) been super close with an ex girlfriend (21F) who's an ESFP. Her and I have a ton of history. The issue is that in the process of being in a relationship before, I hurt her. My more aggressive nature tends to take over and I made some mistakes which now led to her and I being exs. That was 2 years ago now. I adore her, I love taking care of her and we've been close and talking about dating.  She used to adore me too, she still does but she's apprehensive. Now another guy has started to get in the middle and she's been pulling away needing her space to think over her life and family drama. I admit I've gotten lazy with her and I.
       I also have to admit I don't take the space and lack of communication well. I'm concerned about losing her again and I'm looking for the best way to approach this with her. She's been super distant and that's really hurt me. I'm hoping you guys can provide some insight on where to go from here. I'm hopefully going to see her soon. But every time we plan to meet she's been flaky. I want to ride this out with her but I'd like some insight from the other side of things. She doesn't deal with conflict well which i get and I've always been understanding of, but my instinct tends to go that way when I feel things go wrong. I'm a fixer so when u face an issue I try to dive in. 
      Any suggestions on how I should approach this with her?? I've thought over this for a while and I think I know what I want to say but any more information would be greatly appreciated :-)"

308,esfp,"Me: I just wanna be the most hyper and edgy kid amongs everybody.. tbh i am just another attention seeker. I am nothing but a person with high ego, and low self-esteem. In real life I wouldn't be as confident to act like i do online.. I guess that's a good thing from keeping me out of trouble. But the drive is still there, my desire to be noticed by people is far from gone. I've acted hyper irl several times, and it never ended well. I got ignored, ridiculed, persecuted, bullied, and even confronted for what they call as misbehaviour. I might not be an INTP, but i just can't help but notice how the INTP chat is much more loose and tolerating towards people like me. I want something to be proud of, yet lack the ambition to get it. So i started dwelling on my internal side, trying to convince myself that i have something to be proud of, like a high iq. I also seek much more things from the material world than most intps, and i also like physical affection a lot more than verbal affection.. i might just be an esfp, i guess from now on i'll adjust myself from being a hyper edgy androgynous nerd into something society itself is familiar with. As much as i want to stand out, life for me won't be as smooth sailing if i don't be a normie.. 
I've been bullied by the smart kids at high school for being too 'shallow and tacky'.. I just wanna be noticed and admired
I live in a third world, developing country where first world countries like the United States is most admired by people.I then faked being an american by doing stupid stuffs like speaking english on a daily basis, scrolling through us political pages on Instagram, or scrolling through Yahoo News just to get noticed by my classmates for how 'American' i am compared to them. I have really little interest on actually reading and understanding the news, but much more on 'what others might perceive me as'. Although I know deep down that my classmates aren't really interested nor impressed by my things, i just can't help but to satisfy my desire... And in the process i feel a bit uncomfortable and a bit embarrassed because i know that my classmates would just perceive me as 'someone dumb who wants to get noticed for being out there'
I am used on 'American' things now
For example, I have zero interest on keeping up with news of my country's, because i consider most of them to be barbaric and uncivilized in nature, too chaotic and close minded etc... So i am a bit behind when it comes to what's currently happening in my own country.. People call me ""unpatriotic' and 'picky' for that
I guess im a sensor knowing im the type of person to choose a car solely based on it's look
For a sensor who loves physical affection and material things, i surely am not intrigued by my 'close surrounding'.. it's true that i basically underestimate anything 'local'"
309,esfp,"I can't think of much, and maybe this won't apply to you, but I always get discouraged when my peers are more organized and goal oriented than me. I think its important to realize that everyone is different, and though we have a different approach, we can still easily achieve the same results. We just have more fun."
310,esfp,"I'm an INTJ figured I'd come check out ESFP because if I could, I would be an ESFP. Makes sense that nobody is here lol. ESFP is most represented in the real world and least represented in internet world. lol"
311,esfp,"With such a decent percentage of ESFPs (statistically speaking anyway) I am surprised there isn't more activity in here!  But as it goes, we are usually the ones out enjoying things and being the life of the party instead of sitting here talking about it.  ;)"
312,esfp,"decent percentage? I'm intrigued, what with 16 possible types, how many of us are there supposed to be? One theory I have is that maybe ESFPs are not the type to take surveys, so that's the reason why this is less active...?"
313,esfp,"I think I saw one figure that indicated around 9%ish of the population? But I could be making that up. You're right about being less prone to take tests/surveys. Either way, it's nice to at least see some other folks in here!"
314,esfp,"If nothing is stopping me I'll defo sleep until at least lunch hours(I remember waking up at 5-6 PM for a while lol). I've always made sure my current job won't involve waking up too early, because anything earlier than 8-9 AM is crazy for me. I can't physically go to bed until past midnight, regardless of when I have to wake up. But if I have to wake up early for something exciting I don't mind waking up at like 4 in the morning
How is your sleeping schedule?"
315,esfp,"My favorite ESFP is having a surprise birthday party in a few weeks.  I already got her a gift for her birthday (a deck of Exploding Kittens card game) but saw her early so gave it to her for Xmas.  I told her it was for both Xmas and Birthday, since I'm poor can't afford much.  But wanted to surprise her with another gift because it is a surprise party and her 40th.  What inexpensive item or ticket or whatever could I give her for her b-day?  I'm INFJ, if that matters."
316,esfp,"It's winter in this hemisphere so I'll assume you're from here, you could get her a cute beanie or knit one if you have time and can do that. Personally I like getting gifts that say the person knows me well, like memorabilia from my favorite TV show or a gift card to my favorite store or something."
317,esfp,"Hi all, 
I am a coder, and as an ESFP, I couldn't have chose a more depressing career. I am at my desk all day staring at my screen in a small, quiet office going absolutely OUT.OF.MY.MIND.
I just did it at uni because back then I didn't do much besides gaming (huuuuge self esteem issues that I have mostly fixed), but now I still struggle with abstract concepts and its really ruins my mental state by the end of every working day (combines with lack of social interaction at work).
​
I guess I have accepted I will need to change jobs, but I am kind of worried and would love to hear what some of you do/how you got there?"
318,esfp,"I’m a year from finishing my undergrad in Ecological Studies. I’ll have to go to grad school, and probably get my PhD eventually, but I think it’ll be worth it. I want to be something along the lines of a wildlife biologist, zoologist, wildlife researcher, etc. . I’ll get to travel and spend lots of time outside. (I’ll also have to spend a lot of time inside writing field reports but no job is perfect.). It’ll be hands on, I’ll get paid to travel, and everyday will be something a little different. I love animals and I’m really excited for it. "
319,esfp,"I am in my last year of my undergrad in a Bachelor of Public Relations and I am hoping to be part of an agency or freelance in the future. I really enjoy it, and I’m excited I see where it takes me later on. I think there are a lot of options out there for PR depending on what peaks your interest. I wish I could give you more guidance, but I think you should follow your heart and make a big change in your career. You’re obviously unhappy and the time you spend miserable at work is just time that could be spent looking at other positions! Good luck with everything."
320,esfp,"This may not be helpful. I’m a physical therapist.. I am around people all day which is nice, but can’t say I’m satisfied with my career choice. I’ve been trying to pinpoint what it is.. i think it’s partly I don’t like feeling that others depend on me and I don’t like my schedule being set for me. Definitely understand why you feel the way you do, especially with the lack of interaction. Kudos for recognizing your dissatisfaction and being willing to make a change!"
321,esfp,I'm finishing up school and starting my career in commercial photography and it's pretty great. Right now I'm focusing a lot on retouching (working right now but always distracted haha) simply because it's good paying work I can do from anywhere. I'm trans and still in the really early stages of my transition so I'm afraid I won't be able to get a lot of assisting work simply because people suck haha so I'm trying to put a lot into work that doesn't matter if I confuse people with my looks. But I plan to diversify my work and root it in people. I can't work anywhere near product photography and architecture is ehhh. I love retouching portraits since I get to stare at people still and connect with them lol But yeah I love working with people and translating their feelings to photos!
322,esfp,"Small, quiet office? Sounds like an absolute dream for any INXX, lol. (and probably others)
But anyway...
You could consider accepting and embracing the abstract concepts and just practice them more and more.
Everyone can get better at just about anything with practice. It'll become easier and feel more natural. Think of it as writing with your offhand... or your feet.
People who have horrible accidents learn to write with those just fine :0
​
Though, in the spirit of full disclosure, I would never tell an ENFP or ENTP to stick with something they don't like. "
323,esfp,"I am a medical biller/coder in a small office. I ask myself how in the heck this happened just about every day. It was a job I kind of just fell into, and I happened to make a career out of it. It can be mentally stimulating, which is great, but I totally get what you mean about going out of your mind with the quiet and lack of interaction.
I have this little problem of always being unsettled in every job (and relationship, and hobby, and the list goes on). I would love to go back to school to get a degree in something I would find fulfilling, but I can't think of any profession that would keep me interested and happy for life (and be worth the thousands to re-do college).
What's your dream job? If you do change jobs, what kind of job will you look for?"
324,esfp,"Nice suggestion. PR has always interested me, it is just the kind of Corporate Cover-Stories side of it that kinda worries me and I feel like that authenticity driver in me would feel constant moral conflict. I am going to look into that though because I am sure there is a lot more to PR than that.
​
Thanks."
325,esfp,"I feel like if I were in your position, it would be the rules and schedule that comes with that dependency on you. 
​
That is fair though, I think being able to find some enjoyment is very important. Do you think you will stick around in that career or is it starting to effect you ?
​"
326,esfp,"Wow, such a great response. First of all, I wish you all the best for your transition :D. Secondly, commerical photography? Awesome! I don't mean to talk down your work, but photography always scared me for a job, due to the highly competitive nature of it (same thing for most arts/creative jobs). I have really always enjoyed taking nice shots and our type knows what 'looks good' and what is 'photograph-able'. Are you able to share a bit more about what your work is like/how did you study this? (uni? self-taught?)
​
Being a coder, I can see huge salary potential and I don't see that with many of the suggested ESFP careers. So I feel like I am constantly keeping an eye out for a happy medium because I am anything but happy these days coding."
327,esfp,"True that. To be honest since this post, I have felt that I am getting better at my work, and the bad feelings are not so present. 
I was actually thinking about it last night - that I was closing myself in a box  because I am an ESFP, and it just means it takes more effort, rather than it being impossible and soul crushing."
328,esfp,"We sound quite similar there! I find the stimulating moments great too. And I too can relate to the unsettled feeling in everything. Sometimes I can't even describe why I am not quite satisfied in any of those areas. I had a great job that I left due to that feeling.
It puts a pin in me dropping everything to go do something else because I just point out all the reasons I'd probably end up unsettled/unhappy doing it.
Most of my dream jobs are hard to humour due to my salary being a lot higher in computer science than it'd ever be into the other careers that'd make me happier like working with animals, but I'd love a sense of purpose.
​
I think I could find a happy medium kind of pivoting to do a more social job within tech in a company that is a bit more philanthropic. How about you?
​
Appreciate the response :)"
329,esfp,"Well the undergrad is just like any undergrad program, but the graduates programs will be hands on with a lot of lab and field work. It doesn’t feel like school as much as actual experience. Same thing for a doctorates program. That’s a lot of why I chose to go into natural sciences. It’s always been something I’ve been interested in, even though the pay isn’t fantastic. It’s a very hands on career field, with tons and tons of options. There’s a lot of graduate and doctorates programs that pay you to do them, since there’s so much hands on work involved, like TAing, and research. So even though it’s not a great paying field, at least it saves me a lot of student debt. 
So yeah it’s a lot of school, but it’s not traditional sitting in a classroom all day kinda school. "
330,esfp,"Oh also depending on where you go to school, the classes can be a lot of fun and not feel a lot like school. One of the classes I’m in this semester meets for an hour once a week and has very little homework and no tests. After the semester ends we’re flying out to a research station in the Mojave Desert for a week.  We’ll get to go on hikes across the desert, work with the researchers, and catch lots of lizards!!
Next year I’m taking a class that has the same structure, and a two week trip to Costa Rica. 
I’m at a state school so it’s hella cheap (comparatively) and the trips only cost $1000-$2000 and are covered by financial aid. It can be a lot of work but I can also be a lot of fun!!"
331,esfp,"Thanks! And actually commercial photography isn't really competitive, unlike in the arts community. That's kind of annoying for me though, I want a challenge and all my classmates as passive as hell lol I go to a technical school, so they cut out all the arts and most of the core classes so it's very focused on being a working photographer. So a lot is self directive and some students really aren't that great because of that. So like I personally don't really ""take"" photos that often; I make them. I focus mostly on portraits and am very detail oriented, which is a skill that helps me be the top retoucher in school lol So like ideally I want a fulltime job with health insurance simply so I can transition easier, but I'm probably going to have to go freelance just cuz most studio's take a long time of interning (often without pay) to get even a low paying job. It's all about connections and staying present in people's minds. So like as a retoucher I need to reach out to a lot of photographers with images I feel I can work on and ask to do free test work with them and keep communication, and also work well with them so they recommend you. Newsletter's and actual mailed things are pretty great. And so people will hit me up with jobs and either I charge hourly or estimate it. Like if you're doing bulk corporate headshots then by the hour, but if it's a magazine cover then it's by the job itself. But if you're a photographer then it's all about knowing the directors and producers and having a lot of experience in assisting. One of my teachers still does a lot of assisting since it's work and pretty simple and helps fill in the gaps between bigger jobs. Sorry this was kinda rambly lol but yeah commercial photography is all about connections and basically having a big friend group lol There is competition but not that much, especially not with pricing otherwise you fuck up everyone's incomes and you'll get in trouble if you're in a union haha It's a lot different working direct with the client like weddings and stuff and that's all too full of drama and not enough money for me lol 
tldr you gotta be friends with everyone which is my dream haha"
332,esfp,"I'd love to be a magazine or book editor, or do something artistic. But those could be lonely jobs for me, too. I originally went to school to be a therapist, but that I tend to carry other people's emotions around and that was a terrible fit for me. I don't know if I'll ever feel settled. It's hard to describe, but I sometimes think that discontentedness is what makes me feel like...me. Like I'm not happy unless I'm constantly pushing against that settled feeling. I could very easily fall into a comfortable life doing what I do, but I'm not very good at being comfortable. It's like my entire body and mind rebel against it. Do you get like that too?"
333,esfp,"I had a crappy childhood, so obviously I was home alone and didn't socialize. I was alone most of the time and thought I liked it. Then I did the test and was like ""Oh, I actually like socialization and being the centre of attention... I'm just terrified of people because they're horrible."""
334,esfp,"I'm an ESFP but have considered myself ambivert, smoking weed made me more introspective and comfortable being alone, but when I am in social situations my ESFP comes out, also anxiety is big for ESFP's (speaking for myself), when you love the attention but are also anxious a part of staying in is to avoid uncomfortable scenarios that I've imagined "
335,esfp,Me too. I had a crappy upbringing and so I get anxiety a lot. This makes me a lot less social than my preference. It took me ages to figure out. I think I just eventually realised that going out and being around people always perks me up.
336,esfp,"Purposefully avoiding uncomfortable situations isn't as satisfying as learning how to handle them, you look more confident if you don't do it, just embrace the fact that sometimes you will look like a fool and that's okay, you shouldn't worry about that"
337,esfp,"Hi, INTJ here. I am working on my ESFP-identification skills and want to know what you think about Chris Taylor if you have the time.
Here is a 24 minutes long interview with him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5abbTOzs_Vc&list=PLzsTvqyBRGv2HNUFi5XMhDnflvMm9Ll_h&feature=share&index=3"
338,esfp,"Hey, sorry you aren't getting a lot of action with this post! I think ESFPs are not wildly into analyzing details like this, unfortunately. For example, I doubt many here know much about the ENFP type or what would distinguish us from them. "
339,esfp,"Do not worry mate! Whenever I post something to reddit I am fully prepared for it to be ignored or down-voted. It took me a couple of minutes to post so it is no big loss.
I think the main reason this sub is slow is because ESFPs are extroverts and so are very much less likely to be spending time on-line."
340,esfp,You guys are full of deep questions just like us - next time you find yourself with one post it here. Of course being an ESFP chances are that you will end up distracted by something fun before you actually login...
341,esfp,"A shy ESFP O.o I guess it makes sense though: one can live a pretty full and extrovert life without talking too much.
Though being shy on an anonymous forum is pretty silly. One of my posts could have reached the front page if it was in a default sub and I can tell you people will upvote the most stupid things while many more interesting ones are downvoted so do not mind about this kind of thing."
342,esfp,"Wtf man. 
We chase you back if we like you, if not we don’t like it when we are being chased by people we don’t like. 
But we usually like people so we generally okay with being chased.
Does that make sense to you? Bitch."
343,esfp,"I am, but I haven't always been. I used to be quite the opposite, actually! Always very opinionated, but I have become surprisingly more graceful and kind to those who disagree with me now than I ever was before I became a feminist. Not that the two are correlated. I just think I'm growing up."
344,esfp,"Definitely! I feel like I wanna be a part of this new wave of feminism and would never change my mind on that. However, it's only for the last two years that I've identified myself as a feminist, before that I was highly skeptical and thought it was about hating men and what not. Feel pretty silly about it now."
345,esfp,"I'd contend that ESFPs are most inclined towards activism in general, due to Se + Fi being their two strongest functions . 
Let's (etymologically) break it down: 
""Activ"" = doing in the present moment = Extraverted Sensation 
""Ism"" = values and ideology = Introverted Feeling
Hell, can we just call ESFPs ""activists"" from now on?
EDIT: Put introverted sensation instead of introverted feeling"
346,esfp,"Egalitarian is the way to go! Feminism is ruined. All you good feminists, cast away your female rights and angry protesting and just leave it for the extremists. Bring us your noble ideals of freedom, gender role dismantling and  equality so we can condemn the feminists sexists and move on into a better world!"
347,esfp,"Listen to her when she gives you advice. We don't just dole it out randomly, we do it for a reason. Enfps have an awful time accepting they have a poor grasp on reality and are stubborn taking advice that conflicts with NeFiLand.
If she doesn't want to go deeper into discussion or get philosophical about something then change subjects. This is the best way to make her hate you.
Oh and don't be passive-aggressive/shady when you're moody. Be upfront. Enfp moods change about 200 times a day and my enfp friends sometimes just randomly stop talking to me for weeks when they get in a mood. I guess they think it's easier to make me wonder than to actually tell me what is going on. Also read this comment."
348,esfp,"Oh, I never keep her in the dark. She does that to me sometimes, but mostly because I get overly protective of her. Her advice is 90% of the time the only thing that can change my mind.
I realize that I need a lot of work regarding practical thinking, so that's one of the many reasons why I am grateful for her presence in my life."
349,esfp,"Recently I have become more self aware, and more self conscious if my behavior. And I keep finding myself wishing I hadn't said something or another. I am constantly worried about annoying my peers by talking too much. Does anyone else experience this?"
350,esfp,"Ya, but you just gotta be your best most positive self and do your best!  One thing to remember is that people don't remember what was talked about or who said what. People just remember if a night was generally fun or not. If one comment falls short, there is always time to make up for it, don't worry about it.  worrying causes hesitation which is no good. "
351,esfp,"Hey fellow Realists.
Tired of condescension, scrolling through walls of boring text, intuitive ramblings, and nerdy discourse?
Head over to /r/sensor, a fun sub where anyone is welcome and we don't turn down for nothing.
xoxo,
The mods at /r/sensor"
352,esfp,"I can fall in love so easy and get tired so easy too. 6 months ago I broke up with my 3 years gf, she was an ENTJ. Was a good relationship, but man, I always look for the harmony so Im good detecting problems, but I dont like to focus on the problem, I like to focus on solutions. Guess what? My gf focused a lot in the problem. Too many rules and too many complains burned me out. Im a guy with a huge patience, some people say patience is a virtue, but in this case my patience was the main problem because I let many things happen that fucked me up. I realized that I didnt love her anymore when i didnt wanna have sex with her no more."
353,esfp,"Currently with an INFJ right now and she's seriously awesome.  It definitely takes a bit of understanding on both ends, but I think we click together perfectly. She's the best part of me, and I learn how to be a better person from her all the time without her knowing it. I show her I love her in my overly enthusiastic ways, and she shows it back by letting me inside her walls. "
354,esfp,"I have been married now for 14 years to my entp husband. He makes me laugh, he’s fascinating, and he can drive me up the wall with his caution and his constant worrying about the future but he adores me. I drive him batty with my impulsivity and my emotions but he is a constant in my life and he makes me feel safe and I make him take some risks. It’s great!  We both are committed to making this work and he is an incredible dad to our 3 kids.  Find someone who makes you feel safe and aren’t runners. Do I think I could find someone who doesn’t make me this crazy?  NO!  Do I think I could find someone that makes me this happy?  NO.  I miss the excitement of new relationships but I would never sacrifice what I have for the excitement of something new. 
Keep looking!  We can commit!"
355,esfp,"My boyfriend's an INTJ and as weird as it sounds, it's actually going pretty well! He likes discussing about political ideologies/theories (topics that I sometimes like or dislike) and much to my surprise, he makes the topics very interesting. Sometimes, he would also help me digest and understand what I'm currently reading. He's also very patient and understanding with me. He's the yin to my yang ☯❤"
356,esfp,"A year into dating my ENFJ boyfriend. I just didn't get sick of him long enough for us to become official! Hahaha. But I was definitely extremely resistant early on, feeling my commitment-phobia surfacing, but that was definitely more prevalent due to my iffy mental space during a bad 2018.
​
He plays a mentor role to me, and loves to teach. I love to learn, and have a bit of anxiety about the future, so he helps me out there immeasurably."
357,esfp,I'm an INFJ and my ex husband is an ESFP. I never really understood why the two types are supposed to be incompatible. Aside from our stubborn nature's we clicked really well. Even after the divorce we are still pretty good friends.
358,esfp,"See, I may get angry and emotional and express that. But in reality. I am not artistic in any way, I am monotone as fuck on stage. I cant even draw a flower, and I cant sing. and zero fashion taste. the only thing I can see myself doing is Early childhood because I love kids and it would be so much fun to be creative all day and not act like a kid! woah! 
but has anyone else had this problem? I take every test made and it still gives me ESFP, am I a failure at my personality because of this? "
359,esfp,"First, understand and remember that you do not do things because you are an ESFP, instead you are an ESFP because of things you do, how you think, feel and act in certain situations. In fact, it feels strange even to say that someone is a certain type, again it is their actions that are typical for a certain type.
Second, as an ESFP I recognize myself in your description. I can't draw, can't sing, my hand writing is terrible etc. I do however feel quite creative in coming up with solutions, explaining things to others etc. I also love to help and entertain people, kids included.
Third, for me, when learning about personality types, myself and others around me I have gotten much more understanding from looking at my temperament (SP) than the full ESFP type. This is also clear from the archetype word attributed to these, as Artisan (ESFP) feels a little strange but Problem Solver (SP) is right on the money.
One of my favorite books on this subject is ""What Type Am I?"". It is a short and simple read which gives a lot of insight into MBTI personality types and the four temperaments (NT, NF, SJ, SP) and how they interrelate."
360,esfp,"The Myers Briggs personality types aren't that rigid where if you're an ESFP you must love to party, entertain, and live in the moment. Everyone is different and the personality types aren't supposed to be one size fits all. 
Before I saw this I actually just posted a selfpost asking about which traits apply to them and which don't and I think it's true that almost no one is 100% an ESFP according to the personality page but thats what makes everyone unique certainly not a bad thing.
As for careers you should do what you want to do don't limit yourself to the websites saying ESFPs can only do x y or z do what you're ood at and what you love if thats early childhood then go for it!"
361,esfp,"Your reason for being monotone on stage, not being able to draw a flower, being unable to sing, having zero fashion taste may be that you aren't invested in those things and you don't really care about them.  In my experience I have never seen myself as an artist, but one day I was inspired to sketch something I had seen the day before and it came out beautiful.  I was astounded that my attention could even stay focused on that sketch for the hour and a half it took.  I have not made a decent sketch before that day or since, but I know that if i'm inspired to do it, then I probably can.  Same with acting, when I read a script and love it (this is coming from some high school theater) and I can really identify with my character, I immerse myself in the thoughts and feelings of that character and become that character on stage.  That happened twice, but in every other play I tried out for I couldn't find a single character I could become and didn't do the plays.  Same with singing for me, I played the piano for a few years and according to friends and some randoms acquaintances at a party, my playing of the piano and singing of Daniel Powter-Bad Day was better than the original, but no other song was that way for me.  To me it's all based on immersion into the topic or activity that does it.
Tl;Dr-Immerse yourself in the topic/activity and see if it truly interests you and you will find that you have those skills you previously thought you didn't have."
362,esfp,"wow, thank you! this is actually very helpful. I can relate to ESFP as my type because most are true rather then others. and I guess its true that because I do most things I would have scored higher on the scale. but on S/ N I tied. but It gave me S instead because I guess I related to it more. 
but the one I scored the highest on [62%] was feeling! and that to me says it all. I am very open and express all my emotions and I dont like to drag things out. I openly tell people how it is and I always put feeling into everything I do. so I can say I am proud to be an ESFP. 
and I am glad I am not alone with this. I thought I was weird and I took the test wrong lol. though I enjoy over exagerating things i could never be an actor. "
363,esfp,"ok! thank you, yeah most of my % were below 30% exept for feeling [F] and thats the big one. lol [62%] and I am curently going to school for genral studies in hopes of persuing a home economics degree and freelance for awhile lol. my aunt does it and she travles around the world seeing so many places and enjoying amazing food. and i always enjoyed baking sweets. 
my best friend, he wants to be a pastry cheff and said that as soon as we both get our degrees we should open a busness together. and I feel like that would be amazing! I could do both. I would just be a partner and he would be in charge of the store and I would help out while I was in town and all that. and being freelance I could always do both lol and i would have holidays and pretty much my own schedual and how could that NOT be amazing?!?!  but i want a minor in ECE just for a fall back career because in IN they are in need of teachers right now. "
364,esfp,"Wow that is actually very insperational! I will try drawing, its not like I havent drawn anything good before [ I took plunty of art classess and we spent a month on a project at a time. ] I lover paper mache but Its hard to find time to make the paste lol. and this one time I wanted a tat of a koi fish so bad and none of the pictures seemed right and so I drew it from scratch and It turned out to look exactly like how I wanted it to look. I lost it within a week though haha.
im sure acting and drawing [arting? lol] will be ones that I could start at. but my voice will lstill be bad if I try to sing lol. and I know a little guitar but i can only play 1 song lol
I just was never really good at any of the stuff consistently.
the only things i love are anime and reading and you cant make careers out of that lol "
365,esfp,"I wrote a huge reply then cancelled it... I don't have the inspiration to write it again so I will Tl;Dr
Look beyond the boring statements of loving something or being interested in something an see the hundreds if not thousands of opportunities behind the things you love!  Animation of anime, art behind the anime, dream the characters yourself and you may find the inspiration because you love anime, record books on tape, there are jobs for that, read to children and the elderly there are jobs/volunteer opportunities for that.  I had a lot more I'm sorry but it was too many words to retype on the phone.  And good to know my rambling a helped you out in any small way!"
366,esfp,"Also, consistency is boring!  A wise man once told me ""variety is the spice of life"".  And I took that to heart.  It's my life's purpose to do something that is new to me almost every day no matter how small.  Whether it is taking a new route to the store or saying hello to a stranger or trying a hobby I heard about and thought could be cool.  Variety will keep you interested.  This could be why you love anime because there are so many types an twists and turns within the plot line because in cartoons anything is possible.  And no book is the same.  Ever."
367,esfp,"it hellped alot. I just thought anime was all voice acting/ marketing/ and animating [art] so I sold my self out and said I couldnt do it. at least for the time being. I have a VAA acount and when I have the free time I like to post a little and do a few characters. small ones really so i am only in a few episodes, 
And I never thought about doing voice recorded reading. that would be the best job ever!!"
368,esfp,"ESFP's are known for living in the moment, I personally feel future planning, specifically what I'll say makes it less authentic and makes it harder for conversation to flow naturally. Improvised situations just feel more natural and comfortable for me."
369,esfp,"I mean it's good to have some idea of a future goal in life, if that's what you mean. Or at the very least some kinda backup plan. Unless you're just talking about daily stuff like conversation and whatnot, then yeah I would never think to plan that."
370,esfp,"Hello there.
I did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).
I was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.
Here's the survey.
Feel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on /r/MBTI. Hope it's alright!"
371,esfp,"Depends on which one it is! Also depend on the kind of person you are. I believe if you are a good person, with a good heart looking to get something good out of it, you will have a great trip. If the opposite is true I think you are much more inclined to have a bad experience. "
372,esfp,"For me, anything that causes you to go into that introverted deep contemplation zone is kinda uncomfortable. Would recommend you make sure you both feel really connected as she's doing it, put something funny on, keep things light at first. "
373,esfp,"Depending on what it is. Probably the same reaction she has to liquor. 
For myself, 1 of 3 things happen. I get hyper, I get deep or I get sleepy. All to the extreme. I hear I'm pretty fun to be around when his happens. But it all depends on the person too. 
And I definitely get more touchy feely. Which I already am, but I don't hold back. "
374,esfp,I recently stopped smoking weed because of my Se dominance. I hate psychedelics because of how easy it is for our Se to kick in and bounce off our Fi. I used to love smoking bowls and tripping but since graduating college its become much more of a burden accepting reality and future that I would not recommend psychedilics
375,esfp,":) i think I should've been a bit more specific: how does it effect on YOU? I'm an isfp and have had a somewhat great experience with shrooms previously. I took them mainly because I wanted to find something out of myself. I think I was depressed and I think shrooms helped a lot how to deal with it. I had lost my enthusiasm for everything, and they helped me realise that I'm worthy of being happy even only based on the fact that i'm just a human and i'm alive. This was the biggest realisation for me and it made me a better person overall.
I have a friend who is esfp and she is thinking of trying mushrooms next fall and I'd think mbti has a small role in how drugs affect you, i could give her a bit of an insight what she is going to experience.
If you could give me a little less generalized answer and a bit about more of your own experience, that would be nice :)"

377,esfp,"And if you guys will let me mention this, your subreddit's theme is rather hard to navigate - I couldn't find the 'submit post' button with it enabled. Maybe it's my adblock, but you might want to get it checked."
378,esfp,The most important thing in my life is my close friends.  I have a very broad friend group and I like hanging out with  individual people but at the end of the day I always come back to my very tight circle.
379,esfp,"The most important part in my life is constantly challenging myself and being happy. I love being stimulated all the time, preferably very busy with things going on all around me. 
My biggest fear in life is living a what we in Sweden call a ""Svensson-life"" - Svensson being a very common surname. Essentially, getting married, having two children, living in a nice little house with maybe a dog or a cat, working office jobs, you get the drill. I always crave adventure and new challenges, I rarely keep a job for more than six months, and I make sure to keep company with like minded people who will keep me entertained. My biggest dream in life is to see the world - I'm going backpacking through Thailand at the beginning of 2017 so that's a start :) 
I'm an 18 year old girl, for the record."
380,esfp,"INTP male here.
A couple weeks ago I started dating this ESFP. We're both seniors in high school but we've liked each other since junior year, so we already know each other on a friend basis. She was in an ill-fated relationship with this other guy (everything was against him) when we finally confessed to each other. She couldn't withhold her feelings, so she told him about me and he kinda just gave up on her and is still angry at her.
We went on a date to the movies soon after. The next few days were weird. She seemed less interested in me. After a long talk with her, we decided to just be friends. The next few days we hung out and interacted with each other as if nothing had happened, like two very good friends that just like to chill with each other. She was going to the homecoming dance with our friend (girl), but the friend cancelled on her at the last minute. Now she (ESFP) just told me that they were going to ask me to join them yesterday, but they forgot. I agreed to go with her to the dance tonight, just the two of us.
Being an INTP, it's natural for me to seek hidden meaning or motive behind every word and action, and I recognize that not everything has a hidden meaning. Help me judge how she feels about me based on the following and what I have already told you. I've been getting mixed signals here and I need your ESFP perspective on the situation. Here are some of the things she's told me, which might not actually reflect her own feelings and were just said to deal with things in the moment, such as excuses to just be friends. What do these statements say about her true feelings?

she has feelings for me
she has feelings for him (the guy she was ""dating"")
he is mad at her because his ""pride is hurt""
I'm too clingy (I'm not at all, but must have come off that way because my previous attempts at convincing her to stay with me implied an exaggerated a desire for long term commitment)
she wants to save romanticisms (such as holding hands) for someone she's willing to commit too in the long term (""mr. right"")
once suggested I should give this other girl that likes me a chance (I said I wasn't into her and she never mentioned it again)

I really like this girl, just everything about her. But God I wish I could just read her mind. I want to be with her and make her happy. I fell that she wants to be with me too, but her feelings change a lot and can even conflict. I want us to be together. I want the best for her and for me, even if that means being just friends. I truly hope that's not the case."
381,esfp,"It sounds like she is still confused and not completely over the last relationship. Maybe now is not the best time to be in a relationship with her.. It sounds like she wants the best for you though, even though she is trying to set you up with someone else. Sounds like she feels guilty for not returning your feelings. Yeah I would just give it time and put off a real relationship for now, then reassess."
382,esfp,"Nearly everyone does this. She's a person, not an MBTI type- try a dating/romance related subreddit instead. Just because we're ESFP here doesn't mean we know how she ticks. "
383,esfp,"She may either be unsure of her feelings or she's over you. I feel like every one assumes ESFPs get bored of people quickly and move on to the next crush. That's never been an issue for me, but it could be true of her. You should talk to her about the mixed signals."
384,esfp,"Your over thinking this. Your over-thinking will scare her away.
Just look at how she feels around you. If she said no and that she just wants to be friends, then respect that. If she starts showing more of an interest or flirting with you, then show interest and flirt back. If not, then most likely your in the friendzone. 
She probably has feelings for her ex, and your her second option. You need to let her end things with her ex in her head. Which she will eventually do. After then, reevaluate where your at and try again. Maybe something will happen. 
As for the dance. She could be wanting to make her ex jealous, she could be wanting to get closer to you, or maybe her friends really did cancel and she doesn't want to stay in. Just go with her and don't overthink it"
385,esfp,"I posted this about five months ago and I've confirmed her to be an ISFP (which isn't that different), but it's funny how what you wrote still applies to my current situation. The school year is almost over and we're still in the same weird spot. We've been back and forth, on and off for six months, and I'm looking to seal the deal, to make her mine and see what the future holds for us. But if I can't pull it off then no big deal. There is a plethora of other options in my future. Thanks for the advice."
386,esfp,"I am not sure if I'm mixing up this stereotype with the ""leo"" stereotype but I remember one of them is that we're cheaters or we get around. I don't have a problem with that if someone else is (the sleeping around one, fuck cheaters) that way but I'm actually way less exciting. If I have feelings for someone it's really intense and I like to be in serious relationships vs. many hook ups."
387,esfp,"I do not really enjoy dance clubs. I love dancing and I love being around friends and people, but they are too goddamn hot and the music is usually weird ass mixtape bullshit where there are DJs yelling over crap and not the fun stuff I want to hear. That's one of many stereotypes that probably don't fit. lol"
388,esfp,"That we like to go out partying all the time and don't care where.
I love things like house parties, generally, so long as the crowd feels genuine. Usually it's a great space for conversation (because the music isn't deafening) and activities (I'm so down for a house party that also includes board games or Mario Kart or something like that).
If it's the wrong kind of house party or a nightclub or something I'm almost as likely to find an excuse to leave as an introvert would be, because I'm very sensitive to environments in which I feel like people aren't being genuine."
389,esfp,haha yep exactly! I actually disagree with most ESFP stereotypes...but my INFJ friend (who is the one who is actually really deep into MBTI) seems to think I have high N cause of spending too much time with introverted gamers lololol
390,esfp,"My beer belly is evidence that I definitely live in the moment when it comes to food and drink and most fun things bwahahahhaha, but I try to be sensitive to peoples emotions if my live in the momentness is going to have an affect on them :D"
391,esfp,"How to proceed when an esfp suddenly becomes withdrawn and uncommunicative?  It seems they don't want to resolve any issues and would rather not talk than deal with problems. 
Attempts at trying to talk just come across to them as harassing and overwhelming and causes them to become even more withdrawn. "
392,esfp,"One of the big things about most ESFP types is attention to ""vibe""/tone/atmosphere whatever. The emotional messaging itself is as important as the rational message, so when you're dealing with someone who's withdrawing you're going to have to do some coaxing and reassuring to make sure your SO understands you're coming from a place of mutual cooperation and not angrily attacking them. "
393,esfp,"What's the best way to coax an esfp if you've already made the mistake of getting angry at their lack of willingness to discuss issues? I'm trying to reassure them and be positive but they are not interested in discussing since they now feel they will be berated I guess.
Unrelated, how should I proceed if an esfp is giving me silent treatment? (I am an infp) 
Trying to talk to resolve and occasionally getting frustrated at being ignored only makes things worse 
Thanks "
394,esfp,"Tbh I'm not too sure myself, but I'd maybe suggest carrying on business as usual and letting the vibe settle and get friendlier again for a few days/weeks. Directly addressing the issue will probably seem confrontational since you're in so deep at this point. 
Pretty related actually. Again, leave it alone because they don't want to deal with you right now. "
395,esfp,"How long to wait for? Isn't there a chance she will just lose interest completely then, or think how peaceful things are without talking to me and not wish to bring back negative vibes into her life. I've heard esfp can easily cut people out their life if they associate them with negativity, but I want to discuss the problems and resolve them. At least to become amicable. "
396,esfp,"Well without knowing more about the context it's hard to say. You'll have to feel that one out yourself depending on the severity of whatever the disagreement was and how urgently you need/want to patch things up. 
The second part of your comment is pretty accurate though, especially if you two were never especially close in the first place or the issue was especially divisive. "
397,esfp,INTJ's always have this weird vibe. Idk how to explain it better but it does make me feel drawn to them. What I've found with one INTJ I know is that they say things that go against my Fi which really irritates me BUT I find myself coming back to them because I feel that they do offer interesting insights. I don't know if I could ever be in a relationship with an INTJ because they seem kinda uptight (sorry) but I do think they'd be a good friend. 
398,esfp,"Overall, I genuinely like INTJs. They're pretty quirky (in a good way), intense, genuine, and low-maintenance. 
That being said I get incredibly frustrated when they get into a 'my way or the highway' mentality. 
Additionally most of the INTJs I know could live to at least try to invest/initiate more into our friendship. But that's bleeding into my personal life."
399,esfp,"I don't know if I could ever be in a relationship with an INTJ because they seem kinda uptight = same here,  but there're some less uptight so you can actually date them, which i did and it was fun.  but it's also too hard, so never again lol"
400,esfp,One of my best mates is INTJ. I love his passion for the subject and he's the entire reason I use this subreddit and know anything at all about MBTI. He can be harsh at times but its always with justification and generally he has thought everything through. I go to him for a lot of advice and general guidance.
401,esfp,"It does. But I try to keep perspective. I kind of rate all input/information coming into my mind by it's use to me, so i pretty much toss out non-essential feels before they reach important parts of my psyche."
402,esfp,"If your tired, and an opportunity comes along that would require you to be alert and awake and grab it. you would kick yourself. Also i don't know about my fellow ESFP's but when I go for something or do something fun its often tiring at the other end and Play hard Sleep hard is good."
403,esfp,"That's a great goal to have.  Sleep deprivation contributes to a host of health problems--physically, mentally, etc.
It's a very wise time investment to consider!  On that note, some things are really worth investing in financially:  A great bed suitable for your needs, (comfortable shoes is another biggie). Simply consider the time you'll spend with a product, and the benefits a good product can bring."
404,esfp,"That's the Socionics subtypes. I don't know that I buy into visual typing by facial and body features, though I understand why inflection, cadence, and body language matter. The celebrities in the video - some I see as typed correctly, others I really do not.
For myself, bu cadence, mannerisms, behavior, energy, body movement, etc, I'm ESFP-Se. However, although I am an athlete, I am overweight, and I also like eccentric colors. I'd focus on mannerisms though."
405,esfp,"Jimmy Fallon aint an Se dom. He's also not an Fi user. Either that or I'm typed horribly wrong.
I agree with Jimmy Kimmel. Jim Carrey is a Te dom. He has Te/EJ identity issues to the max. 
Conan is as Ne as you can get.
I agree with most if not all of the actresses and singers. Maybe not Natalie but I can't say for sure. Also not sure about Emma, she seems more Fe. "
406,esfp,"Not an expert in MBTI so I can't speak to that much, but I'm an INTJ female dating and ESFP male. We both refer to our relationship as ""the best relationship ever."" We've been together for over two years, and although it's been a lot of work--especially learning to effectively communicate feelings, needs, desires, disappointments, etc.--over those two years to make it work, I really do think it's a great relationship. Might not be right for everyone, but it's certainly working for me."
407,esfp,"Depends on the people involved. There's nothing saying any pair will never work. I personally would have a hard time with INTJ, then again I don't know many. The INTJ would have to adapt to the ESFP or it wouldn't work. Don't expect vice versa."
408,esfp,My best friend is an INTJ who acts like an ENFP. It was like fireworks when we met. We are so alike I can't exaggerate thate enough. We're both odd and quirky. We are great only had one big argument. She accused me of something I did and didn't accept my apology though. I am 16 and so is she. she is 3w9. I am 8w9.
409,esfp,"I'm an INTJ male who's been married to a ESFx for almost 22 years. It's been up and down for both of us, but I wouldn't have had it any other way. We complement each other; I keep her grounded and she encourages me to step out of my comfort zone. Any long-term relationship requires work and sacrifice, but it can work beautifully."
410,esfp,"I'm an INTJ. One of my best friends, if not the best, is an ESFP. Sure, some habits of his can irk me a little but I don't remember the last time we've had a major argument in the last 15 years of knowing him."
411,esfp,"I've been in a LTR (4yrs) with INTJ (I'm ESFP). It has been the best relationship that I have ever been in but.... also the hardest. Its a constant roller-coaster of emotions. We always have the same argument ( the same for the past 4 yrs) I don't pay enough attention ( true)..... ESFP, tend to be scatter, needy and clingy for affection but you will always have space to gather your thoughts, some one to listen to you say the same thing in 4 different ways and still smile and someone that is going too have your back in any situation.. Oh I forgot, we are impulsive and indecisive and even thou we try its hard to change our ways.
Lastly be content and nice about the fact that we will never see the world as you do. we are not your pet projects to fix but that does not mean that there will be no growth as the relationship evolves."
412,esfp,"I am an ESFP female dating an INTJ male. I have been dating him for over a year and a half and things are like most people have been saying very up and down. We are completely opposite. We compliment each other well because we are on opposite sides of the spectrum, but when it comes to communicating feelings and emotions sometimes it gets a little shakey. I'm the type who tends to hold in my emotions till they all come out. And in general I'm way more emotional. Sometimes he sees me as too clingy. And I see him as too emotionally unavailable. However, conversations and time spent together are so natural..which is unlike any relationship I've had before. I think it just depends on the couple and if they are willing to sort through the differences and try to find a way to make it work. I personally feel that even if there's a bit of a rollercoaster ride to it, it's very rewarding, and he's my best friend. "
413,esfp,"In theory - no.
As mbti states, you and your partner should be almost opposite: everything but J/P. People with ""almost opposite"" types can form a relationship of duality (http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/17-Duality-Descriptions-Meged-Ovcharov).
Complete opposites, on the other hand, most likely would be confronting each other.
But that's theory.

414,esfp,"I think that since a lot of ESFP's wait until they get the opportunity to open up to someone, introverted people in general are especially easy for ESFP's to enjoy spending time with. The fact that it can be quite hard to get to know a generally introverted person on a more personal and deep level, the good things about the ESFP's are more apparent when getting close to this person. Almost all my best friends are INFP's or INTJ's and I'm an ESFP and it's because I feel very comfortable with these people. And trust me, I know what my friends are, I wanted to know what they were so badly! ;) As ESFP's do!"
415,esfp,"I've been realizing that most of my closest friends are ESFPs, and though it seems nerdy to use MB types to date, it couldn't hurt to see what this looks like romantically-speaking.
I'm an ENTP, so it makes sense to be with someone who is spontaneous and likes people the way I do, but balances me out with the feeling stuff and and approaches the world a little less chaotically than I do.
How do I spot girls that are ESFPs without killing their interest by talking about Myers Briggs."
416,esfp,I am an ESFP and I would love to talk to you about science. I had a hard time in school but science still interests me. The most important thing is to just act relaxed. There is no reason to be nervous. When others come up to me and talk with me I automatically think we are great friends. I am a dude though so I won't be dating you anytime soon.
417,esfp,"I'm an ESFP girl, and I agree with what's been said here, mostly.  I love school, though. But I definitely agree with the person who said they think everyone is their friend. I love talking to everyone and collecting new friends and ideas, but I'm really sensitive about a lot of things. I may be making a bold statement here, but for me, the most important thing about dating an ESFP is respecting their feelings. Don't belittle them. ESFPs love people but are easily hurt by them as well. It's like an extrovert/introvert combo. Haha. ESFP girls (and guys) are really empathetic and like to help people or keep the peace. I think an ESFP/ENTP relationship would be a good idea, because personally I'm always looking for someone to keep me balanced and level-headed when I get overwhelmed.  Good luck!"
418,esfp,"I am not sure 100% that I am an ESFP, I don't fit many of the stereotypes... regardless I will answer.
I have struggled with this for a long time, and a big part of my answer is to ""dive in"" ... at least that is what I am experimenting with right now.
Say yes, do too much... get dirty and take risks. Yeah, I often hit a point where I take on too much and burn out,  but burn out is a better place to be in than the depressed state of trying not to overcommit. Usually I can recover from a burn out in a couple days, but the depression sucks me in for much longer.  Being smart about it where 80% of it are things you can let go of will make that easier.
Still struggling on how to stick to a plan and do regular necessities with consistency. "
419,esfp,"The thing about ESFP stereotypes is that a lot of them are based on dichotomies and 16personalities, which means that they're completely wrong and worthless. Stereotypes are stereotypes regardless, but the Se dom stereotypes for example fit us much better
I agree that it's good for us to stay active, but you should make sure that you're constantly doing something productive, instead of just getting hyped, getting a bunch of things done and then losing motivation to keep going for a while"
420,esfp,"hi, anyone you take a quick personality test https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test <-- (don't need to create an account on the site)
then take a survey on your music taste? https://goo.gl/forms/lzqPk8jGD6oYXEy22
Would be huge. Help me get preliminary validation for my hypothesis, hopefully I can post the results later on.
(I know it's not MTBI ¯(ツ)/¯)"
421,esfp,"A while back, we asked folks in this community to take a survey and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.
(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""extravert"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )
Introduction
The Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.
As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.
Summary
In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.
Overall Preferences
Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).
Overall Response Breakdown
Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 
Introvert-Extravert Preferences
Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.
Introvert Response Breakdown
Extravert Response Breakdown
The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.
Ambivert Preferences
While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.
Ambivert Response Breakdown
Male-Female Preferences
Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.
Male Response Breakdown
Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.
Female Response Breakdown
Gender and Non-traditional Genders
We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.
That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.
Generational Preferences
The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.
Millennial Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.
Gen X Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.
Boomer Response Breakdown
Occupational Preferences
The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are STEM-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  
STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.
non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Scenario Preferences
We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.
It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.
Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown
Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death), included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.
Emergency Response Breakdown
The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions), the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.
Cool Customer Response Breakdown
The scenario, I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems), showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.
Hot Customer Response Breakdown
Consequences
We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).
Negative Consequences Response Breakdown
Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).
Positive Consequences Response Breakdown
Conclusion
Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 
Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 
Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.
As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 
Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not why things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?
All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.
We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please contact us; but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.
You can find a copy of this article over on Medium if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line."
422,esfp,"Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg
​"
423,esfp,"social yet quiet, need alone time but get restless when alone for too long, hates parties but loves getting together with friends, loves attention yet modest, humorous and always wants to be involved, needs affirmation, friendly yet skeptical, impulsive yet careful, hates loud people yet can be loud, loves making people laugh, only serious when in a bad state of mind
how would you type with this description?"
424,esfp,"I saw on r/INTP that ESFP's and INTP's don't get along. I've been been reading through this subreddit and I can see why an INTP would feel maybe uncomfortable around ESFP's, but I was wondering how ESFP's feel."
425,esfp,"I would agree with r/INTP on this one. But I do find INTPs super interesting! I'm very familiar with the type(and with Ti-doms in general; lots of them are my relatives, friends' SOs, coworkers, previous classmates or neighbors etc...), and I can safely say none of them are more than people I simply tolerate. And the feeling is definitely mutual. I still find them super interesting, but you know those people you meet and you can just tell you won't get along? 
To name some things:


I feel like they look down on others easily. It's weird. I do my best to not judge people and to be respectful of other's lifestyles. INTPs in my experience don't do the same. I've seen multiple INTPs write people off as vapid and stupid because of the music they listen to, or the shows they watch, or the way they dress. ""Only shallow people use Snapchat"" and ""Oh, your friend watches Keeping Up With The Kardashians? Well she did seem kind of stupid."" are real things I've heard INTPs say. 


And they tend to come off as condescending, which I'm totally not a fan of. My coworkers do this all the time, where everyone would be having a conversation and it turns slightly more difficult to follow or a big word is used. The two INTPs will stop talking, pick some random person in the crowd(who I guess looks stupid; and who didn't ask for an explanation) and dumb it down for them. There is one INTP who is really smart, and lots of times he has to dumb down the conversation for me. He can be really nice about it. The other one is definitely on the same level as me, so it really pisses me off that he thinks he has stop and explain what ""precocious"" means for me. 


I feel like out measures of success are very different. It's interesting. I consider myself way more successful at life than most of the IXTPs I meet, but still, I think Ti-doms ""pity"" me. I care a lot about my looks and I like being around people and feeding off of them way more than doing any introspective activities. I like a lot of really trashy reality TV shows (not the kardashians, they're too ""first-world"" for me lol think ""flavor of love""-trashy), I'm not interested in science, and I trust people with degrees more than people who don't have them 7 times out of 10. That is probably a nightmare for most INTPs. Who would want that lifestyle?. But I'm content with who I am, and I don't want everyone to be like me. We don't really get each other, and thats fine! I'm glad we are so different, it adds color to the world. :D

"
426,esfp,"Really?? I have quite a few INTP friends. We get along just fine. They're always fun and have interesting things to talk about. I personally love INTPs. I couldn't see myself being in a relationship with one though. But that's because I party with both my INTP friends and it always ends up really crazy. And you would think I would be the one to set no limits... This is not the case. I do feel like they like to compete a lot. I'm not a huge fan of competing. But it doesn't bother me. Just not something I'd want in a SO. 
I'm curious why you would say we would make them uncomfortable. What's your take on us? "
427,esfp,"I had a good friend in high school who was an intj. I feel like I did make her uncomfortable at first with how much I jumped around and ran in circles, but eventually, she introduced me to mbti, and saw my differences as an ESFP, and something about that made her feel a lot more comfortable around me. Now, we occasionally have random theoretical discussions and talk about certain machines that she likes, and we get along great. While I can see that there may be some initial differences, I find that a type as flexible as the ESFP can get along with intps just fine (as well as any other type for that matter)."
428,esfp,"I don't dislike ESFP, it's actually the opposite. Although I could feel uncomfortable because of the huge difference of energy usage. I'm here thinking all the time about stuffs and get lost into it while you guys use your energy at being awesome and hilarious. You're in the now, I wish I was but I'm not most of the time. And this can make me feel like i'm boring as hell in comparison.
That being said, INTPs don't share one brain like a beehive. You may have seen one or two bitching around, but they don't represent the whole. "
429,esfp,"i used to have a friend in highschool,he was ESFP. To this day, funniest person i have ever met, always dancing, making the funniest jokes, only time he was serious was in a rugby game, it was actually funny to watch him be serious. we used to get along well when it was just me and him talking, always interesting to talk to, and would tell me things about people and explain situations i had trouble understanding socially. INTP here. i always felt that the one thing he didn't like about me was that my sense of humor was more looking down on people and condescension and all the INTP stuff"
430,esfp,"This is interesting because my esfp sister always tells me ""you think you're better than everyone else"" when I don't .
The only time I'm purposefully condescending is when I know she's lying about something and she continues talking with confidence after all my attempts to remind her to slow down an do her research. I don't like arrogance bundled with presumptuousness and I hate lying
But I believe she's referring to something more than that,
And I think that one intp ,who is really smart and when he dumb down the conversation he does it politely, that's because you're being honest, not pretending to know what you dont when you don't . I'm more inclined to be as tactful and pleasant as possible when someone genuinely wants to know something new rather than pretend to know, and from your post you seem more or less humble
Also the thing with picking a random person to give an unwanted explanation sounds pretty te to me, intj maybe? I dont understand that situation you described"
431,esfp,Assholes comes in 16 different types. 
432,esfp,"Well reading through this subreddit it's just so intense I guess. Also really 'random'. I don't have anything against ESFP people personally I'm just confused and that makes me uncomfortable.
Edit: Vocab"
433,esfp,"Well you should not be surprised to know that a lot of people judge individuals according to the ""on-paper MBTI type"". This type is x, this one is that, ""I've know one x type, they are all like that"" is a common idea here, so. I felt it was necessary to remind that assholes are not from a particular type."
434,esfp,"Hey guys! I've been taking the mbti test for a couple of years once in a while and i always got the same result : esfp. I was always a social butterfly and love changing as many groups as possible and being in the middle of attention, I love humour and spreading good vibes everywhere I go but I'm stiĺl not sure if I am an esfp. Can you give me some questions that could define an esfp to the core?"
435,esfp,"All of what you've said is common in ESFP, but does not define ESFP and relates to a whole bunch of other aspects outside of this taxonomy (Enneagram, instinctual variants, other).
ESFP is about your cognition, specifically, your perceiving and judging cognitive functions and their stacking.
Do you perceive the world in cold hard facts, that are tangible and observable, as opposed to say, a multitude of possibilities? When someone asks you to logically justify your point of view, do you find it exciting to talk semantics and logically explain, or do you find it unnerving and almost like a personal attack? Are ethics objective and shared, or do you have a very personal value system that may or may not align with that of society, and an understanding that it's exclusive to you, and others may not align?
​
I'm not the most structured, so it would be good to get questions from others, but those should help, somewhat."
436,esfp,Lol the thing is that I'm also into having peace and quiet and I dislike talking too much sometimes. I find people that talk to the point of being annoying and beg to be constantly in the spotlight   unnatural  and I believe that they are out of ballance in themselfs
437,esfp,"I'm a type 3 double wing enneagram btw.
I see the world as a multitude of possibilities, I do find sometimes explaining my logical point of view  unneirving (I get a bit tense when that happens because i dont really have words in explaining logically most of the times and I have a general sense of what I know instead of knowing in details something) and mostly I'm not that much into value systems and morality. I just try to be aware of what i feel/think/happens and not place any judgement"
438,esfp,"List your MBTI type and your favorite activities to do.
I'll list mine. Having as it comes adventures (sneaking into places etc), Learning about things I like (The Bible, Charisma, NLP, hypnosis, different sorts of skills ect), Weightlifting, Skateboarding, baseball, running around, Minecraft <3, Talking with a friend or two, Chess and other strategic games, Eating good food, Learning about health things, Reddit, Funny videos and documentaries about things in my scope of interests. Also airsoft and being a libertarian.
Edit: we SP's need a convention or a meet up to get to know each other. We are so much fun and adventurous!"
439,esfp,"I'm ESFP and I love doing NEW things. Anything I haven't done before like a new restaurant, new activity or new bar. My steady hobbies include going out, lifting weights, hiking, beach, concerts. I just love constantly being on an adventure and meeting new people. For some background info, I just moved to LA and I am a Scorpio. "
440,esfp,"I kind of like the description on 16personalities
It's long, but it's in sections and divided by context, which makes it easier to read (most people just read the summary). Some fun visuals too. Not everyone likes 16personalities, but I'm an ESFP and I found it to be very helpful. :)"
441,esfp,I would like it a lot more if it didn't have the Marilyn Monroe quote at the top. I feel like it gives us the reputation of being unreasonable drama queens when I'm actually a very reasonable drama queen
442,esfp,"Hi. I am currently in a phase of self-discovery. I have recently discovered that I am ESFP and was able to come to terms with things I am unhappy about. I am a first year psychology and computer science student.
I entered the university with a low expectation of myself - in many ways - as I had rather unhappy time in high school. In high school, I did terribly in my study, partially because I was not happy, but mostly because I am not very good at sticking with plans and pushing myself when I could go out and watch a movie or dedicate my time in practicing for the musical that I had a lead in.
Even though I want to use this oppertunity further educate myself and become a better individual in general, since studying has never been a strong suit for me, I am facing the same situation as I did in high school, where I am not studying because I've never really done it properly.
According to ESFP description, we are not very good with academic stuff because we are more interested in being in attention and pleasure, and generally just not logical or persistent.
Maybe I am giving the test too much credit. However, most things described in the ESFP page was true to me. And I want to know if any ESFP was able to really push themselves academically, and if so, how they did it. If you have any study experience as ESFP, please share it here for me. I just want to know what other ESFP has done."
443,esfp,"I found this youtube video to be helpful. 
Also, remember that whatever is noted online about ESFPs is regarding your ""tendencies"". You're not always being non-attentive, illogical, etc. 
Lastly, the fact that you are taking the time to learn about your MBTI will help you by identifying your possible triggers into procrastination and overall lack of proper studying. "
444,esfp,"I've been thinking about responding to this for a while, but it is a hard question to answer. Just thinking about this topic makes me a bit anxious. I've managed to make it to my Master's degree and I find myself surrounded by people who have their shit together to a degree that I can only fantasize about. My academic history is riddled with disappointments where I can remember just fucking off before the exam. uuggghh. THE SHAME.
I wish I had tried harder in University, so I could have been eligible for more grants and scholarships in my Masters. I don't really expect that to motivate you, as it wouldn't have motivated me. 
The best advice I have is to use your passions as much as you can. Let them lead you and motivate you as much as you can within your field. When you are selling yourself, sell your passion. Professors and Industry leaders want that in students and employees.
And halonut's advice is really good as well. Don't use MBTI personality typing as an excuse, but a road map to improvement. "
445,esfp,"I wanted to add to my answer- every once in a while I get drunk and watch the disney movie Mulan by myself, to remind myself that there are always other roads to success other than the traditional. (I'm doing that right now)."

447,esfp,"Does this sound like esfp

I don’t mind listening to your ideas, but if don’t have any intention of putting them into action I’d rather not waste my time. 
I focus on the present but occasionally I get nostalgic.
I get bored if you try to talk about my future. I try to waste as little time on that stuff as possible. Things don’t stay the same and more often than not you’re going to end up adapting to the changes anyway.
I find that the emotions of the people around me influence me a lot. If I’m around someone who’s cussing at their phone or someone else, I feel uncomfortable. If I’m around someone who’s always laughing and talking and making jokes and stuff, I feel encouraged to do the same.
I feel awkward when I’m alone and I’d rather be around a lot of people. 
I find myself needing a lot of affirmation.
I find myself focusing on the details in the real world more than details about myself.
If it doesn’t have a deadline, it isn’t getting done unless it’s actually important to me.
I’d rather spend time having fun and being happy as much as possible than doing chores and dwelling over stuff that doesn’t affect me right now. 
When I’m cooking, I’d rather have an actual recipe with proportions so I know what the heck I’m doing. 
I’d rather rely on facts that are confirmed and true than fluffy theories that may or may not be accurate. 
I don’t care if plans change at the last minute. It happens. It just opens up more options. 
It’s very important to me to be accepted and liked in my community. 
I think drama is rather exciting and fun to have in my life. But when it goes too far and starts to screw things up, that’s when I start to get really nervous. If it gets to that point I’ll try to act happy and upbeat and try to make others feel the same way and maybe make the drama less threatening, but if it obviously isn’t helping I’ll just sit there and shake with anxiety. 
I find that commercials and ads with an emotional appeal have more of an effect on me than ones with a bunch of numbers and percentages. 
People are always telling me to think before I speak but I never do that. 
If something is important or significant to me, I’ll remember a lot about it. 
It makes me feel sooooo awful when for whatever reason I have to stand far away from a group of people. I’d much rather be among them.
I hate relying on strict plans because I’ve never seen one work out the way it’s supposed to. Things change.
If I feel strongly about a subject, I have absolutely no problem expressing my feelings about it. But if it’s likely that it will cause a conflict or a giant argument, I’ll just keep my mouth shut. 
I can say something with confidence for once: I’m a procrastinator. As I said in my previous post, if it isn’t affecting me or my loved ones right this second, it doesn’t matter. I’ll only do it if I absolutely have to, and most likely I’ll start it the same day it’s due. 
I can’t take criticism. It comes across to me as an insult and makes me feel like crap. 
If I’m being disrespectful, I’m not doing it on purpose. I’ll most likely apologize if you bring it to my attention.
I love assignments and essays that allow me to express myself. 
If someone has a suggestion that we are able to act on right now, I’m always the first one to jump out of my chair and go. If it’s a suggestion that may or may not happen in the future, I don’t waste any time or energy on it. Because I know from experience that those lovely little “possibilities” and “ideas” never work out if it requires too much planning in advance. 
If I do something foolish that causes me to be ashamed, I’ll try to distract myself from it with other things. If I’m unable to do that and I’m left alone with my thoughts, I feel like garbage.
If I ask someone a question and they don’t answer in .00000000009 seconds I assume they didn’t hear me or they’re ignoring me. 
I feel like I can go forever without being alone and that would actually be great lol. 
As much as I want to keep your secret, more times than not I’ll spill the beans without even realizing it. 
I don’t mind a loud environment. I think it’s really awesome.
I’ll tell a complete stranger pretty much everything that’s going on in my life and how I feel about it. I’ve gotten into a ton of trouble because of that. 
I honestly don’t like being in control or in a leadership position lol. I’d rather let someone else take care of that stuff and I can just go with the flow.
If I do end up making a to-do list I’ll never follow through with it. 
When I’m at a restraunt I tend to order the same thing because I’m comfortable with it. But if someone suggusts something to me, unless there’s a really good reason not to get it, I’ll try it. 
When I visit someone’s house and it’s cluttered and messy, I actually admire it. It comes across to me as they’re living their life to the fullest instead of gushing over how everything is displayed. As long as you know where everything is, it doesn’t matter at all. Why waste your time on that stuff? It makes no difference.

This screams extraverted feeling. Not likely to be an ESFP, who use Introverted feeling as their second function."
449,esfp,"ESFPs are grounded in reality, not ideas. We see things in terms of how they work in the real world, not how they could work in an ideal society (ENFP).
Behavior wise...I've found ENFPs are better at talking about anything, they can keep any conversation going and find something to add to it, where ESFPs mostly talk about what's going on around them, what's happened, what's going to happen, concrete stuff. We don't talk much about stuff outside our experience. ESFPs are more physically adaptable, able to adapt immediately to their current environment and react quickly. ENFPs are too spacey to do that. They're the ones who lock themselves out of their cars and throw their phones in the trash."
450,esfp,"Personality types can change a bit.  I used to suffer from acute social anxiety that held back my ENFP tendencies, but the more I have overcome that with age and experience, my true extrovertedness has surfaced. 
The spacey, idealist stuff I've had since I became cognizant."
451,esfp,"Yeah but this is anecdotal. My enfp friend and I were talking last night about where we want to live. She was saying how she wishes society were set up like a commune where we just exchange goods for services. She doesn't like society as it is so she's trying to find a hippie place to live that matches her ideal. Me I more adapt myself to society and look for the best it has to offer. I make my decisions based on already-available options and make the most out of those. So my ideal place to live already exists. Not saying either view is correct, just different."
452,esfp,"I would be more like you and choose somewhere that already exists. When things get too far out there like that, I lose interest because it's not...something I'll ever get to experience. Is that practicality? I don't know anything anymore."
453,esfp,"I would have said yes a year ago when I wasn't all that happy. I'm in a good place right now, and it doesn't depress me at all. My thought process is that there are places that I haven't been to yet that might be ideal for me. It does feel like a waste of time to focus on something like that now. That's all I did when I wasn't in a good place though."
454,esfp,"The part that makes me question that is I'm not the epitome of extroverted. I'm not the ""performer"" although I think about being up on a big stage all the time. I know there are variations, but that's a defining characteristic I lack."
455,esfp,"I thought I was enfp for a while too since I'm not chatty cathy either. I'm actually kinda closed off around most people. But given a choice I would always choose to be around people, and I'm always trying to make people laugh/entertain them somehow when I'm around them. So not a performer in the literal sense necessarily but your disposition."
456,esfp,Huh...I've always had that need to entertain people too. I've somewhat grown out of it because I played it off as my need for people to like me (which it was). I guess I'm an ESFP who had a troubled past. Thanks for your responses!
457,esfp,"So, I don't know for sure, but he kind of fits the bill for it and I'm trying to gauge the best way to deal with our impending divorce.   
I'm an ENTJ woman; I've always been the bread winner, always been the one with high expectations, driven, pushing him to be better, helping him with college, the military (I got him enlisted because it helped me), etc. I'm pretty sure the pushing finally got to a point where he couldn't take it anymore and we both just started losing respect for one another and couldn't communicate anymore due to him always taking everything I said as criticism and it was to the point that I used the same tactic I usually do with discuss of divorce and told him to leave and he finally did. He had enough. He's done.   
I didn't realize he was really done though, so within a few days I'm trying to talk to him like we're just fighting per the usual, got us in counseling, we had some fights, and then 17 days after leaving, he was sleeping with someone else. Loyalty is a big deal for ENTJ's so this caused me to flip and go on the extreme aggressive side of things which included some vengeance, upping the ante, and of course none of that helped. But why - you ask - would I even want to bother with someone who is dead set on being done? Because we have kids. And part of what made me flip so hard besides the loyalty is that he wasn't really invested in seeing them during that time because he's too caught up in living in the moment.   
Well, that girl lasted from Oct 17th to roughly Nov 11 and the last I heard they saw each other was Nov 26. By Nov 28th, he met a new girl and he's only known her for all of 10 days but things seem to be going well there and he's been staying over there frequently. During this time, he has only seen the kids 6 times (Mainly in Oct) and that's on both of us (I got petty on some stuff and he decided to concede everything to letting a court handle the situation).   
I don't know if this is normal behavior for a ESFP type person but I do know he has a habit of basically hopping into a new relationship very fast to get over an old one and has a unique ability to just drop people when he wants. So I'm curious if this behavior fits the mold or if it's a different personality type. He's got great charm, charisma, likes to be the center of attention and is constantly changing his appearance to fit whatever job he's in (currently he's becoming more of a country guy and his new dig is quite country herself).   
And if he is ESFP - what is the best way for someone with a more aggressive personality type to find common ground? We both currently have an issue with trust, but I need to re-establish at least some basic level of trust in order to work towards co-parenting with him.   
We have a custody hearing on Thursday and until tonight, he and I hadn't spoken or seen each other in a month, but I'm the pushy type so I sought him out. With all the deep diving I've been doing into my own personality type, we were able to have a much needed civil discussion of my expectations that his ""living in the moment"" doesn't affect our children and that he doesn't let the flings ever take priority over them. He seemed to agree, assured me he could ""drop them"" if it ever became an issue, but was reserved to admit his habits of going out and partying all the time because he likely feels like it's something I'd jump on and criticize. Which I likely would because he also complains of not having money when he just bought a 2018 car and is funding the attorney since he's the one who filed for divorce.   
Either way - I just want to find the best way to move forward and understand him better so that I'm not causing the same waves I did with our previous relationship.   
​"
458,esfp,"I do not have kids and am not married but I have been dating an ESFP for 8 years. 
I’m sorry you guys are going through a rough time. 
As far as personalities go, my ESFP finds self-worth and satisfaction through praise and affection. You mentioned that many times you have pushed him into positions or self improvement but feel that your criticism is hindering your relationship. Perhaps try pointing out the good things he does do, no matter how little they may be. It may be hard for you see the good in him right now but when you look for them and point them out maybe it will get easier over time. My ESFP also positively reacts to truces during fights through a hug or a kiss. Physical affection brings out the best in him. 
Personalities aside, I think trying to push people into self-improvement before they are ready or into a position they do not want for themselves can be harmful for both parties in the relationship. It might give you a false identity of your loved one and lead to your SO not only feeling unfulfilled with themselves but it might cause resentment. 
Also, good step getting into counseling. 
I don’t know the relationship you guys have and I don’t understand the difficulties navigating a relationship with children but I hope this helps either way. 
Good luck. "
459,esfp,"You look like someone who appreciates bluntness, so I will be that. ESFP and ENTJ share all cognitive functions, so can often get along great, although, if they spend too much time together, they both get frustrated, so they need their regular downtime.
Honestly, from what you said, I wouldn't comment on loyalty, because you were split before he began anything. He's not necessarily behaving like an ESFP, he's behaving like someone who just got out of prison. You cannot overwhelm people. You have to respect their personal agency. And understand, that ambition isn't the be all end all, and if a person isn't ambitious, as long as they do their part, you cannot forcefeed it to them. It doesn't seem like he had much of a say in anything, because you steamrolled over him. And coming back with petty vendetta, and chasing him down like a harpy does no one any good. It certainly doesn't help him. But let me ask, how does it help you? Calm down. Take an analytical approach. Don't take things so personal. Doesn't sound like the marriage is salvageable, but if you treat him with enough respect, he doesn't sound like he's too bent on any vendetta whatsoever. Talk like adults. Don't make it personal. Take care of yourself."
460,esfp,"This is quality advice! I don't think I'd add to that.
Mostly not to forget to take care of you also. No matter how the conflict rose, it takes a toll on you. It's easier to be the bigger person if you make sure you're as at ease as you possibly can be."
461,esfp,"Hey there, I appreciate the feedback - the only reason that I considered it disloyal was because we were still talking and nothing had been filed through the courts yet. But I also see the perspective of you and him in the sense that I highly doubt he sees it as I do. 
As far as your question of how does it help me - back when all of this first began, it allowed me to get a one up in the situation/take back a bit of power. When you're angry, like I was, and you lash out, you get to live off that high of angry energy for a while and it's nice because you feel like you have some empowerment back, but it wears off. So basically, I was just allowing myself to feel like I had a one up on the situation in the short-term, and completely disregarding any long term consequences or the bigger picture. 
That's why as soon as the divorce was officially filed, I dropped it all - didn't talk to him anymore, focused on figuring out what my issues were, what had happened to get us to that point and I was pretty damn unaware of my own self.   
Not taking things so personal is difficult, but I'm trying to just accept that he's living in the moment and it's not about me, it's about him. Either way, I do think there is some progress being made, so I'm hoping to maintain that.   
Anywho, thanks!
​"
462,esfp,"I get it. When I'm blindsided and hurt, I tend to get petty, and of course, later I feel bad, because even though it felt great saying that stuff, and made me feel in control, it doesn't feel like that in retrospect. With relationships, it's never healthy to point fingers, because ultimately, you can't fix people. You can only reflect on what you have done, and how that affected things, and what you can take away from it. Lessons learnt, and crystallizing preferences and understanding what you will want from future relationships. It often helps to get a therapist, even if for a few sessions, to vent out safely, and to get feedback. With friends, there are always two risks - they will placate you and tell you everything is the guy's fault, because they don't want to anger you or hurt you, and they will hate on they guy, which may not always be what you want. Also, with a therapist, you don't have to feel guilty for hogging the air time, because it's all about you, and you don't have to reciprocate. It will help you hash things out. Also, you seem like someone for whom personal growth matters, and like someone who's willing to put in the work. This will help you sort through it. You can adopt the stuff a therapist advises you that you find applicable, and you can always dismiss the rest as bull.
Not taking it personal is difficult. For everyone. But I find, that ENTJs take it real hard. They're slow to trust, and careful in who they develop feelings for, and even though their feelings can and often are powerful, it's the one aspect of self they struggle understanding, which makes it extra difficult to process. My guess is, that if you both can keep it civil, your relationship will get better when apart, when coordinating as parents. You'll be good working with each other for the benefits of the kids, because your differing prioritization of values won't come to clash so often. Treat him as you would want to be treated, and even if he turns out to be a lesser man than you believed him to be, you'll sleep easy, knowing you're who you want to be.
Sauna, wellness weekend with friends, or a bubble bath with a candle and a book are a good investment right now ;)"
463,esfp,"I'm actually pretty fortunate to keep good company and none of my friends are really the type to say ""Fuck that guy"" and majority know that I'm comfortable accepting criticism with ""tough love"", so they'll be honest. I also have been working with an online counseling service and dumping all of my stuff in the chat session and today, while reading about ENTJ's, I came across this paragraph that states, 
""Given the nature of Ni, TeNi’s can sometimes approach detail overload. When this happens, it helps to externally record thoughts (in a journal, planner, to do list, or by talking with another person). Externally recording thoughts allows them to release the thought into long term storage, knowing that they are more likely to be able to recall it later. Or, if they feel they have adequately addressed the matter, it allows them to “delete” the info completely.""
I about shit myself because I kept apologizing to my counselor for how much I'd dump in the chats to late reflect on. 
Solid advice there though friend. I did a week away in Austin to basically go into overload with details about stuff and process. It was really helpful in the healing process. Now days with all the additional energy I've been having with my brain going overload on analysis, I've been going out and chatting with people. That's also helping. I've been pretty dormant for a while that getting back out is helping release and renew energy. "
464,esfp,"Always put together- I think about accessories like necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings a lot, especially the length of the necklace with my top. I like to follow fashion trends and make them as much my own as I can without just going for the next thing. I also just have a feeling when an outfit goes together right. I’m not really sure exactly what it is, I’ve just always had a sense of what works and what doesn’t and I feel uncomfortable leaving the house in a meh outfit. At my job I wear business casual with a lab coat and people always complement me for standing out in a good way with my clothing choices. I really fall into the ESFP fashion loving stereotype "
465,esfp,"I would usually make my own style based off the trendy clothes. Like I would wear Fila Disruptors with Adidas 3-stripe pants or a pair of ripped jeans, add a denim jacket or a hypebeast style Parkas if it’s cold out. These are my favourite outfits. Oh, and also DUNGAREES omgg they are so awesome! I own a white pair and I wear it a lot!

469,esfp,"same with me.  I like mental stimulation.  
I used to have jobs that were the same thing day in and day out and I would absolutely zone out.

471,esfp,"As an INTJ, with the reverse order of functions I am curious how your inferior and primary perceiving functions manifest and how they compare to an INTJs.  Also, my wife is ESFP, so I'm trying to gain better insight into how she ticks."
472,esfp,"Hey dude, I'm also an INTJ but my fiancée is an ESFP.  First and foremost, ESFPs generally aren't into analyzing things much at all, let alone to the level of depth that we INTJs tend to.
I'm starting off with this because, unfortunately, I doubt you're going to see much of a response to this post.  You're just asking for details that they're not really prone to caring about.  Even just MBTI in general is oftentimes more analytical than they'd prefer.
So in lieu of that, I'll try to pitch in here as much as I can, with what I've personally learned and discovered.  At least, that which I can put into words.
I have found the pairing of ESFP and INTJ between me and my fiancée to be very natural and enriching.  As you're obviously already aware, we share the same cognitive functions... except in reverse order.  This is massively valuable.  We seem to be generally ""on the same wave-length"" most of the time, which I contribute heavily to the fact that ultimately we are using the same cognitive functions to make sense of the world and produce decisions.  However, we also complement each other very well, in the sense that A) she picks up my slack in terms of Se and I pick up hers in terms of Ni, but also -- and more importantly -- B) we are continually learning from each other how to better utilize our inferior functions.  Which is to say, while she's picking up my Se slack, I'm also learning from her the value of Se and absorbing some of those tendencies.  (And vice versa.)
To get a bit more specific about how we compare?  Well for instance, much as I like to think I'm a very observant person, recognizing patterns in things and people that others don't see, she sees much more depth into the truth behind people, interpreting their words and their actions, to a degree of which I am simply incapable.  Many times I have felt certain I knew exactly what was going on and what I thought somebody ""actually meant"" when they said ""XYZ,"" but she would contradict me, and she would be right.  Perhaps that is an overly convoluted example, but the point is... even though I can see patterns, and I try to apply that pattern recognition to people, she still just gets people far better than I do.
As INTJs, our minds are very abstract and we think about things in this weirdly disconnected way that nobody else thinks about them.  ESFPs, as you would expect, are precisely the opposite.  They prefer the concrete, the tactile.  Another anecdote... I'm a programmer.  I don't know if you're very familiar with programming, but it can become incredibly abstract.  I've been helping my fiancée learn to program every once in a while, and she can now usually handle the linear stuff fairly easily... but once you start stepping back and making things abstract (such as functions, or worse, classes) she begins to struggle.  By the same token, she perceives the world in a much more direct way than I do.  I'm off in some distant corner of my head 90% of the time, but she's the one keeping me grounded here.  I'd forget to eat or sleep if it weren't for her (and that happens, when she's not around).
That's what I've got for now.  I might pop by again later if anything else occurs to me.  If you have any more specific questions, please let me know and I'll try to oblige. :)"
473,esfp,"Hi! I saw this post before and have been meaning to sit down and type up my response, sorry for taking so long!  
Please keep in mind that my personal interests and priorities may be different from your wife’s. Also I’ve only been learning about MBTI for a little while so I might not be spot on. Feel free to critique, I can’t give broad generalizations since each person is different from the next but I can give you my personal view and hopefully it can shed some light.  
So the ESFP cognitive functions are the opposite of an INTJ. In order they are Se/Fi/Te/Ni.  
So this is the process which I usually use to synthesize information and come to conclusions about the world around me.  
Outward Sensing (Se)
I take in stimuli, such as seeing things, facts that people tell me, etc. This is the basis and the “food” that I am working with. Many times conclusions stop here. Some examples of this are:  
Stimuli #1: See a ring on someone’s hand
Conclusion: S/he must be married  
Stimuli #2: See someone walking around with a full cup of starbucks
Conclusion: There must be a starbucks pretty close by  
Stimuli #3: Lamp doesn’t turn on
Conclusion: Power out or lightbulb burned out  
Simple connections like that. Imagine all of these, but maybe multiply by 3 and that’s how many things I will notice at any given time. I don’t notice everything, I could see what color shirt you are wearing but completely miss what color your eyes are or vice versa. Or that you have thick eyebrows or a scar somewhere. I don’t think this is restricted to ESFPs but more like selective attention. If I am tired I will notice less, if I am in a new place or meeting someone unfamiliar I will notice more. Also note that I am making a lot of mental connections at a time, and because of that a lot of times they do not have much value and thus do not cause any motivation for action. Sure there may be a starbucks in the vicinity but unless I am really craving starbucks I will not actively seek it out. Same with the example of the burnt out lightbulb. I have noticed that the lightbulb may be burnt out but I will most likely not change it right away instead mentally noting that it is something I need to do later.  
A lot of things to me are considered “solved” at this point after I’ve applied Se. Some will go on and apply Fi and Te (they kind of go hand in hand). Very rarely will a problem be serious or unsolvable enough to need me to use Ni. Keep in mind that little things like this which the conclusions stop here after outward sensing are those that don’t have anything to do with me and only have to do with the physical environment so I am impartial to them since they do not make me make a decision that will change my schedule or involve my feelings.  
Another example is that I am writing this up but just now I noticed that my keyboard is dusty. I typed a little more to finish my sentence and then proceeded to clean the dust off my keyboard before resuming typing. Other things that happen are I realize I need to shave my legs while I’m browsing the internet, browse the topic a little bit more, leave the tabs open so that I can go shave but also go back to it when I finish. Other things are I might realize I really need to use the bathroom and go do that or I just suddenly want to check my face in the mirror to make sure it looks okay. Or I’ll feel hungry and open the refrigerator to see if there’s anything to eat. I may or may not actually make something to eat. This also may happen three or four times within two hours and I may actually make something to eat either out of hunger, the fact that it’s a bit ridiculous that I’ve opened the refrigerator door four times or to stop myself from checking the refrigerator again. There are a few times when I will be so into what I’m doing that I don’t notice things around me but it happens very very rarely. Usually my eyes will wander and notice things around the room or I will get up and subconsciously check on other rooms or other people who are around me (ie. notice their facial expression or what they are doing at the time) for example if someone is reading a book and smiling, I will probably notice so that if someone else asks “have you seen so-and-so” I will be able to respond “oh s/he was sitting on the couch reading a book” Usually the order that I get to things is based on how I prioritize things (work/friends/order in which the problem was addressed/how urgent it is eg when I need to get it done by/how much time it will take to complete/if I have to finish one task first because the second depends on the outcome of the first) A lot of times I will forget and need another message to pop up (eg. stimuli) for me to get to it. "
474,esfp,"I've come to a lot of the same realizations with my ESFP wife.  We have been together 8 years in total.  We have learned a lot from each other, and I quite understand her preference for things concrete and observable.  She is much better at understanding people than I am.  I like to say she has street smarts while I have book smarts, and it's a good analogy for the ESFP/INTJ comparison.  I am curious to know especially how ESFPs perceive and utilize their inferior Ni, as I rarely see my wife's manifest.  I have had good luck with responses in this sub in the past, though it doesn't get a lot of traffic so it may take a while to get some in on this post.  At one point I had the highest voted post here (which seems weird for an INTJ to have in an ESFP subreddit)."
475,esfp,"This happens when I am multitasking 4-6 things. 5 is the magic number of things that I can attend to at one time and give my attention to and achieve optimal results. A lot of times I will stick something in the microwave and forget about it because I am doing other things, the microwave beeps and I think “what did that beep come from, oh that was the microwave I forgot that I microwaved something, let me go get it now or in a few minutes” I could microwave something, take it out of the microwave, realize that Spotify stopped playing music and realize I want music, get up even though I was prepared to eat in order to turn on music and then settle back down again to eat.  
Inward Feeling (Fi) & Outward Thinking (Te)
If something has not been solved by now I will move on to feeling (Fi). Things that get to this point in our thought process have already been filtered through our sensing. eg. they are things that we cannot come to conclusions based only on simple facts and require our personal input. This could be something that requires us to measure the facts against how we feel about them. Some examples are: where do you want to eat for dinner? Well if you give me two options there are things that I can mention from my own experiences about the restaurants such as but not excluded to bad/good food or service, whether my friend recommended it or if it was given good reviews by yelp or some other source of information, if I like a certain type of food (italian/mexican/chinese/japanese), if I feel like a healthy human being at the moment which would mean I would prefer a healthier option or if I feel like a hungry fatass which would mean preferring somewhere lower-scale and possibly gives better portions. Also how much money I feel like spending, if I just got a paycheck i will be more inclined to go to a more expensive place but if I just paid bills or bought something else (could be anything, a back massager, a new computer, if I bought breakfast this morning instead of eating cereal at home - the amount of money matters but the fact that I spent money that day matters a little bit more) then I will probably want to go with a cheaper option. This definitely ties to the Outward Thinking function (Te) in the way that all of the things that I just listed above in order to come to a conclusion will most likely be thought out loud or listed down on paper unless the decision is fairly simple but I will most likely want you to know why I came to the decision I came to and thus voice it out loud so that we are on the same page and that it doesn’t seem like I came to it arbitrarily. After going through sensing and feeling I would say that about 95% of things that go through my head will come to a satisfactory conclusion.  
Inward Intuition (Ni)
If a problem still has not been solved by now only then will I use my Ni. not many things that I think about will make it past the feeling filter but when they do this is the last process that I have in my arsenal to use to synthesize it. You know how in a game you will tend to prefer to play with certain characters over others? I am familiar with the other characters that I don’t like as much but I would rather not use them because it takes longer to get through the game since they are weaker. Ni is basically my weakest and “last resort” character. The function of Inward intuition is to connect things in a united conceptual form. So basically Ni tells us that something “should be this way” which means going out of my way to gather information from various other sources (which is tedious and time consuming). Overall I like to take things as individual situations as specific and unique. Therefore I might see a group of mallards and think “oh they have a green heads that’s such a weird color” but not make the connection until later that “all mallards have green heads” and therefore it is not that special that the group of mallards have green heads. I believe Ni is also related with hyperfocus on an idea or issue until it becomes solved. I do not like to do it because I like to focus on many things at one time since it gives me the feeling that I am working well. If I am focusing on one singular thing I feel like I should be doing something else because the time that I am using to struggle with just one concept I could be using to be completing other things that take less time. But yes, at times I will hyperfocus on one thing until I think up a solution. When the problem gets solved I will get a feeling of satisfaction from getting it done but I will not enjoy doing it since it means that I am working with information and generalizations that sometimes may not pertain directly to the issue at hand. The feeling of having researched something and turning out to be useless makes me feel like I have wasted time by looking it up and is usually why I would rather deal with a situation that gives me the cold hard facts.  
So I’m guessing for INTJ since the Ni function is first in the stack that someone who is an INTJ would rather think about an issue first as how it relates to other things and if conclusions can be drawn from information that is already known or can be looked up. Sorry for the block of text and I think I went off on a tangent and only kinda answered your question, I hope this is somewhat useful "
476,esfp,"First off, what do you want to know?  Second, I'm mainly curious to find out how ESFPs perceive their Ni, as I don't really see it in my wife, because it is both the inferior function and it is introverted so it doesn't get expressed much."
477,esfp,"We've been together for almost 8 years as well! :)
I clearly did not understand your ultimate goal, as I seem to have described all these things that you already knew but did not really talk about her use of Ni at all.  Sorry!
/u/BurgerMe's comments should be interesting & valuable to you, as she actually discusses all four functions in detail.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the turnout you've had already with this post.  I stand corrected!
I must agree that I haven't really seen my fiancée's Ni manifest (or at least I have not recognized it), so I can't be any more help there.  But now I'm interested, so I plan to keep my eyes open."
478,esfp,"And I thought I'd written a wall of text!
Seriously though, this was a very interesting read.  There were a number of things you described that were reminiscent of my fiancée, most notably your aversion to hyperfocus.  If we have a list of problems we need to solve, as an INTJ, I want to go through that list sequentially and only move onto the next problem once the current one is solved.  (And because it's a list of problems, I also want to try to focus on solving them so we can get it all out of the way quickly.)  She definitely prefers hopping between problems and chipping away at them all, and taking little Reddit-breaks right in the middle.
You're pretty much right-on about how INTJs use Ni.  We generally keep a model of all things in our heads and reference it as our information source.  These models are usually just compiled and updated from life experiences, but obviously sometimes actual research must be done.  Most times, the Ni acts subconsciously, so we often feel like we understand a thing but have no idea how we understand it (until we break down into Te and piece it all together).  (I think this is why we can sometimes have a very hard time explaining ourselves and communicating our thougts/decisions.)
It was particularly interesting to read what you had to say about Se.  I find that I also do similar things, but somehow had never really connected it with Se.  Ultimately though, it usually still ends up at Ni... like if I see someone wearing a ring I might think, ""Okay, so they're married,"" and then I'll store that fact into my model of that person.  Later if it becomes relevant, I'll know ""that person is married"" but it won't be immediately obvious to me why I know that."
479,esfp,"I'm glad I could contribute :) this was actually kind of served an exercise for me since it forced me to sit down and think about how I think so it really helped me to understand myself better as well. I await your long response if you decide to do it, I would love to learn about what life is like from an INTJ perspective!"
480,esfp,"OK, long response incoming.
Your post was really enlightening. It was very interesting to read how the reverse order of the same functions works.  I think we use Fi and Te similarly, but place more emphasis on Te and whether something makes logical sense.  Te is the engine that gets ideas generated by Ni done.  
I've noticed the Se in my wife's behavior, the constant taking in of stimuli and multitasking.  She can do far more at once than I do, but she lacks focus, which you explained the reasons for in having inferior Ni.  I find it interesting the differences between INTJs and ESFPs in that.  I tend to make connections and intuitive leaps between various abstract ideas easily, and if a concept or idea is not immediately useful, it doesn't matter, because I know I will find a use for it in the future. Because of having inferior Se, I often don't remember where an idea or fact pops into my head, but through Ni I can generate useful plans or ideas based on many of these seemingly unconnected things.  Since Ni tends to coalesce rather than add up, I tend to focus on one or two things at a time, rather obsessively until I either complete them if they need completing or get burnt out on them if they are ideas, concepts or people.  
This last part can make relationships hard, especially with my ESFP as she tends to focus on a lot of people at once and I often feel neglected as I'm not getting her full attention very often, while I am only able to give my utmost attention to one or two people at a time and I get burnt out if it's constantly on her.  I think I just had an epiphany with that, thank you for helping me with it.  
The part about Fi was especially funny, with the complexity in choosing a restaurant.  My wife takes forever to decide where she wants to eat (if she decides at all), and now I know why.  I tend to have several options already in mind when I ask her, all rationed out through Ni-Te-Fi (I can expound upon that if you want) and usually she will pick one of them as we share similar tastes, though it is exciting when she picks something I hadn't thought of.
I am curious on one thing, though not knowing your age I don't know if you will be able to answer this.  As my wife has gotten older (she's only 27, I'm 30, so not that old) and we have been together longer, she has lost a lot of that ESFP sense of adventure and desire to try new things in general.  I have always had a (different, but complimentary) sense of adventure as well, and mine hasn't diminished with age.  In fact, if anything it's intensified.  I wonder if you have experienced anything like that or not?  I wonder if it's just because of us having settled down and had a child, her lower level functions maturing or something else or some combination.  I still see a spark of that spontaneity and creativity here and there (mostly when she's drunk), but it seems stifled for some reason that I cannot put my finger on. Any insight you can offer on this would be most helpful."
481,esfp,"It would be interesting to hear how you rationalize things through Ni-Te-Fi! I kind of get it but not really since I’ve never heard a concrete example.  
As for the “sense of adventure” part: I am in my early twenties and am in my first of what I hope will be a long term relationship (with an INTJ actually!) I feel that I like to please people I care about and make/keep them happy. Therefore the longer I am with them and the more that we talk and share things with each other I take into consideration his opinions and thoughts and store them away in this mental file cabinet. It could be a passing thought you voiced like “I don’t really like outdoorsy stuff.” At the time you could have meant that you are not in the mood for going camping, but that little piece of information gets stored away and now every time I think about doing something I open that mental file cabinet and compare it to the ideas that I have. Eg. If there was a midnight stargazing event or a carnival, I would remember that time when you said “I don’t really like outdoorsy stuff” and that would go on as one of the reasons not to go and thus I would either 1. Voice the option and not expect to go OR more likely 2. Not mention it at all because I assume that you would not want to do it and I don’t like getting “no” very much. I know I fall into this mental trap all the time. I feel that especially since you have a child she is putting her interests on the backburner. I think what would get me out of that kind of rut would be to ask your wife to plan something that is fun for her regardless of what you like or dislike, emphasize that you want her to pick something that she wants to do without worrying about her obligations or how you feel about it. (the only trap here is that if you end up not liking it she may blame herself… so be cautious?) If she says she doesn’t really want to place a burden on someone to take care of your child (most likely worrying about taking away a family member’s time or financially if you have to drop your child off at the daycare or spend money to hire a sitter), tell her that it’s not a big deal if you unload your child on someone else for a day. I hope this helps, I’d really like to know if this works out for you!"
482,esfp,"OK, I'll try my best to describe it.  I'll probably not capture it accurately enough, but I'll do my best.  A good example of how Ni especially works for me is in making intuitive connections, instantaneously.  Last night my wife noticed that our lawn was getting dead spots and wondered why (her Se).  I made notice of the dead spots and instantly intuited that the lawn was dying again in those spots because the lawn had grown too long (we have been gone on vacation until recently) and the sprinklers were being blocked by the tall grass, unable to reach the spots that were dying.  I instantly knew the why of the grass dying, but I had to go back and determine how I knew it, if that makes sense.  Often the connections Ni makes are much more complex, but this happened recently and I made a point of remembering it for this.
Te comes in to make judgements about what Ni perceives.  Does it make logical sense?  Is this a workable solution?  How do we go about implementing it?  Etc.  Te is the engine that gets shit done.
Fi backs up Te.  Fi is an internal judgement of whether what I'm doing is something that agrees with my self derived ethics and morals, and whether I like it or not.
Good luck with your relationship with your INTJ.  I know it is not an easy pairing from personal experience, but it can work with a lot of work being put into it.  One thing I'll say is that our opinions and tastes can change, often seemingly inexplicably (though we always have our reasons, we may not be able to express them properly).  So what is true with him today, may not necessarily be in the future.
I think I'll try your suggestion and have her do something fun for herself and let me watch our son, or plan a date night and have someone else watch him.  I know she doesn't like being apart from him, but she also needs time for herself and for our relationship.  I've had a hard time explaining and communicating that."
483,esfp,"You should learn to embrace the alone time. It's extremely important for your well-being that you do that. If you fear it, do it! Do it, until it's no longer uncomfortable. Use it to read a book. Watch a film. Work out at home. Learn the guitar. Learn how to program. Learn how to do anything that you wished you did, but kept telling yourself you don't have time. Use the time to make journal entries. Introspect. Focus on what is important for you.
​
People who fear loneliness too bad choose bad friends, bad partners, and don't have any power in the relationships, because everyone knows they won't walk away from toxicity if they fear loneliness. Empower yourself instead. Learn to see why you have value. To yourself, and to others.
Being alone is alright. It's got many upsides. But it takes overcoming the fear."
484,esfp,"I think you've got some good tips from Horrorito, can't really add much to it. 
As others mentioned, don't derive your self worth from the people you're surrounded by. As a high Fi user you have the potential to be emotionally self-sufficient."
485,esfp,"yo sorry for the late reply, i got caught up in stuff  but i really wanted to say thank you i really appreciate ur advice. ive actually taken up some of what u said (just havent replied) and started journalling and reading a lot more.
i think im just afraid of it. its not so bad itself"
486,esfp,"I’d say, practice asking yourself what do *I want to do? What would I do if there was no one to hang out with? There’s a nice sort of freedom that comes with being alone - no social obligations, no feeling like you have to impress or be self conscious."
487,esfp,"Like here's the thing. I appear to be introverted to many people but once they start talking to me, within 2 minutes they know I am extroverted. Here's the thing, I do like being out of the house BUT I need my alone time...if I am out for like a good 12 hours or so, I need alone time. 
How ESFPs are described, they are known to be the most extroverted but do I feel this way? Hell no. I do make friends and get along with people for the most part BUT I get a little drained if I am around too many people at a party. 
Do any of you relate to this?"
488,esfp,"Just chill out. You're over thinking it. Look more into functions and instead of comparing yourself to stereotypical esfp behavior. The way esfp is written in mbti is really shallow and over emphasis the party boy. It's also one of the types with the least written about it.
You also say a lot of stuff with no awareness to how it sounds. You're introverted cause you need to recharge after being out for 12 hours? Really bro? Some people cannot have lunch with another person without having a recharge. You'll get more perspective about yourself as you live, get older. Not by asking endless questions about this stuff 
 Look more into socionics. But, really, chill out with these threads. It's like you're having a crisis"
489,esfp,"you could be an ambrivert. but it really depends on how you recharge yourself. for example: I may sleep 3 hours one night, work all day the next day, go home feeling exhausted, receive a text from some friends inviting me to the bars or whatnot and while i'm driving to meet them, I feel some super burst of energy. vis versa, an introvert could sleep 3 hours, work all day, go home feeling exhausted, open a book and feeling completely energized by what they are reading. 
feeling drained around too many people at a party is normal for any type; there are too many of them to have possible conversations with, you may feel uncomfortable with the way you dressed or the person who brought you there, or you might just want to party with a familiar group of people.
just because we are ESFP's, it doesn't mean we should always feel totally comfortable in any social gathering at any point or time. "
490,esfp,"Yea I'm the same way. I don't talk to most people but once we get a convo going I'm very outgoing. I need to be out and among people every day at least though.
I think ESFJ is most extroverted. Possibly ESTP. Because of their Fe. Ne doms are quite extroverted as well. I don't know if I get drained at a party, it's more like I just want to go home and do my own stuff after a while."
491,esfp,"Yeah. Don't worry too much about it :) I have a huge preference to extroversion and there are entire weeks where the thought of lots of people sounds way too tiring. Keep in mind, being tired it perfectly natural, so there is no need to look to far into that "
492,esfp,"Like an ENFP, you got that auxiliary introverted feeling. Maybe you need alone time for emotional processing.  
Also, I had an ESFP boyfriend (which was apparently a bad idea), and though he seemed to have a greater appetite for going out to many different places, I was definitely chattier, to the point of exhausting him, though I think he was actually more conventionally extroverted."
493,esfp,"""Extroverted"" just means objective- Michael pierce.
So being a ""Objective Sensory"" dominant doesn't equate to not being shy or not overly outgoing. You do have FI aux, I estimate that's receiving a lot of attention."
494,esfp,My friends tell me I’m either ISTJ or ISTP but my family member who is a certified mbti practitioner says I’m an ESFP. I’m just depressed and dealing with emotional abuse from my younger years so I’m much less bubbly and loud. Did any of y’all get mistyped? I’m sure there’s plenty of ESFPs like me in other threads who are mistyped.
495,esfp,"There are definitely members of all types that get mistyped all the time. Poor tests, stereotypes, people's own bias, depression, mania, other mental disorders, etc etc.
Ironically, ESFPs have a stereotype of being bubbly, but honestly, that's more often the ESFJs. ESFP Enneagram 7 with social instinct dominance and triple positive Enneagram type might be, and E7s are common, but other than that, not really. ESFPs value Fi, which is individualistic and private, so that's their show of emotions, and they also value Te, which focuses on return on invest, and shortest most efficient way for maximum return. So, ESFPs can come across quite cold and aloof in moments when they are not engaged.
Things is, I find that both myself and other ESFPs turn on charm for a specific person or group when they are engaged with them in the moment, but can have quite the RBF when not involved. Many are often aloof and standoffish in certain moments. They can also be very practical and problem solvers, so especially with some of them, people assume they're thinkers, because they're practical. I think what others mistake for ISTP (TiSe) or ISTJ (SiTe) is your combination of primary and tertiary functions, Se+Te.
Have you ever taken an Enneagram (with instincts) test? I'm curious to see what you test as. If you're, let's say, Enneagram 6 or Enneagram 9, especially sx/sp or sp/sx (the instincts), you will come across as more introverted. Of that, E6 are the problem-solvers, which is a stereotype otherwise often allocated to ISTPs.
​"
496,esfp,"Hi, I used to be typed as an ISTJ.  I'm no expert in this, but I feel like someone's personality can change throughout their life.  Once I moved away form my shitty parents and could actually be myself I became an ESFP for sure.  When living with my parents I was constantly extremely stressed and anxious so I was not very social and always overthought everything.  So I guess at that time I was an introvert because even though I enjoyed socializing, the idea of being around people other than my close friends made me anxious, and due to my parents I was constantly emotionally drained and needed space.  I always really thought through my actions and the consequences and did what I thought was supposed to be done.  So maybe I was an ESFP I just wasn't myself, or maybe I was an ISTJ and grew into an ESFP.  I think it just matters how you look at it."
497,esfp,"You can mistype as any type, when I first got into MBTI I got ENTP/INTP on every test I took. Then for a little bit I thought I was an ESTP, it made a lot more sense, because my mood doesn't change every 5 seconds and I'm not random, quirky or interested in discussing possibilities. The main thing that made me rethink whether I was an ESTP was that I clearly have strong Fi and no Fe(also later on I figured out that I use Te over Ti), but what stopped me from typing as an ESFP right away was this bubbly, sensitive, friendly neighbor bs that sites like 16p are pushing. Finally, after reading a bunch of alternative descriptions(especially the socionics ones) and researching every single function I figured out that I'm definitely an ESFP"
498,esfp,"What u/Losttrails2 said. We don't change type, but at different maturity levels, or health levels (depression, trauma, etc etc), we can fall back on some of our lower-down functions, therefore appear to others as a different type.
People who experience bullying or emotional trauma often come across introverted, even if they are not. In typology, cognitive extroversion is not necessarily social introversion. Cognitive extroversion means you engage with the outside world (not necessarily people) before you refer to the internal. It might mean that you collect data from the external world (Se and Ne), before you evaluate them through the filter of your internal values (Fi), as opposed to focusing on your values, and then collecting data for their benefit. Introverts are more introspective, not necessarily less engaged with people. Extroverts are more open to experience before introspecting on it. That does not have to involve people. Often does, but not always, especially not with those who are shy, have social anxiety, or are depressed."
499,esfp,It’s said that when you are depressed you revert into your shadow type which is technically INTJ but you are still technically a dominant sensor which is why you most likely thought ISTJ. ISTJs are known to fear the future and INTJs are known to look forward to it. An ESFP often fears the future which is why a shadow INTJ probably still fears the future much like an ISTJ although in a different way.
500,esfp,I thought I was an ESTP as well because I can be an accidental asshole very often. It’s not the same as a tertiary Fe user messing with people’s emotions though. I say things that I think are true and authentic then realize through facial expressions that the person is angry with me. Sucks. I don’t want to come off like a jerk or anything but sometimes just being real and saying what you really think can cause people to freak out.  I feel uncomfortable thinking for myself but I have read a ton of info and I have hundreds of reference points so I’d like to think my understanding is pretty strong of most topics I’m interested in. Have you experienced that? I try to be honest and real with people and do things for them all the time. Many people hate me and I have a lot of enemies but then someone fake comes along and doesn’t care about them and gets praised without doing anything to back it up. Super frustrating. Have you felt that?
501,esfp,"I'm an Enneagram 6 too. You can look into Enneagram if you are interested. It's a different taxonomy than MBTI/Jungian typology/Socionics, but can be quite complimentary. It focuses on people's core fears and motivators. There's a lot more depth to it, but in basic:
Type 6 fears fear itself, and concerns itself with safety. There are two ways to react to it, either phobic (fear avoidant, looking for source of security), or counter-phobic (faces fear, recklessness). Most people oscillate somewhere in between these two approaches, with a tendency to be more one than the other. I, for example, am mostly counter-phobic. They typically make good problem-solvers, when healthy, and are good with taking precautions, or at least being aware of what they should be. If not so healthy, they tend towards paranoia, fear of the future, doomsday approach, and towards conspiracy theories.
Type 2 fears being unneeded and unloved, and tends towards nurturing of others to tie them to themselves and make themselves needed, and to get love in return. Healthy ones are positive, nurturing, and empowering, while unhealthy ones tend to be suffocating, overbearing, undermining your sense of empowerment."
502,esfp,I definitely thought I was an introvert until I realized my “introvert” time was filled with solo activities and looking interesting things up and having fake arguments/ conversations in my head. When you’ve had a hard time with toxic people your need to extrovert doesn’t go away. You just find ways to do it without people. C.S. Joseph also says the ESFP often retreats into an introverted side of their mind if they feel uncomfortable with those around them. Worrying about what they think (Te) and worrying about the experience you are giving them (Se)
503,esfp,"Yeah I can relate to some people not liking you off the bat, that happens to me too. Sometimes these people are just jealous, sometimes I might come off cocky. As far as someone getting upset over you saying how you feel it depends on what you're talking about like if someone asks you if you think they look fat and you tell them yes then it's understandable lol but otherwise if someone is just mad at you for telling the truth then it's probably pointless to have deep conversations with them"
504,esfp,Interesting! Yeah I was a chaotic rebel in school but now I’m one of the most loyal employees at my jobs. I still fear the future and I had a brief period of conspiracy obsession but now I don’t allow myself to read any of that. I actually bought thousands of seeds and started prepping/ watching info wars. I’m not even remotely like that anymore so I must have gone between the two. Isn’t type six really rare for ESFP? I’ve heard it’s common with ISFP 
505,esfp,When I’m a pretty logical person and I’m still thinking possibly ESTP. Sometimes people my age says things they believe strongly and I try to soften it but I can’t help but correct them. I can see inconsistencies pretty well and I often point out how what they are saying cannot follow their other claims and it often frustrates them. I really love this INFP at my work but they tell me I need to be less logical and try to understand things from other perspectives. I just think I’m pretty grounded and open to realistic ideas but not fanciful ones that are inconsistent. 
506,esfp,"I do that too, but in a different way than Ti users. As I've got into my 20's I really started being more prone to seeing inconsistencies and stopped falling for things that aren't backed by evidence(except for MBTI lol but I view it as just a loose system that helps you understand why people think differently)
One of the Te/Ti differences I've noticed between ESxPs is that as when our tertiary functions are well developed(and I believe that functions gradually evolve with age) ESTPs are less determined and proactive than ESFPs. We both have Ni which can among other things manifest itself in ambitiousness, but with Te ESFPs are more efficient in getting things actually done"
507,esfp,"I have a good friend who is an ESFP. Before I get into my problem with her, I'll say this. She's kind, she's thoughtful, she's hilarious, she's wonderful as a person and I value her friendship deeply. Our friendship means a lot. She's genuinely special to me and I'm only asking the following questions in order to preserve our friendship. 
So. My problem. I work with her. At the moment, I work a little above her. She is on a team I am responsible for. And, though I love her in informal friendship settings, she is incredibly immature and unprofessional in situations that require professionalism. We're meeting with investors at the moment, as we need funding for this project. She is manic, bordering on panicked in these meetings. It's genuinely embarrassing to be in a meeting with professionals with her- she stresses out in front of them, scrambles for the answers to questions, has no sense of order when presenting our case, scatters notes across the table, interrupts me frequently, despite me being midway through a presentation. 
I am also struggling with being technically 'in charge' of her. She is really quite unreliable- she struggles to meet deadlines, and if I ask her for something more than once she takes it personally. If I ask a question to understand what she meant by something in her notes, she takes it personally. She has a specific expression and tone that I know well; it means her feelings are hurt and I may well hear about it later. If I take a moment with someone else on the team, she asks me later why she wasn't included- well, because it wasn't your area and had nothing to do with what you're working on. 
I love her, I care about her, but I'm getting very frustrated with her. How do I gently ask her to be professional at work? And how can I help her stop feeling like she has to... I don't know, fix things with me? She's also getting to a point where she can absolutely sense my frustration and as a result is trying extra hard. I really don't like it when she tries so hard, I like it when she's just herself- but lately she's been forcing humour, trying to be funny rather than letting it come naturally as it usually does to her, messaging me twice as much as usual, asking me if we're okay almost every day, and it's driving me a little insane. I just want her to be a little more professional at work and know where the line is. 
I don't want to hurt her feelings, but she seems to be so easily offended at times. It's getting to the point where I'm starting to get irritated with her in non-work settings just because her behaviour is reminding me of what she's doing at work. 
I'm sorry if this sounds judgemental, I really do care about her, but I'm getting so exhausted with balancing her and work. "
508,esfp,"Take her out for a beer and be honest with her. We like straight forward. It’s her job aka essential for living.  We can tell when you’re bsing us, may be why she’s irritated with you. Give her an open space to talk, that’s not at work. Make sure you make her feel like you’re on the same team.
And yes we do need down time to process our emotions. But we don’t like anyone to know about it.  My boyfriend barely knows it haha. 
Edit: make it fun somehow! "
509,esfp,"That's a great idea, thanks! I do try to lift her up with everything I say. I hate being technically her 'boss' on this project, because as a person she's wonderful, as an employee... well, I hate having to be critical of my friend. 
I'll definitely start trying to assign more tasks that I know she excels at, and I'll be sure to give her more positive reinforcement. 
Do you think it'd be a good idea to spend some extra time with her outside work? I get the feeling that she's resentful or irritated with me at the moment, but I think some down time could help us get back on track. I just want to do whatever I can to make her feel better whilst reducing my frustrations. I know my frustrations aren't her fault, it just appears that we have conflicting working styles. 
Would spending time outside of work be a good idea in your opinion, or do you think I should give her some breathing room?"
510,esfp,"This sounds like a great idea. It's much better to focus on 'you're doing y task instead of x because you're great at y!' than 'you're not doing x task because you're not as good'...
Also I know you didn't ask me but I personally would say, yeah, time outside of a working environment is probably good. It's a different relationship when you're at work (and technically her superior) than when you're just hanging out."
511,esfp,"Definitely! Awesome, thank you. I really want to make sure she's happy, whilst being productive. 
Even so, I appreciate the input. I'll definitely make sure I set aside an evening where we can not talk about work and just hang out and have fun then!"

513,esfp,"I'm an INTJ programmer, and my roommate is an ESFP artist. I'm helping her with her required programming class. As you might imagine, it has been quite a struggle for her to grasp the highly abstract nature of programming. It also doesn't help that this is one of her last classes. She is very burned out by college, and her primary worry is on finding employment, and not on her last classes.
Despite this, when I come to help her, she will be very attentive, and try her hardest to understand what is going on. Of course I'm not expecting her to become a pro at this, but I do want to do what I can to help her as much as I can since she is struggling A LOT.
The main issue I see is that most of the time she can understand very simple concepts by themselves, but only in a very specific circumstance, and fail to learn the pattern and reason behind that concept. To put it in more concrete terms (and ridiculously simplified example): she will understand that ""2 + 2 = 4"" after seeing an example of 4 things together, but afterwards, when ask to put the sumation of 2 and 3, she will be lost, and unable to relate that to the prevous example.
I hope I expressed my problem clearly. Is there anybody here that has come across a similar situation? What strategies did you use to be able to learn easier?"
514,esfp,"I am also an INTJ programmer and my fiancee is an ESFP artist/biologist. She occasionally becomes interested in learning programming, both for professional purposes (building websites, or games) and also to better understand and appreciate what I do (she's so great).
She's pretty comfortable with simple concepts such as arrays or the distinctions between different primitive types, but once you start getting into OOP she begins to have a harder time conceptualizing the more abstract class vs. object vs. function/method distinctions. (She also tends to forget her semicolons... I wonder if that's due to a more urgent ""let's get this done and try it out right naow"" sort of mindset.)
We talked about it, and /u/Kafke is definitely right that you should try to use as many real-life analogies as possible. I like to compare classes to blueprints or schematics, while objects are the actual things created based on those blueprints. Methods are actions that those things are capable of doing, e.g. a Car is able to ""drive,"" ""turnOnRadio,"" ""openDoor,"" ""lock,"" etc. I have found this approach to be somewhat successful, but not perfect, so I'm still learning the best ways to communicate. I also recently compared constructors to ""a machine that can convert a blueprint into the end-product, e.g. 'construct' the actual car"" to explain why it's a method that looks like a class (has the same name). It was not a perfect analogy and made me realize that constructors are surprisingly difficult to explain.
This is a very interesting topic to me and I would love to work together on finding the best ways to communicate these abstract concepts, and continue sharing our results!"
515,esfp,"How I learned to program, and how I teach people, is by using analogies to physical real-life things. So an array would be related to mailboxes.
Most of programming lines up to physical things. And really, the only thing you need to teach past that is the ""grammar"" of the programming language (write lines, end with a ';', if's, loops, etc).
Though, I'm an ISTP, so that might not be the best way to teach an ESFP."
516,esfp,"One idea is to make the best use out of her existing material. Which exercises and lessons does she have to comply with? This stuff should hopefully be at entry-level and gone over in class already.
What I mean here is: instead of trying to get this huge overarching INTJ scheme of yours into her head just act as a coach for her to get her homework done. Don't even code."
517,esfp,"When I was younger I always scored as an INTP, but now I score more as an ESFP.
Any insights into this?
Also hi!
Think this explains it quite well:
https://www.quora.com/Can-a-persons-Myers-Briggs-personality-type-change"
518,esfp,"Keep in mind that the tests can make mistakes. Also do more than one. And check the cognitive functions. Also keep in mind mbti represents core personality not too much of external factors. 
Eg. J vs P
I'm INTP naturally. But like J's I like my workspace organised and what not . Seems like the opposite of p but as we mature things can come into balance
Also I've become more extroverted in some aspects and as for f . Some times a test even put me as F and it's usually fifty fifty. But that's only because of my religious background family and other factors like that. But exploring cognitive functions clears it up.
There are other factors like social anxiety that might cause even n extrovert to score as an introvert. Also many of us unwittingly delude ourselves in different ways as we any the questions results vastly vary
Edit: also after reading through many sources mbti tests usually talk about external factors affecting results and in certain reflections they might mention certain behaviours that resemble other types .
But mbti type does not change. 
I have 2 esfp sisters and my mom is esfp. All really different, my mom even acts like me . So I deal with alot of grey area"
519,esfp,"Yes,i think i know, i was married and was an intj as scored by my college professor. My needs for love and acceptance were being meet, so i could be introverted and judgemental of others with no repercussions. 
Now that I've been single for a while, I've had to alter my personality, because i don't want to die alone. :) 
I changed my behaviors to match my situation. Since the test is based on behaviors it stands to reason that if you have any emotional intelligence your rating would change based on your situation. "
520,esfp,"You don't change that much... even if let's say you change... did you have major trauma or something? Maybe you started acting your shadow side which appeared like INTPs I'll have to look up ESFP's shadow function stack for that though... ESFP's are chilled out, don't cares... INTP are stressed out, thinkers... that's huge... The point being if you now identify with ESFP it's fine if you don't feel like it you may be another type... just a suggestion... if you are biased towards some type don't be... all the types have pros and cons and they are all special ""snowflakes"" :-P"
521,esfp,"only at 15 and above do people start using their auxiliary functions. You could've been an ISTP with INTP tendencies at first.
Depression, stress and trauma also mess around with functions so you could've then became ESTP from ISTP
from T to F, it's hard to say but ESTPs and ESFPs are actually really similar outwardly. The test could've easily mistaken the two due to a lack of development in both."
522,esfp,"You asked a question, then disagree with the answers you get? Why did you come on here again? To hear only a specific answer that you want to hear?
(That's called confirmation bias, BTW.)"
523,esfp,"I can disagree with the answers, my personality has changed, I know it has. Im just wondering if anyone has any similar stories.
I was INTP, every test I did I always came out INTP. But now (3 years later) I usually get ENFP or ESFP"
524,esfp,Until you actually figure out how the functions work you are literally just a blind man running in circles clicking answers that pertain to you at the time. There is a high possibility that you mistyped. And as an INTP it would be even more possible that you mistyped because of how scattered we can be. Go learn the cognitive functions and how they work then figure it out yourself. Just taking a test and believing it without understanding anymore about it... Actually that sound like an esfp lol. Well you mistyped. Carry on
525,esfp,"And the link you posted is better? Quora is basically Yahoo answers. There's no ""source"" for anything MBTI related as it isn't science based.
Do you want an answer to your question or did you just post it for fun? Everyone's gonna say the same thing. Go ahead and post it in /r/mbti and see what they say."
526,esfp,"I answered this earlier and what I said was as an ESFP I always focused very hard to train my cognitive functions, so much so, that for a time I was an INTP because I neglected my strengths and focused on my weaknesses."
527,esfp,"As an esfp you have extraverted sensing as a primary function making you go through all the tests to see what was ""practical"". Introverted feeling as your second function is where you get that introvert. Which sounds right there with what you just described battling everything.Though it can be a very strong trait when you feel strongly about/for something. Idk. Sounds close to me from the information we have"

529,esfp,"Hi There !    
   
~~I'm a near archetypal INTP !~~ 
I'm an ENTP, in fact ! =D 
Seen in socioconics that ~~INTPs~~ INTjs and ESFPs are Duals for each others ,
which I find really interesting     
     
So I wondered what meant to be an ESFP      
So if you want to help me a bit in my quest of knowlege ,I would ask you some questions then :
 
༄ What does ESFP acronym means for you ? 
༄ Do you know some INTPish people ? 
༄ Do you have experienced a Duality Relation ?
༄ Do you have some questions for me as an INTP ? (because I'll be glad to answer anything !)
 
Thanks alot for your attention ! 😊"
530,esfp,"Hi there, I am an ESFP, and I will gladly answer your questions, but first I need to clarify what you mean by ""duality relation?"" Those words have no clear meaning to me. It seems that English may not be your first language, but is there any way you can restate this one question?
I'm thinking that you mean one of two things, either a ""dual reality"" (which would be like living one existence but believing another) or you simply mean a polyamorous relationship which is being in love with multiple people at once."
531,esfp,"well for me being an ESFP is likeing to express feelings and would rather be around people then be alone. that is me personally. some of the other things apply, but people and feelings sums me up to a T.
well I dont know any INTPs per say. I am not sure exactly how I would tell. But I am curently dating a guy who is INTJ. which is almost the same. and It is working out amazing! we have so much fun.  The only thing is that we are exact opposites. he would rather be alone then go out with people and he does not share his feeling well. but he will eventually. and he does go out with me on occasion. but we love eachother. and vise versa. I let him have his alone time and I dont pressure him to spend time with me or share his feelings unless the situation calls for it. "
532,esfp,"My husband is actually an INTJ so I don't think they are that different. 
At times it annoys the piss out of me that we are so incredibly opposite. He relaxes by sitting at home and playing on the computer or readin boring things on reddit. My relaxation comes from being out of the house. Loud music. Lots of talking and interaction. So what makes me feel good makes him stress out. 
But I guess I love him no matter much. He reads things about me and though I FEEL everything and he THINKS everything... It's good for balancing us out. Though it is insane trying to get each other to see our points of view. 
He's logical and I'm spontaneous. He's quiet until he has a very definite opinion and I kind of bounce around loudly until I feel comfortable. 
I'm kind of just rambling now so I'm gonna stop.... :) "
533,esfp,"I'm an ESFP, close friends with an INTP who is studying graphic design. We get along really well and I understand the duality. INTPs are an interesting group because a heavy F mixed with a heavy I creates interesting conversation when it comes to emotion. "
534,esfp,"Hi yea... I'm an ENTP and the dual for INTP is ESFJ.  In socionics, the last letter is switched for introverts.  Some people deny this, but I've spent a great deal of time talking to my mother and I am super confident she is ESFP and very happily married to an INTJ.  
As an ENTP I have spent a great deal of time interacting with ISFJ and ISFP and I am confident I like ISFJ wayyyyy more.
Good luck."
535,esfp,"None of those !       
They just have theorised the relations between MBTI achetypes
the duality is the best but because it's a theory I wanted to know if it has some realty !
I can restate anyway :
How do you see INTPs ?    
(That's pretty much just that ! X) )"
536,esfp,"Not much a feeler ?  
Interesting !
And even then ... =O
Yep INTXs seems to have difficulties with feelings =)"
537,esfp,"haha ! XD    
I haven't though you can see this like that : I find it funny !
Two side of the same coin : that's how it's written in the paper,it seems it's accurate   
I'm happy for you !
Nah I love reading you !
I use to read lot of thinkers in Reddit : your style is very refreshing    
I thought feelers were afraid of internet ..."
538,esfp,"Yep emotions are terrible for INTPs =D
I use to neglect mine. Now I've understood it was ordered and intelligent ,I'm less weirded out and I'm amazed by feelers ,without plain understand how it works.
Back to back =D
I was wondering how it would feel X)
it's the main reason for I created this thread
It's your heavy F we are talking about, right ?
 
Thank you ! ^^"
539,esfp,"Another Redditor told me about this socioconics invertin thing !
Thanks !
You too ! ^^"
540,esfp,"Oh ok. In that case,


I'll break down each letter. E: I'm social and enjoy meeting new people. S: I take in the world around me. I enjoy being able to experience things. Experiences are very valuable to me, much more than material possessions. I love the outdoors and I'm a sucker for simply feeling good. F: I act based upon my feelings sometimes. I do not like this characteristic and I'm actively working to repress it mainly because I am in an emotionally controlling relationship with a ENFJ who had a bad childhood and exhibits the primary negative characteristic of being very manipulative. P: Means that i live and let live, almost to a fault. I don't really judge others for their actions and beliefs as long as they are harming no one and not judging me.


Not sure, i think two of my friends are INTJ but they don't seem to fit the J much, but maybe because they are my friends.


No as I mentioned I'm actively stuck in a relationship with a ENFJ who exhibits the most negative characteristics of his type.


Yes, my question for you is can you answer your first question and tell me what each letter of INTP means to you? 

"
541,esfp,"Nooooo! I love the internet. I just avoid a lot of it. Fb drama. I don't read peoples posts a lot. Blah. I do however LOVE fb games! And all games really. I play WoW sometimes. Farm games. Slot games. I even dabble in the rp side of things like twitter. 
I also write some. Not a lot. I used to write a lot more. I'm like a big kid. I can spend all day watching Disney movies!  And I've recently gotten into the studio ghibli movies! "
542,esfp,"a friend of mine was in a class where the professor asked whether we would take a pill that would make us happy for the rest of our life (constant ecstacy feel) and all the Ts in the class said that taking the pill was the ""obvious choice"" but as an F there are so many more outcomes of doing so. 
As far as feeling goes when spending time with an INTP, it's really interesting to try and break their shell of emotion, although it is nearly impossible. They would rather talk about interesting drawings, deep topics, philosophy, etc. "
543,esfp,"Repress it ? Oo
Uh oh bad ahead !
Use to not care about that X)
That are ? =S
Seems fair !
Here we go then :

I : Seeing people costs me alot so I have manage my energy when I'm about to being in social situations which I enjoy anyway     
    Luckily I love managing ^^
N : Intuitive , my Ne (extraverted intuition) is my major mean to process my surrondings it's very efficient to find interesting things but make me look crazy ! XD     
    Sometimes my attention is forced : I'm a butterfly ...
T : Introverted thinking , my internal world of logic sutained by two pillars :        
Scientific method        

correcting and/or using logical flaws
Thinking actually costs me practically anything so making things working is easy and enjoyable for me 


P : For me percivers prefers to work outside systems ,and that's my case : I'm guded by some thirst of discovery



EDIT (14/04/2014) : 
Seems i'm more of an extravert. A lot more.   
It explains why do love to talk with you ,guys. =)"
544,esfp,"Judgemental is a terrible word to describe that last letter. Just because someone is a J doesn't make them that descriptive word ""judging"" it does however make them more apt to scheduling, organization, etc, while us P's are more fly by the seat of our pants and take everything in as it comes along."
545,esfp,"yuck ! XD
Eh ?  
Surprising !  
I don't like them : pay to win bad bad quality
Played WoW a month : was a zombie, had 3 hou a day to play only the week end ,played in my dreams to compensate.
Finished lvl 20 after playing 24h cumulated.
Was a pig killer
Reminds me Pop Cap games ^^
RP make you a good player !
I love people who write : I love books so people who writed it are at least as awesome as their books !
I love Desney movies too ! 
For the inconstancies and flaws
Always entertaining
Next Pixar studios ?"
546,esfp,"I find their lack of faith in life disturbing X)
Was your philosophy teacher I suppose ?
Reminds me Morpoeus's pills X)
Good luck : We use to bury them in mass of rationnal throughts ...  =D
That's not my case : I was living in a ""special"" family environment ,forcing me to be in touch with my feelings =)
That's why I tend to understand how feelers think but find it quite unconfortable.
More or less =)
Most of the time people are not very up to listen ,past a moment.
That's why I keep quite when in social situation : I'm affaid of boring people with my endless stream of thoughts. 
Edit(14/4/2014) : re read it ,I think it still quite accurate ,as an ENTP ! =)"
547,esfp,"I don't know about that. I like to schedule things, and know how things are going to be planned out. My husband on the other hand hates scheduling, even something as general as me telling him I want to go for a run tomorrow around noon or whatever. It ruins his plans of having no plans. However, he gets incredibly sensitive when someone doesn't share his political views, and judges them as a bad person, without knowing anything about them other than their political party.
Also, this post is like a month old. You must be really bored in class. "
548,esfp,"It's about social skill and intent more than MBTI
I say beware because I know a manipulative person who isn't ENFJ ,it's very destructive and anybody can't do anything to help this person      
I fear that your ENFJ can be in the same kind
Manipulation always implies bad will so please keep an eye on this too
I hope you the best anyway !"
549,esfp,"Hello there!
Brace yourselves, it's going to be a long post/rant.
I'm a 31yo INFJ, female, and I need advice about how to deal with my mother in law. I know, cliché, right? :)
I have been married 6 years now and I'm very happy with my husband. However, things aren't always easy when it comes to my relationship with my MIL. It doesn't help either that we live very close to my husband's family and really far away from mine (so far, and tickets are so expensive, that it's been 3 years since I've been with my family). So this kind of intensifies the problems for me because I can't go and have some ""my family"" time when my in-laws stress me out.
My MIL has never taken the test but I'm pretty sure she types as ESFP. But the worse thing is that I believe she also suffers from Histrionic Personality Disorder. Now I'm no Psychologist, but she has many of the symptoms, the only one obviously missing being the seductive behaviour. She does however fit this to a T (from Wikipedia):
The World Health Organization's ICD-10 lists histrionic personality disorder as:
A personality disorder characterized by:
-shallow and labile affectivity,
-self-dramatization,
-theatricality,
-exaggerated expression of emotions,
-suggestibility,
-egocentricity,
-self-indulgence,
-lack of consideration for others,
-easily hurt feelings, and
-continuous seeking for appreciation, excitement and attention.
Even if she doesn't really have HPD, that list above pretty much sums up her behaviour. I know a lot of the things she does are with good intentions. She cares about her family. My problem is that, even after more than 10 years knowing me, she doesn't really know me. She has picked up a few hints about the kind of thing I don't like along the way, and I'm grateful for that. 
But still she pursues me - I could even say sometimes I feel like she stalks me. For instance, like a good INFJ (or an introvert for that matter) I hate talking on the phone, and she knows that. But she will call me many times, even after my husband tells her to send me an e-mail or a message on Facebook (ah, Facebook, another one of our battlefields lol), and when afterwards we meet in a family gathering, she will put me under the spotlight and ask me really loudly and in front of everyone why didn't I answer when she called. And then I look like the evil daughter-in-law, because everyone just loves her (except for her two daughter-in-laws so I know I'm not crazy or a bitch). She will make a point of saying that she really only wants to help, to be my friend, what's the problem in calling me?
When she does something that annoys me, I try to hide my feelings so not to create an awkward situation but I don't always succeed. So what I do is I try to discreetly avoid her. That's when she senses I'm kinda mad at her and then she comes right up to my face and starts noticing everything that I'm wearing and saying ""what a nice blouse you're wearing"", ""what a beautiful necklace!"" (as if it was new, even though she's seen me wearing it it tens of time and even complimented it before), or she will show me something she bought and ask my opinion about it. And I can see in her face that she doesn't really want my opinion but to assess if I'm ok with her. I wish she would just apologize for whatever it is she did wrong, and leave me alone for a while instead of coming on so strong. Once I actually hid in the bathroom the escape the MIL probing eyes and when I was in there I heard her asking where I was. Oh, dear! LOL
There are many other things she does that annoy me, especially the way she is like a toddler when she doesn't get what she wants, and the fact that she inteprets every little thing people do or say as something else entirely. She also is a little paranoid and always thinks people are talking about her behind her back or judging her, even (and especially) her closest friends. I guess it comes from her low self-esteem. Honestly, I think she's a mess and could benefit greatly from therapy, but she's also religious and will have none of that. I wish my husband and I could move to a different location so we would see her less and maybe my relationship with her would improve.I also wish she was more mature and would not act like a kid.
My question for you ESFPs is what can I do to try to improve my relationship with her as it is. She sometimes tells me that she loves me but I can't say it back to her. I don't really think I love her. But what can I do to assure her that yes, she's a good person, that she doesn't have to try so hard, etc? She is really needy (see HPD symptoms) and I have the worst time dealing with needy people. But I also can't tell her some things like I would with a friend, because she's so sensitive. I think she longs for me and her other DIL to see her as our second mother, since our own mothers live very far, and she's hurt when we gently say we don't see her like that. She wants to be our friend, but our personalities clash too much. So she wants to help, she wants to be a mother figure, but it has to be her way or she'll be hurt/offended. I find it very hard to deal with this situation and I would love to hear what you have to say about it. I'm open to answer any question you might have.
I am not saying that I want her to completely change for my sake and behave the way I want. I just wish it wasn't always such a struggle. Maybe sometimes she could refrain from doing something that she knows I don't like, and next time I'll do something nice for her in gratitude. It's not like I don't know how to live with Es - both my husband and my dear sister are extroverts and I adore them, and we manage (have managed, in the case of my sister when we were growing up) to live together without killing each other LOL! So it's possible, unless INFJs and ESFPs are the two most incompatible types there are!
I am also posting this on the INFJ forum, it will be interesting to hear what each type has to say. :)"
550,esfp,"I would playfully insult her, be rude to her, but always give a smile after like you just farted in her pillow. It sounds like she's loud and obnoxious, like me, and that list you listed described me to t. Treat her as if you get annoyed by her and let her show it. This may blow up in your face but if you have known each other for 10 years with no improvement I say go for it."
551,esfp,"I'll try me best to answer this. I'm an ESFP and I've been in a long-term same-sex relationship (over six years) with an INFJ. We're both 31 as well, funnily enough!
First off, it sounds like some of the problems here stem not from her being an ESFP but from her being a bit immature. I know one or two other ESFPs and while some of them can be very needy/attention-seeking, others aren't (in my experience, this can be true for people of all MBTI types!).
The phone thing stood out to me, though, because my partner hates talking on the phone, I'm guessing for similar reasons to you. He's told me that when he's on the phone he finds it overwhelming because there will usually be other noises vying for his (or my) attention, and that he usually prefers email/messaging or face-to-face; the former because it allows him to answer things on his own terms and in his own time, or the latter because it makes it easier to place what's being said in cotext (through body language, tone of voice, etc.). With that, at least, I think your best bet is probably to take a deep breath and broach the subject with your MIL. Just tell her that while it might seem odd to her, you really dislike talking on the phone. Explain why and reassure her that it's not personal but something that you need from all people. Do whatever you can to calm yourself before this; having known a few INFJs in my time, I know that your type can be highly sensitive and if you're anything like my partner or one of my close friends, you may say things more abrasively than you mean to because this kind of confrontation feels particularly stressful for you. If your MIL is perceptive enough she'll know not to take it to heart, but it sounds like she's not and so some of the heavy lifting (emotionally speaking) is going to have to come from you. It might feel really exhausting to discuss this with her and express your needs in detail while keeping calm and not reacting to anything she shoots back at you, but it will hopefully be worth it in the long run!
The other issues with her singling you out at gatherings can probably be dealt with in a similar way - if you can explain your needs as not being about her but about being introverted, there's a better chance that she'll understand. Tell her that while you appreciate that she likes to involve everyone in conversation, for an introverted person such as yourself it's usually quite taxing to be pulled into group conversation. That doesn't mean you're not enjoying yourself, but as an introvert in group situations you're usually more comfortable listening to other people talk and inserting yourself into the conversation when you feel like you have something particularly meaningful to add. Her behaviour sounds like it might just be a clumsy attempt at putting you at ease - something ESFPs tend to like to do, but which can backfire if they're not perceptive enough to pick up on when someone would rather be left alone. I'm guilty of this on occasion myself.
I'm going off a bit of guesswork here based on my experience with INFJs and the strong/weak points of both INFJs and ESFPs, but hopefully that helps a little!"
552,esfp,"Thanks for the reply, Troy521!
If that list really describes you, I'm curious to know how would you feel if you were treated like you suggested me to do.
And also how do you feel about what I said. Do you think I'm being unreasonable? It would really help me understand the way she thinks and sees things."
553,esfp,I treat people like that without even thinking about it. I just think it's fun and harmless but others can easily get annoyed. When someone else treats me like that I kind of think of it as a game. I don't take offense to it. If you run away or hide I would stop but I know others who would take that as a challenge. I am by no means a psychologist I'm just explaining what I know as an ESFP.
554,esfp,"Thanks, it actually helps. I think she's the kind that sees it as a challenge. She has this formed image in her head about the way families are supposed to be, and one of the things is that she wants to be like a second mom to me."
555,esfp,"Does anyone else feel like they struggle with being sympathetic towards others?
I recently got out of a two-month relationship and I learned more about my personality and it is my belief that it is harder for me to relate or sympathize with others, and I don’t know if that’s something personal or if there are other ESFP’s that feel similarly?"
556,esfp,"For me, it's periodic. I sympathize, but I also look out for myself first.  That's partly learnt behavior. I had people take me for granted, and just ask for favors upon favors, applying to my sense of sympathy and my compassion. I find it difficult to differentiate between pure manipulation and desperation. But I learnt the hard way, that if you burn out, you can't even help yourself, let alone anyone else.
So, my sense of sympathy goes to those that try to help themselves. If I see you working on sorting out your issues, I'll be happy to offer help that I am able to offer. If I see you sitting on your ass waiting for rescue with a self-pity and victimhood mentality, get off my fucking lawn! Ain't nobody got time for that!
I am unable to consciously take advantage of people, because I do have sympathy. But at the same time, I am discerning who I invest my energy with."
557,esfp,"Dave is Davesuperpowers on Youtube, he runs Objective Personality which is pretty much Myers Briggs but he found a way to have an 80% accuracy when it comes to typing people because people tend to type themselves as something else. We're both part of his membership class and decided to talk about the concepts."
558,esfp,"Hey guys, it's been a long journey for me. Making it short I'm an ESFP who experienced a trauma right before entering my teens which caused me to retreat from the world and live in denial about a lot of things for 5 years. Ever since my trauma, nothing has felt the same again and after ""coming out of hiding"" last year I was overwhelmed at how different myself and the world was. 5 years of hiding can really do you in and I found myself living in the body of anxious adult and experiencing an incredibly confusing, deep, painful and emotionally draining personality crisis. Fortunately, I discovered Myer Briggs which helped me a lot and was able to surround myself with several of great people who took me in despite my anxiety, etc. Fortunately, my body has loosened up over this last year and things are getting much better but my heart still craves to become whole again...to reunite with the cheerful, uninhibited and fun-loving person who I grew up as except now as an adult. I love performing and entertaining the people around me but now I don't know how my performing would look like as a 20 year old...I don't know how  my younger self would have developed into an adult if it weren't for that trauma. I need to get my performing identity back..back when I as younger I had a feel for the world and I had a grasp over my ability to perform (what would work and what wouldn't). Right now, I don't have that performing identity . I'm afraid to perform and make mistakes since I'm older now, I'm afraid of making a fool out of myself/being misunderstood, I'm afraid of forcing things and not seeming natural. I look back at my younger self a lot and remember how he performed but I can't bring that person out anymore (completely) because I'm an adult now so yeah my performing would be different. Guys, I miss feeling happy, calm and letting my spontaneity naturally run loose. An uncle of mine who I run to for help tells me that since I'm an adult now..things are going to be different and that I can perform now by being a good conversationalist and letting witty comments fly when the occasion pops up but I know that isn't the whole story. I still don't feel ""free"" and I find that I'm still conservative socially. My younger self was more over the top, outrageous, energetic and I want to bring that side of me out again. So my question guys is..how do you perform and liven things up as an ESFP? Thanks guys!"
559,esfp,"You're uncle's right about socializing, but before it really helps you perform, it sounds like you have some other things to work out. I went through something similar, and I recently became an outgoing, ""performer"" type. You need self-confidence to really get you there, and children are teeming with that stuff. You'll be a grown up version of that energetic person in no time. "
560,esfp,"Why are ""Enegram"" & ""Big 5"" test not as popular as MBTI?
I think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the ""Enegram"" or ""Big 5"" test.
What do you think?"
561,esfp,"Hello there ESFPs, I got a little survey for everyone to fill out. I'm curious to see which types most likely mistype as what other types, and so far I've only gotten answer from the ESFPs. If you would all be so nice to fill it out that would be awesome, I'll post the ""results"" on /r/mbti as soon as I feel like I've gotten enough answers if anyone is curious. Enjoy."
562,esfp,Because for me I would prefer travelling alone and meet new people rather than to travel with friends and probably get your freedom stripped off for the whole trip. Do you guys feel this way too? Or am I just different here?
563,esfp,"I actually feel the same awkwardness when alone on a trip for a long time. That’s why I would drop by to a random club to meet new people, if that’s not available, then probably anywhere that has crowds. But usually I wouldn’t be alone for that long to feel that way tho. I’ll just find something to do anyway when I’m bored haha."
564,esfp,"I'm curious about that, too! My boyfriend is an INTP so I sometimes check out his subreddit and there are always a lot of people there discussing new topics and writing looong posts etc... While over here, it's amazing if you find more than like three answers on a post :o"
565,esfp,"Yep, don't worry dude. The internet age was basically invented in order to grant introverts worldwide a shield against real life contact, and then Zuckerberg comes along, revolutionizes social media, and turns the internet into a means to augment real life interactions rather than substituting them. THANKS ALOT MARK. "
566,esfp,"ISTJ Male here. My ESFP girlfriend loves to be very socail and likes to be in-tune with social media and everything that is happening in the social world, rather than discuss something like this haha. This is what I like to do."
567,esfp,"Yep. Also typology itself is of more interest to IN types and it was developed primarily by IN types. Some of the key figures:


Gustav Jung: INFJ or INTP (occasionally people claim ISTP)


Isabel Myers: INFP


Katherine Briggs-Myers: INFJ


David Keirsey: INTP


And while Dario Nardi (neuroscientist who's done type experiments using EEG scanning) isn't exactly a key figure, he's an INTJ.
ES types are more likely to see typology and personality psychology in general as a waste of time."
568,esfp,"I fucking hate confrontation so much. I wish I could get better at communication when uncomfortable events happen. I would rather keep the peace and hold back rather than having it blow up in my face. I don't know, I feel like it makes me kinda fake?! I'll just ignore what's bothering me for the sake of not having to bother with drama. 
How do I work on this?! "
569,esfp,"A combination of practice and mindfulness, generally. It helps to practice on smaller things, like if your friend group is bickering over something relatively inconsequential. And on the other hand it can be helpful to just generally be mindful of when you're avoiding something that needs to be dealt with, and either actually deal with it, or at least make yourself aware of your own behavior so you can better address it next time. "
570,esfp,"Life is too short to hold back. Yesterday, a librarian chided me for not standing in the right spot in line, even though nobody was behind me. I told him that I'll be using the automated checkout from now on because those robots provide better customer service than he does. 
Now, I could have responded with even more sting if I put more thought into it. But it felt really good just to be able to retaliate and defend myself. I'd rather have it ""blow up in my face"" than look like a victim in front of others. Don't fear confrontation; expect it whereever you go and embrace it. I'm also an ESFP, by the way."
571,esfp,"I let most things slide unless it was something really big and absolutely not acceptable. In which case i'll straight up ask ""what the fuck was that about?"" If it was a work situation, i'd be like ""let's discuss our ways of working"""
572,esfp,"I don't mind trying to get a rise out of people, but it definitely freaks me out if I accidentally push it to far into a unintended confrontation.  Its weird because I tend to feel offended they got mad and me and just make it worse intentionally, but then feel really bad about having upset/angered someone.  I also tend to feel whatever the other party feels (or I guess I feel like they feel which is probably not always right) but yea confrontation sucks because it's just a whirlwind of quick emotions that you aren't sure what to make of as soon as it's over.  I really appreciate the personality types the re cognize the need to apologize even when both parties may be in the wrong, because if you walk away angry I'll probably be quietly angry with you about that argument for a while unless the confrontation is recognized as just that a momentary thing and that there was no harm no foul, then things are very easily forgiven."
573,esfp,if i hate someone or something - just give me a reason and i will explode into your face or well will confront you right away. Tho i don't like to be the one bringing things up but sometimes you have to because there's no one else to help you out 
574,esfp,"Here are my experiences with ESFP and me as Fi dom:
The ESFP I know is far more likely to have their attention pointed outwards in the world. Their focus is on what's happening, what's around them, what their friends are up to, finding fun things to look at and do. If they go quiet and I ask what they're thinking, often they say they're not thinking about anything at all, kind of like they're naturally meditating.
This is from an ISFP profile: ""they take this time for introspection, assessing their principles"". I think this is one area where Fi dom shows itself - more conscious attention is pointed inwards, such as reflecting on values and consciously thinking about them. The mind's eye of an introvert spends more time inwards.
It's not that the ESFP I know is never reflective because they are, it's just not as much of a part of daily life. They can have lots of busy days with not much time to think and still be really happy. Once they said a good amount of time alone for them to recharge is 1 afternoon a month and I found that amazing! They can be happy spending all day with lots of people and all evening with more people. They have so much social energy. Another thing is that they get really lively and energized in groups of people, the bigger the group the more lively.
But I really see the Se-dom the most in how much of their focus is outwards most of the time, and how happy it makes them to be that way."
575,esfp,"Hey motherfuckers, I'm an ENFP that tested EXFP for a while and I'm pissed that you guys aren't being the cool people you are and talking about how cool you are. Tell the world about yourself, we want to know! Or about why you're happy today! Or why you're not! And then have people make you happy because that's how people work! Exclamation points!!!!!
Srs tho let's hear it"
576,esfp,"3 upvotes and no one being attention whores?!? What? Have we lost our edges or something??? I'd love to stay and chat, but I'm too busy being a cool guy. I'm smooth as I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and I've got enough muscles to impress some of you. That's right! I'm average on the outside and extraordinarily decent on the inside. I like long walks on the beach and other people knitting. Hello, elderly ladies and craft lovers. Need a hand with that missed stitch? I have to go now and play sports."
577,esfp,"Do you guys ever just need to take a break from people, haha?
I'm a VERY extroverted ESFP but even I find I need to take a day or two away from people.
It's not even like I'm stressed or anything, it's like the constant demand and expectation DRAINS me.
Do you guys ever get like this? If so, what usually causes it? 
♡"
578,esfp,"Yep. We're still human. Everyone needs some alone time to recharge. I think extroversion is more about what entertains us. And making people laugh or talking to people stimulates us more that when we are alone. So that constant stimulation would drain anyone. Do you feel bad that you need alone time away from people? I know, I do. Friends text me constantly to hang out and I find that draining too. "
579,esfp,"I completely understand. I am a more reserved ESFP (or in other words, people I am not super close to overwhelm me a lot).
In terms of what you're saying, I honestly think the cause is the fact that we are humans. We only have so much energy we can exert before needing to recharge. "
580,esfp,"100% agree!
Extroversion for me is about a need for external stimulation - not necessarily social - and where I direct my energy.
I actually hate when you come across other people who are into mbti and you tell them you're ESFP and said people just assume that you're this completely social person who just cares about having fun and partying, haha."
581,esfp,"I agree with you so much on this. My extroversion is all external stimulation, and I hate when people assume that only refers to social stimulation. People get overwhelming sometimes. 
I find the best way to recharge is to go outside and go for a walk. I love drinking in the external world and just experiencing life. I do not need people with me, but it still feels like external stimulation. 
I also hate the ESFP stereotypes. Most people don't actually understand ESFPs at all. Fun fact: I'm in college and I have never been to a college party. I don't really want to all that much. We are more than our stupid stereotype. Oh, and we have a brain too."
582,esfp,"Hey, thanks for the love! I was in a brief relationship with an INTJ. Sadly I had to end it due to major incompatibility issues, but don't let this discourage you because I am only 1 person (you need a larger sample size). 
He was very logical; preferred talking about the abstract and philosophical as opposed to concrete matters. We clashed when he played devil's advocate and refused to empathize with me at all. One day I decided that the benefits of the relationship did not outweigh the incessant fighting, so that's why I broke up with him. I'm surprised he didn't leave me first, considering how rational he is. "
583,esfp,"Love INTJs but they are my kryptonite... Your Ni draws me in and the need to break down your walls keeps me coming back like a strung-out addict and just about as healthy.
What is it about ESFPs that you like?"
584,esfp,"Ended one about a year ago. The chemistry is ridiculous. I think about him once in a while. it was more of a timing thing and beliefs. He was heavy into evolution and I wasn't. it had gotten down to considering marriage. lol I wouldn't budge on my beliefs. but I wish the best for him, couldn't do the friendship thing after haha just ended up back together like a cycle.  that aside it was great and I loved all the other differences. 
Thank you for the emoji love! and letting us cuddle you when you really don't want too at first. "
585,esfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbti] Hey all you Beautifully Awesome Female ESFPs!!! I love ESFP soooo much!!! What are your feelings on Male INTJs and especially your experiences in relationships with them? I'm guessing they were objectively magnificent, amirite?! 😉👉 😍

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
586,esfp,"Describes how ESFPs are to me perfectly :)
ESFPs...what do I like? hmmm...they are full of life and adventure and charm, and are simply bubbly little sweethearts, are they not?  ""Just when I thought I was out...they pull me back in!"""
587,esfp,"That sucks you couldn't agree to disagree on the evolution thing, but I'm guessing the matter was much more complex than that.  
What drives me nuts about some ESFPs I've met, is when their beliefs were challenged, like when I wanted to merely know why they believed something so staunchly, they didn't have a personal argument apart from ""I was raised that way"", or ""that's what I've always believed"".  To me that's interpreted as, ""I was indoctrinated to believe that, and I'm quite happy to keep it that way.""  Sort of a willful ""ignorance is bliss"" approach.  To each their own I suppose, but I prefer the ugly truth to ignorance almost any day of the week.
Yeah, I could never do the whole friendship after love thing either, though I never stop caring about those I've loved.  
Also, I don't know what you're talking about because physical touch is my #2 love language, and I very much value the intimacy and chemical release of cuddling :)"
588,esfp,"Ah, I wish I knew how to pull an INTJ back in... you guys are slippery suckers, slipping through my fingers at the last minute.
But don't mind me... just a heart-bruised ESFP here succumbing to melodrama.
What prompted you to post such an effusive love letter to ESFPs in the first place?  Got an ESFP on your mind? ;)"
589,esfp,"Yeah that was one of the improvements I made for myself after my relationship with the INTJ. He pushed me to use utilitarianism and objectivity to support my arguments, which I am grateful for. Fuck, this sub is making me want to start another relationship with a different INTJ hahah. I want it to work so badly :'("
590,esfp,"THANK. YOU.  That's exactly what I was going for. At least I made some effort to tailor the post to the audience, right? 
I xposted to r/MBTI and got shat on all over for the style of the post, but in this case, the only opinion that really matters to me anyway is the ESFP's.
They don't allow flairs here, but I even flaired the xpost with ""For Fun"" :)  I figured that would make it irresistable to ESFPs."
591,esfp,"I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome."
592,esfp,"For those who play video games, what types of games are you drawn to? Is there a specific genre you gravitate towards? Are there specific attributes in a game that you like? Story? Humor? Action elements? 
What are your favorite games? Is there anything you like about those games in particular?
And, if you feel like it, I would love to know why you like to play video games (or why you don't play video games). "
593,esfp,"Hi! I play video games sporadically, but regularly. I'm useless in fast paced games & first person shooters, but I love games like Sims, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley. 
I also love point and click games a lot, like The Walking Dead, Life is Strange, Heavy Rain and The Wolf Among Us. I like games where I build toward something or have a goal in mind, and games with a social component and a good story have a fuzzy place in my heart. :) "
594,esfp,"I am a personal fan of jrps and story games. As mentioned previously, Telltale games are a big hit for me alongside Deponia. I'm also a big League of Legends, Final Fantasy 14, and Persona 5 definitely captured my heart thiis year. I'm not a huge fan of shooters though since I'm not the best at them. Ff9 is my all time favorite and on mobile im in love with sao memory defrag."
595,esfp,"20/f: Games I play the most are overwatch, crusader kings 2, stardew valley, medieval 2: total war, banished, fallout 4, the sims, skyrim... and others that I play less often but I still enjoy, like game dev tycoon, starbound, you must build a boat, civ 3 or civ 4.
Really, there is no connection between any of them except that I really enjoy the gameplay + rewards system for each. They interest me first with their raw funness, then hook me with objectives/achievements. When executed well, that can exist in FPS, RTS, RPG, TBS, etc. like the games listed above. Story is pretty unimportant to me."
596,esfp,"Firstly, Shovel Knight, because it's a great game, riddled with puns and has all the greatest things I love about Metroidvania/side-scrolling games wrapped into one singular game. (legit, I've replayed SK at least 5-7 times, a few more in New Game Plus, not to mention all of its DLC)
I have a knack for JRPGs (ex: classic Final Fantasies (FFV and FFVI are my personal RPG faves) I've been playing Final Fantasy Brave Exvius for a solid year and a half now. 
I'm not a huge fan of FPS's, but Overwatch and Borderlands 2 have been a lot of fun/huge time suck the past year or two for me."
597,esfp,"I play mainly fps, or 3rd person shooters. Love the fast action. I struggle to play slower games unless with my friends and generally I try and get my friends involved whatever game I am playing and a game will often just die for me if none on my friends want to play it with me. Generally don't play single player games anymore, though I used to when I was younger. Play a lot of board games too and card games with friends.  "
598,esfp,"Hello fellow ESFP fam. I find that people tend to avoid me because they think I'm judging them, when really I'm just being shy. I don't like this, and want to change it. Has this happened to anyone else? If so, did you do anything to change it? If so what was it and how well did it work? (If it helps for context, I'm a 19 year old male at college)"
599,esfp,Did someone tell you that's why they were avoiding you? I know that when I'm feeling shy I can get kind of dark and sarcastic and I think that pushes people away and could make them avoid me. I've never been told I'm judgmental though...
600,esfp,How do you know that's why they avoid you? I'm shy. I think you're shy because you're self-conscious and this is the reason you come up with. The solution would seem to be just talking more. If people think you're judging them then maybe reveal something about yourself that they might judge you for and see how they react to level the playing field. I doubt that's the case though. If you're shy people might just find it awkward to make conversation with you.
601,esfp,"Hi everyone. Just wanted your opinion on something: would you guys think it is possible to be ESFP and have social anxiety. When I'm with the right people (and they are very few) I always feel so energized and I'm so outgoing and all, but whenever I'm other social situations, I have this sudden anxiety kicking in. I want others to invite me and I want to go to social events, but at the same time I dread those situations. This leaves me very torn apart on what I want to do and who I am. Sorry for this rant, but needed somewhere to vent."
602,esfp,"Going through the same thing and it sucks but a bit of mild anxiety medication does the trick for me, if you don't take any I'd suggest it, it won't help tremendously but it'll help enough where my hearts not pounding every time I have to be in public. "
603,esfp,"That's not abnormal, but I think ESFPs might be less likely to seek out help for stuff of that nature without a bit of coaxing. Being independently-minded can be both good and bad. :(
If the anxiety isn't manageable, I would recommend talking to a professional about your options regarding counseling, medication, lifestyle changes, etc. I know how hard it is to make steps like that, but if it's for your own mental health, it's always worth it!"
604,esfp,"As an ESFP personally I understand when people need alone time. Grew up with an INFP older brother. 
To the more rambunctious ESFP's, they have introverted feeling, just tell them you need some time to process your thoughts and emotions. "
605,esfp,"Hi everybody, I'm a male INFJ trying to help a really unhealthy female ESFP to grow as a person. I'm 25, she's probably in her thirties. I'm not interested in her in any kind of way except for wanting to help reach a better quality of life. I know I'm not a therapist, I know I can't work miracles. I know that I simply might fail. But at the moment, I don't care. I want to help her. And I already did, by giving her a couple of books of self help to read, which she enjoyed and it improved her quality of life.
She has plenty of problems.
* Too forceful.


Too insistent.


Speaks with the flow, really fast.


Doesn't ever stop and listen to what others are saying.


Has little to no self control.


She's extremely gullible. Like, really gullible.


Remembers things badly and never doubts her memory, to the extent or putting up conflicts until disproven.


Doesn't trust other people's judgment. Thinks always negatively of other people's motives.


Unable to put herself on other's shoes to the least extent.


Unable to see the other's perspective unless shown.


Criticizing continuosly while being unable to think out of the box.


Acts childishly more in general.


And much more, making her come across as stupid to other people.


People are scared and annoyed of her. She has little to no friend, except for virtual friends like me and a couple of others (because we're really, really patient with her). While she does come across as stupid, I don't want to believe she is beyond salvation or that she's inherently stupid and she can't change that. I think she can be just as other people. She really suffers from this state. She feels unlikable and useless.
I've felt this way before, even if for different reasons, but I can really relate. I've been a reject of society before, I almost no friends, and had to grow. My only friend helped me, I've made mistakes, but eventually survived this and became much more balanced. She's far from balance, but I really want her to achieve something. All I know is that if I don't help her, she's doomed to a life of loneliness (which expecially for an extrovert seems like hell) and being completely dependant on her parents. She's been on therapy, I don't know if she already is, but I guess that didn't work too well.
At the moment I'm working on making her solve a problem of her personality gradually, by making her mindful of her mistakes. I'm making her write a couple of problems, and try to improve a single aspect of her personality at a time (like self control) for at least a week. Ex: We're starting with self control, for now.
Anyway, this is the first ESFP I know, and I don't know any other at the moment. Do any of you have some suggestions to allow her to improve? Any story with similar problems? Things I should avoid to tell her to hurt her feelings? Obvious pitfalls I might fall into by not knowing how to handle Fi users?
Thank you very much in advance."
606,esfp,"She trusts me, I offered her help, and she accepted willingly.
She liked the book I gave her, and told me it has been useful. It was a book aimed to help people stop being overwhelmed by fear and anxiety."
607,esfp,"Thank you, that was really helpful. About the gullible part, she's simply the kind of person who reads a random article on the internet and believes it's true because ""mainstream media are liars and they have an agenda"". Basically, she's a bit of a conspiracy theorist. I've gone through that phase, starting to believe all kinds of crazy sheet because ""mainstream media doesn't tell you the truth"". The problem is whether what you say is supported by evidence or credible or is simply...bullshit.
About memory, I think she genuinely has bad memory. It's also about trivial things, like ""what Ability does the Knowledge skill in D&D belong?"" She was pretty convinced it was Wisdom, but it's Intelligence. And that goes on with a lot of other trivial things which she's pretty convinced. And she fights because it fits her memory even if it's not true. Or she confuses things she told someone else with things I she told me. Or things like that.
EDIT: Yes, she's pretty exhausting. But I can manage her most of the times."

609,esfp,"The trick to an esfp is, everything we do is stimulating. 
Stimulation comes from all five senses and an esfp tends to ride those sense all day. Find an esfp, and ask them what they like to do for fun.

614,esfp,"Hey there ESFP's!
I have a question for you! I'm a male INFP and i had a thing with a female ESFP.
She was in a relationship that's why called it a ""thing"", but it was more than just a fling or her cheating, we not only had sex but we also made other stuff together, we talked a lot and went out. As an introvert being with her was a blessing because i became really confident of myself. 
But that's really it, i asked her many times to leave her actual partner to stay with me, until i bursted and said i was done. That happened 2 times and for a reason or another we started dating again, and now 7 month ago a third time for real. We haven't seen each other since then.
Now, as an INFP of course I tendo to overanalyze things and i still am thinking about her.
The question is: is she thinking about me or is she really done? 
At the start of january i went to my old workplace (where she works) to wish all of my ex-colleagues a happy new year, unfortunately she was also there. Of course i gave her my best wishes like i did with everyone else. 40 min later she wrote me and wanted to chat. WHY? I mean i'm giving my everything to forget her she writing me gives me hope (and i don't think that is a good thing). February was my birthday, she wrote me happy birthday and i thanked her. She wrote again trying to start a conversation. WHYYYY?
Can you ESPF guys and gals tell me what the hell is going on in her mind? Does she want to be friends or is she just trying to keep me hooked in the case that she Leaves her bf or something else? what is her plan? is there any plan or is she just trying to be nice ? 
Sorry for the long post! 
have a nice one !"
615,esfp,"I think this is a post for /r/relationship advice and even then it sounds like right off the bat this relationship was doomed to begin with. 
In my opinion, it wasn't more than a fling or cheating; it was cheating. She cheated on her partner with you and you're upset that she isn't faithful to you; moreover you demanded of her that she do as you want - to leave her partner for you - without considering that she may not want to or she might've already.
Judging from the rest of your story it sounds like she wants to keep entertaining the notion of you but the thought only crosses her mind when you come around again. For the most part it seems she's had her fun already and she's probably not interested in more.
Have you given thought to the idea that if she was unfaithful to him in a relationship, she might also be unfaithful to you in a relationship? Don't let yourself be strung up by your emotions. Assess the situation logically and determine the next course of action. She doesn't appear to be dedicated to anything more than a passing glance whenever you come her way and so it seems to me you've simply got to forget about it."
616,esfp,"She sees you as a hook-up. Don't go looking for emotions where there are none. I know it's next to impossible for an INFP to do that which is why ESFP and INFP make a shitty pair. Choices are accept your hook-up status - good luck with that being an INFP - or leave her and move on. You're just messing yourself up obsessing over her.
Female esfp btw."
617,esfp,"When you're out of her presence for more than a few days, she's stopped thinking about you. She's probably having fun with her old boyfriend again, or maybe she's banging new dudes.
Then when she is reminded of you, she thinks, ""Hey, that was fun. Let's see how that could go again."" Or maybe even, ""I really, really like him.""
The point is, at least for me, I fall hard, but I recover quickly. I've not been single for more than a few weeks since eighth grade, almost twenty years ago. Many of my relationships have been long, several years, so flighty isn't exactly the right word. I am just not a dweller.
For most of my life, I've felt as though i always get what I want. To a degree, that's true. But it's also true that once something is an inconvenient option, I no longer want it and it's not much of a loss. The fact is, once you're out of sight, you're inconvenient, uninteresting, and probably not much a loss."
618,esfp,"ESFP female here. Unfortunately I recognize this girl's behaviour in myself from a couple of years ago, I'd like to think I'm not like that anymore but sometimes 'the old me' comes back and surprises me. When I was a bit younger I enjoyed the idea of keeping many doors open or whatever you'd like to call it, sometimes I wasn't so considerate about other peoples feelings and I just wanted to have fun, flirt and see how far I could take it. I don't really know why I did it, it somehow felt like a game, I liked having these casual flings (and many of them at once!) and just screw around for fun. In the end the fact that people would get feelings for me and end up getting hurt was probably what made me try to change myself later on. But in your case, I would say this girl just wants to fool around for fun and isn't really planning on leaving her partner anytime soon. If you however stop answering her attempts at conversation I'm 99% sure she'll start saying she misses you and the time you spent together etc... It's a tricky situation!"
619,esfp,"Another male INFP here. The mid-age female ESFP at my work is just incredible. I was on a walk today thinking about how she operates, why there is something about here that is just outrageous yet relatable to me, and I worked into Se (she's so damn smooth, too smooth not to be an extroverted senoer), Fi, Te, and Ni. Looked online, I was right. Watching her engage into Te/Ni with customers is great, because you don't expect it. She goes from total outgoing partier to confident thinker (Te is the logic and external order, Ni is confidence). Just have to say, the older ESFPs are probably the coolest people on earth. "
620,esfp,"I really disagree about INFP's not being able to be detached. I went through a phase like the one the described ESFP went through, getting involved with more than one guy. It's just the fact that THIS INFP is looking for something serious and the ESFP is not. It could just as well have been the other way around.
This is what I'd like to say to the OP: find someone who is just as serious about you as you are about them. Doesn't matter what type, could easily have been an ESFP too. Just don't waste your time on THIS ESFP."

626,esfp,"Dominant Se (ESXP): Experiences are the stuff of life. I want to go snowboarding! Skydiving! Drive a racecar! Give me an adrenaline rush, and I’m fabulous. Okay, what’s up? I saw your eye twitch. That means you’re upset, but about what? Oh, I can leap in there and do this, no problem! See? It’s easy! You need a part time lion tamer? I’m sure I can learn it in no time. Okay, so here are the sixteen awesome things we can do in this theme park. Which one first? Look, you do that, I can hold this, and keep track of the kids, and check my Blackberry, and call Gary back all at the same time. You know, someone could make a lot of money if they—oh, what the heck, I’ll just do it. While you were standing there gaping, I saved the kid from the bus. I want to try that out; I think my body can take it, and it’ll be fun to find out. I’m going to say this, and see what people do…
Auxiliary Fi (EXFP): I am happiest when staying true to what I believe and what I want for my life. I know what I want, what beliefs and ideals motivate me, and how I feel about something. This is good, and that is bad. I know you’re only pretending, because I can see right through you. How does this new belief measure up against my life, my goals, and my core values? I believe no one should enforce morality; it should be a conscious choice we make. I care very much about you. I am loyal to you. I have great enthusiasm and many feelings toward you, but I show it through actions rather than words. You don’t have to say anything for me to be able to connect to and understand your meaning. I am okay with silent affection.
Tertiary Te (EXFP): Look, I organized all my movies by alphabetical order or time period! My socks are sorted by colors or fabrics. I enjoy having things organized, but have to focus to set up the system. I know this isn’t working right, and I want to fix it. I suspect this project will take me another couple of hours, but I’m going to give myself extra time just in case. Look, either you can prove aliens exist or you can’t, and if you can’t, they probably don’t exist. Let’s talk about this idea to see if it’s even possible, on a factual level. This is why I made my decision. I want to have a plan and follow through with it, but sometimes I forget what time it is or what the steps in the plan were. I probably shouldn’t improvise answers as much.
Inferior Ni (ESXP): Though I care more about what’s happening in my life right now, I want to have a good future. I haven’t forgotten my dreams, and I’ll figure out how to make them a reality one of these days. I like thinking about my future life and, although it’s hard, I can learn to put aside immediate experiences if I know the long-term goal is worth the wait! I feel optimistic about the future, and sometimes out of the blue, know how to do something that I have never tried doing before. I’m not sure how, but I knew that person would do that.

627,esfp,"I'm an INTP male. I recently got out of a relationship in which I let myself fall into with an ESFP woman. For various reasons, after 2 years of unsteady interaction, it broke apart.
I loved her. I still love her, even though she's no longer a part of my life, and the fact that things went ""bad"" between us. She lied a lot, and was sneaky, and my perceptive nature never really let her get by with the lies. It's a long story, and any rational person would call me insane for still caring/loving her.
To make a short story of it, she wore me out and made me fight ""too hard"" to feel secure in the relationship.
My question is, are there any ESFP women who have either married an INTP, or had a long, more-or-less happy relationship with one? How did it work out?
Those who have had failed relationships with INTP males are encouraged to give their stories, too.
I don't know how to sum up my problems in one question. Any detailed or abstract summaries would help me understand, I think.
I'm moving on, but it's hard without understanding what went wrong. Or, rather, WHY it went wrong."
628,esfp,"I'm an ESFP female who's currently in a serious relationship with an INTP male. Even though our relationship is still going strong and not anywhere near ended, I can't deny that there are some real big differences between us that sometimes shine through and make things rather complicated. I don't consider myself an ""overly attached girlfriend"", but I DO need a certain (sometimes big...) amount of attention and support for my ideas and some lovey-dovey type of compliments once in a while, and if I don't get those things I can get extremely irritated and sometimes start fights without reason just to get some reaction out of this guy.
I know this sounds utterly ridiculous and even mean, but I just can't help that I get so mad when things don't go my way that I wanna make him mad too. We've talked about it a lot and are always trying to find ways around it and it's working pretty good so far even though it gets exhausting sometimes. You mentioned that your exgirlfriend wore you out and I sometimes get the feeling that I'm wearing this INTP guy out aswell, with all my emotions flowing this and that way and my inability to handle them sometimes, making me act all crazy in some situations.
Sorry if this became a bit confusing and not relevant to your story at all, but I just wanted to give some thoughts on how our ESFP + INTP relationship is going. I hope your moving-on-process goes well! Take care!"
629,esfp,"I dunno if this will help but I do have a very good INTP friend, we have known each other since we can remember. So it is possible. It sounds like this woman was an immature version of her type, in which case it would be very hard to get along with any type who is immature.
I do know that INTPs are very conflict avoidant, and even though ESFPs are allegedly too, we tend to cause more drama than we avoid. Could be this is why it went wrong. Maybe look for an older ESFP who has matured some."
630,esfp,"My experience is slightly different from yours, but perhaps you can still relate. I am an INTP female who was ""friends"" with an ESFP female. She said all these wonderful things to me about how much she valued me and wanted to hang out. She told me she loved me. She never followed through on all her promises. Things became toxic. She ended the friendship by stating that she had never cared about me in the first place. She basically just led me on because she craved attention. So, from my experience, this pairing does not work AT ALL. I expect people to be honest and honor their word. Lying and hurting someone else in the pursuit of meeting your own emotional needs is something that I abhor. It is a terrible thing to do to another human being and an unhealthy way to live.  "
631,esfp,"I don't have any experience dating INTPs, but I want to reassure you that ESFP women aren't all sneaky and lousy at secure relationships. I have read a number of times that we aren't supposed to be great at chill, committed relationships, but I'm not convinced that's true. I agree with others that it seems like she may have some growing up to do, by what you've said."
632,esfp,"Sorry about your loss. I'm an unmarried male INTJ, but maybe my perspective and experiences can help answer some of your questions. 
First, it's possible for any type to have either a good or bad relationship with any other type. Individual differences really make or break it here. That said, MB type can be a useful predictor of relationship compatibility. In my experience, N types, especially NTs, don't mesh well with S types in relationships. There can be a very strong attraction and good sex between the two types, but the connection rarely lasts due to vastly different ways of understanding the world and behavioral prioritization. 
Your experiences are not unique. I've dated xSFx types before with similar results - intense ups and downs, some good, lots of bad. Give yourself some time to get over this loss, which (to be blunt) probably isn't much of a loss anyway. In the future, it might help to remember that stable and fun relationships are where it's at, so if you're dating someone and the relationship is overly stressful and problematic without remedy, you owe it to yourself to end that relationship. You know why your recently-terminated relationship was problematic, now is the time to ask yourself why you put up with the pain and commit to not making that mistake again. "
633,esfp,"Hey dead thread. I'm an INTP male. Just found out my girlfriend is an ESFP.
Our relationship is definitely riddled with arguments, but still going (despite her trying to break up with my numerous times, usually over dumb shit). Thankfully she laughed at that.
It's not easy I guess. She's very attention seeking (she objected loudly), but never wants to give attention to me when I seek it (because her phone needs it more I guess).
It's not an easy pairing but sorry to say it worked for us. You just have to be hard headed (and not to stick your dick in crazy (whoops))."
634,esfp,"The only thing I learned from it is steer WIDE CLEAR away from women who really like the Twilight movies/books... and trance.
Oh... and to trust my instincts. For some reason I ignored them as paranoia early on. Somewhere inside me I knew before I knew it was wrong."
635,esfp,"Oh too bad you deleted your post, I thought it was really interesting (and sad of course :c) to read about what happened in your relationship since i've never really read about any intp + esfp couples before, but I understand if you wanna keep it to yourself too.
Well, it's only been 3 months (though we knew quite a lot about each other before that) so it's not really a long-term relationship yet but I certainly hope it will be!"
636,esfp,"hey new redditor here so sorry if i sound rly out of place bhahaa
anyways i was wondering if its normal to have a dramatic personality shift ?? i took the test about 4 years ago and i was an INFP but ive been taking and retaking it for the past year and im defos an ESFP now. 
did this happen to any other ESFP ppl ? bc sometimes i question whether i am really myself or whether im happy or if im not the same person anymore. ive only really started looking at this stuff recently and the impression i'm getting is that people view ESFP as shallow and fake which is kind of upsetting bc i worry about whether i've lost my depth or not... 
i've probably changed bc i was really unhappy socially (i had 0 social skills) and just started putting myself more out there. does this also mean that i was originally an ESFP to begin with? how do these things work?
educate me ! :) "
637,esfp,"The short answer is no. First off I’d like to remind you that the test can be VERY inaccurate. 
What I find funny is INFP’s and ESFP’s are two very different people. 
There are a couple reasons for the different results... 

You are an ESFP but maybe you were lacking social skills because you weren’t confident or had low self esteem so you weren’t as social as you were now and hence got a different answer

2 You are actually an INFP and are just better at socialising now and hence got mistyped

You are none of the above and you’ve been mistyped twice 

I’d recommended posting something on  r/MBTITypeMe to a second opinion on your type :) "
638,esfp,"For what it’s worth, when I first found out about mbti I typed myself as an INFP. Right now I’m more or less sure that I am an ESFP, it’s just that back then I was an unhealthy ESFP with a poor understanding of MBTI. I did go through a pretty major shift in the perception I have of myself between then and now."
639,esfp,"Probably you mistyped in the beginning. Don't worry about questioning whether you are really yourself/happy/same person or not - I can't speak for others but sometimes these thoughts do come to me.
That's what people view - it's just a stereotype. Other people can think that ESFPs are shallow/fake/party animals etc but ultimately they aren't ESFPs themselves, who are they to know what we are like internally anyway.
Anyway if you are interested in ESFP and all, you can go read on cognitive functions! "
640,esfp,"oh wow !!! we sound weirdly similar bhahahaah
did u get more confident/more self esteem? and do u like urself better now or back then ? like do u worry youve changed too much or smth? cause idk im so scared bhahha"
641,esfp,"I dont see it as me changing, more as me having changed perspectives. Instead of seeing it from that unhealthy angle I had before, I shifted to that other angle that has me a lot more comfortable with myself. I did get more confident, with more self esteem. But I’m the same person as I was before. If the changes you’ve seen have been positive you shouldnt be scared.
And ESFPs are not more shallow than other types. They just somehow fit a particular definition of shallow that a lot of people interested in mbti on the internet seem to have. Shallow to me means not having substance to back up the way you act and think. I like physical appearance and clothes, I like wild partying and dancing, I like watching sports and doing sports, but I’ve given a lot of thought to it all. Some people see behaviour like mine and think « that person is shallow », just because it fits an arbitrary idea of shallowness they havent given much thought to. That to me is shallow."
642,esfp,"Hey fellow ESFPs!!
Just wanted some insight on how ur crushes work? I know its a very vague statement but I honestly don't know how to explain it. Do you have tons of little crushes, or fall really hard, or not like anyone? Or do you always like someone?
What do u do with ur crush? Do u chase them or prefer them to chase u?? How do u court them???
I feel a bit alone when it comes to crushes bc I feel like no one understands my thought process. Was wondering what goes thru ur heads when u have a crush."
643,esfp,"Some Characteristics of the ESFP Child-Some Behaviors to Look For

As mentioned about…they are laughing, cuddly, moving a lot, alert, really loving babies
The see to enjoy just being close to
They are by nature friendly, outgoing and social
Easily adaptable
Love the outdoors and being with friends
These are young extraverts…they can get very excited…normally that will be having fun with others
They can get carried away in their excitement
Impulsive young ones
They like to touch a lot of things
The ESFP child…at any age…typically wants things right now
They normally enjoy school
Many ESFP children are drawn to art
Very generous children
They are at times mis-diagnosed with “ADD”. They go form thing to thing, touching everything…this is natural for them
They typically have difficulty with staying on task, schedules…they learn to adapt, don’t worry
These children (people) truly live for the moment!

Regardless of Your Type Mom and Dad-Here Are Some Things You Can Do to Nurture the ESFP Child and Improve Parenting Skill.

Don’t stifle their energy…let them SAFELY get it out
They will talk a lot…channel it, let it be…..chatty little ones
You can’t stop them from “touching things” so teach them how to touch things
Do NOT jump to the “ADD” conclusion…so much damage is mistakenly done with this type in this area…study them with “ESFP” in mind BEFORE you seek “clinical” advice
Support their emotions…well “feeling” actually, it is strong in them
Reward them with things that can be touched
Let yourself hug them, kiss them, touch them…ESFP children thrive on it….some others don’t you know
They love surprises….surprise them
How many time can you tell the ESFP child (person) you love them….as much as possible!
Be real, specific, but loving in your discipline of them
If you are not a “spontaneous” person and want to be…allow your ESFP youngster to show you!
"
644,esfp,"Oh for a moment there I thought you really meant you were 5 XD
Nevertheless ...
You are very observant! You will see things and notice things that the adults don't see! Things like incidences on the street, anything out of the ordinary -or if someone suddenly but subtly decided to dress differently one day. You will notice if something is wrong, or different or out of place, and it will give you a kind of sixth sense, much like Sherlock Holme's deductional superpowers. Still, you tend to notice things that specifically interest you -like cars, maybe, if you're into cars. Or fashion, if you're into fashion.
You have boundless energy. They say it is a stereotype, but it is true. You're capable of doing at least four times as much as the average person, although, at your own discretion, and in your own messy, chaotic way. Things just get done out of the sheer force of your boundless enthusiasm. And if it hasn't been done, it will get done, eventually, after you've done these other ten things that you're excited about. And that other thing that suddenly came up. Because why not.
-unless you're depressed. Or at home most of the time. In which case you might want to go out there and get some help.
You tend to be very popular, and simply attract people and followers, without even trying, and just by being yourself. For ESFPs, I think this adage is true -You do you."

I try to reach out and introduce myself and talk to people, but nothing really sticks and I end up back on my phone again lmao. I mostly spend Friday nights voice chatting on discord. It's not like I don't want to hang out irl, it just doesn't 'work out.' And I don't mind it, because I can still get my socialization from the internet even if I get rejected irl rofl.
I really enjoy talking to people, but I also don't mind being alone if they don't enjoy talking to me. Memes, discord, reddit, etc are still fun. My social life could be more active, but everybody expects you to put on some kind of persona or else you'll be socially outcasted. Online, you can socialize just fine and not have to deal with all that garbage. Don't get me wrong, I like socializing irl, but I guess I don't want to be the one planning everything and constantly being on my game for strictly following social norms lol.
What are your thoughts? Am I the only one? "
646,esfp,"Not wanting to follow social norms seems to be an ESFP trait, and I feel you on hanging out not ""working out."" A lot of my friends are busy and introverts, or are just far enough where I can't just run over for the night and hang out."
647,esfp,"It all depends. For me, I generally enjoy going out, but not necessarily directly talking to people, if that makes sense.
I like interacting with people, and I LOVE hitting up the local bars. I just get bored easily and end up spamming the ESTJ guy I'm into on my phone lol."
648,esfp,"Honestly, you sound a lot like me and it’s kinda freaky lol. I personally don’t like to reach out and make plans to hang out with some friends but I still enjoy their presence. When I’m at home, I feel like I need some company if I’m not keeping myself entertained so I get that interaction through discord."
649,esfp,"Thought I was an ENFP for a while. 
Esfp stereotypes are such shit
Anyway, what are your careers? I'm talking with an Air Force recruiter soon to see if becoming a fighter pilot is an option for me. 
Edit: whenever people call us dumb link this thread bc lots of y'all have smart af careers or creative careers that take lots of smarts to be successful. "
650,esfp,"Honestly I think the people make the job. As an ESFP we can do pretty much anything as long as the people are good. Ultimately I like my job because 1) I like driving and 2) everyone in my unit is decently friendly 
I’ve done tons of jobs I’ve hated just because the people were positive sources of energy and I cared more about them than the mission, and in return I succeeded at my job. Idk if that sounds cliche but be a pilot if that’s what you want to. I can definitely tell you it’s probably going to be extremely exhilarating. "
651,esfp,"Thanks for the advice. I live in a super liberal metro so all my friends keep telling me it's a mistake. Grew up in a rural military family tho so I've been kinda mixed on my thoughts about it until I actually looked at the benefits. My mom is like ""you can still be a doctor and go to med school!"" lol silly mom, but I do like that I can continue onto a masters and don't have to worry about finding an funded program. 
Is the quality of life between enlisted and officer as stark as people say? There's a few enlisted jobs that look cool to me, but I'm leaning towards officer "
652,esfp,"I also grew up military and never saw myself making it but one day I just decided to join. I love it man. Yes it’s a huge challenge but it’s one I find to be worth it. It depends. If you have the ability to commission right now, I’d suggest that. If you only have the ability to enlist, I’d definitely enlist. The best officers are the ones who enlisted first. Ask literally anybody. Quality of life is fine. I’d say the base but mostly the attitude are what determine if things are good or bad. Basic sucked and I wanted to quit, just like everyone else, but what kept me going was knowing the personally victory it’d give me to succeed. Same with tech school, and now that I’ve completed both and I’m working on my CDC’s I want to succeed even more. I think the military has been a positive thing for me and definitely helped me develop my  Ni. "
653,esfp,"I never saw myself in it either until this Christmas when my dad made the entire family watch Top Gun since my brother is joining the army. 
Haha now I'm stealing his thunder again, he found out he's doing Patriot missiles and obvi being a pilot would be way cooler than that imo "

My friend and I are hardcore MBTI hobbyists that recently decided to start a podcast. I'm an ENTP (The Debater) and she's an ESFP (The Performer), and together we have four years of MBTI knowledge, a love of self reflection, goofy humor and a very fat cat.
In our first 30-minute episode we talk about our history with Myers Briggs, why we love it, a short version of our lives as Extraverted Perceivers, and our vision for the podcast.
We're super casual and looking to talk about pet theories and MBTI jokes as much as serious self-reflection and analysis. We stumbled a bit cause it’s our first show and we don’t script it, but we’re hoping to get better with experience and feedback.
Tl;dr What do you think about our podcast? What questions do you have or do you get all the time about Myers Briggs?"
655,esfp,"My INTJ husband is going to be very excited about this. I'm glad there are ESFPs that can really get into the mtbi self-analysis! I've never really grokked the nitty gritty of it, and blamed my type for that. Makes me happy that there are people who can speak for us."
656,esfp,"Being an ESFP, The Performer, is nice... I generally love to learn new things.
I like to play music, sing and act, but I also love science and math that is actually applicable to my everyday life. 
I believe myself to have great anger management skills and social skills. 
Also I am obviously confident in myself and far from depression of any kind. I strive to be optimistic and wise and was raised by an ENFP mother who taught me compassion and perspective and an INFP older brother who taught me self control, and really just how to not be that guy, as it is often so easy for an ESFP to quickly become that guy."
657,esfp,"Miscommunication, Constantly. I was super affectionate. Which he loved but not in front of others. He would correct me in front of people (very factual). Just bad experience all around. I have another acquaintance who is an INFJ. She very belittling. She only talks about herself and repeats the same stories over and over.. I loved/love them but they both seem toxic. I'm sure a healthy INFJ would be fine. "
658,esfp,Is there anything I need to worry about or be aware of? My best friend is also an enfp but we get into fights because we are very different in how we perceive the rest of the world (our n and s) and she's also very selfish. I'm afraid my boyfriend and I might conflict like this.
659,esfp,"meyers briggs isnt a tell all about a persons character;if you think a personality can be summed up in broad sweeping generalizations youre gonna have a bad time
rather than using mbpt to determine what kind of person they are use it to find common grounds on which to build a relationship on. dont ever focus on the negatives"
660,esfp,"ENFP can sometimes be put off by ESFPs big personalities. We might see you as being obnoxious even if you're not intending to be. We like to discuss meaningful things, and really like the art of conversation. Sensing is our very last function and we do it internally, so it's hard for us to understand ESFP because as you said, we perceive the world differently.
What are the things you and your friend clash about? Perhaps I can attempt to explain her thought process..."
661,esfp,"Once you guys are intimate enough to talk about this talk about it. Tell the other one what difficulties you have with your best friend and how you should deal if such things arise.
Talk about sensing and intuition, how each feels about them and just go from there. Communication is a great way to prevent pent up things from blowing up!"
662,esfp,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
663,esfp,"Easy peasy I think. I usually try to just jump right in and worry about the details as I go. Sometimes the decision you make is the wrong one but whatever, not like I died, and it's more productive than had I mulled it over forever anyway. "
664,esfp,"I'll have a hard time deciding whether or not to do something until I tell myself ""Just fucking do it"" and I do. 
I do try to put a lot of thought into decisions that really effect my life... but I often get caught in a loop and don't actually make any progress. More often than not I look for validation in my decisions from someone."
665,esfp,"I find it extremely difficult to make major decisions. I find myself unable to choose and will often default to the easier choice or let someone else decide for me. 
With  insignificant choices I will usually just go with my first reaction but I also end up changing my mind a lot. I've realized that I can't make hardly any decisions in advance. Even if I have time to think it over I can't finalize my choice until I'm in the moment where I can't delay any longer. And I usually end up choosing the same option I would have chose initially. "
666,esfp,"Surprising amount of variation here. I struggle with major decisions that involve renewed long-term commitment. Choosing a career path for example has been a nightmare because whenever I begin to commit to one, I feel that I'm missing out on certain ""important"" qualities and I swing quickly to another which offers them. Rinse and repeat a few weeks later."
667,esfp,"This is exactly the behavior I am trying to improve.  Thanks.  Not flaky at all.   I just wish I could make better decisions, but you hit it spot on.  The more options, the harder (or more impossible) the decision."
668,esfp,"I'm 28 (female) and started dating a 35 (male) ESFP in January.. I have never dated someone so passionate or emotional. He has been sheltered and privileged most of his life... He lived at home and was upset when I met him about his parents divorcing last year when I met him.. He hasnt worked in over 7 years or so.. He was agorophobic for 8 years when he was in his 20's. We fought the first time we met., but more in a way of him asking me questions and testing me in a way. I am recentlty divorced and lived a very diff life than he has.. I've always had two jobs.. my own house.. relied on myself. But even though we are so opposite we had this attraction.. Everything moved very fast and once we realized we liked each other he started staying over every night and now here we are 5 months later and its still going. Sometimes he is brutally honest which I like but I'm still getting used to his personality. He complains about certain things I do or don't do.. I'm not used to affection at all from my previous relationship that it almost feels taboo to me. I love that he is so affectionate but I forget that I need to be more touchy feely with him. What can I do more as an INFJ to make him more happy?"
669,esfp,"Hello there INFJ! 
I am actually an ESFP (Male, 20) dating an INFJ (Female, 21) & I have a couple of suggestions for you.  


Provide a new experience for them. (Find something exciting or creative to go & then something creative to do once you are there & that will feed into their extroversion & adventurous side. They will also start to attribute that good memory with you. So the more you do that, the more they will associate fun times with you.


Give them attention. Whether that’s making eye contact with them or following along with their ramble story, they will feed off of that and the story or themselves will get crazier & crazier. 


Communicate to them that you enjoy when they show love to you. Regardless of what their love language is, although most ESFP’s are Physical Touch, they will want to show their love language to you. They will want to hug & kiss you. They will want to constantly compliment you & send love letters. They will want to do creative tasks for you that will benefit you. They will want to buy you cheesy cute things. That will all depend on their interests. 


If you need any more suggestions, I can do some more thinking, but off the top of my head that’s what I came to the conclusion. 🚀🤪😊"
670,esfp,I’ve never met an ESFP so I wanna hear if anyone has met an ESFJ and why or why don’t you like them. Why would we be at the top of the compatibility chart? Why do you think I would like you and why you like my type?
671,esfp,"I haven't met one but sounds like a dream for some, since both types get along really well but the J is gonna keep the P in check hahah I'm more into opposites tho so I don't know if I could date someone as similar as myself"
672,esfp,"He has a unique understanding of MBTI, pretty hit and miss imo. According to socionics your ""dual"" would be an INTP, which is the best type for serious relationships. Not sure what other types would be a good match for you, look up what other types socionics suggest and also look at types who use Fe, since it's your dominant function"
673,esfp,"I feel that, I have some social anxiety so I need someone to help keep things moving! Idk I would honestly probably be ok with an introvert as long as theyre still socially outgoing. The biggest need of mine is an FJ type. I think I would rather be with an Intuition over Sensing but really I think everyone's amazing! Just love people who are emotionally available and can sense others feelings"
674,esfp,"That can happen too since you're so different, but you still share the same functions in a different order, so if you do find an INTP you are on the same page with the relationship can be very beneficial to both of you. My duals are INTJs and I'm pretty sure these are the people I tend to argue with a lot, but at the same time I can understand them and I see how this could be a very healthy relationship. The point of a dual is that you improve each others weak points while exercising your most powerful function"
675,esfp,"It depends... I think we can allow ourselves to be manipulated, but I usually know when someone is trying to manipulate me.  I can choose to submit to the manipulation or I can stubbornly refuse to be swayed and cut someone out of my life for attempting it.  I can get resentful of someone trying to manipulate me into doing something that I don't want to do... I may eventually cave but they've only won the battle and I won't stick around enough to let them win the war.
I saw a youtube video about ESFPs that said we're highly individualistic.  We do only what we want to do... we have Fe but it's in our unvalued function stack.  We're not that motivated by peer pressure so for someone to manipulate us, they really need to appeal to our Fi."
676,esfp,"Hi guys, I’m an INFJ myself, I have many ESFP friends myself, and I see what you mean by us easily manipulating them, i think it’s more of a dominance thing, I can easily see how to do it With Ni and Fe like second nature, but I avoid doing it because it feels fake and I hate fake people, I see right passed them using the same process as I have the ability to manipulate people and it is sickening to watch. Plus that is just against my morals. Even though Our top stack does not mention we have Fi. We have a very strong function for it, even stronger than Fe, it’s just subconscious. But Enfjs don’t have a strong Fi and so they don’t probably have the morals to stop them from manipulating ESFPs as much as INFJs do. Even though INFJ can be more efficient at it, so don’t piss one off, or you won’t even know you did until it’s too late. (Not saying All Enfjs don’t have the morals too, I’m just saying it’s more likely.) lol I feel like the enemy here. 😂 I subscribed to only my type and this type, because I thought some of my best friends mbti type where very interesting to me, which turned out to be this one (ESFPs) and than I see this, Lmao. I mean sometimes I do manipulate ESFPs when they are teasing me or doing annoying things to me, but that can go for anyone who tries being an ass to me, no matter the type, but otherwise no, I don’t manipulate people."
677,esfp,"Also I have a random question, so when y’all are pretending that your mad at someone, are you just doing it for fun and to tease them or do you mean it and how can you tell, because my ESFP friends tend to do that by text to me and it makes me sad because I can’t tell if they are offended by me or not and it makes me very stressed and what ever I do, they keep going with that joke until I bring up my anxiety disorder or I will say to them I won’t be your friend anymore as a last resort, because it’s too painful for them to do that to me because I want to be great friends with them and they are really fun and great to be around and bring out this energetic vibe that makes everyone want to be around them. And than they jeopardize a friendship with me with a silly prank and I don’t want to make them think I’m mad at them either because I don’t want them to feel uncomfortable about me being actually mad, because all I want to do is spend a great time with them. Any help since y’all are ESFPs and hopefully more mature than my teen friends. I can see that being a flaw, but I don’t believe that it out-ways all of the positives about them. Sorry for my terrible grammar, I’m just rushing."
678,esfp,"I agree with this. I feel like N types are more likely to be good at seeing manipulation and doing it. When I was younger and probably an esfp, I was manipulated by an xnfj. I still don’t get along with most xnfjs I meet. I can see past their bullshit now. Unfortunately I’ve met some pretty bad ones."
679,esfp,"Hi I feel like your comment is partly in response to mine— I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable with my description of xnfjs. Unfortunately I’ve mostly met the bad ones but I have met some nice ones as well to balance :) I don’t think enfjs are more prone to this— I think the xnfjs who seek power, dominance, and especially material things are more prone to this. The xnfjs who want to be perfect and who always want more but are never happy with what they already have. When xnfjs are healthier, they are less selfish, more generous and sweeter. "
680,esfp,"Personally, I've never pretended to be angry at someone. That's just plain childish. I either keep it inside or express my anger, depending on the situation/whom I'm dealing with. Hopefully your friends will grow out of it over time, or maybe you could get new ones. Edit: Anxiety should be < than happiness"
681,esfp,"It’s fine, I don’t usually get emotionally offended like others my type. Like you said, it seems more like turbulent XNFJs do. Im turbulent myself and sometimes I can feel jealous, but I know how to manage those emotions easily and not let them take over my actions. I know how jealousy can really hurt friendships or people in general because people did bad stuff to me because of it. Instead of jealousy, I replace it like I feel good for the people I’m jealous of. I kind of look up to some of my ESFP friends, try to even be more like them. I kind of did. I exercised my Se dramatically and I would do things that other INFJs could not. The only jealousy that can be hard to control for me is when I feel like my best friends are leaving me for new ones. That is the jealousy that is hard to manage. I mean everyone feels jealousy, it’s just a matter of control and changing perception of the situation. I think I’m only turbulent because it might have something to do with my Sever anxiety disorder with OCD, misophonia, and more stuff from my auto immune disorder."
682,esfp,"Hopefully they do grow out of it, I don’t want to resort to new friends, but if have to, I would. I thank you for your input. I wanted to here it from an ESFP because I like to give the benefit of the doubt and I want see the situation from every angle, not just my own."
683,esfp,"Maybe so. My Inxp sis would manipulate me quite a lot when we were kids (she told me afterwards). But then again most xnfps I meet I like. I sense they could manipulate me if they wanted to but they don’t because they like me too, and if I found out we would no longer be friends. It’s different with unhealthy xnfjs because they seem to hate me at first glance, especially if I’m just trying to be friendly (not even loud nor intrusive)."
684,esfp,"Good for you to have a healthy stance on life and people :) I’m a turbulent isfp and I understand what you mean about jealousy especially in friendship. If anything, I find that healthy Fe is more selfless than Fi because it is external and focuses on the needs of others, not the self. So I see some of that in your post, which actually reminds me of my infX best friend."
685,esfp,"Oh yeah. I love ESFPs. And my brother seems to always bitch about you. Again the way the manipulation happens would be different. Me as an INFP would manipulate you, about me. I would make you feel a certain way about me. An NFJ would do it about you."
686,esfp,"Awe thanks, but Fi is good at keeping a moral code. Which I feel like is important to have one, because sometimes what Fe likes to believe is the majority’s beliefs and the majority isn’t always correct, like during the holocaust, most of that party who knew what was happening believed it was ok to kill the Jews. I believe in god so my morals belongs to only what he says and no one else and what Germany at the time did was completely wrong. This is just an example why Fi is important. Like my Fe will comply to social norms and be cautious of breaking them or I will be embarrassed. Those aren’t really core morals, but more of a social aspect. And selflessness will occur in Fi if you believe to be selfless, and Fe can believe that being selfless is not the approach if they are in an environment where the norm says it’s not ok. I think Fi is a very independent function that’s makes all of you very unique and interesting to get to know by the way. And your opinions are fascinating and new to know."
687,esfp,"My sister would actually make me angry on purpose so I would do something stupid and I’d get in trouble (didn’t work all the time because she was the older one and my parents would also be like “why didn’t you watch her” lol). That was not manipulating so I would see her differently, that was more manipulating me and how others see me. But since then she’s gotten better. I wish I didn’t have a bias against xnfjs but unhealthy NI and Fe just repulses me. Healthy xnfjs can be very sweet though."
688,esfp,"Hmm I don't think I would do anything like that. INFPs can manipulate for sure, but I think the motivation there was just more a big sister having her fun lol. But I agree with the NFJ bias. I feel it too. Its true with the majority I see. But I have an INFJ cousin who is just awesome. But still even then I speak to generally about them. Probably more my own problem."
689,esfp,"She admitted it was because she was jealous I was spoiled lol. But I love her :) she doesn’t do stuff like that anymore. Yes, I wish I met more healthy xnfjs too. Actually I think unhealthy Ni makes you overthink and think everyone is talking bad about you and unhealthy Fe is trying to be the best while fitting in (so when other people have qualities the xnfj wants they get jealous easily)."
690,esfp,"OMG! That is exactly what it is haha. You described my brother perfectly! It's not only trying to be the best while fitting in, it's hating the norm when you are trying to fit into the norm. Also being scared anyone is thinking about you and being super reserved."
691,esfp,Then I think the reason your brother doesn’t like esfps is because he secretly envies them. Because esfps are usually popular while being unique in some way (Fi) and they are straight to the point and don’t worry about people talking about them (Se). He probably feels like he is more entitled to the popularity because he can read people better (NI) and because he tries more to make the group harmonious (Fe). Fits the xnfj from my childhood too lol
692,esfp,"Yes...... Yes. He doesn't like my esfp cousin because he says he is stupid a lot. He also says he is a conformist. Saying the esfp just follows everyone along. When in reality he wants the esfp to follow him. This seems like a very infj hypocrisy. 
But hey isfp. We both feel very much don't we. Haha. You're so clever. "
693,esfp,"MBTI PODCAST
Hello peeps, the MTBI podcast is on the works, were still recruting personalities for the podcast and people who can help us out with intro music and cover art, 
You can join the creators group to help create this podcast here:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/MBTIPodcast/"
694,esfp,"Most important are the alone one and the shallow one. My Fi makes it hard to get along with the same person for extended periods so I usually need a break. And it also makes me feel things pretty intensely, so I definitely wouldn't say I am shallow, though based on my interests someone might pin me as being that way."
695,esfp,"Hey there everyone, I've taken the test once again and I've gone from ENFJ to ESFP. I guess I identify more with ESFP according to what I've read online.
Anyways, I've been talking to this girl (ISFP), for about 7 months. Our relationship has been really off. She feels like she wants to be with me sometimes and others she doesn't, so its constantly back and forth for 7 months, every time I try to let her go we end up being drawn back to each other and she goes back to the unsure feelings.
It's to the point where she's unhappy and stressed out all the time because she doesn't know how she feels and ends up telling me she feels so much better when she gets away from me. It's irritating because I'm not doing anything, and I've told her that none of this is my fault, and that it's all her mind that's making her problems. She knows, but says a lot of it is BECAUSE of me. So she says she's ""Don't trying to have feelings"" for me. Which again.. irritating.
Everyone says move on, I know that's the 100% surefire way to get over this issue, but it doesn't work for us, We've tried NC, we've had ""space"", and tried talking to other people, but she gets super jealous when I talk to anyone, even if its just a friend on Facebook...
Her plight is this, ""I don't want to lose you, and what we have, and some days you're what I like in someone, and others your not. I have feelings for you, but deep down I just don't feel it, and I don't feel like I want to be with you because I'm not excited by the idea""
""So.. If that's how you feel, why are you still around?""
""IDK""
Are ESFP, and ISFP even compatible? We're really similar and we do have an amazing time together, really the only time things get irritating and shitty is when she starts to second guess her feelings. It just puts me through hell because one day the girl that I'm in love with is feeling things for me and its wonderful, but then at the drop of a pin somethings wrong and she is turned off by me and then things get complicated..
and the contradicting, holy shit. She contradicts herself on so many things. I love all her flaws, but this is one that I have a hard time accepting. Especially when all of her contradicting thoughts are about how she feels about me.
""I want to be with him""
""I don't want to be with him""
""I have feelings for him""
""But I don't feel for him""
""I don't want to lose him, but I don't want to be with him I don't think""
AH, it just frustrates me even thinking about it. Before I'd get all hurt and depressed and upset. Even now when she starts saying things like ""I'm just done trying"" or ""this just needs to end"" it makes my stomach sink, but my main feelings are just ""Holy shit this is stupid and annoying, I'm not an item or a second option to you.""
But neither of us can walk away. Whenever I get to that point where I feel like I can, something happens and I end up getting back into her. 
The ""way"" that I am that she likes, really only comes when I feel like she's into the relationship. Like shes committed or invested in a way. Or if I'm stressed out, or after an argument. 
I guess the shadow type for ESFP is INTJ, which she's drawn to. 
Idk. I'm sure you're all going to say just drop her and move on. I just needed to rant. 
But if you guys have any other advice on how to help her make up her mind I'd be more than happy to hear it.
TL;DR: I'm in love with an ISFP that doesn't know what she wants, or how to feel about me and its been going on for 7 months. "
696,esfp,"Hopefully all of you read this comment, as its me in a calm state of mind, and completely open with my feelings, as well as my thoughts and desires.
She's said to me that sometimes I'm not what she wants, and that I don't make her happy or excited, and her conflicting feelings I can see make her extremely miserable. 
I love her dearly, and I hate to see her like that, and I want the best for her. I want her to be the happiest she can be, even if that means having to leave her life. As much as I don't want to do that.. if it's the only thing that would make her happy, I'd be prepared to do so. 
Although, as stubborn as she is sometimes, I know that I hold a very dear spot in her heart. I love her to death. I hope she finds peace in all this, and figures out what she wants.
All her life, she's been left to her own problems. No one willing to really help, instead, would rather wait for her to figure herself out. She's not had a rolemodel, she's not had someone to set an example for her.
As much as I know this ISN'T my responsibility as a person, it IS my responsibility as a potential S/O. It's something that I want to do for her, and I hope that in doing so, it helps her further understand her desires, and what she really wants in life. I don't want to hold her hand, because ultimately there are things in her life that she's going to have to face without me. She'll have to be strong, and independent when that time comes. But I want her to know that she isn't going to be alone. That I'm always going to be here for her. Even if she's mad and ends up hating me for whatever reason, my love for her isn't going to subside, nor do I feel like hers will for me. 
I want to help her grow, and walk with her, as opposed to walking above her like everyone else seems to want to do. I genuinely want her to see how much self worth she has instead of constantly thinking she's not good enough for anything, or anyone. No matter how much shit I'll have to walk through. I'm patient, I'm in no hurry. I might not even end up with her in the end. But, with whatever time I have with her, I'd rather make it productive to help her along in life.
That is the extent of my love."
697,esfp,"I literally had the exactly same thing happening to me last year with my best friend. She finally became so pissed of at me that we stopped talking for about 2 months, and then got back together. 
We now communicate alot more, tell each-other exactly

702,esfp,"I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.
This is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/esfp would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ESFPs.

705,esfp,I subscribe to the theory that our corporate overlords secretly control every aspect of world societies using different forms of government to subscribe to stir up petty bitterness among society so that no one ever realizes that they are uaelessly sucking all the wealth from the world for over priced status symbols.

711,esfp,"So this is actually a true delight to find this. 
I am wondering if this means that you and I experience the same things, the same anxieties and such. 
I have found that I had to articulate this recently to several people and have yet to find anyone who understands quite clearly- maybe its an ESFP thing? 
I am anxious that I am not social enough. 
Let me back up I just moved to London, before I moved to London I lived in DC. In DC I had a very established social life- three plans an evening the weekends were packed. I moved to London as the result of a quarter life crisis and you know all that jazz. Before I left I remember quite accurately sitting in my empty bedroom sobbing. My fear was- no social life. 
When I got here- it was game on, I did not allow myself to sit in my room, I did not allow myself to have down time. Every second, every dinner was directed at making friends. I voraciously did this- when my social calendar was not full (plan every single night)  I had so much incredible angst and stress. 
This stress caused me to invite 49 people over for s'mores one night at my new flat and spawn a tradition on Thursday nights. I mean people in the building view this as an awesome sense to socialize as we are all grad students but for me it was less about socializing but more about me getting my Thursday nights filled. It was almost about thriving- if this makes sense? 
I have taken up closely- and again maybe an ESFP thing- with a roommate who is unimpressed by me. Its not hard for me to find people who will laugh at every thing I say because they want to be involved with me and company to my plans. My roommate is the complete opposite, introvert, unimpressed and the only thing we bond on is sassiness. I adore her for her honesty. I have to work to get her approval. ( I call myself a human golden retriever). She has as a challenge tried to get me to stay in on nights. 
So I have I have stayed in without plans for three nights. I am getting used to it- but I have to equate it to feeling like I am gaining 50 pounds and watching trashy TV- I feel gross. 
I guess what I am saying do other ESFP-er's get it? Am I alone? Is this what we deal with? 
Do you also have friends who are embarrassed about how many conversations you start with strangers at a bar? No matter how many friends you have you sometimes feel very alone? Do you all have different levels of friends with whom you consider on an order of closeness. From the people you can hang out with, in sweats and those you do to ensure that you are included in some social group you bounced into when you went to that Goth Rave that one time? 
Just wondering..."
712,esfp,"Yeah if I don't go out and do things I also feel like ...gross. That's a good word. Like wtf am I doing with my life, just sitting here? Everyone else is out.
I start convos with strangers like it's my job. Mostly cuz I can't sit still, I need to be doing something. And I think ESFPs tend to attract flaky friends so yeah, I have a lot of those and I do end up feeling alone if I overthink about it. So I just try to be ok doing things by myself. My best friends are introverts because they're loyal, but fuck they never like going out! Once every 2-4 weeks and they're done. But all my friends are all in different circles. None of them know each other. I just collect a bunch of random people, there's no real theme to the kind of friends I make. They're all interesting though."
713,esfp,"Welp I am kind of thinking you shouldn't be in this forum friend 
INTP's aren't my people either so I don't hang out where they are and post about that. 
So color me confused why you needed to comment. "
714,esfp,"I have an ESFP who has been grieving the accidental death of a very close family member for over 6 months. She barely goes to work, can't sleep, confesses that she's always irritated at things that would never bother her before, and you can tell when she's thinking of her loved one because she tears up but then refuses to talk about it. It's almost like she feels embarrassed or ashamed. I think she has a lot of guilt/blame/regret over her last interaction with this person. What she did wasn't ill-intended or even bad, but I think she keeps thinking that if only she had done something differently anyhow, it wouldn't have happened. 
She had a brief period right after the death where she indulged in a lot of drinking and sex. That seems to have abated, but she won't go to therapy or a support group, and she won't go to the doctor and ask for medication. I've suggested some self-care things like exercise and writing but she dismisses those too.
I know the grief process can take years, but I worry that she's not coping well. Then again I'm very different from her, so maybe this isn't as maladaptive as it comes across to me. What do you guys think? How do you deal with grief? And what approach would be most helpful to her under these circumstances? "
715,esfp,"Not well. It’ll be a process. This will sound silly, but my friend got a puppy and it was adorable and brought it over for me to play with. She subtly asked if I could walk her. And it helped a lot. Maybe try getting her outside where she doesn’t feel like a burden. I get a lot of joy out of making others feel good while doing things that are good for me too. (Being outside, getting some exercise) 
Sorry if this wasn’t helpful or the help you were lookin for. Just be there for her. Lots of hugs!"
716,esfp,"My now girlfriend (also an ESFP) had a similar experience.  A mutual friend of ours ubruptly/accidentally passed away and she was the one who had been performing CPR on them before they died in hospital a day later.
It was almost impossible to get any of her true feelings on how she was coping out, ESPECIALLY if she started getting emotional.  If things get too heavy she will completely shutdown, ignore it and/or cry intensely.
She’s much better now a year later. 
The thing that got her through in the end was lots of support from friends and family.  As well as introducing as many positive things into her life as possible (e.g. new job, dating, new home etc.). I think for Better or Worse distraction as opposed to discussion seemed to have worked the best, which is very different from myself."
717,esfp,"I’m a ENTJ with an ESFP girlfriend.  I believe simply being there for your friend in the many and various ways speaks volumes to ESFPs.  Saying it is nice but doing things, small or large, says a lot.  Showing them you stand with them during this time will help. She feels deeply and therefor will grieve deeply.  Be there and expect no answers.  (I may be wrong so if any ESFPs want to help me I would appreciate it). "
718,esfp,"we don't deal with it well. we don't like people seeing us cry even though we get emotional really quickly. We are good at reframing though, meaning if we convince ourselves to look at things a different way, we truly believe it. But it can't be coming from someone else, we have to somewhat discover it ourselves and believe it. I would say give her new experiences that she appreciates so her mind can flex and readjust. "
719,esfp,"I recently found out that I'm not an ESFP or ENFP, as long as I thought I had dominant Se justifying it as ""taking things as it is,"" it also came with a whole other set of traits that I don't relate to in the slightest, including things like being assertive, concerned with aesthetics, and great at taking charge,, and this kind of thing has been popping up everywhere, and has been following me around for as long as I can remember. You can clearly see me trying to overlook these for a long time, but after awhile it starts to feel like I'm forcing a puzzle piece. It came down to, if I'm not an ESFP, then I'm not an ESFP. 
After being lowkey rejected by ESFPs, I figured I was ENFP, especially with posts like this, and posts like this, and posts like this, lmao. But then I go and read about dominant Ne and intuition in general...
... it sends my running for my dear S.
My cognition simply isn't dominant Ne. I'm not constantly shooting out ideas  or having hunches while drowning in possibilities,
Where are y'all seeing the intuition?? LMAO
So I found a good middle ground at ESFJ - And to confirm it, I was verified over a video chat and got typed as an obvious ESFJ, and  ESFJ pretty much accounts for everything. My massive Si tendincies I'm always talking about, the resteraunt stuff and the nostalgic recalling dates from the past, and I tend to base my descisions off the past too, like if I knew that this particular resteraunt has some nasty broken soda mechine, I won't order soda there, things like that. ESFJ also has Ne, just not dominant, but it's there enough to explain why I kept getting barraged with ENFP typings lol. And the inferior Ti would explain why I'm pretty bad at logical consistency, people have pointed that out to me a lot too. 
But about the Fe. People have pointed out that in my questionnaires I mention appreciating a good social atomosphere, that's lively, cheerful and accepting, and accepts me for who I am, and it sounds very Fe. Wanting to interact with people especially on discord, caring about twitter followers, wanting to be chill and not control anybody - sounds like Fe. 
But the thing I don't relate to, is Fe being good at creating social circles, reading the room, being good with social cues, and being well liked by most. I am a cringelord for crying out loud, ever since elementary school I've been kind of lowkey outcasted, because I'd always overdo it with expressing my obsessions or meme references or whatever. My family also gets on my ass a LOT about acting socially inappropriate, and I've actually been banned from some places. I'm trying to work on that, but my point is it doesn't come naturally, like a dominant function should. I'm far from a popular social butterfly, the closest thing I'll be to that is typology discord lmao. I believe that everyone has the right to live their life their own way, we're not here to control each other, nobody is less than as a human, the world (especially cities haha) is a beautiful place, and I see no need for social games, gaslighting or any form of malicious manipulation, I just want to live my life with people I love and do what I love. Does this support or go against Fe? They seem to be very big traits, just like how Se dom have these big traits, and I would just like to know if it's that big of a deal to worry about, or if they actually end up supporting my type. 
Edit: I just want to say, that I really do respect and trust everybody's analysis here, I appreciate all of it and I don't want to seem like I'm disregarding anybody's opinion. I hope I didn't come off as 'screw everyone' on this post, I'm just a bit confused atm."
720,esfp,"I'm getting the idea that you fell into the trap of overvalueing functions.
You appreciating something from the outside world is, according to my understanding, not involved with a decision-making process. It is just extraverted percieving, so no Fe. What was the last meaningful decision you made based off of social convention or maintaining harmony? That would mean Fe, and dominant Fe means it is second nature for you, like an instinct."

722,esfp,"I don't think I actually make decisions based off of that, I just go with it and appreciate when the atomosphere is like that. I think the closest thing to that is deciding to go to a party because I know the people there are really cheery and accepting"
723,esfp,"Good. That means, you're probably a perciever.
You may want to read stuff like this. Heidi Priebe is an amazing writer about type and psychology in general. There are 18 hints on how do discern ENFP and ESFP. Just look it up, decide for youself and count. You will probably relate to both in many cases, but it will give you a good idea what is fitting for you."
724,esfp,"This is an absolutely terrible list(and Heidi Priebe has a very limited understanding of MBTI). The way it's described here is as if ENFP is just the more intelligent, future-oriented version of ESFP, which is not the case at all. If you want to tell whether you're an ENFP or an ESFP this list is the last thing you should be looking at"
725,esfp,"From my perspective, she just portrays ENFPs as more philosphical but not inherently better in terms of intelligence. The list is not perfect, but also not terrible I think.
What would be a better source of information for people to find out whether they are N or S for you?"
726,esfp,"I don't think that you should be looking at it as N vs S, because it only makes sense if you're going strictly by dichotomies. Look up the individual descriptions, read about the functions and then decide between the types you're stuck with. In this particular case you should mainly focus on Se vs Ne and there are major differences between the two. Se is a lot more forceful and dominating for one, which wasn't discussed at all in that article"
727,esfp,"Yeah, I'm the opposite of forceful and dominating lmao. If Fe is just wanting to live life, do what you love and interacting with people who feel the same, then Fe is the function for me rather than Se or Ne :D"
728,esfp,"I've lived with an ENTP. I got along with him well. It was great because he loved cooking and would randomly cook something amazing every now and then. He was also highly addicted to drugs so my other roommates told me to keep it low if I had my hands on anything. Thing I liked most about him was that he would be highly productive with school work... everything he did seemed passionate to him. Thing I didn't like was that he was the lack of emotion to myself and everyone else. 

I'm friends with a few other ENTP's who I haven't lived with. As a friend they are great. Anytime I see them on campus they are lovely to have a convo with in between classes. The ENTP's I know are always active, start the day early, and are done with class before noon. They are great people to know, and I would love to live a day as an ENTP for sure, but that Ne dom followed by Ti aux is just too much for me to handle.

As an ESFP i've noticed how easy it is to tune myself with ENTP's. If there is some logic, theory, or subject I know they're into, it's so easy for me to strum at their chord and keep them very excited. It's fun for me because I love hearing how much they know about something I poke their minds with. 
ENTP: I've been getting interested in philosophy
Me: What's the point? We're all just lines of chalk in the cement waiting to be washed away.
ENTP: (immediate argument and opinion about life and death)"
729,esfp,"I hate ENTP humor, it's like the most annoying thing in the world. I don't know what it is but you all seem to have this similar brand of humor where you think talking incessantly about stuff you know we don't care about is funny. And it's like every single thing that comes out of the entps mouth has to have some sort of cutesy spin on it to make it quirky. Everything is exaggerated or twisted or whatever, it's just not natural conversation.
You guys are alright, just don't expect me to laugh at anything you say. It seems entps think their humor is all they have to offer."
730,esfp,"Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) 
You don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:

Any comments, ideas, critics are welcome!"
731,esfp,"To add to it a little bit, I heavily disagree with the portion about which types we would get along with. ESFP's are actually known to get along well this ISTJs (and I can confirm that). Also, my best friend is an ISTP. 
I often push back on using mbti type to determine who a person can get along with. Every person is different, and mbti doesn't necessarily take upbringing into account or emotional/mental health, so every person of every type is going to look different. Yes, there are trends showing which types would be less likely to get along with other types, but I really think it shouldn't specify ""compatibility"". Or maybe it should say something like, ""most likely to be compatible with..."" and ""less likely to be compatible with...""
Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to elaborate on anything else.
Hope I helped! :)"
732,esfp,"I took the test and it put me as ESFP, so it got my type right. I can't make a judgement on its accuracy, seeing as I don't know if it got anyone else's type right, but at least you know it got one person correct :)
I still hesitate every time I take an online test (and most ones I take give me results anywhere from INFP to ENTJ). I wish more tests focused on the cognitive functions instead of only the letters (I-E, N-S, F-T, P-J).
I prefer the longer tests where a person has to actually explain their thought process, but those aren't really possible online (that is, it won't give you immediate results), and it's a lot harder to type them if it's not in person. "

734,esfp,"I'm an INTP and my son is a 13 year old ESFP. Looking back at childhood it's easy to see what my parents did or didn't do that really hurt or helped me, and I'd love to be able to change anything I'm doing that is really hurting him before he's already grown and it's affected our relationship negatively. Are there things your parents did that stick out in your memory as really affirming, helpful, or made you feel loved, cared for, and seen? Are there things your parents did that made you feel invisible, unwanted, misunderstood, cheated, or confused?
Thank you for reading and thank you doubly for any insights you can give!"
735,esfp,"Thank you so much for this post and caring about your son enough to write it.  This in itself makes me think that my advice is probably unwarranted.
ESFPs are still defining who we are when we hit out teenage years.  We’re not good at introspection or deep thinking.  Our Te and Ni feel practically nonexistent at this point.  We live very much at the whim of our Se and Fi at the moment.  Which means that we are easy to understand and easy to please.
We want to indulge our Se.  It can be anything from walking in nature, playing sports, or eating good food.  Ideally, we would like to indulge it with friends.  Make sure you give him a chance to get out, do new things, and meet new people... but don’t force it (as an INTP, I doubt you ever could).  Let him have his freedom to decide what he wants to do.
You may he surprised at how strong his Fe is, considering it’s an unvalued function.  It’s because we ESFPs need a lot of affirmation and validation, so we pick up and value social cues quite easily.  We’re not as rebellious as our ESTP counterparts... we follow the rules as long as they align with our Fi.  If we see something as unjust or unfair, we will join the rebellion, but if we think things are a little out of hand, we’ll step back and abstain from participating.
With Fi-aux, we like to go our own way.  We also like to have things our own way.  We can be demanding, controlling, and selfish.  But we are also about the good time and don’t really get off on hurting other people.  We’d prefer to validate rather than tear-down.  But we’re not pushovers.  If you have a complaint about us, state it rationally while validating is in the process.  We may blow up, but we hear your words.  Give us a chance storm away to calm down and we will return to the conversation later after we have thought about what you said.  We’re highly volatile so we explode easily but then we can let something go just as easily.
If we’ve done something wrong, remember that we are conflict adverse.  If we feel that we’re being attacked, it will trigger our fight or flight response.  We will do/say things that we regret just to get away.  If you see this happening, let us “escape,” cool down, and then come and have a rational conversation with us.  Show us that you understand what we might be feeling.  Validate us.  And then tell us the reasons why you confronted us in the first place.
Hope this helps, though this advice is based on my experience as a female ESFP.  Male ESFP mileage may vary. (n_n
Good luck and know that he’s pretty lucky to have an awesome mom like you! "
736,esfp,"That's a valiant effort, and I'm sure your kid will appreciate it. It's impossible to prevent all trauma, it's just about what trauma, and how much of it, parents inflict. It's part of growing up. However, looking at ESFP needs, and hearing your kid specifically will go a long way to create a nurturing environment.
My parents are a ENFP mom and INFP dad. They're both rather relaxed, and we had a lot of freedom, which I much appreciate. They gave us a lot of freedom, and instead of giving us strict rules, they gave us ethical guidelines, and accountability. We had a lot of power making our own choices, but were taught to understand the direct consequences, and causality, and to make informed decisions. So, we could decide. And we were accountable. Both our parents wanted us to be capable of critical thought.
For me, it's mostly things they couldn't affect much. We were in a financially unstable environment, sometimes almost rich, and other times barely affording food, and they were behind on rent. They couldn't afford to give us any pocket money, and I had to start contributing at 15, otherwise we wouldn't make it, financially. That was a lot of stress. Especially as they treated me as adult since I was 12, and I was in on any struggles they had. Financial, emotional, other. I think it contributed a lot to my depression and anxiety.
The other thing was typology related, so little they could do. Almost all my family are Ne-Si users, while I'm Se-Ni - hence, Si-ignoring. I am focused on immediate opportunities, rather than all possibilities. I always found it a waste of time and frustrating exploring all options. I wanted someone to focus with me on the now, and on a singular road to take, based on my specific needs. I live in the here and now, and am very kinesthetic focused. I would have needed encouragement to take up sports and be competitive, more so than being lead towards an intellectual direction. I'm intelligent, at least according to all measures, but I don't like to stay in the mind and explore options and subjective logic. I want to assert myself on the world and make my way in it, and find success and attention, and admiration. If your kid has a competitive spirit, and likes attention, encourage one, and indulge the other. That's something that broke my heart most."
737,esfp,"The fact that you think and care about this is already a good start
To me one of the things that really made me like my mom a lot less growing up was how little respect she showed me(she's definitely a high Fe and Si user). I think that after a certain age you have to treat your kids as equals, instead she would keep trying to boss me around and disregard my opinions up until I was old enough to stand up to adults intellectually(and to understand that most adults are just as confused about life as kids and teenagers). Also another thing(which I'm pretty sure comes from their Fe and my lack thereof) is how they expected me to instinctively figure out some things(like social etiquette or chores), instead of calmly explaining to me why I should or shouldn't do something they'd just expect me to comply and get mad when I stopped to question it, which only made me confused and angry myself. Personally for me the best thing was to figure things out on my own. Even if someone was being patient and respectful while explaining something fairly obvious to me I'd still have to process it by myself to accept it as a truth(which is Fi and Te I'm guessing)
I've always had a good relationship with my parents, but we were always on different pages about most things in life. I think as a parent the best thing you can do is be there to support your child if he needs you, but let him make his own mistakes and learn from them"
738,esfp,"Growing up I've never felt comfortable letting my parents in. I don't share my personal feelings with them. When I was young I felt they invalidated my feelings and it pushed me away even further. Now that I'm older they're trying to reach out but its difficult for me to trust them nonetheless. Be careful when your child is opening up to you. Most times I ""test the waters"" by alluding to something serious or open up a tiny bit. The reactions to these instances are crucial in deciding if someone is trustworthy or not. So my advice would be to be careful how you react to certain things. Try to keep calm and be careful about what you say. 
At least that's what I think haha I don't study too too deep in mbti. But this is my experience as an ESFP"
739,esfp,"It probably has to do with gender, but I was definitely more rebellious than my ESTP friends. Usually when they rebelled it was out of anger or out of peer pressure, while to me it kind of came naturally, even as a little kid I would disagree with my parents and peers and formed my own opinions about everything. At the same time I was never really a bad kid for the sake of being bad, I just didn't like being controlled or forced to do anything"

Yes, I think I should be doing more of this. Sometimes I'm surprised at the intensity of his feelings in certain situations and this is when I should be especially aware of being affirmative and validating of his emotions and experience. 
""If you have a complaint about us, state it rationally while validating is in the process. We may blow up, but we hear your words. Give us a chance storm away to calm down and we will return to the conversation later after we have thought about what you said. We’re highly volatile so we explode easily but then we can let something go just as easily.""
So when I desperately need some time to gather myself with Ti and Ne I just need to explain that simply and then validate his needs by explaining that when I'm done with Ti/Ne time we're going to play a game, do that code breaking activity, go for a walk, etc. We're going to learn about each other's cognitive stacks a little better I think. I'll keep it short, and I'll be physically illustrative and get him into it, too. I think my lecture style just literally kills his attention and interest. Have to get more kinesthetic.
""...we follow the rules as long as they align with our Fi.""
Yes, I really admire this. I want to make sure I'm giving him opportunities to develop his Fi. I read in another post that Fi sometimes felt like ""shady backroom deals"", ha. I loved that. Experiences in my past allow me to commiserate with this phenomenological way of being, though mine is experienced through Ti/Ne and his is experienced through Se/Fi (mainly and when not under a lot of stress.) So, if we get into an argument over something I can ask him why he feels something should be a particular way and ask him to explain to me his Fi structure. After, I can explain my Ti structure and we can see where the other is coming from. Then we could discuss how to integrate the best of both perspectives. I also want to ask him to dance for me what he feels about certain things, too. Maybe figure out more ways to get him to connect his Se/Fi and help him synthesize them? Yeah, kinesthetic.
​
Thank you so much! Your insights are so valuable, so lucid, so insightful, thank you!"
741,esfp,"""They gave us a lot of freedom, and instead of giving us strict rules, they gave us ethical guidelines, and accountability. We had a lot of power making our own choices, but were taught to understand the direct consequences, and causality, and to make informed decisions. So, we could decide. And we were accountable.""
This is really good to stay aware of. Don't arbitrarily impose my Ti structure on him, in doing so I will be devaluing his Fi structure. Yes, he's been lying about homework a lot because he doesn't want to do it. I don't blame him, it's mostly busywork, but I have to find a way to show that it can be valuable for him through his Fi structure. I need to help him find a meaning through Fi that will motivate him intrinsically. 
""Especially as they treated me as adult since I was 12, and I was in on any struggles they had. Financial, emotional, other. I think it contributed a lot to my depression and anxiety.""
I think sometimes I say too much in certain areas myself. I'm trying always to be honest, as one thing that bothered me with my parents was that nothing was ever honest and so little felt real. There is a delicate balance here at his age, and I want to think more about this. At one point I couldn't live with my mother anymore because I felt in my bones she would kill me (she was physically abusive) and my father abandoned my sister and I entirely emotionally, and half-time physically. I grew up so fast, I'm actually really unsure what the lines are at times. I'm going to ask my friends more when this line becomes blurry for me. 
""I always found it a waste of time and frustrating exploring all options.""
Yes, my Ti/Ne can frustrate him to no end. At certain times it might be good for me to present to him a few paths I see, but keep it short and simple and find a way to tie it to Se/Fi. Maybe... we are reading The Metamorphosis of Plants by Goethe together right now. Maybe I can tie the specific experience of watching a plant diversify itself with ""feeling"" out different ways of being in his environment simultaneously. Try to tie his body sense with his feeling sense with a sense of metamorphosis through time. Then it will have a physical presence and he can explore possibilities that way. ? After clearly thinking over the next quote, its just dawned on me that this IS Se/Fi. But it's not simultaneously experiencing multiple paths, it's focusing on one path and fleshing that out. Then he can move on to another focus that he fleshes out.    
""I wanted someone to focus with me on the now, and on a singular road to take, based on my specific needs."" 
Okay. Yes, he picks something and then he sticks to that path and explores its multiplicity that way, not in the way Ti/Ne explore all paths simultaneously. Duh...how else could Se/Fi work? Ha, that really helped me clarify, thanks. And...my ""deceiving"" and ""devilish"" functions, 7th and 8th, are his leading and supporting, and vice versa. So I can tend to distrust and/or function unconsciously or largely ineptly with/through the functions which are his main, and he distrusts and/or functions unconsciously or largely ineptly with/through my main functions. So when I'm ""analyzing, categorizing, and evaluating according to principles"" and  ""Interpreting situations and relationships and pickup meanings and interconnections to other contexts"" he is  ""Experiencing and acting in the immediate context"" and ""Valuing and considering importance, beliefs, and worth."" Want to keep this interplay in mind more often.

So, encourage his exploring his options and use of subjective logic, but indulge his ability to assert himself in the immediate context and the world and make his way through it himself, and make sure I'm making him aware of my admiration and need for his process?

742,esfp,"It is tough, INTP and ESFP are conflictors, according to socionics. They have so different values, focus, everything, and there is only so much one can do. ESFPs are Ti PoLR and INTPs are Se PoLR. However, I have some friendships with INTPs, some long-standing. That's with those that have the same interests. It's a bit frustrating, because our focus on the same things is entirely different, but there is still value in exchange of information, and indulging the same.
""So, encourage his exploring his options and use of subjective logic, but indulge his ability to assert himself in the immediate context and the world and make his way through it himself, and make sure I'm making him aware of my admiration and need for his process? Do I understand you correctly there?""
Not the first. It will just be frustrating for him, and will give him a complex of being lacking. He doesn't value either. Exploring all the options instead of how to make the one vision he wants actionable seems frustrating and pointless, and subjective logic is for ESFPs PoLR, something they suck at, always will suck at, don't value, and take it as a personal attack even when it isn't meant so. But yes the latter. Asserting himself, and being able to leverage his immediate opportunities right now. That's encouraging his ego-function, and giving him confidence in what he's good at, and what he will instinctively use. Basically, making him confident in what he needs to be confident in. However, instead of options, you do have demo Ni, even though not valued, you're capable in it. And ESFPs are Ni- seeking.
""Aww, big hugs, you and your processes deserve to be valued. You guys are just the most loving, gregarious, beautiful, social catalysts on the planet.

Thank you, that's much appreciated. I don't think that's necessarily true. ESFPs are Gamma, therefore, intrinsically individualistic, and pragmatic. Like all Gammas. However, gregarious yes. And catalysts, though more from an action point of view. I think your son is really lucky to have you, and for looking for ways to make him grow up a confident man, with good relationship with parents. If more people invested in trying to understand others, we'd have less damaged people all around."
743,esfp,"This sub needs more posts so I'll throw my hand in. I just wanted to share that my twin is an INTJ.  As an ESFP, there were many interesting encounters growing up.  He was always very focused on school and I was immersed in different extra-circular activities namely music.  While I dabbled in science (bio) and he dabbled in arts (violin) we finally managed to have some overlapping interests.  We recently have found areas of similar interest and are talking on a regular basis.  He even has opened up to me a little bit, and is less reserved around me!
Anyone else have similar expereinces?"
744,esfp,"Yes! Omg I can't believe someone else has the same situation!
My little brother is 4 years younger than me, and he's introverted and quiet and reserved, while I'm a total ESFP. I imagine he'd be an INTJ if he took the test. It's been the cause of some strain in our relationship, but it's gotten a lot better now that we've realized how different our personalities are, and how to work around that."
745,esfp,"I know you guys are supposed to be good at moving on after ending a relationship. Do you ever look back regretting ending it because you think you ended it too soon or could've had more patience to make it work out or wish you committed when you had the chance?...My younger Brother (esfp) Who hated to be alone, commited suicide because he thought he'd be alone forever (he had friends). All his friends moved on and started families. He had a few relationships that ended because he wouldn't commit. One in particular was a girl that he was seeing for 2 years. She ended it because he wasn't able or didn't want to give her a definant hope for the future (commitment).  I believe he love her more than anybody and she loved him. Eventually She moved one and so did he but he always talked about her. When he moved on to the next lady, it also ended after 2 years. Same exact reason as the other girl. By this time ALL his friends were married and had families. Because of this, he ended his life he was so afraid to be alone. So my question is: Do you ever look back on your life and think. ""I had (the one) and I wish I didn't let her go. I should have committed""......? I'm just curious. I'm not blame throwing on anybody. I'm trying to understand."
746,esfp,"I am so sorry. It sounds like he had a lot of internal struggles.
I don't know that I can give you the insight you are looking for. I do move on quite a bit. But there are those ""what ifs"" and ""what would of happened"" thoughts once in a while. If I would have continued. But I also know there is a reason it ended. I do believe that one day. There will be a person that, will make me want to fully commit. Even though those relationships ended they still mean a lot to me. It just wasn't right for me. Self reflection is always a good thing. 
I'm so sorry for your loss."
747,esfp,"Hi all, I [INFP] and my mom [ESFP] have been going through a massive rough patch.  She took the test a while back and it was accurate to a T so I'm pretty sure I know what I'm dealing with here.  She is very controlling and expresses her anger both verbally and physically, while I tend to retreat until I have cooled down enough to forgive her, and so the cycle continues.  What I don't get is why she is so closed off to me emotionally - she has a cohort of close friends who know far more about her than I could ever hope to, and yet she demands to know everything about me.  Sorry to bring to light all these negative traits but i'm wondering if any ESFPs can help me understand what makes my mom tick and how we can resolve disputes properly.  Much obliged :)"
748,esfp,"My experience as an ESFP is that I have very close to emotions all the time, but that it burns out very quickly. Us senser-feelers know very well how to read people and make them tick, which is why we can get quite mean when we're pissed even if the initial anger doesn't last for long. 
Emotional closed off-ness usually comes for me personally when I feel the other person having a ""superior"" attitude to them, usually I don't connect well with N's for example, as they always seem to find me shallow etc for being an S. 
I don't know your mother but that's just my own experiences. Good luck! x"
749,esfp,"Idk if this will help.. But I'll try. Do you pry? I know for myself I have to willingly give knowledge, you can't just ask for it. My deep feelings and thoughts are pretty private. Have you been up front with her about wanting to have that kind of relationship? 
Some of my experiences with some people, when we have a misunderstanding. They tend to throw things in my face. Like some kind of twisted, game of who's the worst person. I don't partake. But I don't like it either. I can be sensitive but I prefer upfront. I can reason with myself, that you have no ill will. 
Also, it was hard for me at first to understand how INFPs work. Try to explain yourself more but also remember we're very practical. If you can't, try to be honest, upfront and reasonable. And tell her how you feel. And maybe even ask her what you can do to make things run smoother. 
She sounds dysfunctional though. "
750,esfp,"My mom is ESFP, and I'm an INTJ. I think I know what he's talking about.
Something about our end of the spectrum drives ESFP up the wall. I've driven my very loving mother to the point of wanting to beat the crap out of me, when I really was trying my best to diffuse the situation logically. 
It's all perspective, but ESFPs hear our logical pleas as Patronizing. As if we don't think you can figure things out on your own, when we're just trying to give you our ideas. We just don't know what to give ESFPs.
Eventually you learn that the best move is not to play. "
751,esfp,"Sometimes I do something embarrassing, feel so damn crushed and made a fool out of that I don’t even want to stand up, but if someone talks to me or I’m notified of a social gathering or a chance to talk to people, I instantly feel better/ have more motivation all of a sudden. This has been happening a lot lately. Can you relate or is it just me?"
752,esfp,"Yeahhhh.. I guess I have some social anxiety cause anytime I do something embarrassing, in my head I'm like, ""well I guess I have to give up socializing forever now""... And then I can jump right back into it when someone gives me attention or asks me something. Yeah, now that I think about it, I can definitely relate."
753,esfp,"Speaking as an ESFP and someone who knows ESFP's, we're natural flirts, so it's often very difficult to determine whether we're actually crushing or just flirting for fun.
The only thing I would look for is extra attention and initiation of conversation. Despite being very social, ESFP's don't often show their true emotions and tend to keep their deepest feelings to themselves. Unless they are coaxed. :)"
754,esfp,"Hey guys, before I ask this, I acknowledge how wrong, stupid, idiot I am by wanting to do what I’m going to to tell you know, but still. Briefly: I can’t forget ESFP girl and move on, and although she once specifically said “I dont wanna be rude but I think you dont get that I dont want to date you” but my brains keeps bringing all the sorts of excuses why she said that. And although I have said slightly bad things to her like “you’re a party girl”, which means that I’m not supposed to continue liking her, but I still do. So anyway, so 2 times I tried to get back with her since we separated and every time I got hurt because of her disrespect (she once came to a party that I invited her and hanged out with another guy all night). So again no matter how stupid this whole thing is, if I wanna do smth the last time, what and how should I do this? I can’t text her because I deleted all her contacts so I don’t have any means of communication, but I have her sister on sc and that’s how I see her pics and miss her. Besides, I might see her at some bar because we live in a small town, there is a high chance for me to meet her. So how should I approach and talk to her if I see her at some bar? The problem is my last text to her was that she’s a party girl and I dont wanna be friends with a party girl lol facepalm I know there is no way for comeback "
755,esfp,"To be honest... just don’t. She has expressed no interest and if you keep pursuing her it will just annoy her. I have a problem with an ex like this (INTP) and he is so annoying I’ve considered a restraining order due to his harassment.
If you still HAVE to try, just try to be her friend. Maybe if you run into her at a bar, you can ask how she’s doing, what she’s been up to, etc.. but if you pursue her more I guarantee she won’t respond the way you want her to. It’ll only push her away more. By being her friend there’s at least a chance for you to reconcile, get to know each other, and maybe she will develop feelings again. "
756,esfp,"So, the best thing you can to earn her respect is do exactly as she says, and move on. ESFPs are pretty direct, and mean what they say. If she tells you she doesn't want to be with you, then the reason she says that is because she doesn't want to be with you. The absolute best way to earn a woman's respect is by respecting her personal agency ;)"
757,esfp,"Leave her alone. If she comes back around it’ll be in her terms. 
The more people push when I tell them no, the more I feel my boundaries are being disrespected and the more distance I will create with them. "
758,esfp,"Wow this is the first time I hear ESFP getting jealous. And I agree with what you said. I know all ESFPs here think I’m an idiot and creep af, but I understand that I’m wrong in some of the things I said, but it hurts me so bad that I can’t sit without doing anything about it. But at the same I’m planning to go to psychologist, I’m doing my best to get into her position, understand her and let her go."
759,esfp,"Well then that means that’s it’s a lose-lose situation, right? Like regardless, whether I approach her or not, we’re never gonna start talking again, so then I have nothing to loose I guess, at least I’d give it a last try. I don’t plan to say anything bad, I just want to tell things as they are, that I can’t forget her and that I still can’t understand why things didnt work between us. I never had a chance to speak my mind, I was always afraid that by saying how much I like or miss her, she gets more distant"
760,esfp,"In that case I think the best way to approach it would to just send her a text and ask if you can talk. I’m sure if you express what you truly feel, she will respond well :) I know personally and some of my other ESFP friends enjoy when people are up front and blunt about what they want to say. Just tell her how you feel and see how it goes from there. I would apologize for things you said that hurt her though once you guys get to talking."
761,esfp,"That’s what I can’t get about ESFPs. If the girl clearly shown me she likes me in the past and as soon as I want a little bit commitment, she considers that as a disrespect??? Really? I think it’s a perfect pathway to cheating. This whole thing sounds really immoral/hypocrite to me.
Answering your question, it adds loyalty. Very loyal people don’t break up very easily and try to accommodate their partners. ESFPs seem to be okay sleeping around with people and tasting different lips until they find what they want"
762,esfp,"Thank you, the only thing is the stupid constant questioning myself what if I have some chance to get back but by doing smth I’m affecting my chances. Like for example, once, after breakup, I was flirting with a random girl at a bar , as soon as I saw this ESFP girl, I stopped talking to that random girl, thinking this can make a bad impression about me on ESFP and screw up any little chance I have. I know I’m probably wrong, but I just wanna hear ESFP perspective on this"
763,esfp,"Tbh I think this is a bad idea, almost for a year I’ve been trying to fall in love with other girls, but it didn’t work, and now I just feel shitty about myself. I know for sure that didn’t hurt any of them coz I was honest from the beginning. But the fact that I did try to fake it makes me feel guilty now"
764,esfp,"I don’t think anything ever hurt her, I feel like esfps are invulnerable. I’m the one who has been constantly hurt by her not caring what I feel when she’d flirt with random dudes. I still feel like it’s a bad idea to tell her straightly what I feel, I’m thinking of if I could talk about smth different"
765,esfp,"Don't incel react, please. I'm trying to advise, like you've requested. What you said is she said she doesn't want to be with you anymore, and you keep pushing. Whatever the reason you guys split, once she has decided that she doesn't want to be with you anymore, you should respect that. The same way she should respect that had it been the other way around, and you didn't feel good around her anymore. Ignoring her personal agency is what I said was disrespect. Her body, her time, she should be able to do with it what she will and isn't required to do someone else's bidding.
You haven't mentioned wanting commitment, or any kind of discussion, other than that she clearly said she doesn't want this. And clearly, when you don't get what you want, you lash out. First, calling her party girl, because she said no to you, or isn't ready to commit, now calling out all ESFPs for sleeping around with people when that is not a type related thing. I would warrant that at least part of her issue with you is how you react to hearing what you don't want to hear."
766,esfp,"Hey, oqowa, just a quick heads-up:
accomodate is actually spelled accommodate. You can remember it by two cs, two ms.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
767,esfp,"Nope, if we’re over you, we don’t care if you’re chatting up another woman.  And if we’re still into you, chatting someone up with rouse our jealousy and actually work in your favor.
But we hate games... so don’t try to play them with us.  Just be you.  If things are meant to be, they will be.  Love isn’t like the movies.  You shouldn’t have to struggle.  If it’s meant to be, it will be. (^_^"
768,esfp,"This whole plan sounds like a bad idea. I wouldnt push it dude. Shes an ESFP shes gonna flirt whether you like it or not. I mean obviously your mbti doesnt define you, but im an ESFP and im a huge flirt. If Im with a girl its usually harmless flirting, and she usually understands, but she sounds like shes not interested."
769,esfp,"Lol I swear your 2nd paragrapgh sounds exactly like that girl!!!! I feel like it’s written by her lololol But frankly speaking, thanks for the reply, I’ll keep in that in mind. I don’t like games either, it’s just I hate to say this but if all of a sudden she makes the first step to get back with me, I’d make probably 5 steps towards her. That’s my weakness and it sucks. Again I hate that I’m like that, that I still would be down to get back with her and it makes me feel bad about myself. But I can’t force myself, I’m sure if she just comes to talk to me, I’m not gonna even act like that I’m mad at her while I’m supposed to be."
770,esfp,"Then the story still doesn't change. It's tough, but it could be any of a million things. She could be afraid of commitment, which is not the same as not wanting it. She may have liked you enough for what you had going on, but wasn't in love, so decided to make a decision, that would hurt you (both) less than the alternative. Or she could be a player, you never know. We don't know the whole story. You don't know the whole reason either. But as frustrating as it is, we aren't entitled to getting a reason out of a person who turns us down. It sucks. People want closure. But you have to learn that you have to find the closure within yourself, because the other person just doesn't need to give it.
Tough shit. It sucks. I've pulled the short end of the stick in the past, I've also been the person who opts out. You win some, you lose some."
771,esfp,"No we aren’t invulnerable. Quite the opposite for me. A lot of things hurt, but you just gotta let go of some things. Like when i dated my first girlfriend guys flirted with her and she occasionally flirted back, but it was harmless. At the time i overreacted and i got so jealous and freaked out about things. Me freaking out kind of ruined the relationship. Afterwards i thought about it alot and learned that i probably shouldn’t have freaked out and i should’ve trusted her, but dating is a learning experience. 
Also just an fyi if you aren’t dating her she can do what she wants. That should tell you something. Not to be mean im just telling you how it is."
772,esfp,"agreed ^^
You can’t control what she does and if you’re already mad at her for being social, flirting with guys, and partying, the you absolutely SHOULD NOT pursue anything with her. If those things bother you when you’re not together, you’ll resent her while you are. Trust me. I’ve seen it happen so many times. Also?? How are ESFPs “invulnerable”... We are pretty emotional in my opinion. "
773,esfp,"I'm sorry to say, but that's your problem. We as individuals are not entitled to force others into interactions that will give us closure. Typically, it never feels as closure. Needy people just need more and more explanations, more and more chances, and keep bargaining. It's intrusive, and uncomfortable.
The fact you feel used is also on you, not the other person. Starting relationships is about 'let's see where it goes', and sometimes, it just doesn't go anywhere. The considerate thing is to end it early. If anything, she's shown respect by being direct with you, and neither ghosting nor leading you on."
774,esfp,"Im in a very similar situation, an ESFP girl did something similar, leading me on a lot, and then just ghosting. I do find this totally disrespectful and I cant possibly understand what kind of person would do this? I know I wont get closure, so maybe you guys can help me understand what could have happened, let me know if you want any more detail on the situation, maybe Ill make it a post on itself, yeah Ill do that"
775,esfp,"What do you mean by leading you on? What did she do to make you think you're going steady? It's hard to know what happened without more context. Even with context, it's hard to know. It can be a million different things."
776,esfp,"MBTI
I’m very sure about being ESFP. I relate to most of the descriptions, I made a couple of type me posts here and here and got ESFP pretty consistently. I also feel like I line up with the esfp functions (mostly). I know for sure I have fi and inferior ni and the Se description doesn’t sound too off (apart from being physically graceful lmao). I considered ENFP and ISFJ at one point during this confusing mess but they don’t match nearly as much as ESFP does. 
Here are some Mbti ESFP descriptions that resonate with me: 
SOCIONICS
Now that I’m sure I’m not mistyped in mbti, I went on to read some of the socionics descriptions and see what it had to say about ESFPs. 
I found a whole ton of crap like 
Geez, what happened?!??
I know if you’re on r/mbti you’ve probably gotten sick and tired of me obsessing over this stuff. But seriously. I can relate to jack squat in socionics but I’ve never been more sure of being ESFP in mbti. 
I posted threads similar to this in r/mbti and they concluded that I’m actually an ESFj in socionics. But that’s still confusing, because I thought the p and j were only supposed to switch for introverts?
I came here to see what y’all thought. This is very confusing and I’d appreciate if I could get this clarified. Thank you for taking the time to read this. "
777,esfp,"I was nodding through the entirety of the MBTI description but couldn’t even get through the socionics. While I certainly relish being a mentor to others, I’ve never gotten off to the feeling of power. I’m actually currently being placed on a pedestal in my new job and while I appreciate the acknowledgment of my abilities it’s making me a bit uncomfortable because I don’t want the tenured employees to resent me. "
778,esfp,"Socionics actually offers a number of type descriptions, and just like in MBTI some profiles are crap, others are decent. You posted one of the crappiest profiles. If you want to read others that are somewhat decent try ESFp by Gulenko and ESFp by Stratiyevskaya."
779,esfp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/u_serenarose224] Mbti ESFP vs Socionics ESFP

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
780,esfp,"What are some cliches you hear from people about ESFPs? 
We’re deemed as party people who know how to stay wild but most of the ESFPs I know are relatively reserved compared to some of the descriptions I’ve read from other people. I feel like a lot of people (myself included) look down on ESFPs because we’re TOO loose and party too much. "
781,esfp,"An ESFP sterotype I hear everywhere is “all ESFPs have unlimited energy and they’re always the center of attention in a group setting” blah blah blah. I can be pretty shy at times and sometimes if I’m in a group of people I don’t know sometimes I can’t find really find much to contribute to the conversation. So I wouldn’t say that sterotype is always true.
As for the wild partying ESFP sterotype that’s even portrayed right in this sub’s header and description, I don’t necessarily agree with that. I don’t mind parties, but they’re not my main goal in life like some tumblr posts make it out to be. I’m never really “the life of the party.” I love being with people, but I don’t crave attention 24/7 and throw myself in the spotlight all the time. "
782,esfp,I always feel like ESFPs are the most least talked mbti topic anywhere... do you actually noticed that or is it only me? There is always so much to learn about us but people rarely asked us about personal questions.... hmm maybe it's only me?
783,esfp,When I look up ESFP on other mbti subreddits I got results saying espfs are terrible people soooo hahah I think we def fall into the smaller minorities online simply because a lot would rather be doing something else
784,esfp,"ESFP have 'drunk bimbo' as a negative archetype and that is hugely repelling to the more nerdy people who populate the more frequent subreddits. I even argue that, beside the general N"
785,esfp,"Have any of you guys ever experienced being in the grip? I think I have been experiencing it for a while now.
I've always been content with life until after graduating, where I feel like I should have big goals and ambitions. Problem is that I am too anxious to move forward from here - every goal or vision I come up with seems extremely dreary. 
For the first 20 years of my life, I just enjoyed life. Now, I am extremely serious about everything."
786,esfp,"I don't understand what being ""in the grip"" means, but what you're describing is just part of growing up.
Everyone has to figure out what they want to accomplish with their life after high school and it's very rare to automatically know what that is. The hardest part is actually taking the first few steps toward your goal. Whether that means going to college, moving out, saving money, or any other long-term commitment (which is where a lot of ESFP's just struggle).
One thing you can be sure of: when you DO finally figure out what you want to do, you'll experience no shortage of passion for it. :)"
787,esfp,"I think that's what i'm caught up on. I feel that I should know. Atm, I want to go into web design but I also want to try out acting. I guess it's just the fear of missing out which is holding me back, then again I can do everything else in my spare time anyway.
Thank you."
788,esfp,"""Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!""
On the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?
Anyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)"
789,esfp,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
790,esfp,"Because we're emotionally intelligent, happy-go-lucky, and not autistic or anal retentive. Pretty much the antithesis of the Reddit community, so people have a hard time relating. Add that to the natural urge of destroying what you do not understand "
791,esfp,"awww nope, i like you guys generally.
even if im an infj and we are not supposed to get along.
guess it's easier for older and therefore mature (introverted) types to get along with a wider range of different personalities."
792,esfp,"Because a large majority of the MBTI community consists of NTs. Each personality type has biases attached to it on a subconscious level. NTs have trouble figuring this out, because we're not good with our emotions. Although, ENTPs and INTJs are the better of the two when it comes to this.
It's likely you have biases about INTJs you may be unaware of. If you want, I can inform you on how to temporarily correct them like prescription glasses. And no, I'm not saying you've done anything wrong. Everyone has biases. We just have biases about certain types due to the positioning of our functions and theirs. Basically, the less we experience a person's functions, the function stack listing them in order of significance, the more biased we'll be, hence why a Ti-dom will be more biased about an Fe-dom than any other dom."
793,esfp,"Guys help me! I know it’s rude not making this my own post, but I can’t make my own because I don’t have enough Karma, but my ESFP friend’s inferior function (Ni) is going bonkers right now. He’s worrying about that he may get CTE when he’s older because he had 2 minor concussions. Any advice how I can make him feel better from any of your opinions from an ESFP stand point. Him worrying about it is going against the whole ESFP moto of living in the moment and it’s ruining his quality of life and it’s making him go crazy. Any help? I think he’s trying to get reassurance from an Ni dominant like me, but I want more help. I told him worrying about it is worse than having the remote possibility of getting CTE, he agreed to that, but still, just want more advice to help him because CTE has no cure. - INFJ"
794,esfp,"Because everyone on the MBTI sub is under 25 and desperately trying to assure themselves that somehow they're better than other people. This is why they're all types as Ns even though most of them are probably not... also there's a buncha ENTPs and they just hate y'all and everyone else for no reason. Maybe that's true, I'm just talking out my ass though."
795,esfp,"Paranoia is a son of a bitch 
Ultimately he has to find his own answers to escape it. 
Try physically doing something with him to reengage in reality. Make sure he's well fed, has slept, and knows that you care about him. 
Take him to do something new"
796,esfp,"I will try my best to get him back into the momentary reality and allow him to do something fun and I will make sure he knows I care about him a lot. And I will try to find something to do that’s new to him. Thank you for your input, it’s really helpful and I appreciate it a lot."
797,esfp,"No kidding, even the moderators are being asses, in my INFJ type threads, sorry for my language, but maybe the moderators in here won’t be as up tight because they are ESFPs and ESFPs are great and many of my best friends are ESFPs. When they reply to my post and say I’m being disrespectful. Like chill people your being disrespectful, stop changing my words. They are just a bunch of cherry pickers. The INFJ moderators said I called him a skank, I said if you were a skank. Like chill! It’s like they think reddit is some safe space. Ugh... I even almost got banned from the INFJ thread and I’m an INFJ myself. Wish I wasn’t..."
798,esfp,"Just amusing to me that you guys have problems with authority even when the authority is your type.
But it's definitely unfortunate when communication issues escalate into a bigger problem than they need to be."
799,esfp,"True about that everything should be equal in this experiment to which my example of beating an ESFP would be a bad example. But everything would be equal except the personality types, would Ni and Te come up with a strategic plan to beat the ESFP, or would the ESFP use his/her dominant Se to overpower the INTJ. I wonder if that would change any of the odds, or will it still be 50/50 no matter the personality type. External factors don’t count, but what ever differences that happen in the match will be because of being different types."
800,esfp,"Yeah, let’s just say we don’t always stand on the same foot. like seriously, they say they want a genuine conversation even though they are the first to start saying the shit. It’s a bit funny to see them feel so entitled at shutting down my opinion as if free speech doesn’t exist. Like say what you want, but don’t expect me to take anything down. It’s not just the moderators though. If anyone says they hate INFJs, I don’t blame them, some of us give a very bad first impression."
801,esfp,"Well, some subreddits are indeed safe spaces, or at least that's the intent of their mods. That seems fine to me. If people want that, they can stay, and if they don't, they can go and make their own thing.
If I choose to pee on your rug every time I come over, you're unlikely to invite me back much."
802,esfp,"Yeah, like that one post by INTJ asking for perspective and they started attacking him/her? Seriously, that just triggered me. Own up to your flaws too. "
803,esfp,"Yeah, but the INFJ thread is suppose to be talking about INFJs not a place of protection of being offended. If that’s the case than I find them offensive for finding me offensive, but I don’t care. But they sure do treat the thread as one. But for those subreddits, I’m ok with that because that’s what it’s suppose to be there for. It’s just when I go to an INFJ thread, I expect an INFJ thread, not some safe space. It’s very disappointing. But that’s how it is and so I will deal with it by leaving them."
804,esfp,"Yeah, I was in a brawl with my own types, people get offended from my opinion because they took it personally so they want to start up with me with no respect yet they expect respect back from me. Even the moderators where saying I was harassing them even though they harassed me first. (Harassing as in shaming)"
805,esfp,"Yeah, it totally makes sense that you'd expect to be understood by others of your own type.
They're pretty clear about not being a free-speech zone, though. First rule in their sidebar? ""Abuse and harassment are not allowed"". 
'Course, the tricky bit comes when different people have different ideas about what qualifies for ""abuse""."
806,esfp,"Context, any further thoughts are appreciated. Serious as in being calmer, determined, steady, and silly being fun loving, spontaneous, maybe joking around a lot.
If you can explain the when's of when you are in either mood, I'd love to hear it, too!"
807,esfp,"If I'm around people that I know fairly well, and the group is at ease I can find myself being kind of silly. The more fun the people I'm with are having the more comfortable I feel, so I can kind of be loose. 
If there's tension within the group, or I don't know the people I'll usually be in a more serious mood because I worry a lot about offending people, or making someone uncomfortable."
808,esfp,"I work at a restaurant with a few ESFPs. These guys are all about banter and pushing each other playfully. From time to time the pissing contests might get heated, but they never go beyond the day. 
The ESFPs I work with are heavily into music and try to live life according to what they think is good for them, even if they have to fight several temptations along the way (one of them sleeps around a lot, but wants to find a soulmate. The other is about to hit his first sober year and is in sober living). 
The former's laughter is infectious and people mock him for it but everyone loves him. Tall, handsome, funny musician waiter who's good at helping people stay positive and lighthearted during shifts by utilizing his flirtatious sense of humor. Even with guys he's a tease which is great because it eases competitive tension. 
The latter is action-oriented busser who gets shit done and leaves everyone else in his position in the dust. A bit confrontational but that's due to his life upbringing. Deep down he's pretty sentimental and likes to help people stay positive by engaging them with playful aggressive banter. Hardly ever gets mad and responds energetically to challenges and physical activity. We've butted heads a few times but he really brings me out, and the back of the restaurant is usually brought to life with volleys of comebacks after comebacks when we work together. Good shit. 
Yeah you ESFPs are pretty silly. The flavors can definitely vary."
809,esfp,"It's kind of strange, I'm the most serious person I know, yet my sense of humor is also the silliest out of everyone I know. Can't really explain it. I like crude, childlike, raunchy, slapstick kind of humor. Will laugh when someone farts, will tease people when they're uptight. Yet i have the deepest conversations and am constantly disappointed by people."
810,esfp,"Hey guys! So this girl I met is an ESFP, awesome girl I love how we can talk so easily, have lots of fun, plan lots of things we want to do together, and she has this way of blushing when I look at her that, ugh man! , so fucking cute!. , any tips, advice, warnings? I'm going for a trip for about three weeks, any tips on keeping things interesting by text? "
811,esfp,There’s this girl that I’ve become friends with for over a year and so many times I can tell that she’s into me but then there is times where I think maybe she’s just a really sweet person idk. She’s 20 and I’m 22. We text/snap each other every day for a year and everytime we hang out which isn’t that often there always this feeling between us.. 
812,esfp,"I could give a ton. But I remember when we first started becoming friends we were texting for only about a week and she would tell me about dreams she was having of me. I thought that was funny that she would actually tell me that she’s having dreams of me and even the dreams themselves are exactly the type of dream that you would have when you have a crush on someone. That’s just one example of thousands. The most recent one was we hung out for the first time in 2 months and she was constantly taking secret pictures of me. She goes to college and says that so many guys like her but she friendzones all of them... also when I went to say goodbye to her last week she was telling my how sad she was about me leaving and her friend gave her a hug and I said “ wow am I that special “ and then I could tell she got nervous in a way she started saying things that didn’t make sense and got way to excited. Lol it was cute. 
I know she’s esfp cause I had her take the myer Briggs test. And everything I read about esfps is just like her. All though her upbringing is very different. She was brought up in a strict home and was a little sheltered as a kid. I could talk about her forever. I love her. Wish I could tell her "
813,esfp,"you noticed her always staring you, did you stared at her back? i mean like you saw her looking at you, then you immediately look away bc you noticed about it or you stared at her back?
btw, liked men or liked me?"
814,esfp,"I see I see. Upon deep analysis, seems you've got that. The only option is to go for it and hit dem guts. 
If it were me, I wouldn't tell her, I'd just go for it when she's in that embarrassed mode. 
God speed!"
815,esfp,Yeah I love analyzing people. But yeah funny cause when she got in that embarrassed/nervous/excited mode I was gonna hit her with another question that might reveal her feelings toward me but then her friend came up to us and changed the whole mood 😐 lol

817,esfp,"Hey all,
I feel like I am very much an ESFP, and a turbulent one at that.
I started a job this year that kinda sucks. I sit at a desk 8-5 and type out code allllllll day. Sounds like torture for an ESFP - a fact I didn't consider when I was aiming for this industry. 
The job has slowly turned me into a monotonous, pretty unhappy guy. I feel like I have lost my spark that I used to have during the day, and it will only appear on the weekends again now. What makes it worse is I left a good job which had a good balance of social to it to come here (and better $$). I keep beating myself up for it, but also too scared to go find another job impulsively due to how it would screw people over here, and probably not look good by any means. Ontop of that idk what role to even go for (Full Stack Developer atm, definitely not that :P)
​
I see a lot of ESFP's have a lot of creativity, but I feel like I never quite embraced it growing up, then went to a field that was not too creative either. Did anyone else feel like this? How did you find your creative passion? How did you find a career you enjoyed and didn't have to force yourself to every day, and spend all day counting down the minutes until you leave?
​
I just want to be okay with getting up and going to work or being there, but I spend such a proportion of my day unhappy, its turning me into somebody I don't like."
818,esfp,"First of all, are you absolutely sure you're an ESFP? Don't go off stereotypes, go through individual functions and analyze your behavior to see if it really fits you. Secondly, being an ESFP does not equal being creative. What are you good at, what did you want to do when you were growing up, why did you get involved in this industry in the first place, what were your motivations? Answer those questions and you'll figure out why you don't like your current job. It's never late to start over, better to waste some time learning something new, rather than constantly trying something you know you don't like. If you don't know what you want or like maybe it's time to do some soul searching and explore new ideas."
819,esfp,"I have artistic people in my family, which definitely influenced me to do art myself. I also grew up singing karaoke and three-ish years ago I also picked up the ukulele. But these are all just my hobbies!
Last year I worked a job that physically and mentally drained me. I basically worked in a factory, doing the same thing every day (I was packing those serving carts with coffee and tea pots for commercial planes), and the only time I got to interact with anyone was during breaks. It was so exhausting to me. At the moment I really want to work in a grocery store so I get to interact with people all day!"
820,esfp,"My partner is ESFP and a chef. I think that's common for sensory types. He is high energy and has a very keen nose. He likes the busyness and clamour of the kitchen.   
Creativity is simply putting your energy into the world in some sense. Figure out what your best output is and follow it. If you haven't figured it out yet, like me, I guess just keep trying? Sorry it's not very helpful but it's all I've ever received as advice."
821,esfp,"If you don't want to waste your tech background and coding skills, you might look at related lateral moves that are more client facing and hopefully will give you a little more variety day to day. For example, tech sales, technical writing, forward deployed engineering, tech consulting, etc."
822,esfp,"Yeah I see. I did that for over 6 years from 15 to 21 and I loved the social side of it. Now I'm. In industry after university and I'm in an office of 10 who talk in our few hours of meetings a week or make some very light small talk throughout the day.
Its essentially torture for me. 😂 "
823,esfp,"Yeah I think for me I have a keen eye for what looks good. It carries from fashion to interior design so I'm thinking there's perhaps something to do with using creativity I can look into there.
I guess I've always matched creativity to art and I am very artistically challenged 😁
Good luck to us both finding a hobby! "
824,esfp,"Extremely out of my depth when I was six months into the industry. Essentially it was a graduate job at a top tech firm and after company restructures a while back my role became something entirely different. It was overwhelming and ambiguous and wasn't getting the help I needed so I left. I got two years of experience though and that'd great on the resume. 
I am learning a lot here and I felt I needed to do a software developer role to really know if I want to pursue it but the company itself and the culture is appalling lol."
825,esfp,"Fair response! My issue was living away from the city, where most good jobs are in the city. I thought id be happy saving myself 3ish hours of travel, but the negatives in my new position outweigh the flexibility and variation of work I had there (a struggle at times).
​
So I think it will come to a point where I need to move out closer to the city and make a life there, or perhaps try and bide my time and keep an eye out for opportunities around me.
​
I think I am not suited to be a developer. My strongest skills are my interpersonal skills and that is what makes me thrive, so I may look to kind of side-grade to a more social technical position in the next job I go for.
​
Sorry for the word vomit. You helped me ask the questions I needed to ask myself so thanks!"
826,esfp,My sister is an infp and many of my friends as well. I feel that our relatioships don't last. I always get a feeling that they will never put as much into the friendship as I will or as I wished they did. Me and most of those infp friends don't talk anymore tbh...
827,esfp,"Pretty good. One of my longtime friends is an INFP. We have always got along, even though unlike me he is pretty idealistic(but at the same time understanding) and our tastes in art are mostly different"
828,esfp,"I think a lot of it was selflessness? Like I wanted them to care for me as well. For example, with my sister, if she wants advice or wants to share something with me I'll take interest. But she never seems to make an effort to be interested in my life. I've always felt that for a relationship to feel real there needs to be mutual care on both sides. True consideration for the other person. Idk if this makes sense haha"
829,esfp,"interesting. yeah, it makes sense. I'm starting to casually talk to an ESFP dude so that's why I'm curious! from the INFP perspective, I would say it's more difficult to open up to you guys than with some other type. not quite sure why, but I feel like i'm only 50% of myself when I'm around ESFPs. not that that excuses their lack of consideration towards you at all, but might be some explanation."
830,esfp,"Yea and I think I can sense that lack of openness which then in turn get returned. I'd say if you're attempting to romance a dude.....(not sure if that's the case) the advice I could give is if questions get personal, answer honestly and sincerely and return them back. Take a true interest in this person's life and feelings. Buuut then again I'm just a stranger on the internet. "
831,esfp,"Hello, wonderful ESFP!
I am in a bit of a spot. One of my best friends, an ESFP, had a crush on me. It was a brief one, got replaced quickly (he has the attention of a goldfish), and then flared up again after a period of time in which we hung out practically every day and had fun adventures. Now unfortunately, he said this lasted for an unordinarily long time (a year), and was hard to shake out of. He would keep hoping that I would reciprocate. Thus, he's cutting off ties to move on, among other reasons.
So I have several questions. What on earth would an ESFP see in an INFJ??? He certainly has more attractive, more fun friends surrounding him, and I don't fit the type of the usual girls he likes, physically and personality-wise. Secondly, is there hope to be friends? Will he forgive and forget, and stop fearing a ""relapse""? Because I'm very optimistic and I think we can definitely keep our great friendship.
Thanks ESFPs!"
832,esfp,"As ESFP's we can just be very emotional (at least me especially). So when we find someone we like, we can either take a relationship really fast, or we can just get attached even when nothing is happening. And I am talking from experience, it is very hard to get unattached. 
Judging from just an ESFP to INFJ standpoint, he probably sees a lot of things in you that he's missing. I've always said friendship is a good foundation to a relationship, and I would assume everyone would agree, but those are probably the main reasons. "
833,esfp,"I lived a version of what you are describing. Years ago, I developed a crush on my INFJ friend, but she was dating someone else. It became a thing where we would see each other every day almost no matter what because her relationship was long distance so I was who she relied on in person. I was completely smitten but she always had reasons that we wouldn't work. Twice we tried to make it work, each time ended up with us both angry and sad because of our different needs and expectations (I saw a relationship as just a continuation maybe just strengtheing of our friendship, she had much higher expectations of what being in a relationship entailed) So multiple times we tried and then crashed and burned. It was very hard for me as she would quickly usually react by trying to get into another relationship but I never wanted to because I didn't want to hurt her. We finally came to the conclusion that we should not try to be in a relationship and we are just very good friends and housemates and we get along amazingly well because we both know that nothing romantic is on the table and we are free to go about our business but still have each other around. Not sure how helpful this is for you but at least in my situation it was possible to remain very good friends! 
To the whole aspect of why does he like you? Well, at least in my experience as an esfp, I see potential mates as friends and when i really care about the friend it becomes something more, I don't have any sources on hand but I have been shown MBTI interpretations that speak about how well INFJs and ESFPs can work as friends so that might explain why he is so into you because you are a good friend!"
834,esfp,"Thank you so much for answering! I could see what you mean... both were kind of happening. So he's distanced himself, for all intents, permanently... is there any hope that he would re-initiate contact in the future if I feel like it's subsided/he begins loving someone; or should I? I guess, what would you feel are the good and bad possibilities? Thanks for any ideas you have!"
835,esfp,"Yes, there is hope for him connecting with you again, but it might be hard for a while. However, once you two start talking again, let him do things first (if you get what I mean). If you try to jump in too fast, he could build emotions back up again and it could all repeat itself (speaking from experience). 
The way I look at it is there are only two possibilities, he stops talking to you, or you become friends again. If he chooses to cut ties, there's not really much you can do. I had to do that with one of my friends because I knew I would never get over her if I continued to talk to her, BUT that was because she was always being flirty. 
My best advice would be to just take things slowly! You can start talking to him again, but build back up the friendship on his time and show that you care about it. Just don't give him any false hope of a relationship. "
836,esfp,"My dreams are very vivid and based on reality, and all the while I'm aware it's a dreams but I'm separated like in two people; the one in the dream and the one controlling it who also hates myself. So dreams are always stress dreams hahhh But I only have dreams like 2 or 3 times a month and they're barely rememberable"
837,esfp,"One of my earliest memories is a dream I remember I kept having. Growing up I also had super vivid and colorful dreams, but it also stopped for a while. Then I spent ages trying to lucid dream and when I finally managed my dreams went away again. Now I remember them occasionally, and some nights I know I had a dream but I can’t recall them. 
My SO who is an ISTJ dreams a lot as well, and according to him he only remember snippets of them, sometimes the full dream, but more often just bits and pieces of them."
838,esfp,I would have very intense dreams when I take melatonin. It’s actually pretty cool for me and I end up remembering it the next day. Don’t really have the same intensity of dreams if I don’t take melatonin 
839,esfp,That’s interesting that you tend to dream about things you think about a lot because I tend to dream about things that just cross my mind. I wonder if dreams are attributed to our personality?  I’ve read a fair amount about ESFPs but I haven’t crossed anything about them and dreams.
840,esfp,"Nah, I mean that my dreams aren't that weird or abstract. I've heard a lot of people have wild psychedelic dreams and that's definitely not the case for me, because mine are about relatively normal things. Exciting and adventurous - sure, but no melting clocks or talking clouds lol"
841,esfp,"It's different for everyone, and there is no set recipe for how to do so. I had to work very hard for it and it took me a loooong time, some people just have them naturally (Lucky!). There are a lot of suggestions online on how to do so, but usually it involves doing reality check throughout the day, like I would pinch my nose and try and push air out. When I finally realized I was dreaming, I did the reality check and the air went out my nose even if I was pinching it, which confirmed to me that I was dreaming!"
842,esfp,"21, Female, ESFP. I have a super flirty and open personality. Don't get me wrong, I love being playful and sometimes even talking dirty to people I'm close with. But other times I REALLY just want to be respected! I want to vent, share my feelings, or talk about something I'm excited about! It just infuriates me because people can't separate those feelings! I can't be playful, flirty, or be me without people judging me and treating me like a blowup doll they can use whenever!
Do any of you share this experience? If so, how do you lovely people handle it? I don't really know what to do so I try either avoiding the people or changing the subject. It gets annoying though!"
843,esfp,"If one person is treating you like a blow-up doll, then that person might be a jerk. 
If multiple people are treating you like a blow-up doll, then you're probably advertising yourself to them as a blow-up doll. 
Here's my advice: there's no such thing as innocent dirty talk. It's a coy invitation to the guy to ""play his cards right."" After that, you might as well not even bother trying to talk about yourself. He's just watching your lips move.
Second tip: if you're into a guy (or just boning), DO NOT EVER use him for venting!   You're risking instantly losing his respect, with no benefits. He'll still smash you, but then you instantly become (to him) the girl who has sex with men who don't respect her. It's a catch 22, but an easily avoided one.
This stuff might sound overly harsh, but honestly I wish I had someone explain this stuff to me when I was younger. Good luck."
844,esfp,"One of my friends has the same issue. She's naturally super duper flirty and open with most people, which unfortunately comes across as ""oh she wants to smash"" a lot of the time. As far as I can tell, for her the main thing is to be self aware of how she's coming across especially when she's not into it, and also to preemptively set boundaries and cut things off before they get out of hand. 
No personal experience with your issue here myself unfortunately. I'm a dude so it's much less of problem on this side. "
845,esfp,"Yes, tell them directly. I also agree with SunlightSundae below that it is up to you to set boundaries of appropriate behaviour. You allow them in for sex or not. If you don't want them to view you that way, then don't have sex with them. Perhaps you shouldn't even be so flirtatious with them. The way you treat them will lead them to respond accordingly.
And if you build the appropriate boundaries, demand respect, and they still don't see you for who you are and treat you respectfully, then fuck them. Find better friends.
Good luck!!"
846,esfp,"So esfps are known for easily cutting off people who they've fallen out with, who they've argued with or in some other way annoyed them. 
If you've done this/imagine doing it, what would it take for you to reconsider letting them back into your life?  
Im an infp, I would like the esfp to listen to me and realise the falling out was a mistake and I won't bring them anymore grief. But at the moment they won't reply to my messages where I am explaining myself/apologising a lot.  
Is this out of my control completely and all I can do is wait for them to decide if they want to? Or is there something I could say or do that an esfp would appreciate and be more inclined to listen/forgive. 
Thanks "
847,esfp,"We tend to be quite forgiving. Just be clear that u are sorry about the falling out, then give them some time and space. I know that I personally can't hold grudges for beans, and if I have time to cool down, I can forgive pretty much anything pretty fast. If it's just a falling out, I don't think there will be too much of an issue.  When we leave people, it's usually because we have been physically separated, and I can't interact with them. Since we are very in the moment and focused on what is around us to engage in, it's the distance that causes us to loose interest in friends. As long as u are in a position where u have the opportunity to regularly interact with the ESFP, I would think that it's unlikely that the ESFP will move on. Just wait on this one. If in a week nothing has happened, I would try to just casually say hello (preferably in person) as if nothing happened. Let them know that ur willing to move on. If the safe atmosphere is created, u have a good chance of getting it repaired. Once it's been smoothed over a bit and the air has cleared, if it's important to u, u can discuss the issue. If ur fine with just letting it be and neither of u are bothered by it, then u can just let it slip away into the past. "
848,esfp,"Whoops, old-ass post. Eh, I doubt you'll still find this useful, but if it helps someone else who comes across it in the archive, why not.
So, here it is. 
HOW TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ESFP
Source: I am an ESFP and also I struggled with mental illness for years
Yeah, I can confirm that I've ditched people and dropped off the face of the internet just so that I never have to worry about them again. I'll usually feel weird about it for a bit, but the longer I go without contact, the easier it is to move on. This is both a good and bad thing.
When I become distant to my loved ones, it always means the same thing: I don't feel like the things I say matter. I am an Se, an External Sensor. If I don't see concrete signs that my words and actions mean anything to the other person, I will not believe that I matter, no matter how much I want to believe it. So, I will withdraw, and focus on other things. When I am at my most healthy, I can make myself believe that things are actually fine by looking really deep down (This is our 4th, final function: Ni, Internal Intuition), but this still isn't the ideal environment for me.
When reconciling with an ESFP, lay out your apology very clearly and concisely. Use kind, affirmative language if you can, but being blunt about it is something we can appreciate, too. Varies from ESFP to ESFP. Is there any way that you can express concern non-verbally? Words are important, especially if you don't have access to in-person conversation, where body language is king. 
Long-distance relationships are fundamentally terrible for ESFPs. So, if this was the state of your relationship, the odds are already against you. I'm sorry if this is the case, and if it is, your best chances for making it work are being in the same physical location.
Try not to prioritize WHY you did it when you apologize, that's the tertiary part of the conversation. They're an ESFP, ESFPs love honesty and sincerity, the ESFP will accept your internal reasons for WHY as long as you show them the WHERE, WHEN, and HOW.
Nobody has ever given a simple, clean, and conscientious apology to me. I would be elated if I got one, honestly.
To make it work with an ESFP, you have to boil down the requirements of a relationship to their essentials, and then express those clearly. Abstract expressions of love don't work well with Se types, and the void has to be made up for with something else. 
Unintentional mind games are a great way to drive us literally insane.
I once dated an INTJ guy. 
He was bad at reaffirming affection in conversation, and if I couldn't see him in person often, our relationship could get shaky. How did we make up the difference? Well, he tried by giving me lots of gifts (I appreciated it even if I didn't completely understand the logic behind it), and I tried by initiating tons of sex and cuddle sessions. He was into it, so all was well. Both interactions would lead into better conversation. But, note that he never initiated sex. Not even once. 
Because, to his specific INTJ brain, physical displays of affection were not prioritized as a way of strengthening the relationship, and frank expression of feelings had to be personally prompted by me. I was attracted to his intensity, but it was not a very compatible kind of intensity. I was fine with this when we could be in the same location, and believe me, I loved him a lot, but it fell apart when we had to go long-distance. This is one way an INTJ+ESFP relationship can develop and end.
If I saw that the other person's main motivation for apologizing was ""I want this relationship back"" instead of ""I feel bad for hurting their feelings"", it would be bittersweet for me, at best.
At worst, I'd be offended and I would want to talk to them even less. This is why words are so important, and tone/body language just as much.
I've matured emotionally over the years and I no longer cut people off as much, but I still am willing to do it should the situation be right. 
If it was a sum misunderstanding that came over miscommunication, your ESFP will still feel weird about it for months, maybe years to come. Basically, if you both felt terrible about it, honesty is the best way to heal it. ESFPs aren't vindictive unless you force their hand.
However, if you were a genuine asshole who didn't consider your ESFP's feelings and pushed too far, it's very easy for your ESFP to let go, even if their intuitive core is telling them that they don't want to. 
Talking about my abstract feelings is hard, trying to put them in a form that other people will understand is excruciatingly hard. I am sure that an Ne could explain everything I am saying in 1/10 of the text required, but they would have to rely on other people to fill in the gaps.
This doesn't work with an Se. When I want to talk about my feelings, I will deliberate on absolutely everything, I will leave no emotional stone unturned, because trying to convert a heart into a head is pretty fucking difficult.
This multiplies if I am trying to explain my feelings to a Ne/Ni. Yes, like you, OP. If I can't do this when talking, I'd rather not talk at all. In situations of emotional sincerity, there is little more that pisses me off than other people assuming they know how I'm thinking/feeling, and getting it wrong.
Lashing out at an insecure ESFP is devastating to them, and it can put them in a place where they can only see in Black and White.
Personal experience, my guy. It's hard to forget the things that cut deep.
If your ESFP has resolved to cut you off, give it some time. I mean it. They'll move on and the painful memory will grow more distant to them as they focus on new things. Try to re-establish friendship after you've moved on a bit, too. Try to do it when it doesn't hurt as much.
Okay, here's another personal anecdote. Even after I repaired a past relationship of mine, I still haven't been able to close the wound of one particularly nasty conversation from years ago. I never brought up how this argument still hurts me, even though we're still close friends. I wish I could, but it's the only sort of thing I can bring up in person, not over text. 
See, he's an ENTP.
ENTPs have a similar problem when it comes to text-to-text conversation. Also, the opposite of sensitivity, because blunt criticism in the name of improvement is more valuable than making sure we are on the same emotional page. This bothers me and makes me withdraw when there is nothing to make up for the discrepancy.
Well, right now, it doesn't bother me. Why not?
His pool of concepts to immediately draw upon is much more nuanced than mine, and he's a hell of a force to be reckoned with in an argument. But, I am much better at expanding upon emotions than he is, and I can relate to people in a way that is productive for us both, but only if they let me. I, the ESFP, can amplify creativity in people, and he appreciates this, but it's a cerebral chain of reactions that works best if we're both in the same place. If I tried to analyze it, this post would become twice as long.
Making it work requires extensive, conscientious conversation, and nothing else will do. This prerequisite can be mitigated if I get to casually spend time with him in-person, but I don't have access to that. So, to make our long-distance relationship functional, we constantly debate each other over text. It's not ideal, the both of us would rather be able to spend time together in person, but it works.
Do you see how I had to resort to subtly changing my style of language even when merely describing the problem? This is a fundamental difference between me and him that forces a change of communication to make it work. This is one way an ENTP+ESFP relationship can be put to the test.
I need the other party to understand that NOW is the time for talking about THIS specific thing, not THAT one, and especially not THAT thing that seems to be the correct topic from your perspective, but actually isn't. I reiterate, if you make an Se feel as though they can't get through to you, they'll bounce.
This is what it means to be an Se, someone who lives in the present. It's 100% or 0%. I understand you completely on a level that is almost transcendent, or I don't fuckin' get it at all, come back later with a thesaurus.
So, if you ever find yourself talking with your ESFP again, be sincere and listen to what they're saying. ESFPs have a lot of love inside them that they always want to express, and if they loved you, you still have those things that made them love you. But, we're sensitive, in both the good and bad ways. We can smell anger and fear, and even if we can't explain quite why a situation feels wrong, we can't ignore our gut feelings. That pesky 4th function Ni.
So, be frank and honest. It's just a matter of patience and sincerity. 
Also, what those guys said. Hugs. Hugs are ESFP cocaine."
849,esfp,"^This! And a warm genuine hug! Something about the physical interacting let's me know all is ok. But give the ESFP space.
I don't think we intentionally cut people off. It just happens with distance when they aren't around like ^ said. Because when I see said friend, I'm so happy to see them and it's like yesterday. We're so in the present."
850,esfp,"^ what they said! Let us know how it goes! You guys are such a mystery to us! 
Oh and in person is crucial. A text about how sorry you are means almost nothing. Saying sorry in person, takes effort. Something we need. And hug! Yes hugs. Or some sort of affectionate gesture (hand to the shoulder) we can tell how genuine you are from your body language "
851,esfp,"So for the longest time I thought I was an introverted intuitive. I was painfully shy and awkward in high school and so I spent more time in books and video games. However, recently since I've been in college I started noticing something different about myself. I actually appreciate life more when I'm around other people and that I actually hate reading and analyzing intellectual stuff, it's all rather absurd, but I'd rather just be ""doing stuff"". You know, just stop thinking and just go for it! Working out, eating, going to different parts of town, trying out new clubs. 
So I was wondering, I was born rather outgoing. I loved to sing, dance, call for attention and act out. I was totally hands on guy and I loved the simple things. I've always been rather quirky and ridiculous, loud-mouthed and boisterous. However, I think I turned shy for a long period of time and I didn't have many friends so for years I thought I was introverted. But you know what, even during those years, I think there were times when I unleashed my inner energy and it felt right!
So now I feel like I'm coming home and being more comfortable in being my true MBTI, an ESFP rather than the INFJ I thought that I was. But I'm still not sure whether I'm just imagining all this in my head or I'm trying to emulate ESFP behavior when I'm really INFJ because I do plan ahead A LOT, and I'm constantly thinking about the future and my future plans. But also, I'm happier when I'm just in the flow just doing things. I don't know, what do you guys think?
And how can I be more comfortable in who I am and start being outgoing and hands on and really channel my burning energy inside? "
852,esfp,"Hello! Fellow ESFP here! A couple of things for ya.
1- Have you taken the test? If not take it, if so, take it again at least once and get back to me. 
2- is it more important for you to know, or to understand? 
(yes this will help determine)"
853,esfp,"You sound like an extrovert. It's about preferences and you prefer being extroverted. INFJ is one of the biggest mistypes on here. Don't think ESFPs don't plan ahead, we have to sometimes otherwise our lives would be in shambles. But take the test again and see what you get.
As for being comfortable you just have to do it. Just talk to people. It gets easier as you get older and stop caring what people think."
854,esfp,There's nothing wrong with planning ahead. A balanced person will have a balanced way of using their different functions! Planning ahead is important. I do it. But I can't do it constantly or I get really stressed out. Make sure to take the text when you're completely comfortable and content. :)
855,esfp,"Hey ESFP's, I just met an amazing ESFP. I'm INFP, and while I know we are not the most compatible, I still want to see if we can make it work. So the only issue I have is her obvious superficial sense (I love everything else about her) I want to somehow discuss that with her, but without hurting her. I realize ESFP can be really sensitive to criticism, so how do I jump into this topic in the most delicate way possible?"
856,esfp,In what way is her superficial sense an issue? I'm an esfp female myself and highly sensitive to criticism (it can be even the smallest thing!) so I'm trying to consider how I would handle it myself :-) 
857,esfp,"Absolutely no promises on this, but what about approaching the situation with curiosity? You've mentioned that you won't actively bring it up, but if she mentions how much makeup she wears you could try, 'hey yeah, I have noticed that. It surprised me a bit since some girls who wear a lot of makeup can be so vain, but you've never seemed that way. What drives you get all dressed up so often?'
You may learn something important about her, without offending her."
858,esfp,"Well..that is some very good advice so thank you :) I've noticed she does know when she's blind though. Like she will say things like wow so are so awkward, or how are you so white when the rest of your family is tan. But then she will apologize right after, it doesn't bother me though, so I try and reassure her she doesn't need to be sorry."
859,esfp,"It's more or a less a personal conviction. I'm Christian (she is too), so I don't agree with vanity in general (but still think one should look respectable). Hence typically for me, lots of make up is a turn off. "
860,esfp,"OK yes fair point. But because I am infp I tend to think long term. I'm not talking about bringing it up in the near future, just whenever it happens to come into conversation, I want her to know how I feel about it. "
861,esfp,"You know what? This is pretty much exactly what happened recently (on third date). She brought it up herself. Then I made a comment on why she still dresses fairly modest and yet wears make up. She explained that all of it wasn't to show off or anything but simply a comfort level thing. (She was bullied when she was younger about it). Unfortunately, while we had a good conversation that night, I also found out she has a bf that she doesn't like talking about. Not sure why she is still ok going on dates with me then...anyway."
862,esfp,Wearing make up to make yourself look more attractive isn't necessarily demonstrating vanity.  It could also be a strategy for attracting more mates and thus increasing one's likelihood of reproducing.  Unless she is doing it so she can admire herself in a mirror or something.
863,esfp,"Why do you want her to know? Just so you can get it off your chest? There's no reason to let her know other than your own desire to assert your opinion.
If someone even suggested that I was superficial there is no way I would not take it as an insult. My first thought would be, why is this person telling me this? And I could think of no other reason than, they are insulting me. Because that would be the normal response. They certainly aren't complimenting me or giving me constructive criticism."
864,esfp,"ok perhaps vanity was not quite the expression I meant to use in this case.   
See that's part of what I don't like, I want my attraction to be genuine, not based on a fabricated reality. "
865,esfp,"I think you are right, I've been thinking about it. I won't try and bring it up. But if it does happen to come into conversation somehow I will explain my feelings in a different way rather then bluntly saying I disagree with it. "
866,esfp,"Yea sorry I kinda split threads there a bit.  I mean a person may feel sexy, excited, confident putting on makeup and thus they are driven by these emotions to put the makeup on.  They are not most likely analyzing the decision based on moral value or considering the implications of wearing makeup.  In this way perhaps their emotions were caused and driven by a behavioral evolutionary mechanism - to attract and reproduce.  "
867,esfp,"ok yes, I can see how this might be the case. Something I forgot to take into account. I think S dominant types have a tendency to live in the moment. Where as N types like me are more future oriented. So if one doesn't spend much time thinking about the future, I can see how actions like that would fall into the realm of semi subconscious thinking. But I suppose that was also part of my motivation in bringing up the subject to her, to get her thinking about it, to see where her morals actually stand."
868,esfp,Yea definitely!  Se primary is very in the moment and not super future oriented from what I've found.  I don't think most people have values or principles they follow through on.  I admire people who do.
869,esfp,"I love reading! I've read something from almost every genre, but I have a soft spot for fantasy and historical fiction. Recent favorites include all of Terry Pratchett's works, mainly Discworld, and Game of Thrones."
870,esfp,"I’ve read and enjoyed books in many categories and genres! My favorites are sappy romance novels, coming of age stories, mental health related stories, mystery, and murder mysteries. Haven’t read much sci fi though. 
These days I’m reading a young adult novel that hits close to home culturally called The Book of Unknown Americans by Christina Enriquez. I’m trying to make it a point to actually finish more books though. "
871,esfp,"Anyone else read the Game of Thrones series so far?  It definitely is my favorite series of books (started them because I was bored at work after season three ended) but it makes me laugh how people obsess over it.  Like it'll get finished or it won't, it has nothing to do with you.  I'd rather be surprised to find out it's coming out soon than worry about when it's coming out.  And I guess that leads me to wonder if you guys idolize other people like some other types do?  I don't think I can feel the attraction to famous people like others do, anyone else feel like ""famous"" people are typically just normal people you can chill with, that have to deal with fanatics (yea I guess fanatic is the perfect word).  I don't think I could be a fanatic, and this has gone to long, my dog has actually laid down to wait for me to walk her instead of guilty tripping me into walking her, oh shit that's a different thread lol I'm drunk."
872,esfp,"Constantly...I love using my imagination, and books give me free reign to create a world, so in my head it plays out a lot like an amazing movie.
I read mostly sci-fi, some fiction, some horror, some mystery, a little bit of fantasy.  "
873,esfp,"Nah but for real my favourite type is a good period drama (Memoirs of a Geisha, stories taking place in Victorian or Edwardian Canada, New England, England, WWII) or books about whimsical imaginative heroines such as the Anne of Green Gables series."
874,esfp,"Hi Everyone, we have created a whatsapp group for Extroverts. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Feelers/Thinkers but majority are females. Feel free to join. We keep the party going!

875,esfp,"Hi ENFP male here been talking to this lovely ESFP girl as of late but I can't express this cauldron of emotions I'm experiencing to her in the articular manner I was before knowing about her personal life. 
We were talking real dirty and then she opened up to me and now I just feel all soft and shit and wanna keep sweet talking her instead cause I feel like I care about her now as a person but obviously this is killing that primal flame between us. 
She's been pretty patient with me for the most part but I really wanna treat her like the naughty little thing she is , it's her kink.
ESFP females, what do i do ? pls help me lol, I'm emotionally spazing out and i can't think straight 😂"
876,esfp,"I really don't know. I don't much care for people who center their behavior around me. It feels constricting. Focus on yourself. Sure, show interest, but I tend to be attracted to men who know their value. Also, I am definitely NOT romantic, and I find sweet-talk off-putting. That does not mean that every ESFP is the same, however.
The way people who were attractive before stop being attractive is by re-centering their world around me, instead of themselves."
877,esfp,"Definitely along the same vein as u/horrorito!
Female ESFP here. The men I'm most attracted to are the ones who know what they want and aren't impressionable by me or anyone. Same deal with being almost instantly turned off if a guy puts me on a pedestal and tailors their behavior to make me happy.
I don't know if this applies to all ESFPs but I'm really good at reading when people are insincere or their actions are calculated for some kind of return later - i.e. sex! As soon as that happens, I lose complete interest. If you were attractive to me before then you have no reason to start calculating extra shit! I will definitely get wild and dirty on you. :)
I hope this helps... best of luck!"
878,esfp,"So I met my colleague when I started my new job about a year ago. We became friends quickly, although we took longer to become close friends. I'm ENFP, he's ESFP. Basically we started hooking up together really gradually - probably a bad idea because we work together, but it seems to suit us. He always told me he doesn't want a relationship, and I've never tried to change his mind on this. But recently, he's been ignoring me a little bit and acting withdrawn, as if our friendship doesn't matter to him, when it's always seemed to matter hugely in the past. He's always been really private, so I know there's no point asking him to explain what's going on. But basically, I don't understand why it is he doesn't want a relationship when we get on so well as friends as well as, y'know, the other stuff. Also, why the brush-off? Am I just too needy? Wondering if I should just break it off... Jeez. I wasn't expecting to get upset over all this, but well, I actually kind of am. Any advice or potential explanations very welcome.  "
879,esfp,"I dip and dive into and out of close friendships, sometimes with almost no reason at all. Normally my focus has changed or someone was interesting and I wanted to be part of something interesting. If care about a friend though i wont ever leave ill just have periods of downtime. Basically he might come back and things will resume or they might not. As always though, be interesting and look interesting.
Also some decent comments from other ppl as well here and there are a lot more post like yours so go read them on here. "
880,esfp,"My guess: He's probably trying to distance himself and you from each other, since it sounds like you've had the ""do we want to be in a relationship?"" talk in the past and his takeaway was ""no."" And now that you're showing signs of wanting to push it further, even though you guys had a discussion on it already, he's withdrawing from you because it makes him uncomfortable. 
Side note, just because you're good as friends and you're good as hookup buddies does not necessarily mean you're going to be good in a stable long term relationship. "
881,esfp,"Sounds like he's over it. I know those feels suck...but if ever someone just wants to hook up and doesn't really give af about a relationship or wants to hide it from everyone....just run the other way. By him distancing himself he has already broken it off with you.
No matter how many times I told myself in the past ""Sure we can be FWB! That'll work!"" i always get attached and sad when I'm the one getting ""broken up"" with or distanced or whatever you wanna call it. My advice is delete him from your phone and say F it basically. Do not give him another chance. He will prolly come back around to you if no one else is giving him attention or he hasn't gotten any in a while....but that's all he wants. Doesn't give af about your feelings and he's already prolly found someone else.
Harsh reality I've had to deal with time and time again. I have learned my lesson this time, but it took many years and many mistakes."
882,esfp,"So i used to date this girl a couple years ago and it was incredible but being an entp i managed to create way to much conflict and fucked the relationship. I got back in contact with her and i am crazy about her again. Do you have any advice or experience dating an entp and it working. 
How do i please you people? 
Thank you in advance."
883,esfp,"My personality is a bit of a tricky thing since I have a personality disorder. Other than that I'm a faithful person that isn't exactly religious.
 I can have high expectations or imagination for certain things I dream about. I know I want my own practice as a social worker but that's my dream only because it's the most logical step for me. 
Another dream of mine is to move away from my abusive mother, how ever that may just be a high expectation since I'm disabled but living in an expensive city. I can be pessimistic. I am usually really loving and generous with my affection. I think I'm progressive for the most part in my other ideals but some parts of me are very traditional.
I like to do things by the book only because I don't want to fuck up. I'll follow directions if they work instead of trying to forge my own path. 
Some times I get worried by not trying to experience pleasure to the best of my abilities all the time. I'm scared if wasting my time to be happy so I look for any chance to indulge. I don't want to go through life missing out on gun that I could be having you know?"
884,esfp,"Hi I'm a INTP (90/75/65/80%) and I've liked an ESFP (was ESFP most likely still is) girl for over a year now. And WOW the mixed signals you people send a rediculos amount of mixed signals! Please stop! And help me disect this! 
So like I said I started liking her a year ago during a school trip, and through out this trip we got the ""you would b such a cute couple"" at LEAST 3 times a day,from different people(one being her close friends and one being her family member) and ended up getting pretty close the last thing she said to me on this trip was ""hey don't think I'm going to stop bugging you once we get home"". 
Once the trip ended we kept talking, when we met in the halls and in class since she's in a grade ahead of me we only had one class a week together (this year one class a day) and basicly we stayed in touch and I even heard whispers from some of her closest friends that she liked me. Anyway after a while I don't even know what happend well I kinda do I think.... But we just stopped talking and it was almost like she was avoiding me. Like I would be walking down the hall she would be walking my direction see me and would full on pivot and walk away... 
Things have started to get better again (took long enough) but now when we see eachother she starts smiling and saying hello. But the only time she ever has a full on deep conversation with me now is if she's not with her friends and I'm not with mine, ya I get she might not want to talk to me when I'm in a conversation with a group of my friends... But befor she would always talk to me when she was with her friends, well not always but very often.
Anyway like I said we have a class together this semester and she totally acknowledges I'm there... I've even caught her staring/ glancing at me a couple of times. But I don't get what the heck is going on!! I'm fairly positive she dosent like me anymore (not even positive she liked me in the first place, she's way out of my league) infact, never mind that's a story for another day. 
I just need help knowing what to do I'm super scared and I don't know what to say or do(INTP). I don't even know how to explain it like seriously I don't know what to type out! Help me please!"
885,esfp,"If anything we're very much not about mixed signals. If she was into you before, she's not into you anymore. She'll want to spend time with you, be around you, and most importantly actually talk to you if she was still interested in being friends and/or more. Rule of thumb is if you do something bad enough to get consciously and purposefully cut off by an ESFP, you're done until they decide they've forgiven you and are ready to restart things.  "

887,esfp,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESFP personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
888,esfp,"Our thoughts are deeper than most, because we only think about things that matter. 
We love people, because people are more important than most of the other nonsense that goes on in the world. 
We treat others with great respect, because they are people, and they deserve it. 
We like to do things, many things, and we may be hard to keep up with, or uncomfortable if you like doing nothing.
We are usually very positive.
We may affirm you, ALOT."
889,esfp,"I have a habit of semi-flirting with pretty much everyone, male and female. I have had more people than I can count take that as actual interest. My problem is that even when they ask me out and I politely refuse, I don't stop flirting. It's instinctual. :(
I've caused some problems and lost many friends this way. Luckily it's getting better as I get older."
890,esfp,"A lot of people would consider it 'flirting', but I just consider my personal interactions with other people as 'friendly'. I suppose it's just my way of making everyone I meet comfortable in a conversation. 
When people start to take me more seriously, I usually try to drive the conversation back to the fun and casual state. But if the person intended to have a serious conversation, I can flip a switch that casts aside the frequent jokes and sarcasm that makes me an ESFP"
891,esfp,"Thanks for sharing. This really helps me. It exactly describes the situation I'm in--I know this guy isn't really interested in me, but his hardcore flirting (touching, compliments, sexual innuendo, but not backed up by any real action and punctuated by polite brushoffs) is hard to resist/ignore. 
Frankly, sometimes I just want to punch him. :)"
892,esfp,"Asked this is in the /r/mbti group, but, I wanna know what my fellow ESFPs go for! 
For me, I've got a major thing for xSTPs and xNTPs! Love their sort of cut-throat, insensitive front but how gentle, kind and generous they can be (or at least all the xSTPs and xNTPs that I've met hahaha)."
893,esfp,"I'm an INTP and have a fondness for ESFPs. 
The best relationship I've ever had was with an ESFP so I'm basing it on that. She just understood and accepted my nature, and was so attentive and affectionate towards me, like I've never had before. 
I think I could be with an ESFP forever, but I'd need other outlets for talking about things I don't think ESFPs are too interested in. Like philosophy and the deeper meaning of things. At least the ESFP I dated wouldn't even go down such avenues of discussion, and those are the only areas of discussion I find any true meaning in."
894,esfp,I'm always the one to plan get togethers and I always run into someone else I know while we are out and they join us. I talk to everyone and make jokes constantly. Gotta make sure everyone is having a fun time. 
895,esfp,"Definitely true. I'm always embarrassing myself to make people laugh. I'm always the one that's always very ""interesting/special"" and I always start the inside jokes within the friend group. It brings some life to the group."
896,esfp,"I'm actually one of TWO entertainers in my friend group. We don't butt heads though, because we each have our niche. He is the goofy and corny entertainer, I'm the sarcastic and edgy entertainer. 
Although, I haven't the slightest clue as to what his MBTI is. It's possible that he is an ESFP too, but we are different sub-types. I haven't gotten into sub-types much yet, because I'm sort of a newbie. "
897,esfp,Not gonna lie y'all take a ton of selfies. Is there a reason for this? I just don't get it. I mean if you're looking good sure but these people who post just a random resting face pic on instagram? I have no problem with it cuz ESFPs are usually hot but please explain. It can't just be vanity because I'm easily as vain.
898,esfp,"I would never take selfie that doesn't include friends, or some activity I'm enjoying in the background; that I wish other people were enjoying with me.  While we do always take pride in how we look, I would say most of us don't like presenting ourselves as better than others so selfies only feel comfortable amongst closer friends. I know personally I feel self-conscious about presenting myself in anyway thru selfies/sensitive meme subjects on a large platform, because I have no way analyze people's true reactions and it drives me crazy not knowing what some people will think even though I don't care what people think.  At that point trying to guess how i will be perceived, by everyone I intended to see that picture, thru that picture becomes too burdensome to even decide on a selfie pose without getting bored(though if someone has figured out how to take pictures of yourself that you like, let me know, because I do find myself starting to want to post lots of things to social media (mainly to connect with friends  that aren't near me I miss  but forget about) but then having the whole perception thoughts, I'm off topic, oops).  Personally attention thru social media feels too fake and doesn't provide the necessary human interaction/contact I crave (rather be complemented in person so I know it's genuine) so personally I get bored with the idea of taking a selfie.  Although I will say if an ESFP does take lots of selfies they are probably all fantastic because if we do share something we expect everyone we shared it with to like it.  Sorry that response got long, but had thoughts coming from all angles all day on this one and actually drank enough this evening to not get bored with a long winded response that I know probably doesn't make any sense, because nothing ever makes complete sense so just enjoy what you've got working for ya 😉.  "
899,esfp,"I despise selfies unless it's a really special moment that I want to capture with my friends. I get tired of seeing everyone that I am friends with on social media posting pictures of themselves, and giving me long speeches about why they should love themselves. They should practice loving themselves without likes. Plus, 75% of selfies have people making the dumbest faces. I swear, some people look possessed. It used to be fun to play the ""what is this person thinking or experiencing"" game based off of their facial expression, but now it's just stupid."
900,esfp,I rarely take selfies. That's because cameras can sometimes lie; there were times when I took a selfie and somehow I look fatter or skinnier on the picture than I actually am. Or my face can sometimes look oilier or drier than it actually is. I really hate that. 
901,esfp,"This exactly 👆 I love looking at myself in a mirror or messing with snap features, it's just I never actually feel the need to share it with people because I don't care about looking at other people's selfies and I can see how it would come off as annoying to post pictures of ourselves all the time.  Plus we aren't typically needy people."
902,esfp,"I figured it out an hour ago, it's instant gratification.  Fuck if I'm not guaranteed some sort of response for my actions.  ^^^ I start feeling (dammit wtf) why do I need a response even though this is Reddit and I didn't expect one when I wrote that."
903,esfp,"As a slightly drunk ENTP. You guys are fucking great. My best mate is an ESFP and me and him are the best buds. I wish everyone was as spontaneous and happy as you guys and you always find a way to lift my spirits. 
Lots of love and happinessss
An ENTP who's Fe comes out big time when he drinks.z"
904,esfp,"I know right ? I've been spamming my friends with pics from there for the last 3 weeks. The crocheted baby is my favorite post from there, and one of my favorite internet pictures of all time <3 <3 <3"
905,esfp,"I was wondering if you guys play computer/video games, and if so, what kinds of games do you play? I find it funny to compare the games I enjoy to those my fiance plays (INTJ :P)
I tend to enjoy creative platform games the most, like the Wii Boy and his Blob or Donkey Kong."
906,esfp,"I like games that don't require a full on commitment to play/beat. I like to be able to pick up and play a game and be done later that day. I don't often beat games with story modes because I just can't commit to it. I'm not sure this is an ESFP thing or just me. 
Games that really suit me are games like Mario Party and Civ something I can start and finish in one sitting"
907,esfp,wow!! its so amazing that you have the same type of fiance as my boyfriend. I was thinking that we were doomed to break up because of how opposite we were. I am glad to here a success story. lol. He loves to stay in. I love to go out. it kind of makes it hard to do stuff. though I am glad to just spend time with someone. I HATE being along. its so bad. I get bored and movies are so not entertaining after 5 hours. so I tend to go out as much as I can. I call them dates. he calls them torture. 
908,esfp,"My boyfriend and I play FF14 together. We both like videogames, but it's interesting how differently we will play the same game. He is ESFP and he makes a lot of friends in-game and can easily find parties to join. I prefer to play solo unless he drags me into a party. He's usually some sort of tank, and I'm usually ranged. Huge differences, but it all works out."
909,esfp,"This is fascinating! I'm a deffinate ESFP, and I do often find myself only playing for a short-ish period of time, but I also love Fallout and Elder scrolls, creating a character I want to give character developement and perfecting their look. I then find myself playing for hours! Is this normal? Do I play for that long because I'm pushing myself (these being my favourite games by far). Questions questions..."
910,esfp,"Haha, we are definitely a success story. We were a little shocked when I found my type and it was the complete opposite, but we have been together over 7 years. 
It is important that you feel alright going out without him, and that he is ok with that too. Sometimes I will be excited to go to a dinner or a party with my fiance, and he's just not feeling it that night. We've been together long enough that I'm bummed for a moment, but overall happy that he's fine with me going out by myself and we can both enjoy ourselves. I think its important to expect them to want to hang around home sometimes, so that they don't feel pressured to always go out with you, and you don't feel let down that they don't want to. It seems like you know already, but it's also important to recognize that they might not want to be somewhere, and express appreciation that they are doing it for you.
In most other ways, we get along perfectly. I might be a bit logical for a ESFP, though. OH! You should read this!! I HIGHLY suggest it. http://intjadvice.tumblr.com/"
911,esfp,"oh wow thanks! and its a good tumbler! i love it and thank you for the advise. I am bumed out that he would rather stay at home then go out with me but I have come to terms with it.
I also work mornings and he works 6-6 3 -4 days a week. so we each get our good share of alone time. and even though it only been about 6 months now I can see us being together for a long time [hopefully mariage but I am getting ahead of myself lol]
I was scared for us for the longest time because about 2 weeks into the relationship I lost my apartment and had to move out and he asked me to live with him. well its been amazing so far but i am scared that we really rushed things and the next step is to....what? lol I think we needed the space of work to try and get to a normal grounds. 
also, he does not believe in ""love"" he calls it a delusion and he believes that you can have more then one ""perfect match"" and I dont disagree with that last part. see me being all ""feelings"" does not help with that. I believe love is real, he tells me he loves me and he crys for me when I am having a mood lol, and its adorable and it makes me believe that he is truly trying to let his INTJ wall down. cause they all have emotional walls. 
but I totally love the blog all the anon questions are very intriging and answeres some of the many questions I have about him and i have been on INTJforms and alot of them are describing that there are many chances that me and hiim will work out together. 
but personalitys aside. I have major trust issues, so thats a big thing that I need to work on. its been good so far though. before I was way worse and always on his case about where he was going. but after all these months of him showing he will always be there for me and him telling me over and over again it was hard enough work to get me to be with him lol becaue of his introvert persona he dislikes talking to many people. so him coming to me was a big step for him haha "

913,esfp,"I honestly don’t mind it. I’m not going out of my way to be alone, and I’d much rather not be, but if I absolutely have to be alone in my room all day because no one is available or some other circumstance is preventing me from going out, I don’t mind it.
I’m not the kind of person who goes outside to play sports or wanders around the house aimlessly or ‘ADHD-ishly.’ I don’t get restless when I’m alone. I don’t mind just relaxing in bed watching funny vines or interesting YouTube videos. I stay in one spot doing things on my phone or computer and the time just flies right by. If I don’t have any internet or any computer/phone, I will sleep the day away, also killing time because I would get super bored if I had to stay awake the whole day doing nothing in a room. 
I have to admit though, as much as I don’t mind being alone for long periods of time, it makes me a bit feel groggy and unaccomplished and sometimes irritable. It’s easy to forget about it when I’m laying around playing fortnite or something, but when I get back out there it’s like “damn I missed so much” and my head feels cloudy. This actually might be unrelated to this topic all together and it’s happening because I’m staying in one place for a long time and I’m just making a foolish mess out of myself, but whatever, I’m just sharing this to see if any ESFPs or any other type for that matter experiences this too. 
On the other hand though, when I’m spending the day with my friends and riding around in the car and doing stuff, I don’t feel cloudy and weighed down like I do when I step out of my room after being alone for a day. I feel much clearer and less like a fat slob. Like I said, probably completely unrelated to mbti but I just felt the need to share this.
What are your thoughts?"
914,esfp,"Yes, exactly the same for me. I dont mind entertaining myself at all, but over the course of a day or two I feel off somehow. I'm glad you posted this because I always see people thinking ESFPs can't stand time alone. "
915,esfp,"A bit late to the thread haha, but absolutely, I can relate to everything except that I do get restless if I find myself lazing around too much, and I get an urge to put myself in a different environment, so I usually go for a walk. I definitely appreciate being alone and the serenity in it, but I definitely feel happier and more energized when I've spent time with friends."
916,esfp,"I can relate to this, but I'm INTJ. Maybe that doesn't have to do with MBTI. If I spend too much time, like max 2 days, outside the comfort of my personal space, I get stressed and I need to stop everything I'm doing and just go home and not talk or see anyone for at least a day."
917,esfp,"ESFP here. Whether related to mbti or not, I can definitely identify with this. There’s a fine line for me on having alone time. After a certain point (usually a day max), I go from feeling reenergized to feeling isolated and lonely. If I’m in a “mindful” headspace, I can usually sense a weird gut feeling telling me to get out of my apartment ASAP. If there’s no one to hang out with, I’ll take a walk outside and even that alone does wonders!"

Set high standards for myself and those around me, hate mediocrity
Conflict-averse(might have more to do with my upbringing), but never kiss ass or hesitate to disagree with someone
Never been into sports or cared about winning in sports, otherwise pretty competitive
To the point, hate people who ramble instead of saying exactly what they mean, see rambling as an intellectual weakness

Despite that I've grown tired of debating politics, religion and philosophy, see it as pointless and not satisfying
Optimistic

Went from ENTP to ESTP and now I'm wondering if ESFP sounds more like my type lol What do yall think?"
919,esfp,"If I see that a person is coming from a negative place I distance myself from whatever they say right off the bat, its something I've consciously developed, criticism used to get to me a lot more when I was younger. Constantly trying to impress other people sounds relatable lol"
920,esfp,"For me, I don’t see a point unless it’s something I have a very strong opinion about - I don’t go and jump into arguments/debates with people just for the fun of it (this would be an ENTP trait I think)"
921,esfp,"Yes :|
Everytime someone uses one, I think, ""How is that easier to understand than just saying it directly?""
I don't have many issues understanding them... I just think getting to the point is more efficient and less distracting."
922,esfp,"I partially agree with u/chill_monkey ... it depends on the quality of the metaphor, but I feel like they can add a lot to the discussion because there is so much underlying information that can be inferred by the metaphor chosen.
For example, with your ESFP metaphor - I feel like you see ESFPs in such a positive light.  You succinctly explain the how the functions work together to guide an ESFP’s actions but using the metaphor of a captain and a ship, I feel like you see ESFPs as these free-spirited, curiosity-driven explorers who crave adventure, new lands, and challenges to overcome.  I feel like you are slightly jealous of our ability to charge into unknown waters and perhaps romanticize our adventurous spirits.  Your metaphor is so much more complimentary and meaningful than just generally stating that: ESFPs are fun.
Edit: Then again, I could just be misinterpreting the metaphor all-together.  You may just really like ships.  And not kinder egg toys. XD"
923,esfp,"The second one is accurate at least. Can't deny that. However a large part of me (the lazy side, as it turns out) doesn't want to think about something so pointless when you could just like say the thing (logic decreased: now at 13)."
924,esfp,"All of those actually.
Like u/uterus_at_capacity my INFJ wife will use metaphors frequently to try to explain concepts that have a lot more shades of gray to them than I can grasp, often fairly longwindedly, sometimes seemingly circular logic (to me anyway), so I restate things in my own, more concrete, terms to make sure i grasped the particular concept she’s discussing at the moment, she verifies, and we continue, but it takes a little more back and forth."
925,esfp,"Hi! Female INTP here.
I’m in need of advice. I’ve been working closely with an ESFP for more than 15 years. Of everyone on our team, she’s the one who I’ve never been able to click with. It makes me sad because I admire her and hate feeling tension around other people.
We’re a similar age, and met in our mid teens (both early 30s now). 
All I want is to understand how to interact with her. But it seems like every time I see her she shows a new face. Some weeks she’ll seem eager to talk and be friends, other times I feel like I’m being bullied and ignored in favour of the cool kids. Some weeks she’ll be aggressively show-offy; other weeks I can tell her walls have lowered and she wants emotional support or connection.
I am sure that she’s deeply sensitive. She had issues with her weight and looks growing up which she’s overcome but still seem triggering to her. She can get really angry at work superiors, but it’s usually when she feels an injustice. It hurts me to witness that, because it seems like she ignores other people’s feelings and just assumes the worst in their motivations. I wonder if that’s what’s happening between her and me.
This sounds cocky, but I do wonder sometimes if part of our issue is that she’s jealous. If she feels like we’re getting too equal, it’s like she has to lash out and destroy the equilibrium again.
In the past she’s been nicest to me when I’ve expressed genuine admiration of her. But she seems to have an internal idea of exactly how much praise she requires, because too much or too little and she’s back to being mistrusting of me.
Do any of you identify with this? How can I find a way of working together that doesn’t feel like I’m being gaslighted half the time? Quitting isn’t an option- it’s our dream job. I don’t care if we’re friends or enemies or have an unspoken agreement to not talk unless our job requires us to.... it’s the not knowing that is hard.  
I’m willing to say what I’ve just written to her... but I just have zero idea if it would help or hurt."
926,esfp,"I don't get along with INTPs, even tho my brother and main coworker are both INTP. 
I find them both extremely condescending and state the obvious while also having pretty big superiority complexes. 
Neither respond to my social interactions in the way other people would, sometime I think it's intentional but lately I'm starting to think they really just lack the social skill. 
I don't feel like they actually listen to what I say, they just listen enough to respond and they don't respond to additional statements of mine. It's like I'm trying to have a discussion while they are just trying to confirm their initial statement and won't budge. 
They never want to talk about the things I want to talk about, so they always dominate the conversation topics. Which is so annoying, there's only so much fantasy bullshit I can talk about. 
Also both are terrible at giving advice. If I ask ""what's your opinion? Do you think I should go to Denver or salt lake for vacation?"" They would ALWAYS say ""do whatever you want, doesn't matter to me, I don't care""
They are apathetic to a fault, and don't even fake being interested in me, while I constantly have to fake being interested in them to even have civil dialogue. 
When I do decide to play the part and talk about their interests we get along fine, but it takes its toll over time. 
Try going out of your way to show appreciation, a surprise goes a long way, only one time I've been given a surprise gift by my coworker- a bag of snickers. Generosity is one of my strengths so I regularly bring in food for the office or will bring an extra coffee for the INTP coworker, but it's never reciprocated. Usually I chalk it up to the ""missing social queues"" thing I mentioned earlier. 
This is just my experience hope it gives some insight "
927,esfp,"Sounds like the coworker you are dealing with is a petty, immature version of an ESFP. ESFP's are notorious for not getting along with those who are vastly different than them. You are almost a opposite, but that doesn't completely determine who you will click with. I am an ESFP and I click very well with two particular INTJ's. I think that she is deeply sensitive (as I am) and instead of trying to fix that by learning to love herself, she is trying to fix it by making other feels inferior. ESFP's feel very much, and they can have crazy mood swings, but mature ones have learned to control it. You seem like a very nice and understanding person, but some people you just can never please. I don't know if you can really help her, maybe its only her that can change her attitude. "
928,esfp,"Wow, you just described the ESFP I worked with.  I had to quit the job, she was also our dept bully.  A few months later, they finally fired her.  She would get extremely jealous and then bully the people who she was jealous of (I was the one she disliked the most, but she basically did it to everyone in our dept and one point or another, he favorite was to try to bully other people into doing her work, I would shove it right back at her and she didn't like that).  She was really bad at her job and the only reason she stuck around so long, was bc she was chummy with our supervisor. Once our supervisor left, there was nobody to cover all of her mistakes anymore and of course the rest of the employees were so ticked off at her behavior and arrogance, they wouldn't help her, so she sunk like a rock.  A trail of documentation was started.  What's interesting is that instead of realizing that she better straighten up, all she did was point the finger at other people.  She was up in HR each week filing complaints about her other coworkers, so then on top of being incompetent, she also became an active trouble maker too and of course nobody liked her.  
I have no advice, but TONS of commiseration.  This esfp single handedly destroyed an entire dept (only one person left out of eight and it's bc that person is only a couple yrs from retirement, this was in a matter of a year and a half, more than half who left stated that the ESFP was the reason why they left, yet they did nothing).  She created a toxic work environment where she felt that everything should be catered to her needs and her feelings.  And no, she was not a supervisor, she was a peer.  It was basically like being in an emotionally abusive relationship, she felt at liberty to lash out and anyone and everyone and if anyone even looked at her funny, she'd report them to HR."
929,esfp,"This is really insightful, thank you. Thanks for being so blunt. As an INTP I really want to get along with other people, and all the INTPs I know are gentle and sweet inside, but yes I can totally see how you feel that way. It’s good to get honesty. xx
For me having a conversation about specific stuff or bantering is really difficult and exhausting. Talking about theory on the other hand is easy and pleasurable. I’m going to take your comment to heart and keep working on being a better listener and reading conversation cues and not falling back on what’s easy for me. 
In defence of the INTPs in your life, we deeply value independence, social space, and keeping options open. Telling you to ‘do what you want’ is us being kind and treating you how we want to be treated. 
Thank you again! You’re a legend for taking the time to share. "
930,esfp,"Thank you so much for your reply and your perspective. 
Things already seem to be getting better since I asked this question. It’s made me look at my own actions and question what I’ve been doing. I’ve realised how selfish I have been with conversation topics. I get pleasure from deep discussions, but I’m finally understanding that some people really don’t enjoy them. 
When we last caught up things were amazing. We cried and hugged by the end. I pulled my own head out of my arse and really worked at engaging in ways that would make us both feel good, not just me. Keeping things fun and in the moment and spontaneous and genuine.
I know she can still hurt me but I’m going to work harder at not showing the side of me that she finds threatening. At demonstrating more thoughtfulness towards her."
931,esfp,"That's really good. I personally like to have deep discussions, but many of my type do not. It shows very good character that you are trying your best to get along with everyone. I hope both you and her will continue to have a good friendship and grow as people! :)"
932,esfp,"My fiancé is an INTP, and he sometimes worries too much or gets angry when things don't go the way he planned. His pastimes are researching online about his hobbies, but never really doing anything about them, and he doesn't like to go out with anyone but me"
933,esfp,"Half of my siblings and most of my friends are thinkers. My boyfriend is a thinker. One of my sisters and my dad are ENTJs and there is a noticeable disconnect when trying to communicate on a deep level, but I've been able to connect with my sister through a lot of effort and time together. My dad maybe not as much, but that might change. :D
I adore all of them and they're all open-minded about my sensing and emotion expressiveness. I've noticed that I get along well with INTJs and ISTPs."
934,esfp,"ESFP female here...Most of the men in my life happen to be either INTJs or INFJs... I'm not sure if that's because from a friendship and romance level I'm always drawn towards people of the opposite sex that balance me out persinality wise, or if I just enjoy the back and forth our conversations always take. They NEVER bore me. Because we approach most topics from very different perspectives, discussions are always lively and I always feel a 'buzz' when we're done.
Conflicts can arise when I forget their need for solitude and a 'recharge' period or when they forget my need to socialize. I've also noticed that just as I hate being asked to justify a statement Ive made based on a gut feeling, they hate being questioned on things they've taken the time to study and research.
With any relationship, regardless of personality type, you just need to be cognizant of other people's feelings on certain things and don't be a general asshole to each other."
935,esfp,"I'm an ENTP so I'm curious what you consider the noticable disconnect? (I think my (too young to really ""tell"") daughter is likely an ESFP so I'm especially curious :)"
936,esfp,"Here's a picture/gif of a cat, hopefully it'll cheer you up :).

I am a bot. use !unsubscribetosadcat for me to ignore you."
937,esfp,"Yes, but I can't assume he knows what's feeling or what I want. I was never one to do that, though, because I like being straightforward with my emotions. That being said, when I tell him I'm sad, angry or frustrated, he understands and does whatever he can to make me feel better "
938,esfp,"Specifically, I'll be trying to express something and they don't know how to interpret it, so they often misunderstand what I say. That has caused a lot of unnecessary tension. ENTJs don't know how to deal with my emotions either, so I can feel pretty misunderstood. :/ But like I said, effort and patience can help both sides understand. I'm so much closer to my ENTJ sister now than when we were kids.
Now my experience with ENTPs is a little different. The only issue I've had with them is the overwhelming extroverted intuition. Too much of that is exhausting and can put me in a bad mood. In short, don't think out loud too much in an abstract way. I'm sure you know this, but abstract just means anything that isn't straight forward. For example, I get annoyed by a lot of metaphors. They're like speed bumps on the road of thinking (I hope you can appreciate my poor attempt at a metaphor! I've been practicing)"
939,esfp,"Whenever something goes wrong in the day, it will ruin the rest of her day and she'll like start worrying about other things that weren't even related to her current problem. I have to choose my words super carefully, and if I say one thing wrong, it goes back to the start. But I'm ENFP and she often tells me that I'm being too optimistic, even when I'm trying to look at the situation in a realistic way. So it's rare that she'll take what I say seriously, when it comes to this stuff. The only person that she ever really calms down for every time is her ESTP father. But I don't want to just tell her that she should call her dad every time she starts worrying.
I want to be able to help her, but it feels like she really doesn't listen to me, until she calms down. I've tried everything I could think of, but I just can't seem to get through to her. I've tried talking with her calm and sensibly, talking enthusiastically positive, shutting up and just listening, yelling at her to stop worrying(this definitely didn't work), mimicking her father, changing subjects, worrying with her. Like I'm just lost. Is this a ESFP thing? And what can I do? We've been together for 6 years now and it's something that has been draining both of us."
940,esfp,"In my experience as an ESFP I just need my feelings validated. I need someone to sit down and say ""your feelings are real and therefore are worthy of being felt"". Words also cut deeper than you would think. Any insult towards me, even as a joke, hurts me to the core, because I don't understand why people have to hurt other people. 
Basically, to help her, I would be very careful what you say and how you say it.
And make sure she knows that how she is feeling is 100% okay. I promise you that this will help. Once I know that people understand my problems and feel for me I am able to get over it.
I hope this helps :) "
941,esfp,"It's not really an ESFP thing no, in fact most esfps are prone to not worrying about things they definitely should worry about. I agree that she probably wants her feelings validated and someone to hear her out. If I am caught up in worrying I want the other person to just listen to me and agree that what I'm worrying about is stressful but also calm me down a bit by breaking the situation down."
942,esfp,"Does she have Bipolar or ADD ? I am not a worry wart nut have horrible stress. Sometime exercise therapy and medication doesn't even help me at all. I have PTSD,Bipolar 1 and ADD life is so sucky sometimes. Maybe therapy would help her? you sound really sweet she is so lucky to have you. Maybe do more research persuade her into getting therapy. ESFP 8w9"
943,esfp,"The difference is just if you value new experiences or your personal values more. ESFPs want Se experiences— new things, interesting things, and to have fun as their top priority in life. ISFPs only want to express themselves and experience new things that are aligned with who they are, what feels right. "
944,esfp,"No matter your Myers Briggs type, each person is still an individual and will lean more or less towards each side.
I'm a little bit more extroverted, meaning I lean more towards ESFP. But my ""E"" is weaker than some other people. 
You might be close to 50/50 E/I."
945,esfp,"These are functions. We all have our own likes and dislikes and good or bad habits. Those aren't functions. Functions are how our brain perceives things. Something you learn at a very young age. What your asking, isn't easy. "
946,esfp,"Hey listen bro, I know that our brain processes info and guides our personality.  I'm asking for an ESFP perspective because I am basically the same type as ESFP, but my perceiving functions are mixed up.  If I use extraverted sensing to the point that it becomes fluid/more natural to extraverted intuition, it shouldn't be a problem."
947,esfp,"I think they mean you can't learn this by tomorrow. A person can't just teach you suddenly how to smell the roses before trying to figure out what type of rose and family they come from. Sensing is the first thing we do. And we are very different. But that's a positive outlook you have. 
Try hunting. You have to use all your senses. Something outdoorsy where your forced to use your Se. "
948,esfp,"So, I'm an INTJ - I know, blah blah blah we aren't good at emotions - but it felt soon and I want to know what you all think.
Back story: We met a few months ago and he's been chasing me and finally around the beginning of April I agreed to dinner. So we've been dating for about 3-4 weeks. (We don't really have a ""bf/gf"" label yet).... And last night we were getting hot and heavy and I did something awkward - per usual - and he said ""It's ok, I love you""... And that took me super off-guard. We talked a little about it, and I told him I couldn't say it back yet. He admitted he said it too early. 
So my question is - is that common for ESFPs to say that too soon? I know there tends to be a stereotype that you guys are a little flighty - no offense meant there. I'm just a little skeptical."
949,esfp,"I am an ESFP married to an INTJ and yes, I had to be super careful with not blurting that out too soon in my relationship.  I totally agree with /u/Troy521 that when I get sucked into the moment (like intense sex where get 100% focused on my husband) and I tend to ignore other parts of my brain that tell me not to blurt out that kind of thing.  I would disagree that I am flighty, but I would say that I tend to think too heavily about the moment right in front of me at times rather than getting enough of the big picture."
950,esfp,I sometimes forget and start using that word as just a term of endearment when I am beginning to care about someone (versus falling head over heels in love with them). The fact that you stopped and talked about it is good.
951,esfp,"I felt it at what seemed like early on but didn't have the hear to say it yet, as I've scared away many people with my intense feelings. During this time my newish (at the time) INTJ boyfriend waqs picking up on my vibes & thought I was going to dump him. When it didnt happen at the end of the day he was further confused.
He ended up saying it first around the second month via webcam while I was on vacation. I felt exactly the same way and it turned out we developed the feelings at the same time. So if it was early on then we both felt it early on.
To be honest, I can't tell if I fall fast and heard for people because I'm an ESFP (also I'm 50/50 introverted) OR because I have borderline personality disorder."
952,esfp,"It's funny because I'm an ESFP in a long-term relationship with an INFJ (so not quite your type, but close-ish), and he said ""I love you"" well before I was ready to. Same with my previous relationship (which was with an INFP).
I guess I'm pretty comfortable saying it to friends, but that's a bit different. There's a different kind of love that I feel for someone I'm really committed to, and that's not something I take lightly. When I'm really in love with someone, it's a huge fucking deal.
What I'm getting at is that his way of expressing this at this point could well be a way of expressing a feeling of friendship and comfortableness, since the way you describe the scenario makes it sound like he said it fairly casually. That doesn't mean there won't be some other, deeper layers of emotion that get peeled back further down the line if things continue to go well with the two of you."
953,esfp,"it doesn't really mean anything, I say it to girls all the time... i'll even grab their hands and say it in the most sincere form. It's our way of displaying affection whether it seems a bit extreme. If we love you... you'll know, words wont be the defining way of realizing it :)"
954,esfp,"No offense taken :)  I had actually not heard it phrased that way before.  We have been together for 6 years, married for one.
'He admitted he said it too early.'  Like many ESFPs, he likely immediately realized it was too early right after the words came out of his mouth.  If it was me, I would be really nervous about hurting the progression of the relationship at this point (a.k.a freaking you out).  This still in the early relationship stages, ensuring you can both move forward and not overly focus on this moment is important.  Especially since it sounds like you already had a chance to talk about it a bit."
955,esfp,"That's hopeful! All the INTJ/ESFP stories I've heard are not quite as inspiring.....
Yeah, I'm thinking he got really nervous after. Unfortunately I had to leave shortly after as it was late and I had to get home. So we didn't have as much time to talk about it as I would like, but he tends to avoid the hard topics so I try not to push too hard. I'm probably WAY over analyzing it. I'm just more worried about hurting his feelings by not being able to reciprocate. "
956,esfp,"I actually would say that the fact he said I love you, even if too soon, is a good sign.  It means he is on a path headed towards saying for real at the right time.  Granted it is a new relationship for you both but the mistake was his in not thinking before he spoke, not anything wrong or bad about your relationship.  Remember, this has more to do with him blurting it out than anything actually being wrong.
So yeah, talk about it a bit more and then move on to other happy things!"
957,esfp,"I'm just curious as to why more ESFP's aren't really talking on here or interacting... 
I was excited to join a sub with my personality type and it seems there's not much going on with this forum. What's up guys?? "
958,esfp,"Generally, the issue with ESFPs, and Se-doms in general, that they're not the type to sit on the compute all day and chat. They're more the type that is out there in the world, and comments on a 'I have time now' basis. Which can sometimes be often, but sometimes almost never.
ESFPs like to exert themselves on the world, and are very much kinesthetic focused, doing shit."
959,esfp,"But I feel ya. When I first joined the online community for typology, and found out what type I was, I was also disappointed, that I finally found people to relate to, and they weren't almost ever there."
960,esfp,"Funny you say this. I feel this part of my personality, but also feel like I drove myself into a hole of isolation and now I have lost a bit of that spark of being always out there and go-getting. Kinda sucks :("
961,esfp,"
u/AdehhRR

I don't mean that ESFPs are necessarily social. I'm not too social myself. And cognitive extroversion is not social extroversion. However, even so, ESFPs prefer to apply themselves. I'll be at home, trying to learn the guitar, for example.
But yeah, I also know the feel. I do suffer bouts of depression, and when I do, isolating myself happens, and it's hard to dig out of that hole. I do a team sport, however, so that's a good mechanism to suck me back in."
962,esfp,"Hahahaha, sounds like you're not mistyped! I'm the same way. I get super excited and into things, but as I learn more and more, and stuff becomes less novel, I just move on to different things.
That I think is why the ESFP sub isn't all that busy."
963,esfp,"like xNFx overwhelm you? Majority of my friends are iNutives. And I find myself getting constantly overwhelmed lately. I have a few Sensor friends but they all live quite a drive away. They never want to do anything adventurous or new or even go out and I feel like I'm slowly dying. Even my workmates. ALL intuitives. I feel like they have very strong feelings. I don't always understand it. I am sensitive, I will admit. But get over things and move on quickly and I can typically reason with myself as to why I'm being to sensitive. But all they want to do is talk about things but never do them. 
Side note. I recently moved to this area about a year ago."
964,esfp,"Easy to find SFs at places like running clubs, ultimate frisbee, I imagine a fair amount of LARPers, DnD groups. My solution if I'm feeling in a rut with my NF friends (I'm around a lot of them as I'm an actor with a lot of writer/director/etc friends) is get out. My outlet is running and I'm pretty serious about it. It's nice getting a sort of visceral reaction/feeling every day."
965,esfp,"I think that's my problem. I've been working a lot of overtime (with NFs, I do photography/photo editing for jewelers in LA) I haven't had time outside of that. Thank you so much for the advice! I will definitely look into all of those! Glad, I'm not alone!"
966,esfp,"I’ve been in a relationship with an INTJ for over 5 years, living together for 4 of them. I bring him out socially, he reminds me that I need to budget and plan. He’s the sweetest person with a strong sense of morality. Mbti has helped us understand the other better. "
967,esfp,"Currently with an ESFP (INTJ here) and it started great; she brought me out of my shell socially, had a youthfulness and positive outlook that I admired, and genuinely seemed to ""get"" me (never took offense or thought I was arrogant and just overall trusted in my strengths). That was 4 years ago and our relationship spiralled to toxic levels. While we still try to make it work, it has been the most difficult undertaking for myself and I'm sure for her as well. The problem is that she's an immature ESFP; it got to a point where I became a parent to her and she would ""rebel"" much like a teenager would (she would create fights because I was right about something but she wanted me to accept her as being right). If she doesn't understand what I'm saying it means I'm insulting her, if I discuss an idea with her I'm automatically talking about her, etc. An immature and insecure ESFP is a terrible person to be around for an INTJ; do some googling and you'll quickly read about how this pairing almost never works unless both parties are patient and mature (then again any pairing would work if both parties were mature and patient).
The relationship can work and be rewarding but ESFP and INTJ are basically inversions of each other; an immature ESFP is an emotional rollercoaster for an INTJ devoid of any logic in interactions and an immature INTJ is unmoving and lacks understanding of the other's and their own emotions leading to anger and frustration they might lash out with.
Honestly, the best of luck with this pairing. I'm trying so hard to make this work and I honestly don't have any hope of it working in the end but I'm also just a foolish INTJ."
968,esfp,"I would echo the post from /u/notenoughclearance, it is so important that both people are balanced members of their types. I'm ESFP married to an INTJ and when both parties have rounded out their personality a bit it's so great. But it's easy to see how the extremes of the types would clash. 
All I can say about the compatibility is that... we see the world from the same angle and use the same tools to decide things, even if we use them a little differently. It makes it easy to be on the same team, and to feel like two halves of a whole. I'm sure my husband would use different language haha."
969,esfp,"It's a relationship of Duality (terminology borrowed from Socionics), which means could be the best coupling for relationships and 1-on-1 interactions. My experience irl supports the theory, as this my most harmonic, joyful, and fulfilling relationship. I've got a couple friends who are INTJ, and I really like them. But obviously, just type isn't enough to match. There need to be common values, ideally some overarching common interests as well. And it's not the most obvious relationship to establish. From experience, this is something that tends to grow over a period of time, moves forward like molten lava, rather than a forest wildfire."
970,esfp,"Hmmm... telling from my own experience, INTJs are initially very guarded and it's easy to annoy each other. Mistaking their bluntness for arrogance is never a good thing. IRL very sweet actually. INTJ girls are suprisingly chatty once they opened up and trust you."
971,esfp,"I'd also say that I typically get along better with INTJs who are either Enneagram core 5, core 6, or something other, and less so with INTJs who are Enneagram core 1. I get along with those as friends too, but they tend to rub me the wrong way, because they come across more condescending and critical, and I have contrarian knee-jerk reactions to someone judging me."
972,esfp,"INTJ here, and my wife is ESFP. I can tell you from my viewpoint of being together over 16 years that I wouldn’t trade it for anything. 
Our relationship has been very challenging to say the least, but once we realized that we were on the same team and aligned our goals and intentions with each other then it has been great. 
In the end, I find that our differences is what keeps us balanced. "
973,esfp,"It's true that maturity levels must be about equal, and quite good in both. An immature ESFP is a pain in the ass to deal with, as is an immature INTJ. And no one likes to look at themselves before they focus on how the other is screwing it up. That's part of the maturity. Have you guys tried counselling? Or a mediator? Sometimes, the intentions are good from both sides, but tend to spiral. And sometimes intent isn't clear. A counselor could help her understand your frustrations, and could easily help you understand what about that you do makes her react the way she does, and whether there is a way to do things in a way to communicate intent better."
974,esfp,"Fuck bro lol. Why do you stick with it. There's gotta be a point where an ultimatum needs to be made. ""If you care, you will make this work out. If not, then there's no point of continuing to prolong this just to end up with the same result""... Figure out where it spiraled down hill and try to go back (I'm sure you tried). Realize that you could be holding yourself back from finding someone better. But good luck..."
975,esfp,In the beginning it was known that we were on the same team but in recent years it definitely feels like she has forgotten that and I hope she remembers soon that we are working towards the same goal. Glad to hear things have worked out great for you and your wife.
976,esfp,"same here. my wife is INTJ. I am ESFP. we have found compatibility in our 8 years together, 3 married. There can be conflict and at times it can be strong conflict. 
We have found that from time to time recognizing that we have strongly felt differences of opinion, we just drop an issue unresolved. 
We’re both mature and respect each other’s freedom to live as they please. 
We both went through work changes a few years ago and its been a huge help. Negativity in a work place or something like that can be a huge strain on the relationship. I travel for work and am out of town for large chunks of time constantly. my schedule changes almost weekly while she works a standard 40hr a week job. It’s actually been a net positive for our marriage."
977,esfp,"We haven't tried couples therapy but we have seen people individually. An issue she has is lying to her therapist about how she is doing something or how things are improving. She has a constant need to please and entertain people it seems, and being honest doesn't do that but pretending things are getting better does. We've talked about it and she doesn't always seem to be aware of it according to her.
A mediator has helped in the moment but it hasn't lead to any permanent changes. "
978,esfp,"Honestly, part of it is wondering if it's yourself to blame. Like, I don't feel love in the general way people normally describe it, it's more of a conscious decision on my end to ""love"" someone; I'm agreeing to a partnership or something. So, I usually don't break up unless I've exhausted all my options to correct the relationship or they fuck up really badly. The issue with things like this, it isn't always one big action, it's a build up until it explodes, so you are kind of in shock. I don't know, part of it is obvious stubbornness and another is not having positive examples in life.
I'm definitely at that point where something needs to change or I'll have to leave. It's just hard to decide in my position when I have tons of other shit going on in life, relationships take a backseat if that makes sense.
Thanks!"
979,esfp,"Shit, the part about her in the 2nd half hits close to home. I don't like being too honest if it'll make people unhappy, I try to be as optimistic as possible and I think it comes off this way. Only reason I think she's doing it without even being aware of this problem. "
980,esfp,"I completely understand the partnership thing you described. But hmm. Stubbornness on your part? Well I don't think it's fair to criticize her for anything until you have nothing to be critiqued on yourself. Kind of like you can't complain about the issues of someone else and expect them to change if you have issues yourself and you aren't changing. Even if your critique on her is justified... 
Regardless, someone has got to take the first steps in being the bigger man. Otherwise it'll never work out man. Someone has to. Either you or her. And all you can do is control your actions. So focus on that and then she should reciprocate. It's fine that you didn't have positive examples in life. But look for positive ones now. And a positive mindset.
Take this approach: Tell her that you want this to work out, but this can't go on for much longer. And that you are going to show her that you want this to work out by listening to her completely and with no judgement at all and ask her what she wants from you and what she wants you to do for her (you actually have to do this tho). And you hope that eventually she will reciprocate this practice with you. But for now, you will take the first step in completely listening to her and doing what she says. And eventually she will show you whether or not she wants this to work out by reciprocating. If not, then actions speak louder than words. 
But again, you have to listen completely to her and then give it some time (maybe a few weeks) to see if she will eventually put her immaturity and ego aside just like you have. And when/if she does eventually try to reciprocate, she will also have to reciprocate entirely with no if, ands or buts. JUST like you will. 
Let me know how it goes. If you haven't tried this before. But I'm guessing you tried some form of this maybe. But give it a shot. 
​"
981,esfp,"Thank you. I was a very close friend with an ESFP (for like 4-5 years I was unable to type him cuz he's a very mature ESFP lol), and he did exactly that to me. It rubbed me off as he didn't want to trust me at the time, but now that I thought of it I think I can understand it a little better."
982,esfp,"Sorry, I'm typing on a phone so I probably didn't communicate very well, but what I meant by my stubbornness was me sticking around for so long trying to make things work, hahaha.
Either way, it's good advice. I'm older than her so I always try to be the first to compromise or take the first steps to make things better. She's recently gotten to the point where she will sometimes apologise when she realizes she fucked up which is moving our relationship in the right direction.
Definitely will be having a talk with her soon when things aren't so stressful."
983,esfp,"I'm really falling for an ESFP and he's been sending me mixed signals. One moment, he's CRAZY about me. The next, he's very standoff-ish. 
In my past, I've had a history of emotional neglect and traumatic experiences (that I don't really want to get into). It's difficult for me to speak about these things and connect with ANYONE on an emotional level. It's been difficult for me to deal with all of this, and I've been trying to overcome my pessimism and withdrawn emotions.
The ESFP I am dating seems to get discouraged whenever I am withdrawn from him. Sometimes I say things jokingly (that can probably be taken offensively if you don't ""get me"") and it's written all over his face that I have hurt his feelings. I'm not really sure what to do. I want to make this relationship work and I am so afraid of rejection. I've really began to fall for him and if this doesn't work out, I'm going to be very hurt.

The other night, I was having a full-fledged conversation with him in my sleep and he thought that I was consciously speaking to him. He thought that I was fully aware of what I was saying. He had taken a shower while I was asleep and he came into the room, and apparently I said ""Ugh! Why didn't you hurry up? I've been trying to sleep!""
It sounds absolutely ridiculous now that I speak about it...in the past, whenever my daughter has slept in the same bed as me, she claims that I get grouchy if she moved the slightest bit. 
My boyfriend seemed very offended by what I said in an unconscious state. He said that he didn't like how bossy I was in my sleep. There's only so much that I can help when I am in an unconscious state! LOL!

(TL;DR) What can I do to show my ESFP boyfriend that I am committed to this relationship; that I care about him; that I want to make this work? This isn't easy for me considering my past experiences."
984,esfp,"I tend to be really flip floppy. I think ESFPs are just natural players unfortunately. Lots of us are missing the empathy chip unfortunately too. I mean look at Justin Bieber, he's got a million girlfriends and he still isn't satisfied. I'd say get treatment for yourself and learn to be happy being single. Which is really hard for housewife-y ISFJs I know but you gotta try. ESFP and ISFJ are really hard to make it work. ISFJs work best with ESFJs in my experience. Exxx and Ixxx counterpart make a good team."
985,esfp,"I'm curious if we get along when I see another esfp it's another person but i don't feel like I'm always as popular as them and then just feel sad. My friends and even the esfp like me and we are friends, however I did notice when I was younger I wanted to be popular in my highschool I felt bad and wanted to be like them and was somewhat envious; but idk if that's normal. Maybe any of you guys could help explain?"
986,esfp,"I think it has a lot to do with maturity, immature ESFP's in the same setting might start viciously competing for attention, but if you're a bit wiser you'll probably give each other room to shine and not turn it into a competition. The thing about people of the same type as you is that its very easy for you to relate to them and forgive their quirks. At the same time this kind of relationship might not be stimulating enough as you're not evolving your weaker functions, so it all depends on what you're looking for."
987,esfp,"My most favouritest friends are fellow ExFPs. We're goofy and loud, and always have the most entertaining conversations. Plus, they're great for on the spot improv comedy partners. All that's necessary is for both of us to put ourselves out there when we're in the same room, and sure enough we'll gravitate towards each other."
988,esfp,"Seems like 1/3 of the esfps from my perspective r less attracted to other ESFPS and see them as indifferent so they are drawn back. Whereas the others have a esfp way to look at esfp which makes sense and can get along very well, it'd be interesting to see if esfps majority have differing functions than esfps minority or if it's due to environmental affects. "
989,esfp,"Yes definitely, I'll even have a well thought out text/post/message entirely written that if I can't decide how it will come across to everyone it's intended for I'll just delete and give up on.  I would guess it's more of or secondary internal whatever because it's more of an internal conflict of how we think people will feel/think/react from said message, but then without the immediate gratification of a response (regardless of the response, we really just prefer personally interaction) don't really think it's the Te function, though know that you've peaked my interest on actually following thru on a response I find myself fixing typos and doing research to remember what I was reading earlier about it and it would make sense that if I'm entent on making a response it will be a good response.  Though after reading these run on sentences after I start losing interest because yea I think your reasoning makes sense so I'll believe you are right with that.  Anyway I think I was going to say something about the only way things get posted is if we get too bored to grammar/spell check ourselves, because come on I'm typing on a phone, and if auto correct doesn't fix it right I'm sorry it's easy to figure out the intended word most of the time (at least for us).  So yea I'm not sure how to answer because typing and proof reading does not feel like it helps with my external thinking at all, it just confuses me because I don't understand why you have to write in a different form than you would just talk to someone.  Ugh technical writing sucks."

991,esfp,"Hey, I'm a INTP male and recently I was in a relationship with female ESFP. Unfortunately relationship ended, but I enjoyed our time together a lot and got to know a wonderful ESFP individual.
So, ask me anything :)"
992,esfp,"I'm an INTP with an ESFP girlfriend. We've been together for a bit over a year now. How long were you with your girlfriend? Mine is also going abroad at the end of the month (for five months). I'm a bit worried about how our relationship will be but I guess all I can do is trust her. The only issues we have stem from my mental health (mostly to do with communication). 
I think that if you still want to be with her when she gets back, you should contact her. Like you said, ESFP's can change their minds pretty easily, so maybe if you show her that you still want to be with her she will agree."
993,esfp,"Hello I am INTP also and my partner is ESFP. Can you tell me what part of the relationship didn't work for you? And/Or how you two slit up. 
Also what did you personally think of her as an ESFP? 
Mine's emotional when it comes to me and she's very mother-like taking care of me and such and I find myself becoming quite childlike around her, any similarities there?"

actually everything worked fine. even better then fine. communication was great, sex was amazing, we had a lot of fun(typical for esfp :D), but also plenty of deep meaningful conversations. i was understanding and kind (her words; as we intp can be with our wide range thinking and analytical minds), and she was supporting and understanding in different way. more with sensing and emotions. we complemented each other kinda. then she went to study abroad for a semester and distance was the key to breakup. she is really needy, but in a good way, not petty stuff but real support(i was more then happy to provide her support that she needed, because as i said communication was great and everything for us was discussable and talked about), she needed support and touch, and with the distance i couldnt completely give her that. since she is younger and with no real experience in relationship i think she started to feel conflicted emotions and didnt really know how to interpret it. we had really enjoyable summer and when that ""faded away"" with college/work duties combined with distance she broke it of (i've read this somewhere and would mostly apply it to our case: ""ESFPs reevaluate their situations and commitments constantly, regardless of professions of love and dedication today. If a week later they just don’t feel the same, that’s it, and ESFP personalities have no problem seriously considering breaking things off."" but with experience and maturity comes the realization that it CAN be worth the bother). this is my interpretation of things of course, so take that in consideration.
yes, similarities are there. she was emotional when is comes to me(and only me and family ofc), we shared a lot about each other. my emotional and sensing side grew every second with her. she is really good with children and has a younger brother, and i could sense that mother-like taking care thing :)
maybe your gf could help me rationalize this situation since I still feel huge emotions for her and would like some insight from a similar mind. we spoke, ex and I, but she is still abroad and im kinda still hanging(emotionally; working on that side of me, fuck its hard for me as an intp :D)
please, feel free to ask anything :)"
996,esfp,"Hello! I'm Magicturbo's ESFP partner :). 
Everything you write makes a lot of sense to me. 
Having been in a long distance relationship in the past, I can definitely understand her breaking it off. It's not an issue of trust or anything. No matter how much you supported her from afar (and she likely knew you did), touch and physical presence is definitely very important when it comes to a romantic partner. It's difficult for us to feel that connection when apart for a long time. If she wasn't emotionally ready for this and the lack of closeness made her sad it's possible that she just decided that she couldn't stay ""stuck"" in this feeling and needed to move on. This doesn't mean she cared about you any less. It just made it easier for her to live her life if she set the relationship with you aside. 
There is a good chance that she still has feelings for you and thinks about you. Like someone else said, when/if she moves back you could reach out to her and see where she's at in her life. Seems like you had a good relationship so she would probably appreciate it - whether you get back together or not. Can confirm though that she wouldn't want you to stop yourself from meeting someone while she's away. She probably views breaking it off as setting both of you free.
We do tend to move on quickly from relationships - romantic or otherwise - but we never forget them and always cherish the good ones.
The distance issue will happen with friends as well. I only have 1 good friend from my childhood. All others I made during school and past jobs have faded away once I or they left, no matter how close we may have been at the time. 
Anyways, I'll stop rambling now. Feel free to ask if you've got any questions... if all this doesn't make sense, Magicturbo may be able to translate. :)"
997,esfp,"ESFP here.
I definitely do not support racism or racial segregation.  With racism, there is an implication that one race is superior.  I find that this line of thinking is highly illogical and ethically unjustifiable.
Let me be clear that I've seen racism from all races, not just from Caucasians of European descent.  There is an us vs. them mentality that dehumanizes people.  As an ESFP, I know that every person is a unique individual.  I do not want to judge based on the color of someone's skin or where they were born.  I will judge on people's actions and beliefs, though.  And if you are unable to look beyond the color line, then I do not want you in my life.
ESFP's have pretty strong ethics due to our Fi-aux.  I think you would find it hard to find an ESFP here who supports racism."
998,esfp,"I feel like I can fall into making instaneous judements based off stereotypes that I can be overexposed to, but I'm quick to realize where these judgments come from.  I also rely on the fact that I rarely have bad experiences with any person regardless of race once becoming aquainted with them.  But we definitely all are also understanding and accepting of everyone, unless you some you manage to irreparablely offend one us somehow, which can happen but takes a lot to do."
999,esfp,"Well, at least you have helped confirm that type differences are real. Not a single post in this thread that attempts to expand on a position. 
On the other hand, I'm afraid of what you'll find if you post this over at /r/INTP"
1000,esfp,"That's actually a coyly worded post (title) meant to chide the INTPs on that subreddit who sometime accuse anyone who doesn't fit their idea of what an INTP is of not being INTP. Essentially, the young INTPs who believe they might be or should be robots don't like it when INTPs express 'emotions', whatever those are, lol. If you say you 'feel' a certain way, or talk about relationships, they think you're an INFP. It's ridiculous."
1001,esfp,"At the risk of sounding INTP-ish, the OP's (vasubandu) eloquent 9 paragraph post already makes this abundantly clear.  "
1002,esfp,"How do you guys feel about this? To me it's a big fat hell no, can't imagine any worse careers for myself than that, but I'm wondering what you guys think
https://www.capt.org/using-type/workplace.htm?bhcp=1
""Examples of careers often chosen by ESFPs include teaching (particularly pre-school through grade 12) and coaching, childcare work, clerical and office work, recreational work, food service, nursing, sales, personal services, and religious work/education.""
""They are also found much less often in careers that tend to require a more impersonal and analytical approach to people, such as social science or law, or that have very little contact with people, such as research or highly quantitative work (e.g., research, accounting, auditing)."""
1003,esfp,"I'm an x-ray tech and before that I had majored in education, specifically math.
I love patient interactions. It's my best 'skill'. In my performance reviews I'm always commended for my patient care and chipper disposition. And I still think about finishing my bachelor's so that I can teach as a clinical instructor at some point. "
1004,esfp,"It's not what I would go for, but still levels and levels above office work, which is what I'm doing now. That's the death of the soul.
Tbh, I have been a lecturer in an education and culture center in the past, having two workshops that I did for schools. It was on a topic that was too difficult for most teachers to talk about competently, so they outsourced to us. Hence, I had a different class every time. I don't know that I'd be able to keep track of one class over time, but this worked for me quite well. I felt confident in what I'm doing, I knew how to engage the students, and how to pass the knowledge to others, and I was center stage, which worked well for me.
If I should choose a career though, regardless of what is feasible for me right now, I would be a musician, film director, actor, film producer, or work in the stables, riding and teaching horses, and cleaning up stable muck."
1005,esfp,"We are drawn to more social interactions while also helping people so naturally they cross our minds. Personally, childcare/nursing are not for me, but the social side of working in an office is the highlight of my day.
​
Why do those careers seem so bad to you? "
1006,esfp,"But the social side of working in an office is something completely different than being a nurse or a teacher and even if it's the highlight of your day it's still a byproduct of your main job.
Here's a reply I've posted to someone else here recently:

From the looks of it not everyone agrees with that last paragraph, which is pretty weird to me. I just don't see the appeal of it at all. Aside from children, people in general are unpredictable and mostly unpleasant to communicate with. I hate depending on others as well and have always strived to be independent, which seems impossible in these lines of work."
1007,esfp,"Maybe, but most jobs serving people include a lot of negativity while less personal work is a lot more neutral. I can see ESFPs being good in salesmanship or presentation, but serving people has no appeal to me whatsoever. 
I still think a lot of xSFJs and ENFPs mistype as us"
1008,esfp,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger, however I only took meds for about a year. I'm unsure why I stopped, but I remember my mother asking me in third grade if I felt they helped. I didn't really know what the medicine was supposed to do in the first place at that age.
Anyway, a lot of the problems I encounter on a day to day basis are memory problems. Certain things catch my attention, where as others do not. I currently have a pile of laundry to do, bills to pay, a party I could attend, among assorted other tasks I'm putting off.
I'm not sure exactly how ADHD has affected your life, but I know a couple of things that help me. Making lists, and actually doing those rather than things you WANT to do. Making programs and sticking to them. Now, I know it's hard to do this, especially for myself, so it takes a level of emotional commitment to really see these things through.
As I've grown older, I've grown more sedentary. I stay at home and play video games, the only thing that really grabs my attention for long periods of time, mostly to a bad extent. Whatever you're comfortable doing, stop doing it and just get out there and enjoy life. Do things that you wouldn't see yourself doing normally. Pick up a class, start a hobby, hang out with friends more. Try to work towards getting more responsibilities in work so you're never just sitting around being bored. Strive for more. Put more on your plate so you can switch from one to another getting all of that shit done.
I don't really know where you have problems in life, however I know my own faults and this shpiel is just from what I know. Also, this is just a stream of consciousness while I take a break from gaming :P Where do you think you're missing out on life?"
1009,esfp,"You have one advantage and one disadvantage in terms of ADHD, if my guess is right.
As a feeler, it's hard to not take the challenges personally. You're hard on yourself about what you see as failures and see them as a reflection on your character. Try to step back and see your habits the way you might see problem skin or frizzy hair. Don't equate ADHD to character issues; just a challenge that you need to be aware of and take actions to keep in check.
As a sensor, you have a huge advantage in habit forming and following systems. Once you have identified a process to keep ADHD in check, which may include medication, then you will do much better than an intuitor at sticking to the process."
1010,esfp,"Though it takes a lot of effort, I try to force myself into creating easy routines that I won't break because they become mindless. Meds have definitely helped me feel motivated enough, which made this process somewhat easier for me. "
1011,esfp,"Ironically enough, most of my ADHD related issues (aside from the extreme inability to sit in one place and do one thing for an extended amount of time) come from being in crowds.  When I'm in a situation where there are a lot of people or there's a lot of stuff going on, and one person is talking to me, I cannot focus on them. I'm listening, I know exactly what they're saying and how to respond, but I can't keep my eyes on their face. I'm constantly scanning what's going on around me. I've come to remedy this two ways. 1) I've told my close friends about this problem and I remind them often when I'm talking to them in these situations that even if I'm not looking at them, I'm absolutely listening. And 2) I've worked really hard on focusing as much as I can on the person I'm talking to. It usually means drawing a triangle with my eyes from one to the other, then to their nose, then to an eye, to the other, to the nose, etc. It keeps my eyes moving, but the movement is imperceptible to the person, so it just looks like I'm only focused on them. Score."
1012,esfp,"So the title says it all. A little while ago this girl who I use to be really close with for over a year maybe two and almost dated that whole time just recently ""found me"". We use to be great friends and whatever else we were until I messed it up and blew her off for some other girl. So over the years I tried to reconnect and it didn't work out she wouldn't have it all, hating me basically. But recently she decided to find me, ended up looking me up and creating profiles on a few social media sites just to find my profile. Now were talking again and she says she has a BF who she says has been just using her for sex and it doesn't look too good for them. They seem to be almost done.
Now down to the MBTI part. I've tested every time as an ENFP and  I told her about this recently and she took the test and found out she's an ESFP. We get along amazingly and I haven't really found much a problem yet, communication isn't as difficult as some have said it would be between these two types but I'd like to know if it's just me trying hard to make it work, and if there is anything else I can do? I read that ESFPs like for their feelings to be validated and since then I've made sure I've told her feelings are right and should be expressed. I also learned that Intuitive conversations might get a little stale but it hasn't been a problem so far with her, she seems to listen really well and find my intuitive conversation pieces interesting. Like how I talk about medicinal plants alot with a passion, she doesn't seem to mind. So am I doing this right or am I making a mistake? We seem to have alot in common and she is a great person. If I have to I wouldn't mind sacrificing some of my more Ne thoughts but I'd like to know if I'm starting off on the right foot. She even just asked me if I would use her if we ever decided to date again, almost like shes priming me for it. I'm not trying to get too excited though. Also I don't want to put all my eggs in one basket by relying on the MBTI too much, because ""individuals still are"" but it has helped me understand the way some think around me.
TL;DR I an ENFP male might date an ESFP female. Any questions comments or concerns?"
1013,esfp,My sister is an ESFP and I'm an ENFP. We get along really well. I'm also married to an ISFP. As ENFP just remember that there will be times when intuitive discussions will bore her. Just like detailed discussion of how her day went might bore you. Remember also that she most likely will have a need to get out of the house (or apt or whatever) and do something instead of just talking all day. I think you guys will do great. Good luck :) 
1014,esfp,"Then stop right here. No amount of trying to analyse your relationship and engineer the situation will equal just pursuing the human connection in earnest. A test can give you four letters (which should then probably be subjected to doubt anyway, given the fallibility of tests); if you've known her as a friend and romantically then you already know her far better than the MBTI ever will."
1015,esfp,Thank you so much! I appreciate it and that was very informative. I don't think ill get bored with talking to her about her day! I love listening to people i care about. But i will be very mindful on some of the things just so she doesn't get bored.
1016,esfp,"I've been reading about both types, and often they seem so very similar. I do understand the difference between N and S, but I was wondering how you guys see the differences between the two types? Most of what I've been reading is from ENFP perspective, so I'm quite curious...!"
1017,esfp,"I'm an ESFP and my sister is an ENFP. We're very close and hold very similar values. I have 6 siblings (we're all very close) and she's the one I relate to the most. There are very few ways that we AREN'T alike, but I'll see if I can't list a few:
1) She is much better at participating in the NT conversations/debates that we get involved in. She thrives in that atmosphere. I can get just as involved but it can be exhausting and I need an Ni break, even if I'm enjoying the conversation.
2) We have opposite decision weaknesses. I tend to jump into things relying on my spontaneity and/or adaptibility. Even though I'm good at it, it has certainly bitten me in the ass a few times. On the other hand, my sister is very hesitant/cautious and overthinks things, sometimes to the point of missing good opportunities.
3) I'm a bottom-line kinda girl. I like it when things are succinct and final. She's more likely to tip-toe around ideas to find every possible variable before moving forward. Both of these can be useful or harmful, depending on the situation.
These are the main differences that I experience with my ENFP sister. I'm sure these differences change with each individual person and relationship, but I hope this helped in some way. :)"
1018,esfp,"This turned out to be a long post. At any rate, I hope that it's helpful.
I had a ""friend"" once who was quite possibly the world's shittiest ENFP. This is not the standard for the type, but IMO extreme examples are the best for ""compare-and-contrast"" style questions, so here we go.
ENFPs seem to spend most of their lives ""in the air"" about things. I REALLY like this metaphor for them; it's a very potent description. By that, i mean that it describes who they are on A LOT of different levels (with as few abstractions as possible). 
The flipside to being in the air is that ENFPs are particularly prone to becoming ungrounded. In particularily bad cases (involving either severe stress and/or mental health problems), the ENFP can become so ungrounded that they become trapped ""in the grip"" of their Inferior-Si. 
One frequent manifestation of this (that I was subjected to firsthand) is a strong (and hypocritical) preoccupation with boundaries. Everything with her was either about ""tearing down these [oppressive] walls"" or the importance of protected ""safe spaces"". [All the while ignoring the fact that tearing down walls implies that she is an invader, and having a ""protected"" space fundamentally requires... walls! Still drives me mental thinking about it.]
Anyway, the problem (from the ESFP perspective) is that ENFPs never consider what actually makes the metaphor (e.g. ""the wall"") so potent. They just lob the phrase around like it's a hand-grenade. Which essentially makes an ENFP ""in the grip"" just look like a shitty, knock-off version of an ESFP. We pretty much only look the same if one of us is being shitty.
Potency (and specifically power) are perceived through the domain of Extraverted Sensing. This is true for all types, with ESxPs being the most naturally gifted. The types least able to process Se-information are the xNxPs (with INxPs at the absolute bottom). For ENFPs, Se is their ""role function."" This position is all about ""should-ofs"" and is prone towards narcissistic injuries (even in the best of us). Meaning that it's also what we're most likely to project onto other people when we're feeling inadequate within ourselves.
The Si-gripped ENFP is childish when it comes to Se. In comparison to Si-doms (who default to ignoring Se-data, but can wield it appropriately when necessary) the Si-gripped ENFP will refuse to accept any Se-data, except for what fits into two categories: ""proof that I'm good"" and ""proof that you're bad!""
So the ""truth"" (especially concerning the role of power) is only considered as valid as the Si-gripped ENFP can weaponize it. Which is complete shit when they start projecting that mentality onto other people. Inferior-Si screams ""I am a victim!""  (potentially for years at a time) and the ENFP explodes at just about anyone who ""wrongs"" them (the only prerequisite is knowing they'll get away with it.)
My ENFP shit-tier former friend acted exactly like you'd expect a shit-tier ESFP to act: like a manipulative, histrionic scumbag. She'd openly talk about how using sex to manipulate people made her feel powerful. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, she was a genuine monster.
What I learned is that shit-tier ENFPs tend to see walls only in terms of ""something that creates outsiders."" It's narcisstic, shallow, and insanely hypocritical. They like to identify themselves as the ""most unique"" (which complete gibberish; you can't rank most ""one of a kind"" to least ""one of a kind""... it's just one of a kind. That's all there is.) Being afflicted with such a painful ""uniqueness"" makes them feel as though they are perpetual ""outsiders."" And they are willing to screw people over in exchange for the opportunity to ""tear down walls."" It can be on the societal or between individuals (where the ""walls"" are appropriate emotional boundaries.) In either case, ENFPs at their worst are much more socially destructive than ESFPs (even at their worst).
In the case of my former friend, it seemed that whenever she wasn't trying to let the cold air in, she was letting the hot air out. In any case, shit-tier ENFPs like to mess with people's houses and call it justified."
1019,esfp,"I'd like to think I'm more stable(?) than the average ENFP. A little more organized, more pragmatic etc. ENFPs are usually type cast as the manic pixie dream girls, and I don't think that would be an accurate way of describing me. I'm not really the ""head in the clouds"" person.  I'm less of a dreamer and more of a doer. "
1020,esfp,"Many of my closest friends are ESFPs/ENFPs and almost every single girlfriend of mine has been one of the two. Interestingly I have spent the past weeks thinking about exactly this!
To me they look on the surface similar. Very outgoing, bubbly, fun, charming, great conversationalists. They keep things lighthearted, casual, enjoyable. They are extremely caring and kind to others. Fantastic friends, always lifting everyone's spirits around them. 
I think the difference is exactly what you would expect with the difference in their primary function, Se vs Ne. ESFPs live entirely in the present moment, do not like theoretical discussions, do not like to listen to worries, elaborate plans about the future, go into deep conversations about emotions, highly intellectual/theoretical topics like politics, spirituality, etc. (sure some can do this, but to a much lesser degree). ENFPs on the other hand live in their dreams, and for every thousand possibilities they dream up, they only take action on a couple of them. They love to delve into those deep, heady, emotional, spiritual conversations. If you go into a discussion on your worries, fears, or problems, they will be more likely to provide sympathy and understanding.
This is my experience. Both unbelievably great types that I have had wonderful experiences with! "
1021,esfp,"I think a lot of ENFP's are mistyped ESFP's with issues for wanting to be considered out of the box thinkers. A trait that social media (read: Fucking Linkedin) has promoted to be absolutely wanted.
Any Fi user who's not so particularly good with working around with Fi has the tendency to feel victimized. I think. And, with Ne being slightly less valued than Se in an infant (I've heard the phrase: ""Idea's are nice but you have to put them in to action!"" Quite a lot) I can see why most ENFP's have bigger feeling of being misunderstood than the ESFP. 
Ofcourse, this is highly speculative and has no facts to back it up. Merely a hypothesis.
Having said that. The main difference is between the Ne/Se and Si/Ni difference. Inferior Si for ENFP's cause them to dwell endlessly on the past, which due to the fact that a lot of us have a tendency to feel misunderstood, isn't a particularly good thing to dwell on.
Ni inferior means that the realm of Abstract concepts isn't something you feel comfortable with and would love the day-to-day physical sensations more.
The ENFP's Ne takes large leaps in data in order to construct an ""understanding"" of things around them. This can lead to people perceiving them as disorganised. 
The ESFP Interacts with the environment in a more linear and physical way. Going more on the joy of the sensations rather than the joy of what it could all mean. This may mean that the ESFP comes across as more leveled and down to earth.
Both like to play and have fuckloads of fun, but the differences are remarkably easy to see. I'm ENFP, I'm part of an ENFP facebook group which to me seems like a load of misstyped ESFP's who are in their early years. Anyway, ENFP and ESFP go along great on the fun and experience part and completely missmatch on Intuitive Talk vs Sensing Talk (I think)
Kisses and stuff;)"
1022,esfp,"I think one of the main reasons why ENFPs and ESFPs appear so similar on the internet is because most people creating/discussing MBTI content are xNTPs, Ni-doms, and xNFPs. Not to bag on any of these types, but none of these types are all that proficient/knowledgeable when it comes to Se unless their family members or close friends were Se-doms. So they all kind of just lump the ExFPs together as a whimsical/loud/emotional/laid-back person. Which is true for the first layer, and that's about it.
At a very base level ENFPs are concerned about ideals and ESFPs are concerned about actions. An ENFP protagonist will let a villian monologue, an ESFP protagonist is just gonna punch them.
Honestly, despite how many times I've seen that ENFPs are the most introverted extroverts, I'd have to disagree. ENFPs (if surrounded by other ENFPs (which is actually terrifying, don't let anyone tell you different)) can go on for days without their introversion kicking in. It's not until they're finally alone do they feel how exhausted they are. Then they hide away for a month to continue socializing for a week straight and then have to hide away, etc. Basically they're only ""introverts"" because they can't pace themselves when it comes to other people. 
ESFPs are a lot more of a slow burn extroversion. They can go for days, but need days to recharge. Not socializing as much as the ENFP, but also not needing as much time to recharge. 
ENFPs have very little survival instinct. Like, I've met so many ENFPs who accidentally pull an all-nighter or don't eat for 19 hours accidentally or just don't take care of themselves. It's not because they're stuck in a loop of self-hatred, they just don't do it. (How??????)
ESFPs tend to take conscious risks for their own reasons. If they're pulling an all-nighter it's a conscience decision to do so.
ENFPs can be incredibly manipulative. Whether intentionally manipulative or accidentally manipulative they still have a long-standing trend in my life to use people to get their own way.
ESFPs tend to be more direct and confrontational. I'm not a very confrontational person, but when I have a biff I will eventually approach the person. I've known ENFPs who've tried to get Susie to talk to Jacob to talk to Eric to talk to Hannah to talk to Elijah about the why do they hate them. Instead of just going to Elijah and asking why they hate them.
ENFPs try to be edgy. They tend to idolize certain characters in media and model themselves after that, and I've come across several who just adopt edgy mannerisms overnight because they watched a show where edgy mcedgelord was edgy. But these mannerisms never really stick for more than a month.
ESFPs are more edgy. They really don't try, but when you stick to the beat of your own drum and actually stick to it you come off as more edgy.
ENFPs are significantly more idealistic than ESFPs.
ENFPs bring a lot of the ideas to the table, whereas ESFPs are more concerned with finding their own most efficient method.
ESFPs tend to be more rude than ENFPs.
Personally, I think ENFPs like being around ESFPs more than ESFPs like being around ENFPs. Because ESFPs can tell when a situation is starting to spiral out of control or getting too chaotic, ENFPs have a much harder time 'reading the room' and end up letting things get too out of hand.
Either that, ENFPs hang back too long and don't capitalize on a plethora of great opportunities.
There's rarely a middle ground with ENFPs. ESFPs roll with the punches and end up in the weirdest situations."
1023,esfp,"I think that the difference can be summed up as ""ENFP's control their emotions, while ESFP's let their emotions control them"".
Both types prefer feelings over logic, but ENFP's are typically more emotionally adept and are better at reading people. That's not to rip on ESFP's however (and I am one), but ESFP's rely more on charm, wits, and spontaneity. We kinda wing it. "
1024,esfp,"No, not similar AT ALL.  ESFP are such shallow thinkers.  I find them extremly frustrating to talk to, they do NOT want to talk about anything deeply, especially if it is a technical or academic topic.  ENFPs are able to do this.  I also find ESFPs to be more impulsive, more hyper, more shallow, only thinking about the present moment and less considerate of other people in general that they look like jerks... they are out for themselves.  I married an ENFP, I can't stand ESFPs, that N is such a big difference.  The similarities are that both tend to be scatter brained, but the ENFP can focus IF they are deeply interested... the ESFP can't, they are just all over the place, like an adult that never grew up."
1025,esfp,"Thank you so much for your reply! I can see how those differences make sense. In what way would you say you are the same, and do you think this might be due to you being siblings or shared personality traits? If I may ask :)"
1026,esfp,"Proof that ENFPs and ESFPs are similar: 
I am an ESFP. Every time you described an ENFP, I thought ""hmm, this is kinda like me..."", then when you described ESFP right afterwards, I though ""nvm, THAT is me lol""."
1027,esfp,"We're similar in more ways than I can count. About half of those similarities manifest in our taste in chosen sensory input, such as music, food, books, video games, movies/TV shows, etc.
We're both more introverted than one would expect, despite having extroverted traits. We share a lot of the same morals and values, so we tend to have similar -- if not identical -- political, social, and religious views (we're both liberal atheists).
Although I'm sure being siblings plays a part in how similar we are by default, there's definitely a connection of mind that goes beyond that. :)"

We’ve only went out about twice, but I want to make sure that I’m doing things right. I kinda feel like I’m boring her, really. 
The last time we went out we just walked about a mall for 2 hours, is that good? 
Is there anything in particular that you guys enjoy doing? I feel like she’s actually kinda hard to talk to and open up.
Help me out
Thank you! "
1031,esfp,"Try a different style activity. Like you said, she sounds bored. Try to give her options that stimulate her more than your trip to the mall. You could ask about her interests and if she has any suggestions of things she may enjoy. Try go-karting, play a sport together, community event like a parade or festival, or go to a bar she’s never been to. Put the attention on her! Good luck :)"
1032,esfp,"I know that if I like a guy and I'm interested enough to get into a relationship, I enjoy spending alone time together so that I can get to know him. Not all ESFPs want to be constantly going out, so keep that in mind. Personally, walking around a mall sounds reeeeeally boring especially if you aren't having open and invested conversation. I hate to sound pessimistic, because I'm not trying to be, but if you two don't really click then where was the draw to be in a relationship?"
1033,esfp,"Ok (I'm a guy ESFP) but we appreciate spontaneity,a variety of different things because we do get bored easy which is why we seem fun, we just need to constantly entertain ourselves. However ESFPs are chatty but might be hard to open up, if she isn't talking much are you sure she is an ESFP?
But ESFPs are too spontaneous almost, so what is good for them is order"
1034,esfp,"It’s kind of a tough one because she never gives suggestions and keeps telling me she’ll just follow me wherever, kinda stresses me out a bit for some reason heh
She’s definitely not a sporty type though 
I tried to strike some conversations but I realised it’s actually kinda hard to talk to her since she kinda kills the conversation and to be honest she just seems kinda boring- Is she just having a tough time opening up? Do you guys open up to people quickly? "
1035,esfp,"I don’t know, I really tried to talk to her a lot over lunch on our first and tea on our second date; she really isn’t saying much and I’ve been doing most of the talking. She gives very generic answers and kinda kills the flow of the conversation. 
Well draw was I kinda had a thing for her back then, and she apparently did too. Now our exams are over so we’re trying things out. "
1036,esfp,"Good question, I’m not even sure if she’s ESFP anymore; she got that result two years ago and from what I’m seeing now, she’s a lot more introverted than extroverted..
I went to read up in ISFP instead and they seem to relate to her a lot more. I wonder if she just kinda changed or her results were kinda off? "
1037,esfp,"That’s a really good question, that’s what she got two years ago, and when I started seeing her just recently I realised it doesn’t really match up, she seems a lot more introverted than extroverted. I went over to take a look at ISFP instead and they seem to relate to her a lot more... Maybe she changed a bit? Or her first results were kinda wonky.

This post in particular"
1038,esfp,"Ah that's a tough feeling, I see what you mean. A great thing to do is to bring your creativity into other aspects of your life- you have that creative impulse, and you can use that to come at problems from an angle that others wouldn't see. 
It may take some time to develop that side of your creative mind... and it doesn't mean fantastical solutions to everyday things. Just a slightly more open way of looking at a problem, which can make all the difference. 
Essentially, I would stop looking at creativity as just for art or music, and start thinking of it as a tool for anything."
1039,esfp,"I’m also very 50/50, Mostly with N/S and P/J. I feel this probably contributes to feeling not entirely made to fit in anywhere. I’m glad to hear you can relate. I work in a retail job that I hate. there’s almost no interaction with people, I just fold clothes all day. I recently started working in a pre-school which I love because I feel rewarded through helping the children, makes me feel great. Thanks for sharing!! And at least us ESFP’s can appreciate each other’s understanding qualities, outside of the workforce :) "
1040,esfp,"YO THIS WAS CRAZY ACCURATE!
Proud ESFP here and I enjoy the #relatable posts for us party people! I found that acting and being a stage precence is definitely something ESFPs shine bright in. You should give that a shot! I did and I found my calling! I love to entertain others in every way I can but I always feel like I can't do things correctly and it takes longer for me to understand certain complex topics. Its rare to see ESFPs online, so I appreciate you for posting about yourself and representing the funnest MBTI type everrrr"
1041,esfp,"Intresting insight, thanks for your suggestion!!! I definitely want to develop my creativity. And it’s not that ESFPS don’t have talent, however I think my “talent” is understanding people feelings, reading people and just people in general, I love people and know how to make them happy and when their sad I can relate and understand their feelings. It’s just that I feel that’s a skill that isn’t always appreciated. It’s perhaps appreciated socially but not in work.. that I’ve discovered yet anyway. I feel like the education system wasn’t made for ESFPS. Our quality lies in our connection with people not in any particular subject. May I ask, are you an ESFP yourself ?"
1042,esfp,"I am an ESFP, although I tend towards 50/50 for some of the traits. I completely agree, the things that we specialize in are not highly-valued in the workforce. There are areas that use those skills well, like customer support, but it's challenging to move up in a company without transitioning to management.
I work in a design role that lets me talk to clients and interpret their needs... I do get to use some of the areas that ESFPs feel comfortable in. But mostly I feel like I struggle against my nature trying to fit into the workforce. "
1043,esfp,"Growing up, I saw a lot of music videos with what I assume are ESFPs, and the way the walk, the way they talk, it's got me madly in love. Whenever I find an ESFP in fiction or that one girl who might be an ESFP I get a small crush, but she's already in a relationship. So, ESFPs on the internet, please tell me the places you go through in life.
As an INTP I can say that you can find me either borrowing books in the library, either borrowing books about some science or fantasy; or you can find me wherever my friends take me. Yes, I get that I don't do these things every week, but I don't really do much aside from working out, going to school, and going home to be on the internet. The biggest chance you've got of catching me would be at my gym or at school."
1044,esfp,"ESFPs are pretty much everywhere but as with any type, there is a huge variation in terms of how they present themselves to the world. Your idealistic view of them might not work in reality for every ESFP you encounter so you may not know. When you've met one right away.
They're everywhere though, just go outside lol. "
1045,esfp,"hii esfp here. to be honest the esfps presented in the media are usually idealised versions of us or at least our actions are romanticised to the extent that makes our portrayals are unrealistic. 
but i do agree that there are some places that most esfps enjoy visiting - so i assume that means you might have a higher chance of bumping into one there. places like amusement parks, concerts, raves, festivals, bars, clubs, casinos etc.
hope that helped!! x good luck"
1046,esfp,"My wife is an ESFP.  I think there are a lot out there but unlike INFPs like myself they really couldn't give a flying leap about MBTI, Grave's Dynamic Spiral or and of this shtuff... unless of course it is token gesture, their way of showing interest in their xNFx counterpart. "
1047,esfp,"ESFPs have the most right brained personality. They have a constant flow of social energy, and are always able to engage with people. Most of the other MBTI personalities are jealous of at least one of their many qualities. 
Benefits of being a (healthy) ESFP- 
- Ability to smoke massive amounts of weed and still feel fine
- Always able to tune into the moment
- Not prone to anxiety
- Popular in all social settings
- Ability to be automatically respected by others 
- Always knows self 
- Ability to connect with God quicker than all other personality types. Often times simply by looking up at the stars and thinking, listening to music, etc. "

1049,esfp,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
1050,esfp,Idk that this counts. But I have kissed someone else while unofficially dating (didn't have the boyfriend/girlfriend talk) someone else. I was drinking and it was fun but I got a huge rush of guilt and told them about it.  That's pretty much the closest I've gotten to cheating. 
1051,esfp,"ESFP here, and my partner is INTJ. We have been together almost 25 years.  I'm deeply ashamed about this, but early in our marriage (20 years ago this year) I did cheat on him.  For about six months, I participated in an emotional affair with a coworker who lived in another country.  During a week-long business trip, the affair became physical. We had a total of three physical encounters that week.
Prior to the trip, I felt zero guilt about what I was doing.  I felt that I was being deliberately ""starved"" of any physical and emotional attention as punishment for my shortcomings in my relationship. This was in fact, true.  My husband did not feel like I was being the kind of wife he thought I should be, and therefore did not want to indulge my need for his attention or affection.  And although I did not set out to cheat, or seek out this other person, when it became clear he had feelings for me I felt completely entitled to the attention and basked in it.
During the encounters, however, it was different.  I tried, but I just could not let go and enjoy what we were doing. 
For many years afterwards, I battled intense guilt and depression over what I had done, including a suicide attempt.  I finally disclosed everything to my husband a little over three years ago.  "
1052,esfp,"I fucking love being around you guys. I've been told that I'm just a great ball of sunshine and charisma. But y'all just always seem to be so invested in the moment and I semi-envy that. I can always tell when I'm in the room with one of y'all, and I always look forward to sharing the spotlight with you and then just watching you do your thing. Keep being your loud selves!!! I fucking love y'all, and some advice for you less mature ESFPs: don't give a shit what anyone thinks about you and quit hesitating because everyone else is just waiting to hear your shitty jokes/stories/nonsense cause they don't have any. "
1053,esfp,"Hey, 
I am an INTJ and one of my closest friend is an EXFP ( I think she is an ESFP ) and we do get on pretty well. We do live far from each other ( around halfway across the world ) but I guess our bond is special or used to be. Since a few months she has been different, I noticed a pattern that there is one day everyweek when she will just ignore me ? Like I can spot that she is online elsewhere but will leave me on seen. Happened on Sunday but on Saturday she was like “Love you Chloek07” etc etc, I don’t get this inconsistent behaviour. I do understand she has other friends. She is modestly popular. I have told her if she can’t talk, then she can just let me know. But she never listens. Lately she has been dating a lot as well, it all started around the same time. She started going out more, I am a bit worried right now because there has been this change in her behaviour. She is out on dates every week, which is fine but it’s been a bit sudden. This and the inconsistent behaviour has me a bit worried. Also, she sometimes dodges my questions, I will ask her something and she won’t even reply to me. Just ignore my question. Idk I am a bit worried right now. 
Edit : She also has lied to me on a few occasions and I found out about it. A lot of white lies and keeping things from me. "
1054,esfp,"I have an friend who I share this type of relationship with, she is like a sister to me as well. In the past, it sometimes got super overwhelming for me to always have one person fighting for my attention, especially because I make friends easily and just talk to a lot of people in general. I always try to keep everyone I speak to happy, and when I constantly have to make sure that this one friend is always happy, I get tired and grumpy. Instead of yelling at her (because there isn’t anything to yell about) I tended to just ignore her for a bit. It was never maliciously meant, and I always got back to her later.
ESFP’s tends to not like being held down, and generally flows from groups to groups. Doesn’t mean you’re less important to her, just means she might enjoy different company once in a while.
Also try and think about the topics your conversations consists of. If it’s always about the same things, that can also be a reason she sometimes pulls away. "
1055,esfp,"I think you are over thinking. It's a world of constant connectivity and I personally find that I have to be in the right state of mind in order to respond to people. I leave them on ""seen"" because I can't stand the unread notification or because I absent mindedly open the app or because I have the time to read, but not respond. But mindlessly scrolling through social media doesn't take any effort (sadly) and therefore ends up being a place to go even when I don't have the energy to talk directly to friends. It's sad but it seems to be the norm now. 
I think you have two options: 
1) Talk to her directly about these issues. If you feel that both of your maturity levels can handle the adult conversation without hurting feelings afterwards
2) Deal with it personally. Live a bit further from your cell phone and from her life, connect with other friends 
​"
1056,esfp,"EXFP here with high NN and super high SSS.  So what exactly are you ""worried"" about?  That she has a life? That she spends time doing other things? That she isn't a methodically predictable set of properties?  LOL.  I'm feeling a bit of clingy all over you and as an EXFP girl my general reaction to someone I kinda value but kinda rubs me wrong sometimes, is to just kind of tune out or ignore more often, the more they do the undesirable behaviour.  Clingy is undesirable, btw. Best advice:  just start initiating convos WAY less often.  What's the right amount?  Somewhere around when you achieve 50/50 with how often she initiates."
1057,esfp,"Are you dating? Because if not she doesnt really owe you anything. I know you are worried and have good Intentions, but its also not usually a good idea to push people when they are showing you they dont want to talk about something. I think the best thing to do is find some dates yourself, let her know you are supportive and dont push back when she dodges questions. 
If that's too much for you maybe just take some time away to sort yourself out. 
The last thing you wanna do is push her away by being too assertive and getting involved further than she wants. You can't protect her or help her recover when she is down if you arent around."
1058,esfp,"So, I sent her a text message in the morning saying “that I miss talking to her” and she was at work. We texted a bit and then I asked her “if she would like to text tonight ?” She said “yes” and I waited but nothing. I am sorry but I am kind of concerned about her behaviour, I wanna be a good friend but I am running out of patience. "
1059,esfp,But do you do that to your best friend ? Do you ignore them but talk to others ? I pretty much know that she does that. I can accept not being friends and even close but then she will just come out and say things “you are like my sister” etc etc and it just gets too much for me. Like why be two faced ? You know what I mean ? She will speak to other people throughout the day and will ignore me. I guess I am not important enough then. If you can talk to others extensively then you can talk to me as well. That’s the part I don’t understand. 
1060,esfp,"No, she and I are both straight. I guess you are right, I gotta get on with my life. I just worry about my friends you know ? I know she doesn’t owe me anything but the two face nature kinda stings sometimes. "
1061,esfp,"I would second what u/hippieloulou said. If she's ESFP, she's likely out and about a lot, doing things. That can enable being occasionally on the phone, therefore showing as online, but not really be in chatting mode. If I'm doing stuff, I'll check my phone for transport, and for logistics, or even for a couple memes, but I don't want to commit to staring at the screen when I'm doing stuff, so even if someone I like texts, unless it's a crush, I leave it for later, when I have time. This also goes for people I like a lot, because there are so many commitments people require from me, and I just don't have the mental capacity for it all. There are days when 14 different people want to chat with me, often about their problems, but there is no way I'm able to chat with 14 people. The fact that occasionally taking time for myself over my various connections means to them that I don't like or care about you gives me anxiety. And in the past has guilt-tripped me into spreading myself thin for them.
She's not ignoring you as much as she's trying to take ownership of her life. And if she's dating, then that's something new and exciting in her life that she's trying to explore, so she will have less time to spend online. It sucks to be the friend whose life is constant, thus the change seems drastic, and I've been there too, but it's not personal. Most people are self-centered enough that they focus on their life, so she's not focused on how this change impacts you. She will learn to communicate better over time, but probably she doesn't know how to have hard conversations with grace yet."
1062,esfp,"My bad, seemed kinda romantically involved, but looking back it isn't really explicit haha
But yea, people grow and change and that's normal. It can suck but that's how it is. Sometimes people need room to make mistakes and be their own person. It seems like you are still friends, thats good. "
1063,esfp,"I agree, I think what's bothering u/ChloeK07 is that this seems to be a change in behavior, not that her friend is generally flakey. Speaking as an ENFP though, I agree that it's probably just a change in her life, especially since you guys live far apart from each other. I will go through times when I get super interested in something or someone and everything else not related to that will fall to the wayside. I know it sucks to not be able to be close with someone who you really like spending time with. At the same time, the other person probably is not doing this intentionally and there's really not much you can do to control another person's life. So I would suggest that you tell her that you miss her just so she knows, and try to find other things to occupy your time until she comes around again. Sometimes friends just drift apart and it can be heartbreaking especially if it's not mutual - but that's life! Good luck and sending you lots of warm thoughts."
1064,esfp,"my brother, an esfp, just had his heart broken by a woman he was deeply in love with. just this weekend he shared with us that he was going to ask her to marry him, and now this happened. i want to do what i can to help him through this, but i'm at a loss of what i can do. he's the only feeler in our family since our dad passed away, as well as the only male. and i know zero about relationships so i can't even give him any helpful advice.
if it was me hurting, i'd want to be left alone to think and process and analyze until i could make sense of what happened and how i feel. but i'm VERY aware that this isn't a method that works for everyone. 
i tried distracting him today with a new video game. we had a nice conversation about playstyles, battle preferences, and ranking franchises by the quality of their combat systems. it seemed to cheer him up, if just for a while. i also spent a few hours today texting him star wars memes. he loves those. even managed to find some he hadn't seen yet.
how am i doing so far? and any advice on what else i can do? i really am at a loss here. 
thanks for listening.

1065,esfp,"ESFP's will normally want to be alone for the healing process. You may find them declining to leave the house, or join their friends in activities until they are out of their rut.  ESFP's have a natural confidence in themselves, and being spurned by their loved ones can take its toll on their psych. We mostly need time to feel sorry for ourselves, and might actively prevent being cheered up until we do so. 
You can speed this process by giving us an opportunity to feel needed.  Remind  us of our value by asking our opinions on things, asking us to help with something we are good at, and we will be our normal confident self soon enough.   
Guys tend to take breakups harder than ladies, and pout for longer about it, so don't expect a dramatic return to form  for at least a week or two. But ESFP's bounce back to full strength faster than others, and we will be looking for something else to admire in no time. "
1066,esfp,"Just wanna say you sound like a very kind person. :)
From my experience with break-ups or just hard times in general, being surrounded by friends and family who truly care about me is what ultimately brings me out of what feels like an emotional abyss. I know it's not always natural or comfortable to try comforting someone when you aren't an open feeler, but knowing that someone would even try can mean everything and make all of the difference.
Distractions from thinking about the difficult shit is important. From what you've said, you sound like you know your brother well and you don't need advice from me or anyone on how to comfort him."
1067,esfp,"Wow you’re so sweet! 
I would want to just have someone there with me.  After my most recent break up I ended up just bouncing from one friend’s house to another because I really didn’t want to be alone. He might want to talk about it sometimes and he might really not want to other times and both are ok. "
1068,esfp,"exactly what you are doing right now is awesome!
giving space but letting him know he can talk to you (without constantly repeating that) and distracting him with things he enjoys, will definitely help the grieving process. plus just being with someone he loves and cares about would cheer him up. 
it's a process, and he'll make his way out of it. dont worry. you sound lovely!"
1069,esfp,"Hi. I'm an INFP. My ESFP friend needs some help for his future. He often tells me he wished he had my ability to look to my future and plan exactly what I want. He doesn't know what he wants. He is an excellent artist and I try to push him to get a career in that but his ISFJ parents, one of whom tried it as an artist and failed are telling him to not go to university and get a job right now. He is actually questioning what he wants to do and I respect his choice but I want it to he his choice. I told him it'd be better to at least try with your talent and not regret a missed opportunity. He personally doesn't  know what to do. So I thought I'd ask you for him. He is awaiting some help from  you guys. What do you think he should do? Should he listen to his ISFJ parents in quickly getting married and getting a job or should he try for his future?"
1070,esfp,"I'm a 20 year old ESFP. He needs to do what he wants as an individual. He probably FEELS like he knows what he wants, but is discouraged by the main influencers in his life. Keep encouraging him to listen to his heart and push him to make his own decision. It's probably all he needs."
1071,esfp,"It’s tough, I went overseas to do volunteer work for 2 years because I didn’t know what I wanted to pursue. I also worked a little bit after high school still trying to figure it out. The real problem is that we feel that we are good at so many things, and excited by all of them that we don’t know what we really want. I’m about to turn 22 and have finally figured it out. When I move back to California, I’ll be pursuing acting. In a way, I’ll be able to do do many jobs, without being stuck to one."
1072,esfp,"Hi ESFPs,
So I apparently scared away one of your type by sending a very needy text and I'd like to know how you guys can get over people so easily. The ease with which he was able to stop talking to me is frightening to me and its making me think there HAS to have been something else I did that I missed, or maybe something he didn't like that he wouldn't tell me about (b/c I confronted him about the matter). I waved hello for a long ass time tonight, and it was like I was invisible, not even a look in my direction. I've never felt so ignored in my life. 
Please enlighten me as to what I may have missed in our short ""relationship"".
Thanks in advance y'all.
-22/F/ENFP
P.S. I'm not as upset about the loss of the potential ""us"" as I am about being completely ignored and invisible to him."
1073,esfp,"I don't get over people easily but let's be clear, this is only for people I deeply care about and/or people who I feel I wronged in some way. For the ones I deeply care about, I never get over - ever - until a reconnection is established and then I can rest in peace. For the wronged ones, once I correct the wrong in some way, I'm able to get over fairly easily since there's no reason to hold on. There have been times in my life when I've let go of someone without any trouble whatsoever because I was never into them beyond physical attraction. With such people, I will enjoy their company and spend time with them as long as I know they don't have feelings for me. The moment I do know, I will express my thoughts and feelings in a VERY clear manner so they know not to pursue their feelings. 9 times out of 10, they are unable to control their feelings and I go away because I don't want to keep them from being happy. I'm not going to keep you around for my physical pleasure knowing I'm preventing you from pursuing other, more meaningful, relationships where you may find what you're looking for. Sorry to break it to ya but I think that is the case with your lover boy here."
1074,esfp,"we burn bridges easily... it's in our nature. it's something I detest about my type however each type has its corks! you could try to rekindle it but his brain is thinking ""well that didn't work out, so fuck it"". good luck!"
1075,esfp,"Even with people I care about, I can go some time without even thinking about them. It's usually because I'm preoccupied with something. If it's not a strong relationship, I can see myself being able to fade it out pretty quickly. I don't think I'd do that since it's happened to me, and I know it sucks. My emotions are pretty rigid, so it takes a lot to get me to consider someone to be a good friend instead of a regular friend."
1076,esfp,We live in the moment. Personally I have a one strike rule for that kind of stuff because it's an indication this person is gonna suck the life right out of me. ESFP and ENFP are not good together at all.
1077,esfp,"Either I'm in the wrong sub or burning bridges is not an ESFP thing but a person thing. I never let go of people unless it's a toxic relationship that's hurting more than helping. For e.g. I'm on good terms with most of my exes except for a couple who turned real crazy towards the end. One threatened to ""destroy me"" whatever that means and the other was just too obsessed and I've been there so I know what that's like and hence I completely cut off all relations so they'd be able to move on."
1078,esfp,"I really want to ask him about his ability to burn bridges, and he said he wanted to be friends, but he's not acting like one ignoring me. My ISTJ coworker said it might be because I touched a nerve with something I said during my confrontation. But I don't know what it was, or maybe its the simple ""didn't work out, so fuck it"" idea thats causing his current disregard for me."
1079,esfp,"You don't flit between two opposite dominant functions. You're an  ENFP as exhibited by ""I have periods where I am needy and periods where I want to be alone and everyone can go away."" Along with the rest of your longass answer. You can get out of the ESFP sub now."
1080,esfp,"I asked an ISTJ I worked with for his input and he came up with the fact that one should not demand anything even if a simple response in text form from people they've only been talking to for 2 weeks. I am not his: Mom, Wife, or GF (as he put it). The ESFP did not deserve to hear any kind of fuss from me. ""Needy text"", he was at work and I knew he was busy, but decided to push for a response anyway."
1081,esfp,"INTP here, getting cut off completely by an ESFP can be an extremely traumatic way of ""getting over"" someone. We really just need to hear that you aren't feeling it anymore, it's nothing personal but you aren't interested. Getting cut off leaves us not knowing where we stand, which is pretty much torture for us INTPs who need logical order."
1082,esfp,"Oh, I didn't mean to imply that the cutting off happens suddenly and without reason. I'm very open and straightforward about what I want and in this case, don't want. I make that very clear before any cutting off happens and it only happens as a last resort if I can see the person is struggling with moving on primarily because I'm still in their life."
1083,esfp,"ESFP cutting off an INTP.. but leaving these types aside, It's hurtful to cut someone off to begin with and then to do so without an explanation is just downright inhumane. You shouldn't wallow. Get over him and embrace freedom from someone cruel like that."
1084,esfp,"You're simultaneously right and wrong. It's extremely hurtful to cut someone off without explanation, yet you seem to still advocate for cutting people off to ""let them get over it"". That works if the person you're cutting off is another ESFP, but if they are an analyst type (especially an immature one), that analyst type WILL wallow and suffer."
1085,esfp,"As I mentioned earlier,"
1086,esfp,"Kinda a weird thing to ask, I guess, but I wanted to see what like minded people's responses would be!
Anger, more often than not, is marked down with negative societal connotations. It's seen as irrational, unnecessary and generally a bit shit. 
I have always used anger as a focus point. Making the connotations a bit more muddy, for me - as in they're not wholly negative. Anything that made me feel unsure or insecure - anxiousness, indecision, confusion, uncertainty - I've funnelled into anger, as in the past I wasn't quite equipped with the mental patience to properly deal with those separate emotions individually.
Now this doesn't mean that every time I felt these things, I would break out in a blind fury and release the beast within. It's actually the opposite. I used it to focus myself. I used anger to motivate myself and spur myself into action to eradicate the source these feelings. 
Hell, I even used it get through my high school exams.
I definitely am not the only person in the world who feels that anger isn't a wholly negative emotion - that you can manipulate that vigour to benefit yourself. 
Brings me to ask, what is anger to you? How do you experience anger? 
Big love <3"
1087,esfp,"Anger is not a negative emotion, always.. It's when you're coming off a place of defence when it becomes negative and obssesive.
But anger in general is there to motivate us to reach our point better, it's the manifestation of your passion into words, tones, etc..
For me, anger is something I havn't let myself express at all around anyone but my mother.. You gotta let it out though."
1088,esfp,I don't allow myself to express anger either; doing so would indicate a lack of self-control and therefore makes me look weak to the opponent. I love seeing other people angry though; it means I've been able to get a rise out of them! :D 
1089,esfp,"Let me elaborate, the one-word response certainly looks cool, but it doesn't really provide anything of substance haha. Anyway, I think it's more the desire for justice for one's self or others when that justice is being willfully or wrongfully deprived. The determination to restore that justice is, to me, where I draw my anger and what anger really is to me. "
1090,esfp,"I don't understand how repressing anger makes me pretentious. 
By the way, it's pretty funny to me how you choose to get angry at your mom but not at strangers, considering all that she's done for you"
1091,esfp,"OH! Thanks for sticking your nose into something that you know nothing of. Funny.. Hahahaha funny!! XD.. I fucking have nights where I can't sleep over it. God dammit people can be so ignorant and cruel sometimes, have some humility jesus, i'm sorry that I offended you but when you use words like 'opponent' and 'weak', and when you take pride in that you hurt someone else, yes it does seem pretentious, or ignorant to say the least.. "
1092,esfp,"""Ignorant and cruel"" hey I just made an objective observation based on words taken directly from your previous post. You attacking me as ""pretentious"" is completely subjective because someone else can view my approach as pure self-defense. With that said, I wonder how your mother would react to reading our entertaining verbal scuffle. She'll probably be amazed that you treat internet strangers better than you treat her. :'( "
1093,esfp,"Hey, doesn't matter if it's defense or offense. Calling people 'opponent', and the entire tone of all of your post. sound.. pretentious. While I don't understand why you do it(It's understandable nevertheless), what really boggles my mind is why throughout all of your posts here you just keep proving my point. You don't have to make an identity out of this.  And it seems like we made an entire lap, Just as you can chose to express anger fully in-the-moment and it would not mean you become anger(making an identity of it), you can be pretentious all you want, but once you make an identity of that, it'll start to consume you, and cause you to find ways to verify itself. Unless you realize the truth of yourself, you will continue down this path, since you've been mocking and insulting me, even after i've made it clear that my emotions were hurt. Eventually you will wake up, I don't believe you to be a fool, slightly misunderstood perhaps. when you wake up I hope you won't haunt yourself over whoever else you've hurt while in this state. Reading this might be confusing, since your ego is in the way of understand, the current you might not even be able to make the sentences here work! but if you have interest, then let it grow since it's beautiful, and if you care for yourself, then ask yourself, 'Does this individual have any knowledge I can use for myself?'. Or i'm just bullshitting you, and you've red all this for nothing."
1094,esfp,"Was talking to my boyfriend last night (ENTP) and he was talking about how he never thought he would see himself with an ESFP based on how much shit he had talked about them in past. 
Who else has had this experience/ what's the worst stereotype you've heard about ESFP?
Definitely wasn't offended and I almost like that people will often think I'm vapid/ childish before actually getting to know me because of my MBTI- in fact I love taking them by surprise. A lot of NTs and particularly NTJs are fun to test this out on!!"
1095,esfp,"Flighty. I hate that. I'm sorry but some people drag things out when they're miserable and would rather do something else or be with someone else. At least we're real about it! 
I agree with you. And I see this as a good thing. If someone takes enough time to get to know those parts of me. I greatly respect them. Everyone else is just a fun party. But it can bug me in work settings. Some people can be rude. 
We're not stupid, we just prefer to smell the roses not talk about what type they are or what they're called or what other flowered they're related too. There's a time and place for everything. "
1096,esfp,"I mean, I like ESFPs honestly. I have a cousin-in-law who's one and we get along swimmingly. I think the ESFP/ENTP relationship requires two well developed people to make it work, but when it does, it's a blast.
Oh, am an ENTP, to make sure to point it out."
1097,esfp,"HEY what's up I'm also an ENTP with a ESFP girlfriend and I believed all the stereotypes. Well my girlfriend sort of does look like a stereotypical party girl and that made me laugh it matches soo well with the stereotype. Outgoing she matches that stereotype, she matches the needing attention stereotype. The worst stereotype i've heard was that ESFP's move on and like everyone as a romantic partner, this made me nervous, but then I realized she and a lot of ESFP's are more loyal than that."
1098,esfp,Reading posts where people are using really inaccurate type theory to talk trash about ESFPs being stupid...
1099,esfp,"For sure! I see no need to make myself unhappy! 
It is true- my respect for him did increase substantially/ I guess I felt validated that I had changed someone's perspective. 
Yup- high energy, fast moving, practical, what is not to love?"
1100,esfp,I hope we are well developed! We're both pretty young but I'm at a point in my life where I've kinda flipped through a lot of meaningless relationships as my mood modulates but since leaving school I've felt stable/ more in touch with myself :) 
1101,esfp,"Hahahahahahahhahaha the needing attention one got me the amount of times I have texted my boyfriend when I'm bored or asked for a massage or tapped his shoulder when he doesn't pay attention to me is astounding but I think he looks at me like I'm just a really playful puppy so he's happy to give me as much as possible.
I have been quite fast paced in moving on before but...I have more time and freedom now, so I think I'll be around for a while. 
I reckon what we mainly need is entertainment, and when we're not being entertained, we leave. Since I've left school and gotten way more invested in my life and started conforming to my own expectations that's my entertainment, and the person I love is someone enjoying that with me rather than providing it for me.
So I feel you and your girlfriend must be in a really good place right now :) "
1102,esfp,"edit: 6/30 ESFPs have taken this survey. Need 24 more!
Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
1103,esfp,"Hey all! Great reading all the posts here and on the ISTJ page. Just getting into the dating game and would love to hear your perspective. Obviously MBI says that our fire & ice combo is a good fit and have seen some good examples in these subs. But I haven't been able to find any posts regarding how an ISTJ has made the first move. How should people, like yours truly, differentiate ourselves from our more lively and boisterous peers?
A couple of posts I've seen here have said something along the lines of: ""I love shy/introverted girls"" but have not seen the case where being an ISTJ male has worked out. But if it did, did you initiate? Or did he? 
Thanks guys!  "
1104,esfp,"I gotta be honest I don't buy this combo works as well as it ""should"". I've found ISTJs to be either too uh, boring...or well, know it all assholes. But this doesn't mean you are of course. I just don't have much in common with an ISTJ personality wise. Personally I go for people who are...well they're usually other ESFPs to be honest. Everyone has different taste though. It just depends on the individual ESFP. Treat us like anyone else, get to know us but don't be all clingy and text us all hours of the day, and don't pry too much cuz we can be kind of private with our inner lives/feelings."
1105,esfp,"I've been with an ISTJ male before and it went pretty well, I started it though we were both mutually into it and such, but it was a long distance relationship due to meeting online and such. We did actually get to meet in person, but that caused me to end it off as I'd rather the relationship be closer than only getting to meet each year once. 
But as far as relationships with ISTJs, I think it could go pretty smoothly, as long as both sides keep up with communication and the ESFP doesn't take criticism to heart.
I hope this helps!"
1106,esfp,"I'm talking to an ISTJ at the moment and we've been on a few dates. We met through online dating, I initiated the convo and after talking for a fair bit I gave him my number. Our dates have been good, we get along really well. 
Since our first date we've both been initiating other plans.
The only thing that annoys me is that he comes off as arrogant or I'm not sure if that's just him being playful. It just doesn't suit him. "
1107,esfp,No problem! Thanks for telling it straight. Definitely the clinginess is something I can see being an issue cause for those whom get most of their satisfaction from the feeling of accomplishing something for someone else. Good but can easily overreach boundaries 
1108,esfp,After spending a day or two alone without talking to anyone (just watching Netflix or playing video games or whatever) when I get out I feel really down and cloudy and irritable. But after a few hours of spending time with people like after hanging out with friends or going to a gettogether I feel happy and excited and talk more. Do you experience this or it’s just me ?

1110,esfp,"For those of you who don't know, he's an ESFP, and I am somewhat glad because, despite only ever seeing him in one short film, I fucking love the guy.
""I don't have a goal; I don't have an ambition. My ambition has always been the project I am on... ""
""why don't you just make this project your favorite project in the world? Then the next one. Then all of a sudden everything has been worthwhile.""

1111,esfp,"I absolutely loved Mads in Hannibal. To me, he came off as a super INTJ character in that show, and it's so funny to watch him out of character in interviews because he is so damn bubbly and giddy and nothing at all like many of the characters I've seen him play."
1112,esfp,"I am 16 and my brother and I get along really well, the problem is he's always on Xbox and has been more anti social since last month. We almost always have stuff to talk about but lately we have nothing to talk about. He's always making excuses not to go to the gym or hang out with me. I'm really patient but this is pissing me off.!"
1113,esfp,"I'm an INTP so maybe I can help you out. I can only speak for myself and I'm not sure how much of this is actually resulting from my MBTI type.
We need private ""recharging"" time before we can go out and do social things again, its rarely a good idea to forcibly interrupt this - we appreciate autonomy.
We also enjoy engaging our imagination. Se means you ESFPs want to get out there and seize the day, we on the other hand enjoy exploring too, but different things, like ideas and concepts. Videogames often explore ideas so we can very easily lose ourselves in them. These wont be found at the gym, and in the physical world - we don't have too much patience for stuff like this, they bore us and seem mundane and superficial.
An idea for something an INTP and ESFP could bond over: improv comedy classes?
It could engage with our Ne, and our quirky/eccentric side comes out, which is the side of the INTPs that ESFPs tend to enjoy the most. Don't expect him to immediately like the idea though, and don't force it upon him - but explain that everyone going into it is equally awkward and shit at it.
Maybe try and engage his Fe by explaining that you miss him and want to do more stuff with him."
1114,esfp,"Sounds a bit more like me as a 9 if I'm honest! 2s and 3s don't look to be very common based on the googling I've done, INTPs tend to either be 5s or 9s. 9s are softies who don't want to offend anyone apparently.
Relating this back to MBTI. Our lowest function is extraverted feeling. Basically this is when your ""feeling"" is involved with the emotional state of others, empathy, and it picks up well on stuff like body language and tone of voice. But its our inferior function so its pretty immature in us. With 9s being notoriously scared of offending and not being liked, it makes sense that an INTP who picks up on emotional cues, but is clumsy at dealing with them could be a 9. It makes us sensitive but its not very healthy because its basically a paranoia that we're going to hurt/affect you.
I don't know if this is necessarily true for your brother, but it could be."
1115,esfp,"Wings are always the adjacent number (eg 5w4 or 5w6)
this video might help you work it out a bit more easily - listening to it I know shes 100% right about me as the 9."
1116,esfp,"This is sorta for me sorta for a friend.
I'm an ESFP and he's and INTJ l. One of my very best friends.
What type is your best mate or mates? 
My INTJ is going back to college to study psychology and I sorta just wanted to find out who other ESFPs hang out with. "
1117,esfp,My oldest friend is an ISTP (also my boyfriend). My two best friends of the past few years are both male INTJ's and they're both grad students. Pretty sure the vast majority of my good friends throughout my life have been IxTx.
1118,esfp,"2 INFPS. Which I connected to very easily, they also developed my Fi a LOT. and also Ne.
INTJ, Took me a long time to figure out how to even approach a conversation with, but when I understood how to, I also started to really accept him."
1119,esfp,"x-posted to other MBTI subreddits
Hi gang,
I  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality. Check it out here:
https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd
Come  find more people of your type, or seek for others of compatible (or not  compatible) types! Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!"
1120,esfp,"Mad Men definitely - The characters are so real. I actually used this show to sharpen my understanding of MBTI, because the characters are so brilliant and internally consistent. It really stands apart from other TV shows in this manner.
[Also: the sets, the costumes, and the GLAMOUR. Intensely visually appealing. And the props are totally authentic.]"
1121,esfp,"IMO Saul gets shafted in Breaking Bad because his character serves more as a foil for the heavier hitters of the show. In BCS he becomes a much more compelling character in his own right instead of just a supporting character. 
That being said, I don't think it's a must-watch. If you have an hour or two to spare I recommend checking it out though. "
1122,esfp,"It's one of the best shows on TV. They never toy with the audience or make you feel cheap. Mike is also back doing badass things and he gets his own storyline, getting a ton of screen time. If you liked BrBa, you will like BCS. Gus Fring also back."
1123,esfp,"Because I do like being with people but I don’t throw myself in the spotlight and I’m never the life of the party like ever. Lol
reads this subreddit’s description
Does that make me an isfp or something 
Because that sterotype is spread around literally everywhere, just search esfp on literally everywhere and you’ll see what I mean. It’s ridiculous "
1124,esfp,"I definitely like being in the spotlight if that’s what being the life of the party means. I dont really care if people get on board tho, I’ll have my own fun within the party. Sometimes some people will follow but most of the time I’m an outsider at parties. Being the life of the party as in leading the party sounds much more like a Fe thing to me."
1125,esfp,I don't think so because I don't like parties because too many introverts smoking pot there and I don't like drugs they're lame. But I do love hanging out with friends and talking about my life and what I did! 
1126,esfp,I use the moments when I feel optimistic and energized about getting stuff done to accept responsibilities and make promises. I work better with the stick so I put myself into a position where if I dont get the thing done I’m in big trouble.
1127,esfp,"Other ESFPs are not bad, I've had positive experiences with them(us? lol). I'm also into ENTJ girls, but haven't dated one yet. I think INTJs can be good romantic matches for us, as well as other introverts, ISTPs, INFPs, maybe ISFPs(I can see INTP working too)"
1128,esfp,"I like other Gammas. Haven't dated an ISFP, but ESFP, ENTJ, and INTJ, I've done before. ENTJs tend to be my best friends, and are fun dates, but I find them too bossy and too cold for something where emotions should be involved. ESFP and INTJ were the best combos for me.
​
ENTPs, damn... Usually I start off with being annoyed by everything they do, down to how they breathe. But we make good friends. We can't work together, or rely on each other's perception or activity, that's mutually frustrating, but we can have similar fun, and bounce off jokes off of each other nicely. Good for a back-and-forth. And despite so many ENTPs being major trolls, those I know actually have a really good heart and are really helpful when you need help. "
1129,esfp,"Well my boyfriend of 5 years is an INFJ and although we’re opposites in the way we approach the world we have the same values. This means we help balance each other out a lottt. He gets me to do boring tasks including taking care of money properly and I’m very grateful he does that, I get him out of his shell in social situations! "
1130,esfp,"What you listed out first are all Gamma types (value exactly the same cognitive functions), so that makes a lot of sense ;)
I've dated ESFP, ENTJ, and INTJ, and I see why that worked for me. The ESFP-ESFP was most fun and most mutual understanding. The ESFP-INTJ was the most in love I've ever been, and most constructive, and growth inducing relationship. It's not possible to have that again, but if I ever have an opportunity to have something like that, I'm going for it!"
1131,esfp,"That one letter different makes a lot of difference. It means two of your valued functions are different. You perceive the world along an entirely different axis, even though your value systems operate the same, they're based on different input of data.
ESFP values Se and Ni, while ENFP values Ne and Si. They both value Fi and Te."
1132,esfp,Not being able to actively rely on each others perception sometimes.. him getting emotional when we argue and then i guess when he got extremely defensive i got emotional to and would be pretty harsh. Though i have learnt from my past and am continuing to become calmer and nicer when i disagree.. 
1133,esfp,"Hi there!
Long story short: personally, I adore ESFPs and would love to know more of them (not in a creepy way :) ). So I'm looking for your advice about places and occasions where they are more likely to be met. Any information might be helpful: what is your (or your ESFP friend's) hobby, where you like to hang out, etc.
I guess, every fellow INTP like me would be thankful for this information :)"
1134,esfp,"I met my ESFP husband by doing a show at my college, and he was the master carpenter. Most of the ESFPs I have met have come from my area's theater scene, doing either acting or tech work. So, you might have some luck in that arena, too. If you're willing to learn how to run a lightboard or paint a set, you can probably get involved in helping at your local college or community theaters. Competent techies are always in high demand."
1135,esfp,"seriously dude?! you can find us on trees of north woods ,we live there cause our favorite fruit on that trees. wtf with people all i see here is about dating ,how? where? who? are you hopeless that far ,go out find a random girl ,it's not about personality test result it's about your capabilities and what you have.  "
1136,esfp,I lived with an INTP for 3 years. It's easy to meet us but for INTPs it might be challenging unless your friend dragged you out to a bar or party. If an INTP wants to meet an ESFP you would need to go out with friends to some social function 
1137,esfp,"I agree with you, we are everywhere, as most types of people are, I guess, but when you want contact with us, don't be afraid to start conversation yourself, don't expect us to come to you just because we're ESFP, we're not psychic, we don't always know who to approach.
Other than that I would also encourage you to go to places where cool people are, parties, clubs etc, but somewhere you can talk to people, we like talking. "
1138,esfp,"Ok, some clarification then. It's not easy to id ESFP just by sight in a bar or a casino. May be you can suggest a place where there is a chance to recognize ""you"" more easily, like dancing studio or, idk, foreign language classes.
Any advices on recognition are also appreciated :)"
1139,esfp,"Thanks for advice)
Going outside is not a problem for me. I just want to give my effort some kind of scientific approach :) Going outside and talking to random persons is fine, but I want to improve my chances "
1140,esfp,"If you watch an ESFP interact with others it's usually easy to identify them. There is no specific place, really we are everywhere.
Recognizing ESFP uh, just look for someone who fits in. Someone talkative I guess. I mean just look for the qualities you like in ESFPs, that is why you want to meet them right?
In my experience INTPs do a lot of thinking and not so much acting. Go out and talk to everyone instead of asking how to find us, trust me, you will find ESFPs. We are about 10% of the population."
1141,esfp,"I don't have any scientific approaches and I don't really know if any of my ideas would work on other ESFPs, but I'll try to come up with some other ideas!
To me it all boils down to you wanting to befriend and maybe want to have an ESFP SO. You want to get to know them, but we are everywhere, so to me it seems like you need to find places where you can easily get in touch with someone and keep in touch. You want to talk with them and letting them be a part of your life/vice versa.
In that case, if I have understood you correctly, you need to engage them in conversation, encourage their ideas, follow up on them, do the ideas if possible and just be part of the ride, really.
I'm sorry if this is not much help, as I mentioned above, this might not apply to other ESFPs than me and I can't think of a foolproof or scientific approach to ESFPs. Other than that I wish you luck and as a fun side note, I can believe that you are INTP, it's cool that something like that can be shown only through text (not a bad thing, btw! All INTP people are cool!) "
1142,esfp,I'm an INTJ married to an ESFP.  Just curious to know if any ESFP's are in the same situation and what your experiences have been like.  I want to try and see things from the other side of the equation.
1143,esfp,ENTP here with an INTJ dad and brother whom both married an ESFP lady.  I maybe able to help from a third person point of view.  Seems like a crux of their relationship is that the ESFP has to be open about their feelings but then let go so the INTJ can make plans with the information.  
1144,esfp,"I'm an ENTJ (with the E being bordeline with I) and my girlfriend is an ESFP. She's wonderful, the relationship takes a lot of work but it doesn't really feel that way.
We have been together for a year and we have learned a lot about each other but being so different there were issues and lots of misunderstandings.
One very important thing is that she has learned to be very clear with her feelings. If something bothers her she will tell me exactly what and how.
In the beginning she would just act moody, I would completely failed to pick up the hint and think everything was normal, she would get even more pissed off and think I was purposefully ignoring her until she finally would burst with a bunch of repressed emotions to which I could only answer ""Well why didn't you just said so""?
I've also become better at understanding that she doesn't always mean what she says. I used to drive me crazy, one minute she would say ""I want to go skiing"" and the next minute it was ""I want to stay home"". I didn't understand that she was processing her feelings by talking out loud. For NT types what you say it's a fact and to me it sounded like she was changing her mind every second and I felt overwhelmed with information that I didn't know what to do with.
We always have a blast, we complement each other with things we couldn't achieve on our own. She helps me be more in touch with other people's feelings (ENTJS are almost robots in that regard) and I help her structure her goals. We make a good team.
Try not to kill your partner, we're good guys and we care A LOT about our partners. We just suck at making it evident."
1145,esfp,"Hello. Im an male INTJ and my girlfriend is an ESFP.
We have been together for 2 years now.
Our relationship is great. Ofcours we fight sometime, but all cupples do right. I thing I noticed is that I allways wants to make plans for the day or for tomorow, or even the week. And she only wants to improvise or do things spotant.
Is INTJ and ESFP a comon combination?"
1146,esfp,"I'm an ESFP dating an INTJ for a little over 3 years now. We were friends through out high school first then started dating after we graduated. 
My boyfriend is very introverted while my social anxiety (& other illnesses) make me more of a homebody. We work very well together. He tells me I'm unlike any other person he's ever met & we are highly compatible despite what the internet says about INTJ ESFP relationships. 
I also have many close friends who are INTJs (Apparently I seek them out) and we get along well because I'm understanding of our differences.
Deep down I envy my partner's personality type & his ability to manage his feelings better than me. I feel that he's smarter than I  am but he loves me just the same, he says that I have a light in me that draws others to me. Maybe that's why I'm so attracted to befriending introverts.
Edit: grammar... swype is hard lol"
1147,esfp,"My parents are INTJ and ESFP.
They were toghether for about 10 years and divorced when I was young. I still have absolutely no idea why they ever got together; They're not compatible people at all.
God speed."
1148,esfp,"I think feelings are the biggest thing we have trouble with, and not just from my end. I tend to repress or ignore mine, and she often fails to express hers, which leaves me guessing. I'm not a sensor, so I suck at it. I tell her to be blunt with me about what she's feeling, because other than anger I have a hard time reading her. I tend to hold things in until it all comes out at once, like I have to purge my feelings to keep my sanity. This tends to start an argument."
1149,esfp,"I wish my wife was like this, I am often left guessing when she gets moody.  I usually know something is up, but not what it is that is bothering her.  I have tried to get her to just tell me when she has a problem with me, but for one reason or another she never does.
I am still trying to get used to this after 6 years of marriage.  Some times she is truly indecisive, which drives me crazy as I make small decisions without difficulty.  Other times she is incredibly impulsive about important decisions and doesn't leave me the time to think everything through before forcing me to decide.  This has gotten us into a lot of debt over the years before we both came to the realization that that way of doing things doesn't work for us.
We do make a good team because we are so different though, especially as parents.  But nothing is easy for the same reason."
1150,esfp,"It seems to be a somewhat common pairing, if a very difficult one.  I think opposites attract, and it is hard to get more opposite than INTJ/ESFP.  Maybe INTJ/ESFJ would be worse, but I've never experiencd that.  Seems like INTJ/ENFP combinations have an easier time of it.  My wife and I have our ups and downs too, we are radically different and have trouble communicating sometimes.  I'm sort of in the midst of an internal debate about the best way to approach her about our problems and how to fix them, but I haven't come up with the perfect way to approach the issues yet and solve them without upsetting her.  I'm sure I'll figure it out, but I haven't yet."
1151,esfp,"Well, I'm wondering about a lot, but for starters: how do you get across the ""brain language"" barrier? It seems sometimes we might as well be speaking in different languages as much as we understand one another. She seems disinterested in most things that don't deal with the here and now, and I'm often so in my own head I don't even realize she's speaking with me. Both of these cause tensions in our relationship."
1152,esfp,"That is odd. ESFP's don't strike me as the over analyzing type. I used to drive my wife nuts asking her what she was thinking all the time. It took me a long time to realize she didn't constantly think about things the way I do.  She was living completely in the moment, which is something I have a very, very hard time doing."
1153,esfp,"My initial reaction is that you need to prompt her for what she feels/wants and make it very clear that you value her input and you want to use that information in your decision making.  If things go poorly because she gave bad information, you have got to stay calm.  I would draw strong attention to the fact that you made your decision with her information, and then also pull on the fact that the moment is now gone and you want things to be better again.  You've got to distance yourselves as a pair away from the issue.  Make sure you state up front that this is a team thing, not a competition. "
1154,esfp,"I definitely know where you are coming from. These are differences that my fiance and I have as well. I think it helps to be aware of those differences and be lenient with your SO because of them, but at the same time they are not necessarily excuses for not compromising in how you interact with each other. My fiance often speaks in depth about details that are beyond my everyday scope of interest, but I listen as intently as I can, because I know how important those details are to him. Sometimes, he can tell that I'm feeling that way and he'll say ah, sorry, I've gone too far in depth, and he is lenient with my lack of attention span.
Conversely, sometimes I try to say something to him and there is absolutely zero reaction, because he is working through a mental ""stack"" at that moment. But I trust him to at least store what I said in the stack and I wait 30/40 seconds for the stack to resolve, and I get a response. I know he gets lost in his head so I'm not annoyed about being ""ignored"" for half a minute, but he stays out of his head enough to at least register the question.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that all couples think differently sometimes, but since we have the benefit of understanding our differences through MBTI, it's easier to specifically account for those differences. Is your wife interested in MBTI? It's helped me understand a lot about my fiance. Also, this blog http://intjadvice.tumblr.com/
I don't really have a specific ESFP perspective which would help you understand how she feels- I think it is just a fundamental difference. The things she is disinterested in- maybe you could find a way to relate them to her. Tell her why they are important to you, and use emotion words where possible.
Sorry this is probably a bit long!"
1155,esfp,"I am indeed. Though I feel strangely quiet for an ""extrovert"". My girlfriend is a louder confident kind of soul, so we fit better than if we were both exactly the same. 
I'd have assumed that INTJ's would fit well with an ESFP. Opposites attract, or so they say!"
1156,esfp,"Well they're pretty much absolutely diametrically opposed in just about every aspect of personality.
She's short tempered, emotional and spontaneous (for better and for worse). He's somewhat cold and plans absolutely everything.
Her house is a mess. His house is squeaky clean.
She can talk forever, knows everybody in the community (especially the neighbourhood kids) and can get along with everyone. He has a very tight social circle and is one of the most quiet people I know (not in a socially awkward way, nut in a ""I'm not gonna talk if I don't have to"" kind of way).
They have absolutely no shared interests or hobbies. 
I mean they were together for about a decade, there must have been something between the two of them but I don't see it whatever it is.
I'm an infj just creepily watching you guys dw about it."
1157,esfp,"This is a good suggestion.  I already do this some, but I could definitely improve on it.  Part of the problem is her indecisiveness.  Often I will ask for her input on something and her answer is very non-committal, something along the lines of ""I don't know.""  Sometimes I can't get anything more concrete out of her, even after a lot of effort.  This tends to drive me crazy, because I never have any problem making my mind up about something.  I don't want to just take charge and make all the decisions, but sometimes I feel I have no other choice because she refuses to make a decision or offer any input."
1158,esfp,"This is actually really helpful, and a lot of what you are describing with your fiance happens with my wife and I. I brought up MBTI recently (I only found out my own type less than a month ago) with her, and had her take the test and I verified her MBTI after doing some research on it (After first reading the description it didn't seem to fit, but it makes more sense now that I've looked into the functions.) She didn't really seem interested in it at all after that point, so I've pretty much given up trying to explain how our brains work differently. I'll have to try relating it to emotion, but idk if its an Fi thing or or what, but it is almost as hard for her to share her emotions as it is for me."
1159,esfp,"I think my quietness has rubbed off on her a bit, though she is loud and confident in social situations, where I am not. There is a lot of attraction there and we work well as a team, but we sometimes have trouble understanding one another, which is why I posted this.  Want to get insight from the other side (i.e. ESFP's who have dated introverts, specifically INTJ's).  It is interesting to see how we interact with our own types too. "
1160,esfp,"I can relate to this a tad better because I'm an ENTP and the P is strong.  Again, my father was INTJ and something that worked well for us (and INFJ exs of the past) was for one party to present a limited number of choices and then the other person picks from one of them.  This can also be stepped.  So in food, you might focus on ""chinese, burgers, or pizza"" and then pick from there, then pick out a restaurant.  
If you can, try and get these thoughts in her head just a few minutes ahead.  Maybe if you are going to pick up a quick meal like above, start the conversation as soon as the thought of leaving comes to you... but don't plan to resolve it till you are turning on the car."
1161,esfp,"Interesting! Yeah, it's funny how widely people can vary within the categories. I'm on the fence for a couple of the characteristics, and I think that helps my fiance and I get along.
If she has any interest in Reddit or online communities, point her to this subreddit. Maybe finding like minded people will make her more interested in MBTI?"
1162,esfp,"Can anyone direct me to a place where I can find many ESFP that fit this description and are single? If you can I would also like help improving my descriptions of me and who I am looking for.
Me:
-rationalist
-male 28

-many abilities and projects,
 but very careful to use what I have only to help others

EDIT: (short version)
-might enjoy design, photography, buildings, and houses
-balanced and positive
-open to travelling the world
-might like cooking and food
-might like sales work
-might want to become a watchmaker"
1163,esfp,"My personal opinion here is that your are being far too specific.  I'm ESFP/ENFP (on the border of sensing and intuition) and my  opinions/interests change almost daily.  Things like enjoying cooking and interior design, I may get a blast of interest in those topics for a week, then lose interest, then a month later get another blast of interest in them.  My attitudes and preferences change based on random occurrence, you cannot expect the same monotonous interests, attitude, opinions, etc...  In my opinion it's boring and goes against everything I am to be the same all the time.  Some aspect of my life has to change every day and I don't know if that's the same for all ESFP's or not, but that's my outlook on it."
1164,esfp,"Is this short description better?
-might enjoy design, photography, art, buildings, and houses
-balanced and positive
-open to travelling the world
-might like cooking and food
-might like sales work
-might want to become a watchmaker
(I edited this back to main topic)"
1165,esfp,OMG. That's me. To a T. I always wondered why I was great at starting projects but not finishing them. I love learning new things but not perfecting them. fist bump THANK YOU. Where have you been all my life?  Oh yeah: browsing other interesting Reddits.
1166,esfp,Yes that would make it much easier to find an ESFP.  But to find someone like this you will have to visit places where these interests are shared by people.  I go through phases of going to comic book conventions and taking art classes and learning how I code java online.  To find these interests you have to go to a place here people are interested in them so take a cooking class or photography class or go to art shows or find some architechture group in your area or something.  Once you go to find these people they will find you when you are there but make a conscious effort to say hello to people and ask why they are where they are etc.  I love when people I meet actually take an interest in my life (personal opinion alert) and you will be able to figure out if a person is who you are looking for by inquiring about their interests and hobbies.  He'll you may even find that they are asking about you and why you are there!  In that situation I would say be honest and say you are looking for someone with this skillset or interest.  That's about all I got for now.
1167,esfp,"Hey everyone, I'm an ISFJ and need help understanding my ESFP girlfriend.
We've been together for 2 months, lately she's seemingly grown distant, stopped calling me with the nickname she gave me, to the point where I felt like she didn't want me to kiss her (so I didn't).
Yesterday night she told me she feels that telling me she loves me was too ""reckless"".
I don't understand. Any help?"
1168,esfp,"I had the same experience with an ESFP. I could be wrong but I think they live so much in the moment that they are sensitive to any changes in their feelings and don’t see a relationship in such a linear way. So I imagine, for you, your time with her has been part of forming a history and foundation for your relationship, and you are on a pretty stable timeline of progression. However, for her, she’s likely living it day-to-day and riding the emotional/sensory waves without feeling as invested in a future or progressing things in a certain direction. Once the “honey moon” phase ends, I think ESFPs start questioning and doubting pretty hard.
So if she’s not in tune with what she REALLY wants, those daily fluctuations in emotions will be difficult for her to understand and make her question the relationship. ESFPs enjoy interacting with people so much that they can easily find value in dating almost anyone it seems but an immature ESFP won’t always know what they really, truly want in someone long-term or what’s good for them. If she’s unsure, she may start fearing that she’s over committed and missing out on other experiences. She is probably aware of how unpredictable her feelings are and she’s afraid of hurting you so she’s backtracking and trying to manage expectations. 
This could be her realizing she’s not really in it anymore and it’s not what she wants. Or, she’s just dealing with all these fears and needs to soul search more to figure out what she really wants. "
1169,esfp,"From the perspective of an ESFP guy who is dating an INFJ, I have often started to wonder if we should really be together anymore. I haven’t been as crazy lately as usual & since we aren’t in school all the hype people gave us for dating finally isn’t there & since I like hype and adventures it all seems to be getting a little dull. Here’s what ESFP’s need to realize, Life will have dull moments. I sadly have to realize that too & I’m sure she is denying that fact because she wants a stimulating experience just I do, however that will not always be the case. Let her know that & that you are here with her for the long haul. If she realizes even through her doubts of not having the hype that you will remain constant in her life, it might work it’s way to her emotions & she’ll realize that it is time to enjoy life even when it’s not as fun as other times. 
Allow her to be creative when hanging out with you to help her give y’all a new experience.


Go to the fridge & let her know that she has to come up with a dish with ONLY the stuff you can find in there & you’ll help her make it!


Make a stop @ 3 different fast food restaurants & pick up one item from each then take her to a park & either race to finish the food fastest or eat it casually & see who can find more blue cars or red cars first!

"
1170,esfp,"2 months isnt long at all. This has definitely happened to me (I am the one that grows distant after things seemingly are all good). It just dawns on me that the other person is not what I want. It is def getting over the initial honeymoon phase of having someone elses company...usually that'll take me a week or two. Lol. I move on from ppl quickly tho.
Tbh she's over it. Be glad you were only together 2 months not 2 years."
1171,esfp,"Hey there. Not the first time I come across 16 personalities. My boyfriend shared a link, so I was reading about, doing tests, and here I came to ask which type I am. Everything seems to match me, except J/P part. I made the test twice in English and once in my native language. English got me J, native P. I tend to be very OCD, very anxious, feeling like I have to adjust to someone. Rules and rules and rules. But from the other side, I don't like to judge or be judged (sometimes I don't care but sometimes it destroys me by feeling guilty), I want to be free, I want to explore, enjoy my life and do many crazy things. I hate being forced. Does OCD make me J for now, or is it something I try to run away from as P? Before I tried to cure OCD by being more OCD, lately I try to stop my perfectionism before my life blows away like sand. I am also not creative at all, many times I want to just do some activity, but I will stay bored. Sorry if it's chaotic."
1172,esfp,"Feeling like you have to adjust to others indicates Fe. Rules rules rules indicates Si. Not being creative indicates lower functioning Se/Ne. Out of the two you presented, I'm going to say you sound like ESFJ. Definitely not ESFP. As the other person here said, do some more research. These two are very different at their core."
1173,esfp,"Wow. That's a lot of thoughts. For most of the description, I could see it going either way. I suggest that u do some research into cognitive functions and figure out what fits u more if u haven't already. The P and the J make all the difference. An ESFP is Se, Fi, Te, Ni. And ESFJ is Fe, Si, Ne, Ti. As u can see, there is no overlap at all with the functions, so some research should really clear this up :)"
1174,esfp,"It looks like I can be anything, maybe only F seems permanent in my answers. I made one test with ESFJ result, second test with ESFP, third was INFJ. But all of them show that I am almost in the middle with each letter pair. And a few descriptions of types I read so far seem to match. Am I crazy? :D "
1175,esfp,"You definitely sound more like ESFJ. I rarely find ESFPs that are especially rules and structure oriented (rules and high structure and scheduling can feel oppressive to me at times). I love being thrown into new situations and love the exhilaration of it all. What you're saying sounds far more like Si (ESFJs auxiliary function). As someone else said in a different comment, ESFPs and ESFJs do not share any of the same cognitive functions. "
1176,esfp,"Thanks a lot! I think having test in different language won't be 100 accurate. Eg. in English I had a question if I want my child more kind than smart, while in the translated test I was asked if I want more friendly/nice child than smart. I chose kind over smart, but I also chose smart over nice."
1177,esfp,"I am curious about how our cognitive styles compare. We essentially share the same functions but with reverse emphasis. This makes your way of thinking especially interesting (and if I'm being honest, especially alien) to me. 
What are some behaviors or thought processes you associate with Se? What inherent strengths and weaknesses do you note from Se dominance? In what ways do you feel your auxiliary Fi and tertiary Te supplement it? 
Ni is supposedly your Achilles heel and while I have lurked and hypothesized contrasting scenarios, I don't really know how you experience it from your perspective. Lastly, what potential benefits in your personality do you see in improving Ni?
Apologies for barging in and quizzing you all. I hope that between the topics I've posted here and in /r/ENTJ and /r/ISFP, I might get better insight on how to develop myself from people with more experience than me in those areas. "
1178,esfp,"Um I'm not really sure how to describe Se because it just seems like an obvious thing to me. It's just reality. Living in and reacting to it and taking it for what it is. Honestly I don't think there are any downsides I experience from being Se-dom. It fits with my way of life.
Fi doesn't come out very much for me, it's more related to like my interests and stuff. What I find appealing. How I can derive enjoyment from a situation. Te supplementing Se, hm, I guess I am good at figuring out plans for action on the spot, figuring out who needs to do what. But then Fi makes me feel bad for ordering people around lol.
I really am not sure how I use Ni healthily. I think it causes me to read into things too much and make me paranoid. Or fear the consequences and prevent me from taking action. I think I was in Ni grip for like a year or more. I was literally stuck doing the same thing every day because I was sure if I did something different this would happen and then this and my life would be ruined forever."
1179,esfp,"Se: taking things in their literal or physical form. Se can lead to pursing new sensations, environments, feelings. This can lead to risk taking behavior or overindulgence.
 Fi is the process that helps us decide how to act based off the information taken in. Se can affect Fi in the way that sometimes information we perceive literally can mean something else, and may incite an emotional reaction that is conflicting internally. 
Te in combination with Se helps us form thoughts that are literal and 'tell it like it is'. Also like I said, verbalizing Fi processes. 
Benefits to Ni I think might include more in depth abstract understanding of everything. Also a different system of organizing and applying data in the form of predictions, future planning and understanding people. 
Hope this helps! One of my best friends is an INTJ and we can understand each other pretty well since we both have our lower functions fairly developed. "
1180,esfp,"I love being with people and being invited out to stuff, I’d always choose going out to staying home alone, but yet I’m shy to approach people. Crowds aren’t a problem for some reason, but when I’m like sitting on the bus for example, or in the waiting room, I can’t seem strike up a conversation with anyone. They’re sitting across the room and I’m just like “wow geez this is awkward as shit, I really want to talk to them but I can’t, oh shit they just glanced at me, I need to say something and hope they’re welcoming.” I’m sitting there feeling self conscious, I’d like to talk to them but I can’t find a way to do it, and I’m scared I’m going to be awkward and stuttery about it, I’m pretty sure this is just basic ass social anxiety but Idk I want your thoughts. Is this common for introverts or am I just fucking myself?"
1181,esfp,"It's not really common for introverts (INTJ here), but it could be your Fi acting up. Now is it primary or secondary, I'd need more info. I know my Fi friend had the same problem except she didn't wanto to talk to anyone, but felt like she had to because what if they wanna talk but they're too shy? 
My boyfriend is an ESFP and from my knowledge this doesn't happen to him, although he will easily strike up a conversation in an awkward situation (usually saving me). I think it's just anxiety though, but it doesn't sound so bad?"
1182,esfp,You might be more isfp??  I don't struggle with initiating convos but I do get exhausted from groups.  You might be like me in that you are almost equal extrovert and introvert??  I'm only 57% extroverted so sometimes my introverted side will be powerful and other times I'm all extrovert.  Hope I'm explaining this right.  I'm too flighty to edit hahahaha
1183,esfp,"Im a 23yo intp male, i recently started talking and hanging out with a 21yo esfp female. she is awesome and i think about her everyday. Its the first time ive ever felt this way about anyone, she is a beautiful friendly loving person.  im not sure if shes see's me as a potential partner or just a friend. She said i have good vibes and wants to hang out more. Also she is a 10 and lucky to be a 4 :(
How do i know if she likes me or is just a friend?"
1184,esfp,"ESFP gal here, like datgirl said be up front about things and ask her. In fact she may be waiting for that, I know I'm def the type to wait on ppl (but maybe that my lesbian side and not an ESFP thing haha). Don't worry about being ""a 4"" or whatever, comparing yourself never helps. I think I speak for a lot of ESFPs when I said we're much more into personality than looks. Most ppl are beautiful to me and I think every gal is cute as hell regardless of whether they fit society's standards of pretty. What matters is that you get along well and communicate feelings and always have a good time. Also what's more attractive is taking care of yourself than just being lucky, if you put effort and thought into your looks and have good taste that's way more attractive than someone born conventionally pretty by chance and with low effort."
1185,esfp,"I know sometimes for introverted personalities, it's hard to just come out and ask, but I believe it's the best route to take. I'd rather someone just be upfront with me instead of hiding it. I would never want someone to take a conversation, joke, etc. the wrong way just because they can't ""read me."" One of our main goals is to entertain."
1186,esfp,"If she is indeed ESFP, just be upfront. Tell her you like her, and if she's willing, would like to take her out and see where it goes. Being honest and confident helps. It does gain you respect points, even if she wouldn't feel the same way.
I have reacted differently in the past, but as long as the person was respectful of my choice, without verbally challenging it, I was respectful of them, regardless whether my answer was 'let's go for it!' or 'thank you, I value that you're upfront with me, but I don't see you that way. Would it be alright if we stayed friends?'
Mind you, rejection always stings, whether respectful or not. But if you share with her as soon as you realize you feel like that, it will heal up quickly, and won't sting too long. If you take months to work up courage, and she turns you down, you'll be angry at yourself, and unfortunately, at her too. And, there is good chance she might want to date! You don't know unless you try!
Direct and to the point is definitely better than an elaborate set-up."
1187,esfp,"No, you got it really wrong, we're Se doms, so we're among the types who care the most about looks
Beauty is very subjective tho"
1188,esfp,"Very true. Especially when it comes to romantic relationships I don't like playing games with people(unless it's just sex and seduction), the more honest you are with us the better I think. And I agree that confidence is a major thing, even with good looks low confidence is such a turn off"
1189,esfp,"No it's not, unless your whole information about MBTI comes from 16 personalities which would be quite unfortunate. Socionics calls us ""The Politician"" for example or Napoleon/Caesar, which are far more suitable then a name that was created by a group of prejudiced intuitives, who can't tell the Big 5 and MBTI apart"
1190,esfp,"How am I supposed to trust this study if I don't even know the source of it, who conducted this research, what was the sample size, methods used etc 
I know the functions are different(they wouldn't be two different systems if the functions were the same), but generally the only ""ESFP"" description that would correlate to ESFj in socionics would be the dichotomy based one(and the one they have on 16p), otherwise MBTI ESFP correlates to ESFp. I guess it's possible that you are an ESFP function wise and an ESFj in socionics, but that would mean you are among the minority"
1191,esfp,"Hey everyone. In my work I sell, organize, and facilitate 8-week entrepreneurship boot camps in Chile. We have been doing this for just over 2 years now. As we have evolved as an organization it seems we have gotten away from what worked in the beginning--that was basically just being excited and happy about what we were doing and others wanted to be involved. 
Now we talk mainly about vision, goals for future, and how difficult entrepreneurship is. But then we forget about the most important thing, the users experience! 
So I would love to ask a big favor and have you guys check out this website and give your artisan lens feedback on our newest program called Hydra. Its an ocean themed entrepreneurship program - http://hydra.exosphe.re 
please be BRUTALLY HONEST. I would prefer that over fluff. 
thanks to everyone who helps out. "
1192,esfp,Wait this is a course on how to be an entrepreneur? I feel like if you have to pay $4000 to learn how to start your own business you've already failed. And yeah what that other guy said. Too many words.
1193,esfp,It depends on what I’m doing but overall yeah. Sometimes I get impatient and rush to finish because I spend too long trying too hard to make it perfect and I just get frustrated that it’s not going to be perfect and I start to hate it. 
1194,esfp,"If I am really into it, then yes!  Also, if it’s something that I have to look at, like painted walls, then also yes!  If it’s something that I want to finish quickly and it has no bearing on my sanity, then definitely no!  Haha"
1195,esfp,"Not with most random stuff like cleaning. With art and hobbies, yep. You could call me a snob even lol. I like what ever I consider to be the best. So I have to have high standards. 
I do film directing. I'm lovely in my day to day. On set... I'll leave my toes up an the ass of any fucker tryna do an over the shoulder shot. I get uncontrollable. "
1196,esfp,It sucks I'm tired all the time but have insomnia and everything aches when I exercise. Had to drop out of school for a couple years and got better last year then relapsed. Kinda had to put my life on hold. But what're you gonna do. I try not to whine about it
1197,esfp,"I am very confident, assertive and up beat. I have bad anger issues but work out exercise and am in therapy.  I truly stopped caring of what others thought about me in the 7th grade. People were making fun of my personality and being bad at math. I have really bad stress I could be hospitalized it's that bad. I'm a genuine person caring, fun, observant, positive,helpful,social butterfly."
1198,esfp,Me too I watch out for my ENTJ bestie sometimes. One day I wore too much powder on my skin because my stress hormones have been bad the past few months. She said you look so pale like a ghost she's about light medium I'm light not ivory. I wanted to say your eyebrows look bad they're bushy sparse but I didn't
1199,esfp,"It seems i've been trying to force myself into conventional jobs like doctor, lawyer, engineer because of my strict upbringing and traditional parents, an its always made me feel sick. I always dread thinking about a 9-5 career and often exaggerate that id rather die.  But having recently discovered that Im an ESFP i wonder, what jobs should I be looking at? I feel guilty not pursuing something academic (respectable), but then I feel miserable when im there. Im also already in college and have changed my major about 3 times... any advice would be appreciated. Im just trying to make sense of my life. Also I used to be very into art and music but had to stop because of university, and now i cant find the motivation to pick it all back up, partly because my skills have gone to shit :/"
1200,esfp,"Perhaps you could take a break from college to gain a better sense of direction? I tried out a wide variety of jobs before I was able to figure out my long-term career. As an ESFP, I'm assuming you might be people-centric so maybe healthcare (don't have to confine yourself into being a doctor here), HR, and psychology (you could do art therapy?) are potential options. Idk, just throwing ideas at you"
1201,esfp,"As a doctor, lawyer or engineer, you'd find your peers to be more or less soul crushing. They are the cold robots of this world. Maybe a little less so for medicine, but yeah, no, not for an ESFP. You're right. Try these links. Take the Big Five Personality Test too. Search for the US Dept of Labor Career Outlook Handbook. Do. not. drop. out. of. school. But I agree something in healthcare could be a satisfying fit with excellent job prospects. (ie: therapist of some sort) The problem in creative fields is stiff competition for jobs and you'd have to be willing to move periodically.

1202,esfp,"Whatever career you pick, don't forget that it is not your life. As long as you have a life outside of work, it doesn't matter what job you have. Every-time I am working, I always know I have stuff after it to look forward to, which wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the security that work provided me.
Also, just start doing art. Stop giving yourself so much pressure. No one says you can't be shit at it and still have fun."
1203,esfp,"I was the same and am just now finding out after having worked as an Aerospace Engineer for 5 years 😅.  If you are realizing it know you will always be miserable, but my job provides me enough flexibility/stability/status to suite my lifestyle.  You are naturally good with people so your loved around the office and you can be the center of attention, but it helps I'm around a young work force that's not particularly strict.  Also I was raised by two J types so I've become very adaptable around the type of person I interact with regularly at work, but do really struggle with motivation towards the monotonous tasks that I tend to let build.  I love my job though and am glad I got to where I am (thanks to those J types providing me that external motivation my whole life), but you couldn't pay me to put myself through 4 years of Aerospace Engineering again even having already have done it🤔."
1204,esfp,"I love them! So cute and cozy and intellectual. Somehow I've managed to find a lot of INFP friends. We hang out and drink and talk about literature and pop culture and feelings. Literally the best people, except that they never accept my invitations to go out and do things. Then I get pissed at them"
1205,esfp,"Cracks me up! I just discovered the ""personality"" subreddits and just came here because my wife discovered she's ESFP. I'm INFP. We've always joked, but at the same time marveled at how we compliment each other while at the same time being almost polar opposites on a lot of things that one of us hate while the other one thrives on it. She ""zones out"" on soap operas and Facebook games while I search non fiction facts and research stuff.
She hates current events, history, etc, and has to ask me or the kids which spelling of any word such as 'where were, we're', etc. Meanwhile she can glance at a bill or receipt and spot an error in a second. I told her when we met that we would be great parents, because our likes and dislikes would cancel each other and our kids had a chance of being normal. And for the most part it's true, our kids are great, and I always remind them to thank their mother because thanks to her someone in their hereditary line had a chromosome left to pass on - I had a good time in the 60's. And as far as conversation with others goes, thank God there's someone else to do that who's good at it and enjoys it. Ironically my dad was a dynamite salesman who thrived on conversation with others. 
Also, about us INFP's building walls. Yes we do, but I think we're about to make Mexico pay for them "
1206,esfp,"Y'all drive me nuts. Love them to death though. I always feel like there's something you guys are holding back, like there's a wall that'll never go down. It gets frustrating. I use to be bothered by 3 months cave time. But now I get it. It's just something that you need to live. "
1207,esfp,"See, I brought that wall all the way down with someone, and she stopped talking to me for six months because she thought 'we shouldn't be friends right now'. Reminded me that the wall is up for a reason, and that I shouldn't bring it down unless I'm 100% certain I trust that person."
1208,esfp,"Don't worry about it. I've been working with my best friends on lowering that wall with more people, but it's pretty effing difficult sometimes since I'm not a very social person. Thanks for the reply, though :) I appreciate it."
1209,esfp,"I will say. All my close friends I've had for over 10 years. If we've been hanging out for a while. I'll most likely keep you. That person just sucked! 
I have fun friends and close friends. Once we're close, you're for keeps. Cuz lord knows they know way too much ;)"
1210,esfp,"There is no wall that INFPs are building on purpose. It's just that whenever we talk I feel there's no grounds for understanding:s At least that's me. Some people might have better grip of sensors, I just don't get them at all."
1211,esfp,"I don't think I can give you a good example...it's just that when I talk to non-sensors it feels like they understand me without words, like I met my long lost friend, like I don't have to explain myself to them, because they understand. With sensors though...it feels like exactly the opposite. Sometimes I will pass on explaining things to them, because why bother:s They just seem to be focused on things that hold no interest to me (like current events etc.)"
1212,esfp,"Are you a strong Intuitive? 
Ah, so not walls. But interests. Haha it does get boring. That's not the wall I'm talking about. But I like you. You're fun!  
Current events are extremely boring to me. I would rather go do something. Go outside, go hiking, watch a movie, go to a concert, just outings in general. I could also binge watch Netflix. Or a book series of some sort. "
1213,esfp,"I'm not a very strong intuitive according to the tests at least. Somewhere halfway up there.  
Walls, interests, all the same, no?:P It just feels like no connection can be established. But as I said - I'm bias, because apart from my dad, there are no sensors in my closest family. I just never learnt to get along with them and my dad was never there anyway:s I mean different people are interested in different things, I respect that and will pass on people that are interested in something I'm not.
I would rather not go anywhere xD Just stay at home and chat, create something, write a story that's in my head. All that and more ! ...without even going out of my home. Watch a movie? Sure, can we watch it at home? I go to concerts sort of once a year. Too many people in one place isn't exactly comfortable (unless I know them well). "
1214,esfp,"I noticed that. But I enjoy the diversity, I love having friends that taking me out of my comfort zone. I'll take the time to really see if we have things in common. I don't see why I can't be friends with someone, unless they're a horrible person. Different people, different personalities help you grow. Make you better. Have you try new things. "
1215,esfp,"Yes 
A good example is how ESFPs have the ability to empathize with people on a very deep level. With that said, they can make the most of that skill when the person or people they are interacting with are relaxed and level-headed."
1216,esfp,"Currently transitioning into my first legit boss leadership role and finding this very true. I don't bark orders, I want to collaborate and discuss everything. Get my teams views, preferences, and suggest pathways. I want everyone engaged and supporting what we do instead of just doing what I say bc I'm in charge. It's good in terms of I feel like ppl are supporting my style of leadership and like me (I know I know it's not all a popularity contest😋) but I fear when the day comes I gotta play the boss card, will I still have their support? Do they respect me? Or just like me?"
1217,esfp,"Nothing particularly crazy or badass. I was obsessed with being creative and hanging out with friends. I joined just about every artsy club in the school (photography, theatre, etc) sometimes having a leadership position. I loved being surrounded by people every day and having friends all over the school! I guess the riskiest things I did were: cutting class to smoke with friends, and sneaking out or lying about my whereabouts - I tried to make it out to any party/event/trip that I could. I really miss those times honestly!"
1218,esfp,"I worried my mother sick with all the random and mostly toxic boyfriends I would bring home or sneak out with. I flew across the country, knowing my parents didn't approve, to lose my virginity to a long distance boyfriend. I moved out of my parents' at 18 (step-dad issues), went to college and had a pretty good GPA, worked my ass off trying to pay bills, but I was all the happier for the freedom to do whatever the hell I wanted.
I'm only just 20 so this is all very recent, but I definitely took a lot of risks. Some of them paid off, some fucked me over."
1219,esfp,"I prided myself a filmmaker. I would write scripts, cast my friends, film and edit it myself. We also did ALOT of backyard wrestling that we filmed and released a story lined episodes. 
As far as school activities my parents always pushed me to play sports. But I honestly found more enjoyment in theater and tv production. "
1220,esfp,"But all my best friends I met in high school, went to college with most of and all of us party.  I love hanging out / being friends with people I know love being friends with me.  If I can't tell how you feel about me or you constantly do things I quietly find offensive I'll look for a way to distance myself."
1221,esfp,"My best friends are the few I keep in touch with by text or by phone. And the ones I make plans for, to visit them, or like taking a trip together. The rest of my friends it feels like a chore to text them, and I only visit them if by chance I happen to travel to where they're at. Example, I plan a visit to see my best friend in another city, and because I'm in that city, I'll message all the friends I have there in advance so I can hang out with them a bit.
So I guess, my best friends are the ones who are still my friends when we're apart ?
I have three best friends and I'm not great at typing but I believe two of them are ISFPs. We can talk about meaningful personal stuff, or meaningful philosophical stuff, but we can also just hang out and say the word ""dude"" or ""cuz"" or ""gurl"" to eachother for 10 minutes straight. Or start doing military salutes to eachother in the middle of sentences for no reason, and these things just happen. And our time hanging out is always very chill, like listening to music and watching videos together or just being in the same room and doing different things and being like ""hey come see that thing it's really cool"", unless we get drunk and then we act cuhrazy ! But I am always the cuhraziest. And we just get along really well, there's rarely anyone getting upset.
My third best friend is I believe an ENTP. And oh boy it's very different with him. We argue all the time, about everything. But it's very stimulating so I like hanging out with him. I mean everytime we talk about something serious, like politics, films, art, society, whatever, we end up disagreeing and fighting. And sometimes we just get really upset and it happened a couple times that we stopped talking to each other for a couple months. But when we are acting silly, he's a great match for me. He's better than me in new social settings and especially in these settings he is very silly and is very irreverent, like talking about the giant turd he just pooped to people he just met, so he's kind of like a catalyst between me and other people at parties and stuff like that. When we get wicked drunk together it gets pretty groovy and stupid. I tend to take the initiative more when it's just us two getting wicked drunk."
1222,esfp,"When I'm depressed I withdraw from everyone I know and only want to spend time by myself. When I'm by myself I try to figure out what's causing it and then try to come up with a solution. I hate conflict though and my depression usually results from me avoiding inner conflict and it sometimes takes a while for me to realize what it is exactly. Also I often think my life is insignificant to the world and this makes me apathetic and lethargic which only makes the depression worse. When depressed I start questioning my identity and feel as if I'm a phony which could stem from insecurity about what others think of me. But I'm not quite sure. Anyway, you can definitely have depression as an Esfp! "
1223,esfp,"I know this is a completely useless comment, I have no answers- I am on prozac and all that jazz- but I can relate . 
Depression hits hard and it manifests for me socially- I isolate, I can justify being alone for a week- (which is not a sane idea for an ESFP). 
Maybe its an ESFP thing but my depression finds me when I am alone and I realize if I spend my full time recognizing its shadow- that I will truly be terrified about the pointlessness of my life and how unhappy I maybe. Thankfully I sought help- but being as social as I was and as happy as I was- people had a very hard time recognizing that I was depressed and had even more trouble accepting it. 
Anyway- I am not sure I offered you anything here. But please don't be afraid to ask for help, don't let anyone belittle what you are feeling for the sheer reason that you seem happy on the outside. "
1224,esfp,"Thanks for answering, this was very insightful. So when you get depressed, do you think your depression has a lot to do with what others think of you? Or do you focus more on what others think of you than you do normally?"
1225,esfp,"Hey thanks, I posted this a long time ago and my depression has since lifted. It was due to life circumstances that I couldn't control but now my life's moving forward again and I'm a lot happier. I also isolate myself, as does one of my best ESFP friends, and I do agree for us it's 90% just being alone too long, or feeling alone. So vicious circle. Thanks for your comment though, it's nice to see someone be open about it on here. I think our type tends to avoid talking about it."
1226,esfp,"Hmm... This is an interesting question, because I used to be terribly depressed and considered myself an introvert - however after starting to work out, improving my social skills and finally starting to have fun with life the depression eased out and found myself enjoying other people's company.  I still sometimes have a period of feeling extremely down, however this mostly happens during the night and after events such as getting rejected (even though I try not to pay attention to this, sub-consciously I feel bad). If it is seriously severe, it can last for about a week, however I found that going to gym/running seriously helps - so most of the time, the feeling goes away after a few days. "
1227,esfp,"Yeah that's why I asked, someone suggested to me I could be an ESFP but I have depression, and it seems like ESFP is immune to chronic depression so I can't find anything reliable on it. What caused the depression and how did your personality change during that time? Like could you relate it to any of your functions? Sorry if this is invasive, feel free to not answer."
1228,esfp,"The original depression? It was probably caused by social anxiety mixed with not caring about my physical appearance as well as concentrating too much on learning and too little on socialising. Since I have a strong will, I decided to change it all  (about 4 years ago, am 18 now) - as I mentioned, I started working out, reading self-improvement books and generally going out of my comfort zone. Probably the biggest break-through was the change of school (from middle to high). Now I have gotten opinions that I am too confident (in the form of a tease), people comment on my posture and I feel seriously a lot better. I have no problems with meeting new people/making friends, being assertive, similarly I perceive my value hugely higher than it was before. 
If I could recommend some steps for you, it would probably be firstly to take up running/riding a bike/going to gym, and (however strange it might seem) start reading /r/seduction. Even though the point of the sub might not interest you, I have found multiple helpful articles about self-improvement there. Probably the most important part is - fake 'till you make it. If you act as if you were confident, with time you will get used to it and you will gain confidence. Same with other parts of life. 
A helpful book to start is 'How to win friends and influence people'. 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"
1229,esfp,"As a kid I've always been ridiculously excitable and I loved spending time with friends. When I was 12ish I would do stuff like dance at my aunts wedding disco thing, as well as I danced as a dare from my mom in a resort restaurant, fully knowing that I was being cheesy.
Though I've been weirdly paranoid and socially anxious over the past few years as I'm 16 now and struggling with my social life and my GCSEs.
One characteristic that I have for sure, is that I'm quite into girls. :)   "
1230,esfp,"I don't think it's impossible for an ESFP to have anxiety. Just because you're extroverted doesn't mean you can't be anxious in social situations. With sensing, feeling, and perceiving, I see those as linked to paying attention to what's going with people and situations, which could make you overthink things based on what you see and lead to anxiety/paranoia. "
1231,esfp,"Don't forget about that inferior Ni. That can make u paranoid when it goes wrong. I also suffer with a bit of social anxiety. I've been considering getting therapy for it, but I find that if I engage myself in the community, the anxiety goes away. The trick for me is finding ways to apply myself to ur community, and usually, I come out of my shell. "
1232,esfp,"I'm an ESFP and I can completely relate with you. When I was younger I was the person always goofing around for others entertainment. As I've gotten older, I'm 25, I've become overly concerned with making sure people like me. It went past the point of people enjoying my presence while watching me to wanting everyone to like me. This gets exhausting because you cannot please everyone. Maybe you can relate to this?"
1233,esfp,"Hello fellow esfpsl, idk about y'all but I have a hard time focusing and studying. A college student trying to get the grades in I just force myself to study many many days ahead just so I get enough done in time. Can I get some advice on how to get work done?"
1234,esfp,"I remove all distractions, focus on material for 30-40 min, then 15 min rest. I must live through the thing to get it, so I just do it until I get it.
Don’t try too hard - it makes you rigid. Make studying fun by doing stupid things - playing with words, reading out loud in a dramatic voice or any other stupidity of your choice. Studying in a group helps me too."
1235,esfp,This is very similar to my studying style too. Especially the group part - not only do I have more motivation but it’s a lot more fun and I generally learn better when I’m with people. Pretty much everything about this is accurate for me haha!
1236,esfp,"I would like to get more ESFPs to participate in MBTI relationship statistics, because as of now, there are only 2 ESFPs, whereas other types have crossed the 100 limit right now. 
Here is the form.
I really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, here is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from ""INFP"" in cell A3, to ""ESFP"" if you want to see your statistics. ESFP Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs."
1237,esfp,"Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.

1238,esfp,"I have a good friend that is an INFJ. It's sometimes hard to keep the conversation going because he's a lot different than me in that respect (he's usually way more serious than I am). But really, he's a great guy and has a great personality. We share some good laughs and we admire each-other for the things that we do not have in common. ;-)"
1239,esfp,"I'm an ESFP, wife of 8 years (been together 13) is an INFJ.
I am, as expected, the fun-loving, socializer that has some fairly massive circles of friends and acquaintances. I love knowing the what and how about a lot of things.  My thought processes make a lot of intuitive leaps, and i'm a lot more observant of my environment.
She is, more of a considerate intellectual, that can come across as extroverted if she's comfortable in the setting.  She has a smaller circle of very close friends but may not see them frequently.  She loves knowing the Why about people's motivations. Her though processes are very logical and methodical, and she is a lot more observant of the nuances of people's behavior/responses.
She brings a depth of consideration and tends to plan things out.  I bring the fun and spontaneity.
The great? 
We can laugh our asses, have deeeep conversations about people and politics, go on adventures of the exploratory type/and occasionally the experiential type.
The challenges? 
1) She would probe more thoroughly and deeply than I'd comfortably considered before.  Caused a lot of unfortunate defensiveness on my side at the beginning but I've gotten better at processing my internals.
2) I require a lot more social interactions to maintain a happy outlook.  She didn't understand why she wasn't enough and took a long time for her to understand it was about her or us.
3) we handle extroverted activities and introverted activities differently.  
For me, extroverted activities are fun and recharge my batteries and I will literally be the last man standing at an event.  For her, extroverted events are fun, but cost energy, and she just needs to duck out for a little down time before continuing.
For her, introverted activities are great for giving things their proper consideration and she can sit there for hours doing the thing that has her laser attention focused on it.  For me, I caan sit there for hours too but too much will feel stifling, so I'll wander off to do something more sensory.
4) i deal in one-liners, she deals in paragraphs.
Me: Oh here's an interesting thing, BAM. Ok back to the action.
Her: Oh here's an interesting thing, let me count the ways. First there's this thing, Second there's this other thing, Third, fourth, etc.
These are the things off the top of my head, but basically my point is, it can work, but it takes possibly more and a different kind of effort than you (the ESFP) has ever dealt with. 
TL;DR: It can work amazingly well if you can celebrate and embrace your differences rather than focusing on why you don't have more similarities."
1240,esfp,"Absolutely! You don’t have to fit into 100% of the stereotypes, and certainly don’t let it throw you off track. I think it’s better to look at the motives rather than behaviors, because people can do the same things for different reasons, and going by behaviors can be very contradictory and you’ll never fully be confident in the type if you’re constantly realizing that you’re not completely matching the stereotype. 
Maybe find out why he’s low energy? For me, I’m only really cheery and enthusiastic when I’m confident that the people enjoy my presence and I’m allowed to be myself. Otherwise, I won’t match the high-energy persona at all. Especially under stress. 
I wouldn’t completely discard ESFP as a possibility. This might sound a little cliche, but maybe ask if he feels energized/furfilled or wants to go spend time alone to recharge after spending time with people? You can be a low-energy extrovert or a high-energy introvert, it isn’t necessarily a causation. "
1241,esfp,"Ok, let me try:

Pros: 

the ESFP is way more practical and down-to-earth than me. If I'm panicking because I'm overwhelmed with emotions, he will help me chill down. The INFJ is way more organized than the ESFP. If he indulges with procrastination and things like that, I help him get back on track.

Cons:

The INFJ needs to have deep, intellectual conversations that normally do not interest the ESFP, so I talk more with more similar friends than I do with him because I feel discouraged. On the other hand, he is way more social than me, while I need my space and my alone time, which sometimes discourages him.
For sure this is not a comprehensive list of pros and cons, but I hope I gave you an idea! "
1242,esfp,"I am not an esfp myself. I am an intp. But my wife is an esfp. We are living a bit far away now as well for a short time. She has a lots n lots of free time and the attention she needs from me is impossible since I work now,  but I do try hard. But I have noticed,  when she has something to do,  she doesn't seek for attention like the whole day. 
So what are all your hobbies?  Some suggestions would be nice. Also if you guys have by chance intp partners let me know how your relationship works out in situation such as these?"
1243,esfp,"I'm an esfp and I'm super artsy. Photography, painting, DIY projects. I don't know if she's artsy but maybe something like that's an option? Taking pottery or cake decorating classes? Joining a book club if she likes to read? I'm also an animal lover so volunteering at a shelter etc. "
1244,esfp,I’m an ESFP and I love sci-fi films and TV but I also don’t think personality types decide a persons movie preferences. That being said I’d choose a nice science documentary over a sci-fi film any day. 
1245,esfp,"I'm an ESFP and I'm a huge sci-fi nerd. Star Trek and Star Wars have had an immense influence on me! Stargate, Eureka, and Killjoys are also shows I really enjoy watching. The list could go on forever, really... I also read sci-fi from time to time."
1246,esfp,"I like Doctor Who a lot, but that doesn't feel too much like a sci-fi show. The actually fictional ""technology"" in it, is done like a joke. Star Wars, Star Trek, and similar shows don't appeal to me.
I loved Black Mirror, though. But that's not actually unrealistic. It shows the negative sides of technology."
1247,esfp,"I can’t really see sci-fi as the future, it’s more a fantasy. I can’t see the connection between what we are and how we would get to this alternate universe. Dystopian worlds are interesting, but I can’t compare it to the here-and-now in terms of interest. Our world is so much more stimulating than the possibilities that the media offers us."
1248,esfp,"I mostly just get extremely lonely I've been lonely now for over a year I mean I have more friends now that I connect with, but I would say I'm more coming out of the inferior grip side of it now.
But when I do just feel lost and bored I watch YouTube videos although it does no good and I usually stay bored and just wish I was doing the things they were.
I mostly switch through many things in a short amount of time I'll go from YouTube to guitar, to bass, to piano, to reading, to guitar, sing, to listening to music, to playing bass, to playing video games, to watching Netflix.
Basically I do everything that gives me a stimulation but I stop quickly because the stimulation is not the same when I do it with people and into the Ni grip I don't really know what my passions are, well used to but I get 20 times more bored then a healthy ESFPs.
 The only thing I can't do with people around is watch Netflix or YouTube videos I usually can't watch anything with people around depending on my mood but 99% I'm usually too hyper when people's around lol.
But when I was healthy and alone in my room I'd play guitar for hours or sing or play video games with friends online."
1249,esfp,"I'm an ESFJ, and I'm wondering how do ESFPs get along with us? I just met an ESFP (pretty sure anyway) and while y'all are super fun, you stressssss me out with the way you are so spontaneous! Trying to plan a date with this guy is a whirlwind of confusion lol"
1250,esfp,"I find that ESFJs tend to want to do what is in our interest most, but if an ESFP is into you we want to do what makes you happy. If we really dont want to do it we will voice it, but generally everything will be good. Try to just have fun with it! Disclaimer: This is my opinion atleast."
1251,esfp,"I can get along with ESFJs just fine, but only on a superficial level, like most people say here. Like talking about clothes, food, movies and stuff like that. But when it goes deeper, it will create conflicts. I know this from my experience with my ESFJ mom."
1252,esfp,"I often get along with ESFJs. We share zero valued functions, but we have demo Fe and they have demo Se, so there are ways we can bond. I guess we don't have all that much in common in how we operate, but I like the ESFJs (the healthy ones) around me."
1253,esfp,"I like ESFJ's. I think the most accurate word I can use to describe my relationships with ESFJ's is... Pleasant?
Having said that, I don't have many super close ESFJ friends, it tends to run on a more superficial basis. Usually my MO to be tight with someone is through shared experiences. Go out, have an adventure, do ridiculous things that you definitely  regret but would never take back, and now have lifetime of stories together that bond you. Sometimes ESFJs can be a bit traditional or constrained in their behaviour /actions so it's hard to have the big adventures with them. Or they think you're off the wall for what you're doing and they laugh and enjoy but don't really partake.. So there's a bit of a divide. In addition we chat about a lot of stuff but it's generally more superficial (that's also me, I need the Nx's to bring that out in me out in me otherwise i have a tendency for small talk)"
1254,esfp,"ESFP here, get along with ESFJ in most things.  Food, parties, movies, outdoor fun, going out clubbing, etc. Occasionally they get hung up on some decision or ethics like totally ""stuck"" on right/wrong instead of perceiving that it really comes down to the final result of how everyone feels from it all, is what makes it right or wrong.  But NOT if you feel bad for no reason you don't deserve to, like getting all upset or jealous or some other feeling that's on you and your bad."
1255,esfp,"wait why are you planning a date?
a general rule of thumb i use as a strong introvert (and this actually works for me) is to behave how the other person likes people to behave in order to get in their comfortable zone, then work out how each other behaves as your true self, and if that works out, then youre into their really comfortable zone, and you end up being close friends for many years (i think)"
1256,esfp,"I'm an ESFJ (close enough lmao) and I suck at being obvious too. Even if it's not my crush, and it's just a person who might be using the same app as me in the coffee shop.... what I feel is just a slight glance is a HUGE SIGN SAYING HOOOOOOO BOOOYYYYYYYY IM LOOKING AT YOU BEEEE CREEEEEPED OUTTTTT OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!"
1257,esfp,"Hi there! I am an ESFP f/16 and I have been struggling mentally for all of my pre-teens and teens. I am bipolar and have anxiety, depression, abandonment issues etc.
I wonder, out of curiosity, do any of you other fellow Entertainers struggle with anything? I mean we have a tendency to be more emotional and put much more effort into pleasing others rather than pleasing yourself, is it just me?"
1258,esfp,"Actually quite the opposite.  We have Fi so we're concerned with our own feelings, and we have Fe critic meaning we are critical of other peoples feelings.
I'm 18m ESFP and struggled with deeply depressive feelings, anxiety, and drinking every night.  I spent a lot of time digging as deep into my mind as possible, where all the skeletons lie.  It put me through a lot of pain, but now I'm much better on the other side.  Oh, and LSD helped.
Keep on keeping on.  Meditate, exercise, eat well, and find the right therapist.  I think it also helps to read philosophy and psychology to build your life outlook."
1259,esfp,"me! 
i have bpd. it's pretty hard. people dont notice it until they get too close because i usually put on a show, but its so easy to melt down one second and then switch back to being entertaining and cheerful the next.
i go to two therapists but most people cant tell and so no one asks. i too empathise with having the desperate need to please others, but through therapy im learning self-love and do things for myself.
stay heads up girl! you'll be right. just remember its ok to not be happy sometimes, and its ok to let urself be happy."
1260,esfp,"Not really, although I did have some anxiety as a teenager and get the blues here and there. Food helps me a lot when I'm a bit depressed, gotta keep the blood sugar at a decent level. Weed helps too if you know how to use it(and a few other drugs), but I don't know if you should do it
I completely disagree"
1261,esfp,"Absolutely (m/20). Lots of ugly traits. I've come to terms with it, learning to get rid of them and control yourself is part of growing up, I'm sure. I think the most important part is to keep gaining experience and doing new things you never thought you would do, introduce ALL kind of novelty into your life to show you new ways of doing things and allow your brain to develop new pathways and challenge the old ones, the old ways of thinking, broaden your perspective, keep a conscious mental monologue so that you can develop. Since the beginning of 2018 to today I've changed so much it's amazing, and the thing that kickstarted that change was a completely new group of people with whom I would normally never hang out and ""falling in love"" so to speak. Then it all was just ups and downs and learning your lessons. Keep growing man, have enough love and respect for yourself to actively go out of your way to experience new things that will allow you to realise all the goods and the bads in you and to finally end up as the best person you can be. Not gonna lie, it's going to be an extremely tough road but happiness man, the feeling of happiness after you realise how much you've changed and how much you love who you are now is worth it all. Always put yourself first, your mental state, that's like #1 mistake, being unable to cope with being you and having to cling on to other's approval and shit etc. to feel good, be it parents, friends, partner, whoever. Caring first and foremost for your own happiness is the only thing that will make people you care about respect you enough to also care about you. You will still have your bad moments but with a proper foundation you are going to pull through anything and always come out on top in the end :))))"
1262,esfp,"I think most people cope with something or other, though not everyone knows the labels of what they struggle with.
For me, it's ADHD constantly. I tend to struggle with off and on clinical depression. If I don't do enough mental hygiene, I have anxiety and occasional panic attacks. Some of it can be moderated, the rest I just have to deal with. The upside is, it gets easier over time as you learn healthy coping mechanisms."
1263,esfp,"I was very isolated growing up and really socially deprived, which still gives me some social anxiety. That's hella amplified by gender dysphoria and being trans with low self esteem, and then that opens up a whole new can of depression worms hahah Honestly I think depression and anxiety is more common for us than some others"
1264,esfp,"Lol this was literally me today. I become my own mental punching bag on these days.
​
Not to mention I then dwell on every little poor interaction I have when I am in this mood and it makes it worse. "
1265,esfp,"I'd say engaging in casual sex would match our stereotype, but stereotypes aren't often true.
What are your morals/thoughts on casual sex?
Do you think its fun and enjoyable, or do you prefer a stable committed relationship?
Let me know!
FYI: I'm torn."
1266,esfp,"I’d honestly rather not, I think sex is very private and should only really be had when you really love someone. The thought of giving it out for free and treating it like just another hobby is rather disgusting. I really don’t like that it’s apart of our stereotype. "
1267,esfp,"I have always been quite relaxed with it. I guess for me its more like casual emotional bonding. Like I love to get deep with someone even if we aren't that close.
I'm a gay man and kinda always experimented/fooled around with friends throughout the years. This year I have got a boyfriend though and I really struggled giving up casual intimacy ahha."
1268,esfp,"...and after a few months of careful deliberation and contemplation, I have decided to edit the tab from Preformer to Performer. 
Also I'm looking to add a new moderator. I unfortunately do not have the time I would like to participate in the sub so if anyone would like to come aboard to make discussion threads and other features to engage the community comment here or shoot me a PM.
I'm also aware of the missing search bar, If there is someone who is more adept at CSS, and would also like to be a mod, comment or PM
If anyone would like to see some changes/additions to the sub, comment here and I'll set aside some time this weekend to make it happen.
Thanks"
1269,esfp,"Im not a very political person but I believe political diversity + variety in beliefs is important for new perspectives and ideas. 
I'm probably in the middle/right leaning bc I dont agree with a lot of viewpoints on the left especially PC culture, but I do respect their opinions bc it comes from a good place in their hearts. I think that u just need to be more practical when it comes to implementing ideas bc stuff in theory often doesnt work irl, eg Socialism. 
however i know that everyone only wants the best for everyone so I respect everyones opinions as long as it is justifiable ! :) "
1270,esfp,"I'm a Trump supporter. I'm pro economy, I think if people have jobs, and a fair shot at making a living, everything else will flow from that. I am against high taxes like in belgium where they start the first tax bracket at 40%. I'm pro immigration and believe in diversity of sexual orientation, ethnicity, culture, and free exchange of ideas, but closed borders and limited immigration from terror hotbeds and cartel dominated countries. Defensive violence is worth it in the short term to solve certain problems in foreign policy, but not worth risking war with nuclear powered nations. We should all sanction China collectively and hit them with tarrifs. I'm anti political correctness, anti media, anti current education system. I believe in Climate change, its a long term problem we need to fix, I'm supportive of banning straws and not driving to help the environment, but I don't think its the government's job to save the planet, I think that burden's on all of us as individuals. Companies should want to act ethically, not be forced to by regulations that don't work and are sometimes a scam. Pro abortion, women should decide, I'm in favor of more women in power, and not just in times of crisis (see the Glass Cliff). I'm in favor of giving equal opportunities to both genders, and I realize men are favored in many industries, workplace harrassment is a serious problem, and women have it tough.
I'm basically a centrist liberal who can't tolerate Late Night Shows where Trevor Noah grandstands and lectures me, teachers who used to tell me about the gender pay gap myth as if to say if a man and a woman get hired for the same job in America, he will be paid more initially if they are both equal, journalists who write clickbait garbage like Gawker, and its made me upset, so I would rather join the Right and attempt to reform the negative elements and bring them closer to center, than to waste my time with the insane left who scare me with their bullying of Trump supporters."
1271,esfp,"Same. In Aus we’re forced to vote, and I always end up drawing cats on my ballot paper cause idk enough to have an opinion. 
Edit: I have a degree in economics, but I don’t care cause I cant make an impact anyway"
1272,esfp,"I'm new to this site and personality typing so excuse my general noobiness, but I don't recall reading anywhere relating to ESFP's avoiding confrontation or letting things slide when they really shouldn't. I do know that a lot of us find we aren't taken seriously though, which might be related. I'm just wondering if this is more prominent in myself, being a little under confident as a person, but I just hate the idea of upsetting people or feeling as though they'll dislike me for solidifying my point and rejecting what they're doing, even though rationally I know I take bullshit all the time and I dont dislike that person because of that... 
So yeah, anyone get what I'm on about?? :)"
1273,esfp,"/u/cloop417 posted this great summary a few days ago: https://type-coach.com/esfp. It has the line ""Highly averse to conflict or tension, ESFPs go well out of their way to maintain harmonious relationships and avoid confrontation."" I definitely think it is typical! I'm fine debating factual things, but when it gets personal or heated I will avoid it like the plague."
1274,esfp,"Yes, that is me exactly. It is pretty funny since my fiance is an INTJ, and he is pretty passionate about logic and sense. In a debate he can come off a bit intense since he feels so strongly about some logical arguments. For a long time our debates ended with him getting more interested in the topic, only to have me panic and shut down the discussion."
1275,esfp,"Haha, my fiance got a kick out of your post. He says it's a good question.
I understand your frustration. I think there are two things that make it easier for us. The first is that we started dating in high school, so we have sort of grown up together, which has influenced my personality. Where I used to be more ESFP, and still am in my core, I have also soaked up a lot of his logic based thinking. The second is that my fiance has been into MB typing for several years now. Unlike a lot of INTJs, and people in general, learning about MB typing really inspired him to be a more well rounded person rather than just using it to justify his quirks. Reading this blog helped both him and I understand INTJs better.  http://intjadvice.tumblr.com/
Really, though, dads are always difficult to deal with. It's like they inflict their quirks upon their children with particular gusto."
1276,esfp,"I'm always down for an adventure but for some reason, it's very hard for me go on one without someone else to take the lead (usually another ESFP).  I have social anxiety, probably from being in the grip of my ni function too much, and it's really hard for me to reach out because im always scared to be rejected in some way.  Any tips to help?  I just went on a cruise, and for whatever reason it was suddenly so easy for me to be like myself and it gave me such a big confidence boost but now that it's over, I don't know if I can hold that mentality for very long since others at my school don't see me that way.  They think I'm shy but I actually just have social anxiety.  "
1277,esfp,"Stop focusing on yourself but on others. In all honestly no one thinks that deeply about someone else. They only remember how you made them feel (such as were you interested in them, did you listen by asking questions, did you make a joke here or there) you’d be surprised but the best way to start a convo is simply saying “hey, how are you?” After that you can say something like “what’s the last movie you saw?” If they say they don’t like movies you can say “well what do you like?” 
Socializing it’s honestly just taking a personal interest in the other person. "
1278,esfp,"Sense of humour! :) One of the best things I learned from being around an ESFP so much is to laugh at everything! Including my own shyness and the awkward things I do when I feel social anxiety. It's funny and I tell ESFP about it afterwards and they laugh. They laugh at their own social interactions too and make lots of jokes to ease tension. Everything is funny and having fun is the goal of every day, that's what I learned is the ESFP way. :) dances "
1279,esfp,"Most ESFPs, in my experience, are pretty sporadic and bounce around from activities, but we can be pretty lazy if we don’t keep busy and we can get into that grip a little when like that. 
I personally don’t have social anxiety and from my understanding, that can make things a little difficult socially. You can have a good amount of questions to ask someone. Maybe about their outfit, their top ten favorite movies, talk about the city you’re both in, memes, books you’ve read, places you’ve been, outlooks on life, what makes them passionate... 
When I’m in the Ni grip, I get like this whether I’m worried about future plans or maybe when I’m in a transition period in my life and life is hectic, I also can be very paranoid, overthink, become cynical, not know how to explain myself/my emotions. Not ideal. 
Whenever I do get like this, going outside for a day hike with a close friend I trust, a solo road trip, or even a picnic can do wonders! Exercising by myself always helps me come back to focus on the present, get those endorphins going. 
I used to be pretty shy myself and not really know how to explain myself and was always curious to where sometimes I’d cause trouble simply because I was trying to understand something or do it a different way. 
Just focusing on living through your actions and how you value situations and setting a standard for yourself that’s proactive to yourself (without stressing yourself to impress others or getting bored with everything) and others. It’s all about just learning as I go, taking opportunities where life takes me (but also having that little bit of deliberation and discernment), taking the time to confide in people who are good for you and appreciate you as an individual, all while staying true to yourself,  owning your shit when you’re wrong, and still being able to see outside of your own box. 
As weird as it may feel while in a grip, really get out there and just slowly refocus yourself. Go to a city you’ve never been to, give yourself a budget, and just explore. You could cook yourself or people you care for a nice meal, draw something even if you don’t think it’s very good, and put on some good dance music and have a ball and remember to just don’t give a fuck while doing it – just feel those vibes!"
1280,esfp,"Sorry for the late reply, but I needed some time to use what you said irl haha.  I tried doing this, but honestly I think this is what I do when I have social anxiety and it makes me feel kind of boring, if that makes sense.  Like in my personal experience, the most interesting people have a lot of to share but also listen, laugh and get excited about my stories.  How would you balance them both?  I feel like I either do one or the other.  "
1281,esfp,"Thanks for your reply, this really helped!  I really need to start doing activities instead of withdrawing and letting myself get in the grip of my Ni.  I didn't even think that maybe I was letting Ni take over, just that maybe I wasn't even an ESFP at all and that gave me such an identity crisis. But when I think about who I was on the cruise, that was me at my healthiest since there were so many convenient fun things to do with my new friends and I just need to remember that and learn to go out of my way for those experiences instead of relying on someone else for it."
1282,esfp,"Hey, no worries. We all get in the grip sometimes and that’s okay, it’s all about knowing how to redirect yourself. Sometimes we need others to help us, find ya a good friend, grab some road trip food, and just have a weekend together!! (If ya can) "
1283,esfp,"I don't actually keep up with famous people all that much. If I had to choose one though, I would probably pick Clinton. I could definitely see myself as becoming one of the most powerful people in the world. Then solely being know for saying ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman"" with the straightest face. People would still just say I was lying because "" I lie""."
1284,esfp,"I'm not sure why I have the urge to share this, but I just feel impulsive...forgive me ;) 
I only know one ESFP for sure, and only because I forced him to take the Myers Briggs on a long road trip. That person is my dad! :)
If I'm judging ESFPs based off of my dad's personality, I'd like to say that you guys really are awesome people!
My dad is funny, spontaneous, brave, charismatic, loyal, forgetful, kindhearted, and always does what he feels is right. He can have a great conversation with anyone about anything (which I admire greatly, since I'm shit at small-talk.)
My mom is ISTP. They've been together for 21 years and they still love each other. Definitely some communication problems! But they laugh when they both come home with a gallon of milk without knowing the other was buying milk (they've done this hundreds of times over the years and not just with milk.)
My dad loves to go on drives to places he's never been, loves to play pranks, loves the new and exciting, loves a good joke, and loves his family. I love that about my dad. He's really a big sweetheart with a million stories. If someone doesn't like my dad, then I seriously question their judgment....but I might be biased (I'm totally not.) 
Tldr: From the daughter of an ESFP, thanks for being you! I'm glad you're out there in the world making life memorable for the ones you're close to. Continue being great and know you're appreciated!"
1285,esfp,"Awww... thanks for this!  I usually see comments about how annoying we ESFPs are, so it’s lovely to read something affirming.  Your dad is lucky to have someone who understands and appreciates him for who he is.  (n_n"
1286,esfp,"I'm an INFP, and I sort of enjoy studying a good friend of mine who is an ESFP. I'm amazed at his ability to instantly relate with anyone. I'm really very envious and I try to pick up some of his behavioral habits.
If all ESFP's are as much fun as this guy, I would love to get to know more of them. I want to know the secret! How do you all do it? 
Also, very refreshing to have someone around to take all of thel pressure off of me when I'm drained or struggling socially."
1287,esfp,"Yeah! I was scrolling through the sub and there's not a lot of love for the ESFP. It made me a little sad! I know that sometimes I forget to treat my dad right because everyone assumes he's always fine, but he's a person too and I know it makes him feel good when he's complimented and told he matters. 
 People love to latch on to stereotypes or the surface. I believe everyone has depth and it's unfair to leave it unexplored! Learning his personality type has made so much stuff make sense. I'm not going by it 100%, but it's nice to get a clear concise description :0"
1288,esfp,Do you think that living/being raised by one creates the other? My parents are pretty different from my sister and I. They said that they wanted to raise us by letting us figure our stuff out on our own. Not a ton of guiding but there was always support when asked. I feel very lucky. 
1289,esfp,"My dad asked me after the test, ""do you think all three of us (my dad, my sister and I) would be friends if we weren't family?"" I told him of course, I just have no idea how the hell we would meet each other 😁
I'm glad to hear you appreciate your friend! My dad may seem like he might not have a lot to him, but he has a lot of depth he only shares with those who are understanding. He's always surprising us. 
Whenever my dad would take me places as a kid and as an adult, he'd strike up a conversation with anyone (at one point as a teenager I stopped going with him because I didn't wanna go talk for an hour with some stranger. How rude of me, lol). Then he'd leave the room for a moment and I'd be sitting there in uncomfortable silence feeling the pressure to continue the talking, lol. When I was a kid I just stayed quiet, but as an adult I don't feel the pressure to talk. I know it's ok if i want to talk or if i don't want to. Ive learned the ways of small talk...and I can stand it for longer than I thought, lol. "
1290,esfp,"Hmm well he likes to tell stories based on what he thinks each person would be interested in. Like, he won't tell a grown ass man that you have to whisper around starfish because they can hear you, haha. 
When my little sister and I were young, he would make stuff up all the time. Now that we're both adults he has to plan it out a bit before making something up. I believed until I was 13 that Seattle, Washington was right over the Columbia river from Portland, Oregon. But ONLY if you take a canoe across (it's definitely a bit farther than just across the river, lol). I'm not a cartographer. ;) 
I remember him telling us that that bears love eating trash. I didn't believe him until I saw it then I was like oh that one was real lol. 
This isn't really a story but one time I helped him bake a big rock into a cake so when someone would cut the cake it wouldn't go through. It was pretty funny and I remember that clearly. Looking back now...that would have taken a lot of effort and planning to work safely. Master prankster. :D"
1291,esfp,"I do not think one creates the other. From what I'm given to understand from the theory, and from brain scans, cognitive preference is both innate, and non-genetic.
​
My parents are ENFP and INFP. I'm ESFP. My middle sister is god knows what, but possibly INFJ. The next one is ESTJ. And the youngest is either ENTJ or ESFP. Will have to figure out once she grows up a little. She has a different mum."
1292,esfp,"I don't know, let's just somehow get this started again? 
I have read that ESFP take things one day at a time.
Is it true for you personally that you take things one day at a time? Can you tell me how to do that?
Do you think it is true that ESFP personality's don't pay enough attention to there own needs?
Let's all just interact, maybe have a good time. I have read that you are all very outgoing so I don't think you will have a problem with that. :)
I should also mention that I don't think I'm a ESFP but I am curious about people who are ESFP. "
1293,esfp,"One way to think of the ""one day at a time"" thing- royFat mentioned calendars. I've never really benefitted from calendar, but what I do love is starting a day by thinking about what I would like to get done, then making a big to-do list. So in the way, I do prefer the one day at a time perspective.
I find that I sometimes don't pay attention to my physical well being as much as others. After some thought, I think its because I have trouble focusing on consequences. Maybe thats an ESFP thing?
What sort of things make you think you are/arent ESFP?"
1294,esfp,"Every time I try to make a to-do list, or a checklist or whatever, it usually ends up with me getting very overwhelmed and then I can't do anything. Taking things one day at a time helps me not be useless and stressed."
1295,esfp,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hello everyone on ESFP! I haven't been able to upload anything for some reason. But I'll continue to post in the comments until I can. 
I was wondering if you all like the daytime or the nighttime better. I like the night time better right know because it's more dark and quite. I also seem to be able to think better at night. "
1296,esfp,"A crosspost of info I put on the INTp page. 
ESFj: http://www.socioniko.net/en/1.1.types/es.html vs ESFp http://www.socioniko.net/en/1.1.types/fr.html
http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1k7vgh/a_socionics_intp_vs_intj/"
1297,esfp,"ATTENTION: Dear ESFP, I am going to leave. I have to start thinking about things more. I have to. 
I also feel that I may want to revive this subreddit more then you want this subreddit which isn't a bad thing.
I wish you all well and I hope that you all discover a lot about yourselves. 
NEVER MIND. I said I would try and I will."
1298,esfp,"Thank you! I am doing my Masters, and a few months ago someone was giving a seminar on working in the industry. She asked us to put up our hand if we don't use a calendar, I was literally the only person in the group of 16 to raise my hand. I felt like I could hear the whole room mentally scoff at me.
Fuck calendars, man. Ugh."
1299,esfp,"I was wondering, how do you know the date without a calendar? Do you look online for the date or can you just keep track of it for the most part? I can easily forget the date if I don't find out what day it is for that day."
1300,esfp,"I make todo lists all the time, but after initially creating them I don't pay a lot of attention to them. I definitely don't have any problem with leaving items on them unchecked, either because I did not do them or even if I did finish it I just didn't get think about checking it off."
1301,esfp,"I just found this sub because I think I just figured out that I am ESFP. I am close to being ISFP, but I definitely love being around people and I actually don't like alone time all that much, I really identify with introverts as well. Anyway, as soon as I finished taking a million tests and reading a lot of info, I finally decided on ESFP and so I, of course, immediately came to reddit to see if there was a sub for me! I am happy to see there is one, but there is almost no one here. I got lucky and it looks like you just updated a few hours ago, so I am on board to help you revive this sub! I am excited to talk with other people like me! :-) "
1302,esfp,"I enjoy the daytime, but I really love the velvetty excitement of night. I get up at 4am to run through the darkness, with no one else around , and think about stuff ( my thoughts flow easily). It's MY time, I enjoy the birds that are awake, the fish that jump, the life that is in the world, and the freedom I have to just run. I always thought I was weird, till I did the MB test at work and found out I'm not weird at all, I'm ESFP (skips). As a side issue, I was married for a long time to an INTJ. Not a success..."
1303,esfp,"Not an ESFP but, while your fervor is commendable, you might be trying to reinvigorate a sinking ship haha.  Every MBTI forum I've been on, the ESFP section is usually a ghost town.  I think its because ESFPs are usually out and about doing things instead of sitting in front of a computer.  Best of luck to your endeavors though!"
1304,esfp,"So much this, my workstation is littered with to-do's and they're all using a different ""scheme"".  And if you finish your task, why bother checking it off?  And if you're not going to check it off, then why start one?  And if you're not starting one, then why am I thinking about this so much?
Then I forget to do the thing because it's not written down anywhere, and start a new list."
1305,esfp,"That's great. I found this subreddit about the same way. I saw someones comment about the personality types and I am interested in psychology so I googled it. I searched the personality subs for a while and finally stumbled upon this one. 
I found this sub but I also found out there are hardly any post! 
So I decided to try to get more post on this sub. 
I'm still trying. I'm doing it for people like you! I knew that ESFP'S need a sub too! So I'm trying to help revive it know get it going again.
I just NEED an obsession. This can become somewhat of a obsession to me. Just something to keep my mind preoccupied. This is working out ok..
But I have not been able to post recently. I have kept trying for a few days but no no avail. So I finally decided to post in the comments instead. Glad I did! Welcome to /r/ ESFP! :)"
1306,esfp,"For me it is not so much being out and about and not having any time to post, but rather that in most cases I just don't have the energy for it. I love discussing face to face, or even better in groups. When I am at the computer it usually is enough for me to think about what I want to answer in a discussion but then I don't have the energy to complete it. Thinking about things such as how moderation should work is way to abstract to me."
1307,esfp,"Personally, I don't really agree with a lot of this guy's typing and I don't really agree that Taylor Swift is ESFP. So far in my opinion, I think the only typing he's actually done a good job on is Alex Jones but even with Alex Jones, I don't agree with his concluded typing. Generally speaking, conspiracy theories revolve around Ni and so ENFP for Alex Jones doesn't really make sense because of Ne. Alex Jones seems to be in the Ni-Se or Se-Ni Dynamic/Axis to me and I feel he's a J-type so some kind of NJ. I guess I can agree that Alex Jones is on the Fi-Te or Te-Fi Dynamic/Axis which leaves either ENTJ or INTJ and I'm leaning towards INTJ for him."
1308,esfp,"Most of us have read articles talking about the best suited careers for our personality type and I thought it would be interesting to see how similar or different we are to those articles. 
So what do you do (or want to do) for your career? "
1309,esfp,Honestly I would really enjoy being in Human Resources. That is where the real money is and you get to travel all over the world!! But I may stick to Elementary Education. Because I feel like that would be the best way to go. Considering I want a family and I wouldn't be an amazing mom if I went ahead and did what i want  (:
1310,esfp,"Haha all the jobs mentioned so far sound awesome. I guess that's what happens with like minded people!
I'm studying to be a medical/scientific illustrator. I mainly do comics and  hope to work on comic based patient education for kids and teens."
1311,esfp,"I am a embalmer/funeral director. I love doing restorative art and giving families a chance to say goodbye when they thought it was impossible.   
I also occasionally perform with a burlesque/circus troupe, where I spin fire poi, pole dance and walk around body painted for promotional work... Conservative by day unconventional by night! "
1312,esfp,"I'm an airborne linguist for the USAF. It's not a bad gig, and I really enjoy doing my job. All of the bs that comes with the military, and government in general, makes the job hard to stay happy with."
1313,esfp,"I am a corporate trainer. I train new hires for 6 or 9 weeks, depending on department. I am either in front of a group of 12 to 20 people. Or we do train virtually (camera time!) I love it. I have been told that I have been one of the best teacher/trainer they have ever had, and always made dry material entertaining/engaging. I get to tell stories with everyone all ears. I have basically an opening monologue every morning basically on par with any good late night host (work appropriate of course). And after 6 or 9 weeks they leave me go out and do the job, and I get a whole new group. Perfect!"
1314,esfp,"What does your training consist of? Tech stuff? Sales?
Also do you get feedback from people after they are working for a while? Do they think your training helped a lot or do they find the real world to be a different beast?"
1315,esfp,"It's not too hard! But it largely depends upon the individuals you're looking after. The two clients I have aren't that difficult to work with, at least most of the time.
A lot of the job is stuff I already have to do, like laundry and dishes, so it's like just doing that for two additional people. I'm their nighttime caretaker/ home coordinator, they live with me. They have day programs too which are completely separate from my job."
1316,esfp,"Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is!
Thank you for your time I really appreciated also shout out to ""ThePixelHunter"" for helping me in this!

1317,esfp,"Fellow ESFPs,
I'm curious to know how educated you think you are in comparison to your average peer. For example, post your age, HS GPA and ACT/SAT score, College degree/degree you seek when getting into college, and your post graduate profession (salary if you'd like).
I am only asking because ware are commonly known as being the butt of a joke, gullible, and are sometimes seen as having no scholarly background (stereotypes of ESFPs I've seen people post online). If you don't feel like posting this much personal information about yourself, give your opinion about the subject.

HS--
GPA: 2.5
ACT: 31 
I hated homework and project deadlines and was frequently late on turning everything in, but would do extremely well on exams with night before studying.

College--
Degree: European History/Business Administration

Profession--
Motorcycle Salesperson: Nothing of my degree trained me to become a salesman, but sales has become a natural talent of mine. If I was an ESTP rather than ESFP using Fi my numbers would be much higher. 

Does having an education aid my sales talent and ability to work with people so well? I think that college classes have benefited my intelligence, but my college and high school experiences outside of the classroom have made me a smarter person. What do you think about yourself? "
1318,esfp,"18F, 3.8 GPA, 2390 SAT and currently attending an Ivy League college to study engineering and applied math. People think I'm stupid all the time. I don't consider myself smart, I just consider myself hard working and well disciplined which I guess is smart in the sense that I have the sensibility to know to work super hard."
1319,esfp,"3.4 I am really smart, but act like a dumb ass. I have a lot of N and T it's just not as high as my S and F. I'm really good at History and  Science, and English . Math gives me a head ache. It's wayyy to concrete and then too abstract. I'm finally understanding it. I also have good common sense. I am going into Pediatrics, I  Love kids and Science/Health."
1320,esfp,"I'm an assistant teacher in a 3K preschool class. Constantly moving; just enough structure to know what to do next, yet quite a few days have been ""Hey, so we're just going to wing it today!"" So there's plenty of chaos to balance the schedule.
I love it! :)"
1321,esfp,"System Engineer working in the space flight industry.  Launching rockets is as exciting as it gets, everyday stuff can get boring and I can definitely forget to do things I should have taken care of months ago, but it's fast pace enough that I'm constantly having to figure out something new which I enjoy."
1322,esfp,"I would be a tour guide if it paid (I just love being a snobby annoying yet extroverted prick) but instead I'm stuck with micropreneurialship. Currently working on a social media network that needs no ads and instead borrows computing power to mine cryptocurrencies (I've also developed a way to explain it which will put anyone to sleep. I call it ""snorecoin"")."
1323,esfp,"Certified Nursing Assistant. I work in a Nursing home, and do all of the day to day care for the people that live there, and work closely with the Nurses in charge of there meds and treatment and such. "
1324,esfp,"I'm a woman who dated an esfp guy - he was fun, but I always felt like he was putting me in a weird position where he almost wanted me to parent him or something.  The relationship didn't last long, but he was a good guy.  One thing I admire about him is that I know he will have no regrets on his death bed as he is certainly living a full life of adventure/pleasure/fun.  I figure I should maybe learn to do more of that stuff in my life time, but the logistic confuse me - HOW do I do it?"
1325,esfp,"It's kind of a hard to explain how out brains process things. Our entire mindset is so fun and loving that we think there is no other way to act. I guess the best answer has to do with our mindset. INTPs are really interesting for me, I don't know if I'd date one but whenever I think I've spotted an INTP I always break their shell and pretty much get them involved in any conversation. It's a fun skill to have. I guess a good way to experience an ESFP mindset would be to go out drinking and to be super outgoing and emotional with the people you talk to. "
1326,esfp,I don't know if this is a question that's been asked before or if it's strange to be asked on this sub. But I am genuinely interested on a dominant sensors view of spirituality and believing in higher things. I know everyone will have different views but what are some of your guys' view on the subject? Thanks for any replies!
1327,esfp,"Hi!  As the title said, I'm an INTP and my sister is an ESFP.  Do these two personalities naturally disagree with each other?  When we were younger we fought constantly and she's always been attebtion-seeking.  She'll do whatever she has to do for attention and I see through it, but no one else does.  I'm not trying to offend any of you, but is this behavior common for ESFPs and for anyone that has an INTP brother, is fighting common between the two types?"
1328,esfp,"I'm not taking offense to, however your question did seem pretty negatively presented. 
I guess you could say we 'do whatever we can for attention' but in reality it's because we truly enjoy the company and presence of others. We love being around people and being considered part of their daily experience if only for a moment. 
A lot of people get this confused with pride and greed. Also insecurity and self doubt but in reality I find it to be the opposite. Sure there are people out there who just want others attention to make them feel better but me and ll my ESFP friends just love having a good time. And if nobody is presenting a situation for a good time, then we make one. "
1329,esfp,"Yeaaah. I have a good friend who is a INTP and even though we share very similar interests we fight all the time because we have completely different values. We just don't talk too deep about anything anymore because that gets in the way of fun when we hang out. And who cares if anyone is an attention seeker? As long as they are not hurting you - and I presume your sister never stole your moment of fame or anything - attention seeking isn't a bad thing. She'll grow out of it so dw.
Ps. Lol just to give you some prospective, my friend thinks a lot of the things I do is fake because they are dependent on what others think about it. But I only go with the majority because more often than not, the main stream option works and I think having something that works in real life is more practical than blindlessly sticking to an ideal. Ideals are something that can change at any time you know?"
1330,esfp,"I know I did present it wrong.  I didn't try to but I just don't like my sister and I guess I projected that dislike on this post.  I don't understand her and I am a bit confused with extroverted behavior.  However, thanks for replying.  I think I need to step in another person's shoes once and see the way others see things."
1331,esfp,"So. Dated girl. Intp. 
Shit I learnt about myself. 
I need to go outside more. As a kid I did this all the time. 
I don't need romance, I need friendship. I thought going into all this that romance and stuff from Rom coms was legit. Found out that I just need a great time with a mate. 
I don't like not having options. I love to do what I want when I want how I want. It's all rather spontaneous. 
I value others opinions very highly. 
I love meeting new people. Especially if they are fun and out going. I always gravitated towards introverts but having been with one extroverts are fantastic
Single and mingling. 
Fun loud and possibly funny times ahead xD"
1332,esfp,"Usually by hanging out with other people. I get antsy when I'm cooped up with myself, especially with nothing particularly fulfilling to do. 
My current hobby is riding bikes though- usually I do it solo out of convenience (it's a bitch and a half trying to get a bunch of cyclists to meet and ride bikes together) because of my schedule, but riding with others is more fun too. "
1333,esfp,"Really mind-numbing stuff; sitcoms, long cuddles, sleep ins, massages. I liked yoga too but only when there was someone talking about the poses/ meditations. I find it really hard to just sit and think 'inwards' without freaking out so meditating on my own has never really worked out."
1334,esfp,Yeah hobbies basically stuff I can lose myself in. Easy stuff like TV/movies or stuff that takes work like drawing. Or exercise. And of course other people if that's an option. Basically everything everyone already said
1335,esfp,10000000%!!!! I don't know if it's because I'm a T type as well but man we just like simple things at the end of the day. I think as someone who usually dominates social situations/ gets their way with a lot it's also nice to sit back and have someone take the lead/ decide what to do. 
1336,esfp,Hey everyone! Do any of my fellow ESFPs struggle with getting to know people? Like your personality coming off too strong? I love to entertain people and sometimes I think new people can take it the wrong way or they don’t take me seriously. I’m a people pleaser and I’ve been frustrated recently because I feel that people think I’m weird or immature. Thanks for letting me rant!
1337,esfp,I feel the same exact way! When I find someone I think of as interesting I want to throw all my energy in impressing them and becoming their friend but it always back fires on me. I feel like I come on too strong and overshare to the point where they feel uncomfortable.
1338,esfp,"I feel that too. Everyone tells me how kind, fun, and supportive I am but when I look around those same people aren’t always the same to me. The only person supporting me emotionally is my partner. I get told I’m loved all the time but it feels like people keep me at an emotional arm’s length. Bleh
Im just gonna have to save my extra awesomeness for the people who actually stick around, but it’s hard! "
1339,esfp,"For me, I love partying with ESTP, ENTJ, and INFPs. Another Se dominant is fun to go to the bars with, and an ENTJ intensiveness is something I like to keep up with if I'm partying. I say INFP because I lived with one for 4 years and I tended to drag him out to parties whenever I could. N types are fun to party or have drunk convos with since you can talk about just anything if it's abstract. 
I am not a fan of partying with ESTJ, ISFJ, or ENFJ. Something about them brings me down when I'm boozing"
1340,esfp,"ESTPs, ENTPs, other ESFPs, not sure if I've partied with ENFPs but probably them too. It depends what kind of party though. If it's just a kickback then ISFPs, ISTPs and sometimes INFPs or INTPs can be pretty cool too. So basically P types lol. P for party"
1341,esfp,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?
Thank you!"
1342,esfp,"I don't like to be asked out on the spot by someone I don't know well. I would rather have a relationship form organically from a friendship. I am not against having said person ask me out in a romantic way though. If I didn't know them well, I would be flattered, but would likely decline (or maybe go on one date and see where it goes. It's hard to say what I would do. I tend to live in the moment.)"
1343,esfp,"ESFP dude and I have a really hard time asking anyone out, a constant struggle because I have a constant fear of rejection (almost even more with people I like that I know like me) but I'm starting to think it may be because of that dominant function thing and I'm scared of missing out on another opportunity.  I know that I think about it sometimes there is almost an instant thought of you know I don't want to date this person because I really like them but I don't think I can marry them, but if I start dating them it's going to be very hard to end it without hurting their feelings and literally start over thinking timelines in the extreme distant future that whenever i do actually have time to self reflect on make absolutely no sense.  So to answer the question personally the best relationships have been ones with instant connections where I'm approached and feel appreciated without feeling like I've been my overly extroverted self yet.  Which is weird but we may be a love at first sight type personally since we work well with multiple, but I think I'm attracted instantly to chicks with my same personally type, but tend to build stronger feelings towards more intorverted types I get to know well.  Though nothing tends to last due to whatever it is that tends to scare me even though I really desire the companionship."
1344,esfp,"May have something to do with having the lowest subscriber rate among personality types , but only a hunch.
Go over to r/INTJ and explode with sweet talk and bubbliness and see if people don't flock toward you like bumblebees in heat!"
1345,esfp,"Just be friendly and talk. Ask questions. 
As an ESFP, I truly apprecitate someone that shows genuine interest in my life.. Someone that asks questions.  However, I have a very good sense of if someone is being genuinely nice or just BSing me. "
1346,esfp,I'd say to try to not overthink it and just naturally be authentic with us as much as you can. We really appreciate it when people have the courage  and capacity to be who they are. Please don't be fake with us. We don't like it.
1347,esfp,"think most of my friendships in the past start with a clingy, aggressive extroverted person not leaving me alone or else being in the vicinity of another introvert and being like ok guess we’re friends now "
1348,esfp,"Just graduated High school in small town Arkansas. Did some neat shit there:
 I sang in Carnegie Hall in NYC with choir. Also about to act in the International Thespian Festival with my troupe. Grew up with some amazingly talented kids with nothing else to do but succeed."
1349,esfp,"I turned a few panties and some bungee cords into a slingshot. I'm quite pleased with this, as this device is capable of launching and/or exploding large fruits. Seriously, it's an amazing feeling to make one watermelon explode by hitting it with another watermelon. "
1350,esfp,"I've heard that theory a lot, but I don't agree with it. I think ESFPs would end up with spare time like others, and it makes sense for us to want to communect with people online. I think the reason is more so that discussing Myers -Briggs testing requires a certain level of abstract analysis, which is not our favourite thing.
I do really enjoy discussing things in depth. I am from a science background, its not that I think we are bad at all analysis or abstract thought... but something about dissecting personalities in such a structured way doesn't fully engage me. I enjoy it, but not nearly on the same level as my INTJ husband. "
1351,esfp,"INTJs are the best. Through Myers-Briggs I finally understand the difference between 'opposites' attracting and repelling each other. My husband and I understand the world in the same ways, with opposite strengths. Perfect complementation. As opposed to opposites who comprehend things completely differently.
I really like hearing him describe Myers-Briggs types because I don't have the patience for the nitty gritty ""external x internal y tertiary function"" sort of analysis, but he can understand it and explain it well."
1352,esfp,"You know there are certain things in life that I would love to have a good chunk of knowledge on, and MBTI is one of them. I suppose one of these days in my free time, me and the boyfriend should do a little research on it, I'd (and my boyfriend also) like to be as well read on it as your husband is"
1353,esfp,"Hello ESFPs!
I'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the ""adventurer"" which according the the 16-personalities website are the most spontaneous personalities and get along pretty well together.
This group has the potential to be one of the most interesting and fun with many interesting people that I've ever had the privilege of moderating.
Here is the Skype link to join the group: https://join.skype.com/hBYUvET7Hx4P
Or you can contact me directly if you have questions and i'll add you to it directly
My Username: kaspeey"
1354,esfp,"I love talking about stupid and deep stuff!
The only problem is that I have no fucking clue what to say to catch people's attention with a question.
Could you please give me some examples of what to ask to someone you don't know?"
1355,esfp,"I honestly am in the same boat as you. I completely suck at small talk. Although, a good friendship I had started by me going up to them and saying, ""Hi, nice to meet you. I'm terrible at small talk and have no idea what to say."" We then bonded over or mutual hatred of small talk and started a genuine friendship. 
Either that, or I just ask someone how their life is going. If they give the generic ""fine"" sort of answer, I ask what makes it fine and stuff like that (and then gauge if they actually are wanting to talk more about it). I ask a lot of ""why"" questions and ""what makes it that way"" and ""in what way"" sort of questions and then just sort of go from there. I don't know if that answers your question, but I've found doing stuff like that to be very helpful when you already have a basic relationship started with another person and are just looking for ways to get deeper with them.
Does this answer your question or was this not quite what you were looking for?"
1356,esfp,"I usually talk about something stupid like ""how's the weather today"" but depending on what they said, I'm usually able to carry the conversation and it will drift off to something else that is totally unrelated to the weather.
Or I'll say something that I've been thinking about recently eg I'll lament about being unable to watch Dunkirk because I didn't have time, but I really want to watch it because the soundtrack is excellent and the topic about movies will probably start...provided the person I'm talking to responds to me of course.
ESFP here btw"
1357,esfp,"How do you guys manage University life, like in terms of academics and social life and other activities?
I just feel that I can’t keep a good balance between the two. It’s so hard to even have a social life if you are focused on studies or vice versa.
As for academics, Im currently on the failing edge in terms of academics, I don’t know man, maybe I just really don’t like the course of study I’m doing right now. But the thing is, if I quit halfway, how would my parents feel about sending loads of money only to fail after that.
Is university life really hard, like especially for engineering students and shits or maybe it’s just me. I feel like I can’t cram in anything, like it’s so boring.
What should I do? It’s been bothering me for ages."
1358,esfp,"Im in the same boat man. College is not a happy place for me, because studying, homework and work consume my life, and it makes me unhappy, because i really had no social life. I told my parents that and they told me to take some time off to think and reflect, so here i am taking the semester off, and I’m feeling way better. I’m not saying drop out, but take a step back at the situation, or a break to recharge."
1359,esfp,"We all must suffer one of two things: the pain of regret, or the pain of discipline. 
This is life, unfortunately. 
I did a uni course I had no passion for because it offered a safe career. I put in my hard time during uni, and I’m cruising now. No regrets. "
1360,esfp,"I wonder if it's because it's hard for us to plan ahead and block off time. It's either all in or nothing. I'm actually an ENFP, but I think I know what it's like be S pretty well because a lot of people in my life are S's and I've developed some S tendencies. When I was more N I could block off time better - like I'll study for 30 minutes, socialize for 30, do my laundry, and come back. When I'm more S, I just work until I'm hungry, eat until I'm full, work until I'm bored, go do something, feel guilty about it, and have to get back to work. It's kind of stressful, honestly. My brother (who's an ISFP), suggested that I decide how much I need to get done to feel good about myself, and then decide to do other things. Maybe that will be a good way to keep things balanced. Hope that helps!"
1361,esfp,"How are you cruising though? Sounds like you went with the sure, safe career choice and not what you were passionate about?
I only ask because I did this too, and now have a computer science degree, but almost every aspect of coding is fundamentally against an ESFP personality, which I feel now. 
Comparatively, uni was easy compared to this feeling of unhappiness working 9 hours a day in a job that is not right for my personality."
1362,esfp,"I went with accounting, and instead of working in tax or reporting or boring shit, I ended up partnering with sales and marketing to to maximise our sales and returns... i guess what I’m trying to say is, i found the most ESFPish job in my chosen field. Would you have an option like that in coding?"
1363,esfp,"I'm a ENTP male and in a ""happy"" relationship with a ESFP. 
We have a lot in common and really love each other, but every time, like EVERY time, she decides to ignore me at all as soon there are ""new"" people.
I also caught her kissing (i was picking her up from a concert and spotted her with him kissing) her ex two times and she nearly got raped twice, and that were just the things she let me know.
We live in a long-distance-relationship and I simply don't know, how I could loose my enourmous trust issue in her.
The things I loved about her; being open minded and friendly, caring and very fast in making social contacts are now it making me feel insecure and i'm just thinking about how long it will probably last until I'll catch her cheating again.
I mean, she can't even control her body language when she's around new men, especially men which are looking good. Because when new girls are around, she's just friendly and open minded, but when there's a new guy she has interest in, her body language switches automatically to flirt mode, even when she says that this is her way to show she's interested (she would be even interested in a talk to biggest dictators and would find something good in them)
I wanted her to let me know just a few things when she's going out   but now she said i would cutoff her ""freedom"", but when I'm not writing back for like a hour because I have something to do she really gets upset and thinks that i'm with another girl.
Do you guys need freedom all the time or is it just a sign for me to break up and leave her alone with her so called ""freedom"".
I'm just shaking in fear because of the faults she did  in the past but she's just saying, ""I won't cheat on you"" but demands massive trust while not going any step towards me and make me know more about her life or her actions, also she keeps her mobile phone always in her hands and writing or tumblring all the time, but when i'm talking to her vie whatsapp or the facebook messenger i wait around 20 minutes for a respond wich is indeed more often a simple ""k"", ""y"", ""chill"" instead of the intense talks we had in former times. It's killing me because i love her but she doesn't give one single fuck about my trust issue and is upset because she thinks i would see her as a bitch.
pls halp."
1364,esfp,"No you're not. My guess is you guys have been together for <1 year.
Red flag #1. This is an observation I've seen in manipulative people. In one on one interactions they may treat someone very well, but when other people around the respect completely goes away. She is using you for something.
She's lying to you, cheating on you, and manipulating you. What more could you ask for in a girlfriend, right? Rape is something that should be taken seriously. Judging the behavior you described in your post, I honestly think she's full of shit about ""nearly"" getting raped.  
Snap out of it. You're acting irrationally.
You're treating her cheating as if it is a ticking time bomb? It doesn't have to be. She clearly has no respect for you, but let me ask you something: do you have any respect for yourself?
Oh, she's ""interested"" alright. If there is a positive correlation between her flirtatious behavior and the perceived attractiveness of a guy, then she is definitely ""interested"". Come on, buddy, this is common sense.
""Freedom"" as in freedom to pursue her ""interests""?
She's fucking with you. 100%. Let me make this clear: She doesn't like YOU. She likes the attention you give her. 
And you don't have to anymore. Next time somebody cheats on you, or you see red flags, you cut it off.
From my observations, girls have their hands glued to their phones all the time. And by the sound of it, she deliberately took 20 minutes to reply to your message. There is no mutual respect in your interactions. This is not a relationship.
Has it ever occurred to you that the reason why she doesn't give a fuck about your trust issues is that you ""love"" her? Think about it from her perspective. If a guy is giving her constant validation despite him knowing that she cheated and has not broken up with her yet, would she invest her time caring about something as contrary to her ""interests"" as your ""trust issues""? She has no respect for you because you have no respect for yourself. Stop caring about what she thinks. She is a bitch/slut/whatever because she cheated, no matter what she says.
Stop trying to accommodate for her point of view and view her objectively. 
Heres what you do, and you can ignore my advice at your expense:
You're going to cut off all contact and work on yourself. In a couple days/weeks she is going to apologize/miss/text/etc. you. You're going to ignore it. What happens if you don't? She's going to cheat on you again and again and, eventually, she is going to be the one that dumps you.
You sound like a guy that is dependent on people for his happiness. Don't be that guy. Work on your OWN life and people will come. Give people a REASON to want to hang out with you. Work out, pursue your interests, and people will come.
The problem with this girl is that you are disposable. There are more attractive guys that she has access to and she is only using you for the attention/validation you give her. The way you combat that is you simply stop worrying about other people and pursue your own interests. In every interaction you have with people there is an exchange of value (money,looks,skills, etc.). Work on your own value and people will come.
In the meantime, erase this girl from your memory. You are only wasting your time"
1365,esfp,"You're in the relationship. She isn't. We cheat when we don't take the relationship seriously. ESFP in long distance relationship is just asking for it. We are out of sight out of mind. Trust me I tried it with another ESFP.
That said just because we get in flirt mode around some guys doesn't mean we are interested, sometimes we might just be nervous around them.
Yeah man she's not into you anymore, you're a backup plan when she's not getting attention from other guys. Seems like she is trying to get you to stop contacting her since she doesn't wanna break it off herself. Sorry but time to let her go."
1366,esfp,"ESFP's are the flightiest, most illogical people I've ever met. They are fun, spontaneous and can be absolutely captivating, however, there is no rational thoughts in their world. Only feeling and being in the moment. Responsibilities and real life are a chore for them to think about and a relationship where they are tied down is no different. They have no concept of consequences. Honestly dude do you constantly want to be disappointed in the person who you are dating? She clearly treats you like garbage so why torture yourself? There are LOTS of red flags with what you posted and you should already see the writing on the wall. I will honestly be surprised if an ESFP even reads through your entire post before getting bored. Do yourself a favor and end it with her. She will not meet your needs in the way you expect her to. You deserve to be in a relationship where you feel wanted. Speaking as an ENTP with experience with this...run. You will never be happy in this relationship. "
1367,esfp,"The only true part of that comment was when you said I wouldn't read the whole post. No, not every esfp cheats. Yes we get bored and try new things but that doesn't mean we are doucebags about it. Tell her you need to talk with her in a serious setting. No phones or Skype or anything. Face to face in a serious environment and lay it all out there for her. Don't try to spare her feelings. Tell her what you have been going through. Don't let her make a cop out answer. If she isn't mature enough to tell you what is going on then you might have to take a step back and look at the relationship as a whole."
1368,esfp,"We wanted to go to a Festival as a pair and she said, she'll go missing for some hours after some concerts because she wants to meet some new people liking the same music she does. I just wanted to go there with her, watchingin' her dance to her fav music.
But she directly said she will go missing for hours, and that mobile phones won't be charged at festivals as always. Why? and she underestimates that people are probably going to be drunk and trying to flirt as fuck with her, like every guy on Festival does with a open-minded esfp and then there is the thing that rustled my jimmies, that she really makes this ""freedom"" we ned to talk about."
1369,esfp,"IF she goes to the concert with you, she should spend that time with you. Otherwise she should go alone. Not all ESFP's cheat. ESFP's are flighty creatures, but loyal.  I have gotten bored with people I've dated, and it resulted in the end of the relationship, but I would never cheat. Cheaters, in my experience are a product of their upbringing. Cheaters, in my experience, don't stop cheating just because they are caught. But I wouldn't maintain a relationship with a cheater after their true colors run. If they can't be devoted at the beginning of a relationship, the passage of time will only make that worse. "
1370,esfp,"Ask her if she want to sleep with other dudes, and if she is flabbergasted that you would ask, tell her that she needs to stop acting like she does want to fuck around. Don't let yourself be treated like a piece of meat.  If she wont treat you with respect, she no good. Find a version of her that will.  "
1371,esfp,"Hmm.  In my experience, yes.  Maybe they've developed an insecurity about it? My ESFP daughter is constantly spinning,  jumping, dancing, singing, drawing, etc.  CONSTANTLY.  She can't stop.   She does it absent mindedly."
1372,esfp,"I freaking love to dance. I dance every time I go to a club and most every time I go to a bar with music. I much prefer to dance with another person, nothing overtly sexual just standard club dancing, but I'm also not opposed to dancing by myself. I'm not particularly good at it but I can't really help it, it's like an instinctual thing for me. "
1373,esfp,"I've never been widely confident about my looks or dancing ability, and I've never been one for 'girly' activities, but even I love dancing when I'm alone or watching dance shows. Something about it. It feels like some amazing combination of expressing yourself and hands-on activities."
1374,esfp,"I actually feel exactly the same way as you do.   I don't often empathize with someone  unless their problem hits really close to home. 
The way you worded this makes me want to reply with ""are you me?"" "
1375,esfp,"I agree. I'm the same, unless it's an issue I can truly relate to then I find it difficult not to automatically distance myself from it... I've been told I give fantastic advice and I'm a great listener by some people, but I've also been told I'm a shit listener and not at all helpful by others. Depends on their problems I guess."
1376,esfp,"As a ENFP. In my opinion it depends how open you are to make facts a ""priority"".  In addition  for them to discuss and accept your pattern recognition abilities, trust in your insights, use them to help make decisions. If they understand your thinking style it could work great. 
I can easily get along with ESFPs and enjoy their energy, their ability to ""adapt and overcome"". Although  too much of raw data without speculating about its ""meaning"" kinda sucks. Or being looked at as unimportant.
Good luck"
1377,esfp,"I Feel like ESFPs are seen as social outgoing people, which i am for the most part, but whenever I'm in a social situation where I'm the only one that doesnt know anyone or only know a few people i get really uncomfortable and become really scared to come on too strong or seem weird. Is this normal for you guys?"
1378,esfp,"Very normal!
I think ESFP's are better at projecting confidence, and hiding anxiety, but we tend to ease into situations once we are comfortable. 
Social anxiety is normal for everyone to a certain degree actually, I think we just handle it differently from other personalities. "
1379,esfp,Very normal! I once went to a party not knowing everyone and could see people were gesturing 'whats this guy talking about' 'hes crazy' which definitely got to me (have a case of verbal diarrhoea when I'm in these situations'
1380,esfp,"I feel you. I hold myself back a lot in these situations, especially if when I do try and open up to everyone I get negative feedback. It’s very hit or miss for me though, because sometimes I could be completely comfortable with the people I’m with and just let myself loose and try not to let embarrassment hold me down, but most of the time I’ll end up sitting back with my mouth shut wishing I could speak up but can’t gather the balls to do it. I can absolutely relate to this. "
1381,esfp,What do you guys look for in the initial step of dating? I've read that the opposite of your dominant function is best. For us that would be that would be ISTJ or ISFJ. I personally love introverted girls
1382,esfp,"I want you to be happy. It sounds weird but I feed off others happiness and I will do whatever it takes to make them happy. I am VERY slow to judge people so please do not be afraid to talk to me or joke around with me. I live for that kind of thing. I don't care if you like skydiving or if you like reading. I just want to be able to enjoy my happiness with others. 
I do like it when she knows what she wants. I am an extremely easy going person and I enjoy basically every aspect of life. If you ask me where I want to go for food or what I want to do today 2/3 of the time I will say that I don't care and I want to do whatever you want to do. People mistake this as indesiciveness but I really don't have a presence and I WOULD like to just be with you doing whatever. "
1383,esfp,"I'm dating an INTP, and have been for 4 years.
What attracted me most was how forward he was. Looking back, he was really stepping out of his comfort zone. Initially, I'm way more attracted other E_F_ people because I can more easily start a conversation and get excited with/about them.
Long-term wise, my boyfriend INT nature truly drives me nuts sometimes, and vice versa for him. I think if looking for a long-term relationship, ESFPs should be aware of how little Introverts may like the ""jumping from extreme to extreme"" lifestyle we have."

1386,esfp,"I recently went through a lot of changes and currently don't have a significant other, family, or many friends.  I'm in the process of a rebuilding from a fresh start, but without many people to spend time with I constantly find myself alone.  When I have to spend a day alone I just get so incredibly sad and bored... no matter how productive I am the day still feels like a waste without anyone to share it with. My hobbies stop entertaining me when it's all I ever have to do. I would really like to figure out how to enjoy my own company and be less dependent on attention from others.
How do other ESFPs keep themselves from feeling lonely without people around? How did you learn to enjoy your own company?"
1387,esfp,"For me, I still have it sometimes, but it's not crippling or stopping me from enjoying life. I got cats to avoid loneliness. Pets that like cuddling really help. I have a hobby, that has people with it, so I establish some lightweight friendships in there. I also exist a lot online. And I still feel somewhat lonely. Not sure what to say. Learn some mindfulness. Explore why you find it so oppressive and anxiety inducing? Are you good at being alone?
Good thing is joining different clubs, or sport teams, or gyms, and building a connection. Try find people in areas you are interested in. Express yourself."
1388,esfp,"I'm not the best example. I have only lived entirely alone in my own apartment for a month of life out of my 33 years. 
Now I live in a poly cluster with my husband, his husband, and our children. I love it this way. I am not sure if I really could live all on my own for extended periods of time. The truth is, I wouldn't want to do that. I live for the company of others.
But do I enjoy time by myself? Yes. My primary alone time is during exercise. Even so, my long runs are often a chance to reconnect with friends, so I only exercise alone sometimes - but this is the time I use to think, ponder, and wonder. Exercise is the best when the physical fades away - I can't even tell I'm running anymore because I'm floating away in my head. It's what I need, because I can't have my head in the clouds at home, so my long run in the mountains is the perfect mental vacation.
I'm just glad that I have a big poly family to come home to after my little temporary escape to the mountains.
My advice is balance - find ways to enjoy your own company that allow you to rebalance and refresh. And there's nothing wrong with seeking out friends, family, and acquaintances for company most of the time.
Just think of Eleanor Roosevelt. She basically became part of her personal doctor's family near the end of her life.
Polyamory suits us ESFPs better than other types, I believe. "
1389,esfp,"I used to be worried about that as a teen, but right now I deal with it a lot more easily. I just kinda realized that I don't need to chase people to be happy. Being alone doesn't have to be a big deal. I go through periods of being by myself and then living an active social life, and when I'm by my solo I don't mind it. I really enjoy being around people I like, but I don't constantly need it. Weed also helps if you're into that sort of stuff.
Be more active on the internet would be my only advice, maybe try to rekindle some old relationships in real life too"
1390,esfp,"My son is an ESFP. I can see this type of pain in him when he doesn't have enough opportunity to get out with his friends or experience new things. Meetup.com is a godsend, for both his development and my sanity. As an INTP I used it to explore my interests and ended up finding some of the greatest friends I've ever had. Friends isn't even the right term, they have become what I consider to be my real family. The beauty is that you don't have to rush into relationships (my pitfall when I used to let myself get so lonely I'd take whatever came along lol) as you can get to know people slowly and organically through the process of performing fun, healthy, inspiring activities together. 
I really don't think it's a good idea to try to learn to enjoy your own company for any extended period of time as an ESFP. Your strength, and my son's lie in your transcendent abilities in relational activity and to deny yourself and others of that would just be a type of ""little death"" that neither you, nor the world, deserve. If there isn't anything that interests you in your area, start your own Meetup!"
1391,esfp,Practice practice practice! I purposely moved out alone this year so i could spend time by myself without needing to rely on hanging out with other people. It gets easier with time (and I’ve actually turned into a little but of a hermit)
1392,esfp,"No of course not. That's silly and you know that's not what I was saying.
All I'm saying is that ESFPs might be more accepting of different types of relationships outside the standard traditional monogamy, due to our bubbly accepting nature and our ability to accept people for who they are."
1393,esfp,"Hello! I am trying to think of a good gift for my boyfriend's sister, who is an ESFP. We are not close, but we are friendly. I thought about getting her an ""experience gift,"" like a ticket for a zipline or hot air balloon ride. I think that would come across like me trying way too hard, however, because it is quite pricey. Any help? She loves her dogs and she is very very social. She is also into material things it seems (always well-dressed and very put together home). Please help! I am an INFJ female and we do not look forward to the same kind of gifts. I bet she would hate a book of poetry or any book at all for that matter. :p"
1394,esfp,"I would not advise a book, it's like impossible to gauge someone's reading taste. Does she seem to wear very pricey things? If not a gift card to a store would be a good bet. And you can't go wrong with Victoria's Secret for females"
1395,esfp,I'm an ESFP and love reading. A common misconception about our personality type is that we are ditzy which is the opposite of true :) Here's a link to an article that might be helpful 
1396,esfp,"I can second this. Never had so much fun debating. But it was also very exhausting. They're still my favorite type to date. I never get bored. Then again Ive never dated my supposed matches (isfj,istj) so idk?"
1397,esfp,"Hey everyone! I started seeing an ESFP that really identifies with the type and am having trouble figuring out what exactly he's looking for. I thought we communicated to each other that we were both interested in companionship (although I would be interested in exploring other options as well), but he acts very ""couple-y"" when we are together. He also referred to the first time we met as a ""first date,"" which has thrown me off because it seems to contradict the companionship we both discussed beforehand. Any insight would be greatly appreciated!"
1398,esfp,"He's into you if he referred to it as a date. I as an ESFP have trouble with my uh, well I call him my fake boyfriend cuz I can't even get a read on him. He's an ESFP. Some of us are so in the moment we kinda forget about you unless you're around. But he sounds like he's trying to couple for sure.
As far as being an ENFJ I really like ENFJs, usually. I think we make a good pair."
1399,esfp,"Thanks for your take! You ESFPs are hard to read ;) And I think he gets very caught up in the moment; I'm not constantly around and we don't talk much when we aren't together, but I like that because space is important to me."
1400,esfp,"Huh the ones I know don't seem like that. Some of them really like using their Ti though. I think their Ni is just enough to be interesting to us Se doms but it's mellowed out by their Fe, and as a more reserved ESFP I need Fe in my life"
1401,esfp,"I think it comes down to the fact that people are expecting secret motivations or hidden agendas, when for the most part ESFPs are happy just living in the moment and experiencing what life has to offer.
ENFJs especially are always looking for the ""secret meaning"" of people's words actions, so when someone isn't hiding a lot of secret meaning, it can throw us off our game."
1402,esfp,"For me, dominant Se manifests itself as being highly in tune with my enivronment. I'm the first one to answer the phone, respond to other noises, etc. I'm very in touch with my senses - auditory, visual, gustatory. People have often complimented me on my style and food/music preferences. I'd like to think that I can quickly choose the best-looking clothes in any store. On the other hand, I suck at long term planning. "
1403,esfp,"This is nothing new but I felt like answering. I'm very aware of what's around me, even not directly around me. I'm a very practical person. When I'm with people who don't use Se very well, it can get frustrating. People who are disorganized, people who don't see details that from my pov are right in front of them, who are slow to react. When it gets really bad I can lose my patience and get snappy and hurtful if I'm not careful. It rarely gets that bad but I've had issues before when I stayed with the same people for a long time, on a trip for example. Hanging out with other Se users is very relaxing in that respect. My brother is a Se user and when we go from point A to point B together for example, we naturally take the shortest or most efficient route. I think my Se makes me very sensitive to discomfort. Mine or others'. And I'll always actively seek the situation where I feel the most comfortable. And most times I'll do that for people around me too. Small things like moving the peanuts bowl back to the center of the table at a party. Or closing a blind if the light is bothering someone. Or when we're like 10 people on a trip, in a crowded city, I'll be constantly checking that no one is lagging behind. It's noticing stuff like that.
The way things look is very very important to me. My clothes are like an extension of myself so I'll pick them out carefully. If the place where I live doesn't look good to me I'll get depressed, so I'll hang stuff on the walls. I'll put a lot of thought into the furniture and their layout. When I get invited to a flat with blank walls and random furniture thrown around it brings my mood down."
1404,esfp,"The one thing I knew from the start was that I use Fi. I thought for a long time that I used Ne, because I didnt understand what Se was. I thought I was ENFP for a bit, or INFP because I related to Fi more than to Ne. The intuitive bias did play a big part because for a few months I didnt even think of looking further into Se. I did a type me thread on mbti and people said Se user. And after digging a bit I got what Se was I pretty much knew I was a Se dom cause of how present it is in the way I experience things. And I knew I used Fi quite a bit so I knew I was ESFP."
1405,esfp,"Do you have any other ESFP friends?
I think our type is one of, if not the, best types, but honestly it can be hard for me to be around other ESFPs, especially in a group of people and especially if they're my gender. I hate to say it but I feel like I'm competing for attention. Most of my friends end up being introverts or intuitives (who seem more introverted than sensors).
Do other ESFPs feel this way?"
1406,esfp,"I completely agree. I have many ESFP/ ENFP friends and I, too, often feel as though I have to compete for attention.
We just have to remember that everyone is awesome, and we are all fun people to be around. Stylish, too. ;)"
1407,esfp,"Hi guys! 18F Enfj here! 
I'm wondering if you could help me with some insight on an ESFP guy friend of mine! So, here's the situation: 
We met at the beginning of this semester in college and he was actually the one to initiate that we hangout sometime (he did this 2x, actually) after meeting for the first time and chatting a bit. He embodies the ESFP so acutely: He is charming, talented (he taught himself to play the piano and he does so splendidly!), he is adventurous, spontaneous, good at reading people, an intellectual, etc. 
So over a period of 3-5 weeks, we got really close. He was inspired to to take a year off college to do some traveling around the U.S. and ultimately go to France to learn more about the culture/language/people. 
I had my suspicions that he liked me more as a friend, but he has also had some petty high school drama with girls so that's why he hasn't taken much interest in them in college. He actually called me his only girl friend here at college. Here are some other signs I thought he liked me (and please let me know if I'm reading these correctly): 
• He compliments me quite a lot, saying that I'm an influencer and that I'm going to do big things, change the world, I'm a good dancer, have a way with words, good poet, good fashion sense, good at reading people (psychoanalysis is sorta what we do A LOT), etc.
• He says I help him be better and since meeting him, I've seen him mature more as we talk and I express things that may be rude or irritating to others and he takes it to heart and works almost immediately to check himself 
- For ex. He would ask me a question but never let me say, in full, my thoughts. So I expressed to him in a tactful way how that was rude and frustrating and he became very conscience of this since then and let's me say my piece.
• He says he never gives hugs but he knows how much of a hugger I am so he made an exception 
• I was going through some tough times with other friends and I think he tried to console me the best way he could: 
- hearing me out
- giving me the objectivity/sound advice I needed with my emotions being askew
- offering me whiskey (imma whiskey kinda gal, what can I say? 😌) 
- he was actually saving the whiskey for the boys, but gave me another glass because he felt bad and apparently I looked like I needed it
- he talks to me about whatever is on his mind, whether it be the latest idea he has, his family, his upcoming trip to France, etc.
- he seems to trust me enough to want my opinion on things, whether it be on clothes (he actually had me go to the mall with him to pick out a wardrobe) or my thoughts on people
- he actually let me pick out his outfits for the day a couple times
* I could say more, but you get the picture
Anyways, so I tell him how I feel about him in two forms: a long message and a poem (which really showed the hopeless romantic in me) 
I'm quite nervous I might've scared him off because he's been more distant with me (we actually haven't hung out since my confession). We have texted but his are always brief so I match his style when texting back. He basically told me that I was a good poet and that he's not looking for anything right now, which is fair. I just can't help but wonder if he doesn't want to initiate something given his past drama with girls (though he has admitted that I'm a ""smart"" one and mature)? I also wonder if it has something to do with him leaving next month? 
He's just demonstrated in so many ways that I'm unique to him or at the very least, he cares for me. He wishes to just stay good friends but he's the one making it awkward. 
To demonstrate that I'm cool with his decision, I asked to hang out along with some other messages and he replied to all of them (in short, concise messages, of course) but that one. I also made sure to add that I wasn't expecting for us to be a couple or anything with titles. I just wanted to continue on the trajectory of our friendship by doing what we always do: talk, listen to music, go on spontaneous trips/walks. I acknowledged that I wanted to be closer to him, but only of he wanted it too. I told him time and time again that I have no intention of keeping him from setting off on his journey and that I am, indeed, happy and excited for him.
In my poem, I asked him in several ways to please not do what he's doing now: not letting me know what's on his mind or how he truly feels. I feel he's being very objective, kinda cold, but still composed and cool in demeanor like he usually is. Has he caught feels for me and is freaking out about it? Or am I just delusional and overthinking it? 
Any advice is helpful. I know I'm asking a lot. 
TL,DR: I, a female ENFJ, told my good guy friend who is an ESFP that I had feelings for him and now he's being distant. We hung out all the time but now our communication has been reduced to brief concise texts. I'm not making it weird, but he sure is. He said he just wanted to be friends and I respect that, but I cannot help but think he's probably scared. For a guy that's never at a loss for words and gives frequent monologues, he's awfully closed in sharing his thoughts with me on this whole situation. Though he has expressed in many ways that I am a pretty awesome girl, he hasn't told me how he feels about me aside from just wanting to be friends and that he's not looking for anything right now. 

Sorry! That was longer than I anticipated 😅
"
1408,esfp,"""In my poem, I asked him in several ways to please not do what he's doing now""
Well, that's not a decision you can make for him. You cannot implore people to react in a certain way, especially if it goes against his nature. You took your risk, and I respect that, but it was always that - a risk.
I can't tell from the text if he's ESFP or ESTP, but I guess it doesn't really matter. There's not much you can do, other than deal with it. Doesn't even matter, what his motivation to cooling it off is - whether it's because he has feelings for you, but is not ready to get into an LDR if he's going away, or whether it really is that he thinks you're super cool, but he doesn't see you that way is pretty irrelevant in how you deal with things. Why? Because you need to respect his agency in regards to his person and feelings, and his boundaries. Whatever the reason he's feeling uncomfortable now, if you're making him uncomfortable, regardless of whether because of you, or because of his own baggage, it's his prerogative to deal with that accordingly. The best way to 'get him back' is exactly by respecting those, and demonstrating that you are independent, and wait for no man to express himself. You've done your thing, and now you can move on. If he sees your happiness is not dependent on him reacting in any way, he might relax, understand he's not going to hurt himself or you, and hang out again. But it seems you're not there yet. There's not much you can do at this point other than working on how you deal with the situation. That may or may not affect how he reacts."
1409,esfp,"You're welcome ;)
Relationships are hard. People react in weird ways. There's only so much we can do about it, mostly work on how we deal with it.
I'd look at it this way - it was a success. You will never stay up late, staring at the ceiling, wondering what would have been if you only... You can be proud of yourself for having a pair (figuratively speaking), and going for what you want. So many people never work up the courage, and then whine about opportunities never coming their way. They rarely do. We have what we create. And you can be proud of broadcasting yourself out there. The best way to find someone who loves you for who you are is sharing who you are through brave gestures like these. Success is a statistic, and is cumulative. If you put yourself out there so many times (not just romantically), you're bound to have more chance at success. And you learn to process things that don't go exactly as planned better. Hence, from my point of view, it was a success."
1410,esfp,"And I mean that kind of bragging when you're 14 years old and you're like ""OH BOY I WAS AT A PARTY LAST NIGHT AND WE DRANK SO MUCH AND SMOKED SO MUCH WEED AND FUCKED BITCHES AND THIS AND THIS AND THIS HAPPENED"" and you pretty much know it's 100% bullshit.
If so, how do I make them stop? "
1411,esfp,ESFP here! I'll sometimes stretch the truth if I'm trying to tell a joke & im not getting the reaction I want. But I wouldn't straight out lie to someone's face without a base of truth? If that distinction makes sense.
1412,esfp,"I'm an INTP male and dated an ESFP for 2 years. She never lied about things that affected our relationship, but she did lie. About bizarre pointless things that I could obviously easily find out about. 
My straight talking bluntly honest nature tempered it, and we had a great relationship. It ended amicably over irreconcilable differences, but we remain friends and it was the best relationship I've ever had in my life. "
1413,esfp,"I got lucky on that one. I really liked her and would visit the cafe she worked at a lot. We had exchanged small talk and pleasantries many times, she always smiled and seemed happy to see me, I was planning to ask her out. Then she popped up on my tinder feed one night, I swiped right and it was an instamatch. 
That was my green light to make my move, but she still resisted, saying the match was just about friendship. But I kept flirting and pressing and it paid off. "
1414,esfp,"Be straight with them. Maybe say something like ""you said blah blah blah and it was a total lie and it hurts my feelings that you find it ok to lie about even the smallest things, and I won't be able to trust you with the bigger things and if I feel that way others will too""
Two things will happen, he will cut you off or take time to process and be back like a new person (he might lose his temper? Not sure. Male ESFP are a bit different than female ESFPs.)"
1415,esfp,"As we all know, this sub is relatively inactive and quiet compared to the other MBTI subs. Throughout my 2ish years as the occasional spam remover, I've seen that many people would like this sub to be more lively. So I'm putting out a call for anyone interested in becoming a mod. 
Ideally I'd like to have a few people come aboard to contribute in discussion threads, features, CSS, or whatever else you have to offer in order to help grow our community.

1416,esfp,"There's a stereotype that ESFPs are bad with money and are always impulsively spending it. Personally I'm the opposite of that, people have called me stingy before, I never spend it on things I don't need and always save some. How about you?"
1417,esfp,"I have been taught to save from a young age to save, and I don't have big weekly expenses so it isn't an issue much yet. I feel like when I move out, my spending habits will become more apparent. I tend to have periods of time where I spend a lot of money over a few days. I mentally feel like 'I shouldn't be doing thissssss.' But that doesn't stop me."
1418,esfp,"I'm by no means the worlds greatest penny pincher, but I use my poor planning to my advantage and always assume I'll over spend (which I rarely do). Plus with inspiration from The Now, I can always entertain myself and friends on a budget. So. In a way. I guess I am pretty okay with money."
1419,esfp,"I'm not good with saving any, but I have learnt to pay my bills before I do the rest. I spend too much on food and experiences. And whenever I try to build a buffer, there is some unexpected extra expense that has to go, so I never save anyway."
1420,esfp,"I can relate. My friend(who is an ENTJ) always tells me ""don't worry about spending money, worry about work and making more money"" which I mostly agree with, but still prefer finding ways to save instead of working my ass off like him"
1421,esfp,"Hi guys; I've been asked to start a series of type descriptions on another site and I thought you guys might find the one I did for ESFP to be interesting. :) I based my description mostly on my understanding of functions, but tried to make the description as general and broad as possible so that beginners could get a lot out of it as well. Please let me know what you think, what rings true to you and what you would add or change! Thanks guys <3
(also a special note - Intuitive bias is real in the Jungian community.  Being an intuitive myself - I'm ENFJ - I cannot guarantee that every interpretation I have of Sensing is accurate, but I tried my absolute damnedest to describe your Se with as much nuance and love as a I could.  I hope I did you justice.)

ESFP
ESFPs at their best are perceptive individuals who follow their own path.  They are keenly aware of their surroundings and are able to quickly identify and appropriately react to novel stimuli.  They jump on opportunities to participate actively in the world, readily absorbing new experiences and approaching each situation with a receptive attitude.  They do not miss much, either, and will often notice changes or interesting details before others do.  That said, they do not tolerate boredom or tedium well, and will often attempt to find other ways to entertain themselves.  Their primary interest is in seeking out all that life has to offer, and exploring a multitude of adventures in search of mindfulness and self-expression.
ESFPs believe that they will be best able to find harmony in their lives if they stay true to their desires and beliefs and react authentically and honestly to the positions they find themselves in. They will not accept the fact that a particular behavior is ‘good’ or ‘important’ just because others tell them that it is so, but rather, they do what feels right to them in the moment, searching for evidence to justify and verify their natural inclinations. In this way, they can develop a pattern of morality and personal belief that is independent from that of their peer group or society at large.  They are skilled at perceiving and reacting to the true nature of the scenario at hand and not simply doing what is expected of them. It is important, however, for ESFPs to reflect on the objective facts and information they can obtain from society when they make decisions or interpretations, as the way they personally feel about a situation does not always paint the full picture. ESFPs who allow themselves to explore objective data without making personal value judgments too quickly will discover, with pleasure, that doing so refines their ability to accurately interpret present circumstances and allows them to develop a quicker and more authentic reaction to the experiences they undergo.
A young or immature ESFP will not attempt to evaluate the consequences of their actions before they commit to them, and will often find that their efforts did not turn out as they had anticipated.  They also may be skeptical of claims that people, the natural world, or events can be accurately theorized about, interpreted, or predicted.  They will resist attempts to analyze or define themselves, which can leave them vulnerable to the whims of shifting external circumstance.
However, as the ESFP grows and matures, they will begin to find a balance between being immersed in the events of the present moment and developing global theories in order to understand the implications of those events.  They will become more skilled at anticipating the consequences of their actions, making decisions based on not only what is seen and interpreted in the moment, but also taking into consideration that which is unseen and unknown.  They will find themselves becoming more skilled at noticing patterns and developing an intuition about people and occurrences, using all of the present evidence they so keenly perceive to check and verify these hunches, and in doing so will further develop their ability to react appropriately to novel conditions.  That said, ESFPs will always be more flexible and observant than most other types, quick to respond and jump into interesting and exciting ventures, and rarely allowing their beliefs or expectations to cloud their awareness of what is really going on.
Mature ESFPs are often very good at seeing things from other people’s perspectives and sensing how they are feeling or responding to the circumstances at hand, but they often do not find much pleasure or gratification in engaging with this ability unless it’s in service of some larger goal or in order to help someone they care about.  Because they are so focused on drinking in every facet of their present situation, they resist the task of noticing patterns and forming conclusions based on how things have worked out in the past for them.  However, when they are sufficiently motivated, they are very skilled at doing so, and those who allow themselves to practice this skill will discover it to be very useful when they find themselves stuck in a rut or seeking guidance for an important decision.
ESFPs do not enjoy evaluating facts and arguments for internal consistency and are prone to making careless errors in reasoning.  They will often prefer to delegate this task to someone they trust to do it better.  That said, they are capable of doing it - begrudgingly - when no help is available.  ESFPs find it very difficult to conceive of every available outcome, idea, or possibility that could spring from the present moment in time, and cannot help but believe that things “are what they are” and have the internal sense that the world is unlikely to change much.  They also have relatively modest expectations for the results of their decisions and generally do not feel that individual choices are of dire importance.  Although they may, with much determination, be capable of success in leading and directing grand, ambitious projects, it is not where they thrive.  They prefer to explore the world actively and spontaneously, reacting in the moment, doing what seems right, and letting the chips fall where they may.
To summarize, ESFPs are perceptive and genuine individuals who seek to discover as much as they can about the world around them and themselves.  They do so by actively participating in as many experiences as possible and by being true to themselves and their own beliefs.  When they balance these capabilities and desires with an eye on objective facts as well as their internal sense of what seems likely to happen and be meaningful, they can make astounding discoveries and impressions in the world, leading others to open their eyes to a new sensation of awareness and realizations that they had never grasped before."
1422,esfp,"This is awesome! Very in depth. I've also heard we are one of the most generous types which I think has some truth to it, I like spending my time and money on/with other people more than myself. Nice to see a positive description of us that isn't all about being the life of the party which not all of us are."
1423,esfp,"I mean there are loads. Being extra conservative, pessimistic, strictly abiding by all the rules.
As always - look into functions first and foremost and socionics if you feel like you might be an ESFP, but don't really relate to the most common MBTI descriptions"
1424,esfp,Funny story...when my children were much younger we took them to Disney world.  I had been reading forums all about our trip.  Well I got caught up in all the people saying you had to have a schedule to make sure that you did everything...I was the most miserable person that trip.  I was so stressed out when we didn’t meet our schedule.  I swore from then on I would never make another strict schedule for a vacation!  It was so out of character for me to have a schedule that strict that it made my family miserable as well.
1425,esfp,"I'm an introvert, but I've pushed myself and become more ambiverted over the last couple of years. I willingly engage myself in more social activities, because it's not that I don't like to talk to people, I just don't like to talk to people about things that aren't interesting or stimulating (to me). I'm a very deep thinker and I find if I can have really deep, intellectual/philosophical conversations, they actually kind of re-energize me, but if someone wants to tell me about what happened on any given reality TV show the night before, zzzzzzzzzz. That's not to say that all extraverts are shallow, I know this isn't true, I am curious how many extraverts also like deep, stimulating conversation, or if it's more just a sense of connecting/relating to someone, regardless of the subject matter?
Anyways, some weeks, there are events almost every night after work that I would like to go to, but I have a limit, and this can be frustrating especially when say there are 4 events and 2 of them I'm not sure how taxing they will be so I don't want to go, not enjoy it as much as I thought I might, and then be too tired the next night for something I really do want to go to.
I thought to myself the other day ""man, Extraverts must be like the energizer bunny, they can go out every night and have fun and almost never have to worry about their battery running out"".
But I know there's more to it than that. So, what are your limits, what tires you out and do you actually like going out all the time?
Thanks in advance for the insight :)"
1426,esfp,"It's funny that you say having deep stimulating conversations somewhat re-energizes you because that's how I (an extrovert) feel about almost all social interaction. No matter how tired I am I know that once I get out to whatever party/event I'm going too I'll be immediately swept away by the atmosphere and the moment then forget that I'm exhausted. 
So I wish I could offer you a better explanation than just ""I'm extroverted because I like being around people"" but that's basically exactly what it is. 
As far as the deep intellectually stimulating conversations I do really enjoy those, but if I'm gunna be honest, I only like them in very small get togethers. 2 or 3 other people max. If I'm in groups of more than that I would rather be bouncing around to more 'shallow' conversations with everybody so that no one feels left out and I get a better opportunity to build relationships with everyone there. "
1427,esfp,"First of all, I know two INFJs, both are amazing individuals and I cherish every moment with your type.
you seem like a hard introvert which out of the two INFJs I know, one of them is a very very hard I
your type has a predetermined schedule at all times it seems, however you feed off the the emotions of others.. and I love that because when I know you're INFJ, I am only catering toward making things better for you all. 
I have no limits, lack of sleep tires me, I will constantly be involved in any social activity and I will be extremely talkative and engaged with the group, it's hard to explain why but I just absolutely love it. 
as an INFJ I know this is so confusing to you, but I highly respect your type, your work ethic, and the way that you treat people. As an F male, both INFJs I know are also males. I love meeting other F males because they see most things on the same level as I do, and that is very admirable for us males who are generally T dominating types.  "
1428,esfp,"That's it: you just forget, you don't really rest or re-energize. There is no magic bullet that OP is looking for: if you go out every night you'll forget you're tired until something nasty gets you sick and you can't pretend anymore. In the past a simple flu could kill you. It's easy to get used to living exhausted but there's no good in it. "
1429,esfp,"For myself, yes. Sometimes, it's a rough start, but tends to go real smooth soon enough. They need a little hand-holding initially when it comes to physical stuff, but I'm cool with that, that's where I'm confident, and they offer the same hand-holding intellectually, so good growth both ways. 10 stars. Would recommend"
1430,esfp,"It's usually ESFJs and ISFJs who line INTPs since they share their preference for Ti and Fe, while ESFPs are matched to NTJs since they also value Fi. Makes things run a whole lot easier and smoother in relationships when you value the same Feeling function i.e. either both value Fe like ESFJ and INTP, or both value Fi like ESFP and INTJ."
1431,esfp,"I’ve been with two INTJ’s in the past. I don’t know why, but I seem to be naturally attracted to INTJ’s. I’ve had minor crushes on a few as well, even before finding out that their type was that. So it was never a “Hey, you are an INTJ, I like you now”-kind of situation.
However, been with an ISTJ for 3 years now and he is great!"
1432,esfp,"I'm really attracted to ENTP's too, but they're alway too cool and ahead of me and aren't emotionally there. Just last night got the rudest 180 turn around and rejection from a gal, but she was more concerned with my zodiac sign 🙄🙄"
1433,esfp,Sucks that you got rudely rejected... worst feeling ugh :( I feel like the rude ones are easier to get over though cause then you realize they weren't all that great in the first place... That last part is kinda funny to me cause every ENTP I know is interested in some kind of psuedo-psychology!
1434,esfp,"Well, I feel like ENFP men are usually too volatile and their affection is so fleeting. Sure, they are incredibly charming when they want to be but they get bored really fast. When contrasted with their sensor cousins aka ESFPs, I feel like for ENFPs charm is a vital part of their nature whereas for us, ESFPs, it comes in bouts, when we feel really deeply for the person. 
I might also be biased because I just got out of a rltshp with a commitmentphobic ENFP. Still love him though, not going to lie lol but I wanted something more serious so we weren’t on the same page."
1435,esfp,Omg I know who to avoid 😂 I feel like I'm the odd one out as a very athiest ESFP but I have trauma in the church which helps makes me very anti religion/superstition. My other ENTP crush was pretty into demons and shit now that I think about it..
1436,esfp,"I usually hit it off well with INFPs in a kindred spirit kind of way and we oftentimes communicate in similar methods. While I like them, most of the INFPs I know make dangerously poor choices because they believe that their idealized world is the real world and the consequences they'll suffer are their idealized ones, not the true consequences. I find them to be great friends, but without personal growth they tend to be a bit of sweet trainwreck."
1437,esfp,"Judging from the MBTI descriptions you sound pretty similar to us, optimism and creativity are definitely some traits I can see ESFP's gravitating to. According to socionics us and you guys are often friends in real life, although our core values and the careers we choose are mostly different and INFP/ESFP couples are rare."
1438,esfp,"I love INFPs! I've had one as a partner for 13 years, so there must be something that works between our types :)
I find that you're generally very caring, kind, silly, sweet and full of dreams. I think we complement each other well, and act as a good balance to each others flaws. Make a good friend out of an INFP and you'll both grow as people!"
1439,esfp,"I have an agreement with my ESFP partner to ask him for help when making decisions, especially if I'm feeling emotional. I appreciate his guidance and wisdom. :) There are times I definitely need it.
I love his understanding of the world, how he can hold my hand when my sight becomes augmented by imagination and colours of insight cloud the details in front of me.
I love being loved by him even though I am a trainwreck, and gradually I become less so with his influence and care. I also love how he finds humour in my clumsiness and failure to logic. It's nice to be loved and helped even when I fail, and still smiled at with big smiles. :) I love my ESFP."
1440,esfp,"I am married to a ESFP wife who is a school instructional assistant and is afraid of KPI after spending a while and having bad experiences in call centers I’m trying to assist her in finding a great fit she currently loves her job kind of they let her create things and help the kids but force some responsibility on her and she’s finding it boring and her coworkers not very social. I was thinking she might like account management or social based selling based on what I’ve read about her type maybe even social media marketing.
Anyone have any advice or maybe jobs you are in love with that I can give her ideas?
Side note:  any tips to help us communicate and get along and for me to make her happy and help her understand my need for so much space and doing whatever I want when I need to and my frustration when I’m working on something and interrupted.
Thanks for the help"
1441,esfp,"Well, I'm an ESFP in a relationship with an INFJ, and he doesn't like being interrupted when he's working on something (though, sometimes, I don't either). We've basically established that it's okay if one of us wants to approach the other with something, but that we need to respect it if the other of us says ""I'm a little busy right now, can we talk about this later?"". I think it's possible to say you're busy in a tone that is still warm and reassuring (my guess is you might struggle with that more than her?). If you get interrupted when you're busy, try to set aside your annoyance and reassure her that you'll have time to talk later (even give her a time frame if you can).
As for the work thing, your wife's annoyances sound like things I'd struggle with, too. I work as a photographer and I love it - creating things and being my own boss. Something social media related might be good, but ask her about it (I know that I'd dislike a social media job because I find social media really inauthentic a lot of the time). If she's big on working with kids, she might care about authenticity, too. That sounds like a job that's meaningful to her. Maybe she just needs a similar job with more sociable coworkers?"
1442,esfp,"Thanks for the tips and suggestions I’ve noticed this sub reddit isn’t very active for deep ambiguous questions like this but is quite active for shallow questions it’s a hilarious example of personality type difference as opposed to The ISTP subreddit. 
I’m also working on understanding what seems to me to be her self centered nature which from reading in the personality comes with the territory though her willingness to occasionally manipulate people for her ends or care only about herself to hell with the consequences is interesting, concerning and frustrating all at the same time."
1443,esfp,"Hah, well the reality is that ESFP types (and E/F types in general) won't usually spend a lot of time online - they'll probably prefer face-to-face interaction because online interaction can feel very impersonal (I mean, Online Disinhibition Effect is a studied phenomenon). I'm probably an exception because I do a lot of photo editing and sometimes online interaction is the best I can get, ha. Plus, I studied psych for a while and I find human interaction really interesting. 
I don't think it's fair to say being self centred or occasionally manipulative comes with the territory of an ESFP - from what I remember, the types that are more prone to conscious manipulation are the N/T/J types, since they tend to be less empathic and focused on trying to change some aspect of the world to suit themselves. All types can be selfish or manipulative, but it manifests in different ways. ESFPs often have an almost childlike enthusiasm and curiosity for things, but I and most other ESFPs I know can become a bit petulant if we're stuck in a situation we're not happy with. I doubt your wife is consciously trying to manipulate you, but she might not yet have well-developed skills in managing conflict. It sounds like that could be an area for both of you to grow in, but then being in a long-term relationship is a great opportunity for that! 
Ultimately, it sounds like she needs to work on accepting your need for space, but I'm sure you've got room to grow, too. Focus on being gentle and loving in your communication with her (common weak points for I/T types) and try to remember that her responses are probably more rooted in impulse than premeditation."
1444,esfp,"Be able to carry a conversation. The last handful of dates/guys I've hung out with have been SO. BORING. I don't want to be the person putting all the effort in with starting a conversation. Or starting a topic, saying one sentence about that topic, then moving to another unrelated topic. Is being able to hold a conversation really that f'in difficult these days??? Dating is abysmal."
1445,esfp,"These questions probably has nothing to do with the type. But I still want to ask. 
Do you often feel insecure? Are you instantly compare yourself with other, quietly? Do you get jealous easily?
What kind of people do you hate the most and love the most?
I've learned about all good things about ESFP, those questions bother me but I just have the courage to ask"
1446,esfp,"Sup.
I mostly feel insecure during idle times with people I don't know well. I feel most confident with new people when playing a game, working, going somewhere, making plans, dancing, etc. Small talk that leads nowhere can be really painful for me. I'm perfectly fine just talking when it's with my friends but even then I'd probably rather do something with them. About this insecurity, I think it comes from empathy, I am very sensitive to the atmosphere, who's feeling good, who's feeling bad, who's uncomfortable. Some of my friends say I'm making things up and situations aren't as bad as I make them out to be. It's definitely something I'm working on.
And then there's something that comes from my upbringing I'd say, and that's the general feeling that I'm not good enough. It makes me insecure in my friendships, my work, my relationships. It's also something I'm working on and have been working on for a while haha
​
I compare myself to others almost constantly. It's not something I talk about, it's just a general attitude I have. I very much value myself in comparison to others. It's also something I'm working on, it can be unhealthy in some ways.
​
I can get possessive yes. I don't often act on it (as in make a scene, or tell the person directly), but I tend to want to be part of everything a girl I like is doing, and if I'm not I'm gonna feel frustrated and will have to vent to someone hehe. But, I'm working on it. There's lots to work on.
​
I don't hate anyone, but I try to stay away from people who talk as if they already have all the answers. People who will voice their opinion in a matter of fact way, in a way that doesn't raise any questions. I also avoid people who are scared to be put in a situation where they'd be vulnerable, so they plan everything out and don't try unusual things. They're not fun to hang out with at all. In my experience if someone fits the first category, they often fit the second one too.
I also can't stand cynical people, or overly pessimistic people. Altho if cynical people make my skin crawl and I can have murderous intent towards them, overly pessimistic people just bore me. Especially if they're pessimistic and self indulgent at the same time. Ew.
I've met people who were all of these things at the same time and they were terribly unpleasant and boring.
​
In general I love people who are thoughtful, who are ready to question everything including themselves but at the same time like to go with the flow and don't let this questioning weigh them down."
1447,esfp,"I agree, I don't think it's type related, but I don't mind answering.
​
I can come across as very confident, and I don't let fear stop me often, but yes, there are things I am insecure about. I am aware of my imperfections, possibly much more than others, and it can be quite harrowing. I don't feel the prettiest, smartest, most desirable, and to some people, I would want to be. I don't instantly compare myself to others, as I don't view the world in terms of comparisons, but yes, if someone does what I am interested in and passionate about, I am competitive, and if I can't level, I do feel envy. Though, never the sabotaging kind. If I like the person, or if I see the effort that they've put in, I'm proud of them, or happy for them.
Whom I like and don't is hard to determine by qualities. I like people who are blunt, direct, and action-oriented, but with understanding of people's agency and feelings. People I don't typically like are those that force you to debate when you don't want to, are disrespectful of personal boundaries."
1448,esfp,"(Thank you for having the courage to ask! I really appreciate it!l)
This is my opinion. People always say (most) ESFPs are always confident in anything and I do agree with it but sometimes, insecurity could also control me from doing anything. Most ESFPs also talk immediately without thinking, which could hurt or offend someone, but trust me, we never have an intention to hurt people. This is what makes me feel always insecure, thinking if what I said or did might hurt somebody but that's seriously not what I want. Everytime a teacher wants my help, I helped them with quiet/shy mode and this is what made them say that I'm a quiet person when in fact, I'm not. I just don't want to feel insecure or hurt them with my tongue so I kept quiet. I always feel the urge to reply them with a (nice) joke but I know silence is better.
About comparing, I always compare myself with my other friends. They always do their works on time while me? always do it last minute. Most of them are also mature with age, I wanna be like them too! Once my friend commented that I'm actually a mature person but I don't always show it (she really knows me well). But after thinking negatively, my positive mind comes. This is what I like about myself. I always and always try to be positive bc I believe everything has it's own goods and bads and trust God will plan it all perfectly. It's always worth-it to try than to not take chance!
Speaking of jealousy, I don't think I get jealous easily. Plus, when I do get jealous, I'm a pro in hiding it lol. Even my friend said that I'm good at faking it. For example, a few days ago, my friends were playing PUBG with a random team and it turned out a player from the other team was my crush. Then, my friend told me about it and I got jealousy controlling me. I was in denial. I asked my friend ""What is this I'm feeling?! Is this jealousy?!?!"". I was so jealous that I immediately slept afterwards.
I hate the most? hmmm I don't think I hate anyone but I do hate someone with these kind of personality:

when I give an advice, they don't listen/take it seriously.
jokes about something I hate and they know it.
rebel (most ESFPs don't like rules nor borderlines, same goes to me but I believe rules have functions to discipline us, probably to make us a good person so rules stay rules. I could rebel too but not too often)
there's probably more but I can't think any of it bc I love people aka friendships.

I love the most?

first, reserved people lol.
funny af person.
confident infront of public (I could die from anxiety and insecurity if it's me).
laugh at my jokes, get my jokes, join in my craziness.
who knows where to take it seriously and when to not.

Sorry for the long reply :') but anyways, all these are my opinions and other ESFPs might have a different perspective so there you go!"
1449,esfp,"Sure I have insecurities, but I'm so easily distracted that I almost never think about them unless I'm alone for longer periods of time.  
I hate people who are intentionally rude
It's harder for me to like people who are extremely insecure and keep bringing it up
I don't like people who think they're better than everyone else or superior without really getting to know the people they're comparing themselves to
I really like people who are confident in themselves and act like themselves without holding back because that's the kind of person I would like to be someday (I've only just gotten over my social anxiety)
I like people who are optimistic and bubbly
People who make a lot of facial expressions and laugh a lot
Those who are down to do anything with me"
1450,esfp,"I'm going to break this down by each question.


Feel insecure? Very rarely. I am pretty confident in most things!


Comparing myself? On the physical/ physique level, yes. I usually find that I'm better than the average dude, but only better than 50/50 when I'm in the gym. Probably because the gym-goers are already better than the population in general. This doesn't have much to do with being ESFP, imo. For me it's about looking like a muscular, strong guy. And it's not a negative thing - I appreciate seeing beautiful buff men that I can aspire to be.


Jealous? It's severely difficult for me to get jealous. I have it better than most people in general, and my life satisfaction is subjectively higher than most people I meet. I don't really have anything to be jealous about.


I like most people! Eternal pessimists are difficult to be around, because I just want everyone to be happy, or at least content.

"
1451,esfp,"No
Never
Not easily, but other people's success can sometimes make me angry about not achieving more myself, which motivates me to do more
I hate people who are weak, petty and traditional, love people who are analytical, original and strong"
1452,esfp,"
I am extremely insecure. I think this comes because I constantly want to seek approval from others and because of that, I feel insecure about what I am doing/saying. 
I compare myself to others often. I want to be the best.. even though I am not and there are others that are far superior to me. 
Jealous easily? EXTREMELY. It is painful how easily jealous I get. I hate it. 
People I hate the most? Rude people. Obnoxious people. Know-it-alls. 
People I love the most? Genuine people. I can immediately tell if someone is being genuine/real with me versus if they are just trying to BS me. I like people that are naturally loving, kind, sweet, relaxed or funny. If they have ALL of those.. woah.. amazing.  But, I have yet to really find that. 

​
I love answering questions. :D"
1453,esfp,"No
I disagree with most of the things here. Granted I'm older than you(since you talk about crushes and school), but still even when I think about my 14 year old self I wouldn't say any of these things"
1454,esfp,"Thanks!
I'm legit ESFP, not just 16personalities tested, but function-stack and all. That should help ;) But I do have variation against many, because I'm E6, not E7 (which is more common for ESFPs), so I'll be more aloof ans scathing.
Underneath the entertainer, ESFPs are quite serious people."
1455,esfp,"I relate to 8 a lot, but I'm not an 8.
I propose you look at counter-phobic 6 as well. They appear very 8-like. And it's common both for Se-dominant 6s to be counter-phobic, and for 6s with a 7 wing more so than 6w5, and more common for Sx 6s. It doesn't have a good rap, but there are many good things about it. And it comes across very different than phobic 6.

When I'm alone my head feels like its about to freaking burst sometimes and i get so depressed. im desperate to become the fun, outgoing and social person I once was, and my fear is just growing as nothing ever works.(ive had a shot at writing diaries, 1 month of therapy, Ritalin(ADHD medicine, going on vacations, doing old hobbies, exercising, nofap, lol this isn't even something id normally do, im just desperate to get well again)
I miss my old view on life, not overthinking every little thing and becoming angry, being able to perform presentations in school, being able to sort my thoughts into words the way I used to. I know I sound really whiney but really I've been in this pit of working hard for two years now without getting a single step further! everything feels so wrong and i used to view the world as an art, or something beautiful, a gift. i used to have fun and not give a fuck, really. now i just worry, and seek help. and I'm wasting my life as an 18 year old. im useless nowadays and my close friends say I'm stupid as hell.
the only thing keeping me alive is my computer. i use it to escape and catch myself analysing people I admire so I can share the fun they have and be like them. i do this even though it is so unlike me, im just desperate and want to fake to be someone else while I'm this weak of a person. it makes me sad not to be able to go out and be the man i used to be and it makes me self conscious as heck."
1457,esfp,"Get your hormones checked before taking the step to get an antidepressant! You could have hypothyroidism (make sure to get a doc that really knows about this, preferably someone who lists bioidentical hormone replacement therapy as their specialty- most docs don’t really know much about the thyroid and only put you on t4 once you’re way too far gone) or hypogonadism (low testosterone- this is happening in younger and younger men). Get vitamin d, b12, and folate checked because all of those could play a role as well! "

1461,esfp,"Sounds like a rough patch. Don't worry, it does get better, but will require effort on your behalf. I've been there. It really really sucks. Also have ADHD. I also suffer bouts of clinical depression, and occasional anxiety and panic attacks. At 18, you probably don't have enough of these cycles behind you to discover a trend, so I will share mine.
So, partly, I get depressed because it's in my nature, but winter makes it worse. Other than that, it's usually accompanied by lack of resources and time, so instead of going out there, discovering the world and experiencing it, I get stuck in my head too much, which makes me spiral. That also exacerbates the other issues.
Definitely see a specialist if you can. Talk about going on antidepressants for a couple months, to see if it helps. It doesn't mean you have to be on them for the rest of your life, but they do help you get out of the emotional whirlwind, take a step back, and look at your life with a more constructive and problem-solving mindset. Then, when your situation changes, and if your doc approves, you can get off them.
​
Outside of therapy and medication, these are things that help me:
GET OUT OF THE HOUSE! Work out. Do sports. I mean it. Get yourself sweaty at least 3-5x a week. It helps regulate hormones that affect your mood and cognition. When I don't work out, my ADHD becomes so unmanageable that I want to shoot myself in the head, and my depression and anxiety get so much worse. Go running, go to the gym, do HIIT at home, go swimming, or take up a team sport that you can do. Anything you can get your hands on. I mean it. This is the single most important thing in my life that helps me stay sane.
Do you have an INTJ or ENTJ friend? Talk to them? They are good with problem-solving on a level you need. They won't get submerged into your emotional problems, and won't react with sympathy, but with solutions. Get someone who can give you tough love.
Find something you can do, even with limited resources, that gives you a sense of purpose, or value, on a smaller scale. Not in a strategic time frame, but with almost immediate results. Do you have a creative streak? Sing. Play the guitar. Draw. Paint. Take up a drama class. Do standup. Whatever. Are you competitive instead? Do things that will get you immediate acknowledgment."
1462,esfp,"Also, have you tried different ADHD medication, other than Ritalin? I have it, but haven't used it in almost 4 years, except for exceptions. And had to come back to it, because my ADHD has been acting up. One of the major side effects of Ritalin are anxiety and panic attacks. I've never tried Adderall, it's not FDA approved in my country, but has your doctor tried to switch you to something else?"
1463,esfp,"I also haven't touched Ritalin since about 4 years ago, I've never tried any other drug, but I'm hoping for something that doesn't give me that level of anxiety. Adderall isn't FDA approved here either but I'm working up the courage to ask my doctor if he has any suggestions, whether it's anti depressants or to restart my ritalin usage, with a lower dosage than before. I am sort of taking one step back and two steps forward right now. At the time I'm just reading The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, while going to the gym every other day, hoping I can be happy on my own like I used to:)
P.S. i really appreciate you(and everyone else who commented) for taking your time to help me out, im sorta at desperate times nowadays, and the strict school system in Norway isn't helping either;_;"
1464,esfp,"Yeah, school can be extremely challenging if you have ADHD, and more so, if you're Se-dominant and ADHD. Kinesthetic learners struggle at school even though they're no less intelligent. I would know a fair share of that. I've just gone into my old supply of Ritalin because I'm struggling with the overload of work and lack of motivation to keep hustling, because no matter how much I do, there's something I won't do, and then I still get in trouble. Things I've figured out a little to help reduce the side effects of Ritalin - get enough sleep. Have no more than one coffee first thing in the morning. Keep hydrated. Seriously, drink a lot of water. And I have the breakfast pill with a light breakfast at least. It takes longer to hit, but it also doesn't come with a wham! sensation. But proper sleep, nutrition, and regular sport will get you where you need to be, eventually ;)
What you're doing to help yourself will eventually reap benefits. Just keep at it and don't give up. Definitely, speak to your doctor. Mine replaced Ritalin with Strattera. Strattera isn't a stimulant, it works on a similar principle as antidepressants, and you need to eat it regularly, not 'when you need it'. However, in Czechia, the distribution is really fucked up, and I got on it, and then had to get off it and restart, which was a nuisance. You're not supposed to have withdrawal from Strattera, but I've had it. It also has some side effects, some annoying, but anxiety wasn't one of it. Because of the poor distribution I went off it, and haven't been medicated for two years. But circumstances may force me to get a Ritalin refill. Mine is expired, and that's probably not good."
1465,esfp,"How would you describe it when you as an ESFP are in the Ni grip? What does that look like for you?
I found a video online about the ESFP's Ni grip. Is this legitimate?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCPaKL_1k3E&t=88s "
1466,esfp,"I tend towards these moods once in a blue moon, but eventually realize it's like a circle-jerk of negativity and quit it. It might help I'm counter-phobic 6 though - if I worry about something, or am scared of it, I'll do it to prove to myself that it should hold no power over me."
1467,esfp,"I know what you mean. I've realized that once you're in that mood your mind can find ways to rationalize those fears, so you just have to recognize when you're starting to feel that way and cancel out these negative thoughts, don't fight them, just don't let them have any control over you"
1468,esfp,"I've received some good advice on fear:
Let it in. Acknowledge it. Don't judge it though, and don't let it limit you.
It's much easier to live with fear than people imagine. I don't find it limiting. I find it a motivation to problem-solve and overcome. It can be tough sometimes, but it's also exhilarating when I do get past it successfully, and like riding a high."
1469,esfp,"I posted a similar question to my own subreddit a while ago and received a somewhat common response that due to functions switching, drunk INTJ’s act like ESFP’s. 
So that line of thinking (and curiosity) leads me here. 
How do you behave when you’ve had a few drinks?"
1470,esfp,"Depends how drunk. When reasonably drunk I become more affable, and quite good at being « fake », something I’m really bad at sober. So I hop from convo to convo telling people what they want to hear, which sometimes involves really big lies like being a professional snowboarder or having lived 10 years in Cambodia. They’re not lies I regret afterwards, they’re mostly really fun and the people get really excited listening to me. When I’m very drunk it exacerbates my egocentrism, which makes me even more compulsive, and I lose sight almost completely of others’ feelings. I can be provocative and manipulative. Not in a mean way tho."
1471,esfp,"very inappropriate dancing, cuddling with people, crying pretty easily. talking to strangers becomes super easy. also acting out of character i guess, like kissing a random (1x when i was suuuper drunk). otherwise i guess just like a normal party person having fun :--) i dont tend to think much drinking or not so its all just tumbleweeds in my head"
1472,esfp,"Hey, Mokingbirdzz, just a quick heads-up:

1473,esfp,"Im curious if anyone on here had taken the 5 love languages test, or read the book. I think maybe their might be a link between the Myers Briggs test and love languages. Mine are as follows. Quality time, physical touch, acts of service, words of affirmation, gifts. Do you guys match up or am i way off?"
1474,esfp,"I am an INTP married to an ESFP. My first love language is gifts. But it's not so much the materialistic gifts as it is the thought behind it. It could be a note left on the counter in the mornings, something like that. I like knowing that he thinks of me when we're apart. So, I love the idea of him being in a store and thinking, ""Oh, this totally looks like INTP!"" But he's like you all, he has no idea how to react to gifts. His top two are physical touch and words of affirmation. "
1475,esfp,"This is true, but if you've never experienced truly giving a great gift to someone, it's something worth pursuing. 
Great as in ""I didn't know I needed this until you gave it to me, and now I can't live without it.""
The idea behind gifts is the physical manifestation of adding to someone else's life."
1476,esfp,"Oh cool! That sounds reasonable, more thoughtful than expensive. Im the worst at giving gifts. I would rather get cash, and give cash. Its poor edict i know. But i hate the thought of someone hating the gift i got them."
1477,esfp,For me I don't think it would work. I don't see the value of gifts on a regular basis. It seems like an obligation if I don't share that passion. Also im fairly frugal so I would rather spend time then money. I picnic beats fancy resturant every time.
1478,esfp,"I totally get it, honestly... I personally can appreciate a gift that's truly thoughtful, although I don't want to receive them on a regular basis, even if that was the case. I have a few reasons for that, really... 
They make me feel a little guilty for receiving them, and like I have to give them one in return. Additionally, I don't like when people spend too much money on me... sometimes, it even makes me feel like they'll hold it over my head later on for something in return. Or, it makes me feel like they're trying to get out of something, so they give me a gift to ""soften the blow"" of whatever it is that they did..."
1479,esfp,"Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.
I will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.

Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two."
1480,esfp,"Hi guys. ENTP here and was wondering if you could give me a hand at understanding my ESFP mother a bit better.
I am currently studying for exams and am INCREDIBLY busy. I am going to school, studying, eating and sleeping. That is all i do and have done for the past month. Other than the occasional outing with friends to break the cycle. It needs to be done and there is no getting around it. 
My mother does not approve. She is complaining that i don't give her any attention and that she feels i only spend time with my friends and give her no time. So i decide that i was going to meet my friends on saturday night and i will blow them off and go see mum. All is fine until saturday afternoon when she calls me and says she can't do tonight but she can do tomorrow (sunday). No problem. I will study tonight and see her tomorrow. Skip forward to sunday evening and i go round to her house. She is very happy to see me and i am too. Its not like she gets lonely she has lots of friends but i could tell she was looking forward to seeing me. I was too to a certain extent.
We sit down for the dinner she had made and i thought it was nice and then she says this. ""so how is it so easy for you to just take the night off when it suits you, thats two nights you have had off in a row and you don't come and see me for a whole month?"". I begin to explain that i had not taken last night off. She does not believe me. I say that if she wants me to come over more often maybe she should stop throwing accusations at me which are not true. Blah blah blah. She loses her shit.
Starts saying that she feels like I don't even love her. That I don't come over nearly enough and that she is missing her boy. I then explain again that i can't i am studying. She gets herself in even more of a nose dive and then says that my sister sees her nearly everyday and that i should try and be more like her. I tell her that my sister is not in law school but doing a hair and beauty course that does not have even close to the same level of work. Once again she says i am just making up excuses. 
I don't know what to do. I can't make the journey to see my mum even if it is just for a quick visit as it is a 20 min train journey and i don't have a car. I don't have enough time at the moment to see her and she refuses to accept that i am trying my best. She keeps comparing me to my sister who is not going to be the one i can guarantee who will be paying for her care home when she is too old to live on her own. Fucking hell it's just pissing me off."
1481,esfp,"I don't know if this is an esfp thing, it just sounds like really childish behavior. Would a skype or phone call that happens once a week not suffice? Or maybe after finals are over and yoi have an entire summer off? You should remind her that you have a life outside of her by now. If she flips put over that you'll know there's a bigger issue."
1482,esfp,"Hey y'all. I am an ENTP and my dad is an ESFP. We used to be pretty close in the past, but our relationship has became more distant over the past years. Do you guys, as ESFPs, have any tips on how we can get along better? 
Most of the problems we have consists of either my dad complaining about myself being too emotionally distant, even though I consistently make an effort to spend time with him. Another issue we have is when we start an argument after I tell him about some ideas I had. I tend to enjoy debating ideas, but he always leaves the conversation looking very nervous/drained."
1483,esfp,"My ENTP friend and I have gotten into arguments too. There is really no debating with an ESFP, either they don't care because they don't have a position on the subject or they do care and it gets personal. I'd say stay away from arguing, debating is not really our strong suit"
1484,esfp,"Hes probably referring to your decisions being more logically based rather than emotionally based. Not everyone likes to debate, he probably has that nervous/drained look because your logical responses conflict with his emotional responses or feelings. Which would tie back to him calling you emotionally detached. Instead of debating or arguing try to listen and understand. or Just listen/act like you are listening. Just some guesses based off what you gave. I'm an ISTP btw. "
1485,esfp,I do like them a lot. But I can't spend to much time with them. They're idealism becomes overwhelming. I try not to be so straight forward and filter myself. Because I tend to hurt their feeling. And usually it's a miscommunication. The ones I know... Are extremely messy and don't have the best hygiene. I have super sensitive sense of smell... I guess I can't really say all infps are that way.. I just don't know many
1486,esfp,"I just got out of a 2 year relationship with an INFP. In the beginning they will make you feel like king of the world and you will meet their idealistic sense of who you should be. However down the road ESFPs are Carpe Diem, where as INFPs prefer to live in the past or the prospective. It's like living in two different worlds. You will want to go ride a Ferris wheel and they will want to stop and stare at the sky and talk about how if it rained more in Africa, less people would starve to death. Either you will shut her down and she will feel minimized, or she will shut you down and you will feel trapped and restless. Wouldn't recommend."
1487,esfp,"Also, to answer, they (infps) can be kinda hurtful in how they'll totally pull away to recharge or whatever. I find that really annoying. When someone doesn't acknowledge me for days, I assume it's cause they are bored and have moved on.  They'll pull that crap and place the impetus on you to reconnect with them. "
1488,esfp,one of my best friends is an INFP. he actually introduced me to the MBTI. We lived together for two years in college (3 years ago). Him and I were able to feed off of each others desires to stay in for the night or go out and party. we are perfect wingmans for each other and he would become much of an ENFP when we went out wherein I would become much of a ISFP when we would stay in watching anime or playing zelda. 
1489,esfp,"Hard. I have a few INFP friends and we just don't mesh. One goes thru phases where he'll call me in the middle of the night for like a few weeks or so and just Ne all over the phone about stuff I don't care about. Another one is super depressive and drains my energy. Another one I only see on facebook and posts all manner of clinicla depression-related stuff. I deleted facebook so that's not a problem anymore. And another one who might be ENFP but claims INFP, well she's just psycho. So."
1490,esfp,"ESFP. I thought about this a lot and I am not intuitive. Nope. I am much more a sensor. After the differences that I saw from http://www.sociotype.com/tools/type-comparison/SEE-IEE
some of the points definitely made me agree with ESFP"
1491,esfp,"with infps, it's more like your presence-though very stimulating-taxes them. think of coffee, after a cup or two the world is a better place but after 20 shots your brain is fried; you're the coffee to an INFP."
1492,esfp,"I'm a 25F ESFP and I'm clingy af. I hate this trait about myself and I wish I could care less. When I hit it off with a person they infiltrate my mind and I want to spend all my time with them. Unfortunately it seems the other person rarely feels the same, or perhaps I'm scaring them away. I think I am constantly so desperate for attention when I receive it from the opposite sex a switch turns on in my brain and I think they're interested and I just want to snapchat them all day and talk to them all day and wonder why they want to do things with other people????
Crazy I know. Any advice how to break this crappy trait of mine? How do I care less and think of other things besides someone who will probably ghost me in a couple days?"
1493,esfp,"To echo delrey, I think a lot of this comes from a lack of confidence in yourself and your own value. You cling to other people like life rafts because the scraps of validation they give you make you feel good about yourself. And unfortunately this kind of desperate clinginess scares people off because when it's bad it's invasive and toxic to them. 
You should spend these next few years figuring yourself out as an independent person. Form opinions, find hobbies, think about what you value and don't value, your strengths and weaknesses. Be happy being yourself and you won't need to keep people around to only feel okay. You'll  keep people around because you choose to- because they complement your life and personality, not fill in for it.   "
1494,esfp,"It literally says all over the internet he’s esfp. What is even enfp about him? Not sure you know what enfp is.
Edit: He has angry ESFP tantrums. He is a very social person always getting people to like him. Hes always trying to understand the deeper feelings and meanings of people’s stories around him. He’s like one of the biggest ESFP out there."
1495,esfp,"Love the selection there, especially Underground Charisma. As an INTJ perpetually interested in all things ESPF, let me ask: what exactly classifies as ESFP music, in your opinion? Would you consider the currently very popular EDM genre ESFP music?"
1496,esfp,"This seems more entp/enfp/entj rather than esfp.
Entp looking on and bathing in the crowd's attention or Enfp singing and affecting the audience with feels. Entj raising arms as if acting as, ""Right? Agree with me!"" while leading a motivational speech or business panel.
Esfp wouldn't be positioned so stiffly and should bend towards the mic rather than the audience, if singing. This is because Esfps are more sensing oriented and tend to be more focus on the action rather than the reactions.
If talking casually the structure should be more expressive and causally laidback and arms more widespread, body lending backwards.
tl;dr My feedback is that the model isn't passionate enough and the only thing that really makes it esfp is the microphone. "
1497,esfp,"Interesting reply, however not caring what you look like, doesn't make it look anymore like you. 
Not caring what you're made out to be doesn't make it accurate.
Regardless of how YOU feel about, it doesn't change how it is. "
1498,esfp,"So you're saying I'm right. Unfortunately I thought your thoughts were wrong, because I am indeed esfp. 
I commented my response for feedback because I don't like misconceptions about any theories as well as hoped they would improve on observations vs input for the overall quality of the product. 
Yes, I do care about how we appear because this is simply a sculpture with a microphone, and just slapping a microphone on a person does not make them esfp.
I wasn't complaining about how unlike me the sculpture was, I was trying to perhaps contribute to the future of next generation models. So that when an esfp looks at it, they can say, ""OH SHIT THATS SO ME"", instead of, ""Oh I guess this took effort so it's cool I guess. "
1499,esfp,"Idk how or why but they come very easy to me. 
I know English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Italian, Greek, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Swedish, Norwegian, and Afrikaans. 
Idk all of them fluently, but I can get by in most of them and have a general conversation. "
1500,esfp,"According to socionics, INTJ/ESFP is the perfect cognitive match, known as ""duality"". I wish to test this theory by chatting with an ESFP. The biggest problem with dual relationships is that they're difficult to start. Message me or reply to this thread if you're an ESFP and you'd like to chat. Thanks!"
1501,esfp,"According to socionics, they are a perfect cognitive match. Meaning they cover one another's weaknesses, and provide one another with the information elements that they value but can't produce themselves. So in theory, it should be good for both intimacy and friendship."
1502,esfp,"I'm an INFP and last year I feel deeply in love with an ESFP and I haven't stopped loving him since. In the beginning I took an instant liking to him, which is unusual for me as it takes me a while to warm up to people. But with him I realised he was something quite special and I didn't want to let him go.
It was at first quite difficult because I'd never felt this way about someone before and I kept pestering him to see him again and I got really obsessed and I would just end up sending him huge texts about my feelings. It just pushed him further away and so I stopped trying to force things to happen and left him alone. 
Then half a year later, the opportunity came up for me to meet him again. I decided to change my attitude and try doing things his way, namely, not thinking too much about what things meant and just enjoying the moment. And it worked so well, we became so close to eachother. We worked well together, we would help eachother with our work and we kind of complemented eachother. It was so beautiful and I know that he thought it was too, which felt like quite an accomplishment for me because he always has this strong facade and it felt like an honour to find the sensitive part that was underneath. When he told me I was beautiful it was such a proud moment. Often several weeks would go by between us meeting oneanother but each time we met we would become closer than ever. We were even going to go on a trip to Berlin together.
Then it changed suddenly when I told him something that I didn't realise he would get upset about. I won't go into detail about it because I feel guilty enough but the essence of the problem was that I was incredibly naive and he ended up feeling hurt and feeling that he couldn't trust me again.
I thought this was the end but after a month of hearing nothing from him he told me he was ready to forgive me because he knew I never meant to hurt him. He said he didn't think he was going to be able to trust me again but that he missed me and thought about me a lot. However, he also said that he thought that we could never be more than friends. I guess he's completely within his rights to say so and I should feel lucky that he even forgave me, let alone want to be friends with me.
But the problem is that I love him so much and I want more. And I know that we work well together and so I know I can make him happy. So for the first time since I told him about the hurtful thing, he said he wants to meet me again because he misses me. I don't know what to do because I've never spent time with him simply as friends before. I somehow want to show him when I see him next that I'm worth more than that but I'm not sure how..."
1503,esfp,"Don't come on too strong. He's cautious of u now because of ur history, so u want to appeal to him as a friend. As an ESFP, I find myself drawn towards people who like to have fun, so if u meet with him with the goal of hanging out and having fun, things will go well, and he will most likely start trusting u again in no time. The main thing u need to keep in mind is that if u come on too strong, he will run. Don't let him know u love to that extent, because at this point, he will feel trapped and will retreat, and he will be less likely to return. Hang out with him a few times and see where that goes. I know he said he only wants to be friends, but keep in mind it's possible he was just saying that as a defense mechanism to protect himself from further harm, and with a proper approach, he could change his mind. It could also be how he really feels, and no matter how much u hang out, that may not change. If u want to be around him, u have to accept that there is a strong possibility that his stand point may never change. One of my favorite definitions of love is, ""doing the best thing for somebody else over doing what u want for urself,"" and it may turn out the best thing for him is to respect his wish to stay friends. At the very least, just hang out, be his friend, and relax and have fun :) I guarantee u he will enjoy himself."
1504,esfp,"You're in for a world of hurt if you continue to see him ""as friends"" when you clearly are still in love with him. Your story is very similar to my relationship with my ESFP ex (sort of ex, we were friends with benefits bc he couldn't give me a more serious commitment, and I tried everything too, from being the 'cool girl' to being the most awesome friend (with benefits) I could be in hopes he would see my worth and 'upgrade' the relationship). 
Take it from me, this is going to be a moth to flame relationship and the only thing that worked for me was to quit him cold turkey. Being in my ESFP ex's presence was like an ex smoker being in front of a cigarette. You may confuse that for true love, but it's not. It's passion but it's not true love. 
Now I'm with an ISTJ and he is steady and reliable and loving in the ways the ESFP couldn't be to me. Sure, it's not an intensely passionate relationship, but I feel loved as I deserve to be loved. Not saying ESFP/INFP couples don't have happy lasting relationships but it doesn't sound like your particular guy will be that ESFP based on what he himself has said. Sensors are literal and it's always best to just listen to them and take what they say at face value. "
1505,esfp,"That's because Socionics INTp is not INTP. It's INTJ. For Socionics to MBTI conversion, flip the last letter of introverts.
INTJ is ESFPs Dual, and I have experience to support this theory.
INTP and ESFP are Conflictors, which is an entirely different relation, which you can probably guess from the name."
1506,esfp,"I had a 2 years relationship with INTP and from my experience, it's no different from any other relationship. I will admit that certain aspects of our personality annoyed the hell out each other. This person was always serious, logical and about business whereas, most of time, I was the complete opposite. However, we did get along in other areas of the relationship. It just a matter of accepting the other person for who they are and be willing to compromise. "

What about you? :)"
1509,esfp,"28/m here. I'm very similar, despite being an ESFP I'm incredibly introverted in many ways. 
I'll take a night in playing video games over a night out. Happy to spend time chatting on Discord or over Teamspeak with my friends. I'm very creative and am a drummer in a band too, which takes up a lot of my spare time if I'm not at home or at work!"
1510,esfp,"Funnily enough, I pretty much never organise anything. I sit at home and netflix & chill, or clean. A lot of the times my friends come over to hang or for board games, and we usually go out for dinner a lot. We also do hikes, and runs. But I pretty much chill back cause I know something usually happens every day :)"

Synesthesia is super interesting! I'd love to be able to see what you see even if just for an hour! What's your favourite sound?"
1513,esfp,"I've heard of ambiversion before and that's what I consider myself. Definitely need my me-time after long periods of social interaction. I attribute that part of me to how I was raised (home schooled). But it doesn't change the fact that people are totally my thing. I love everyone, and spending time making people happy gets me excited and energized.
Synesthesia is a wonderful thing, and I was so used to it that I assumed it was something everyone experienced until I learned what it was. Right now one of my favorite sounds is a full B flat chord. It has a really warm golden - brown color and it's very comforting. It's also quite masculine. :)"
1514,esfp,"[ENTJ] I don't think ambiverts are truly a thing, and if we are looking at the actual definitions of extroversion and introversion in terms of MBTI... there aren't any ""ambiverted"" functions, either.  I think that the conventional definitions of introversion and extroversion should generally be ignored when trying to type oneself ^ honestly, it does people a disservice using the term, because by default, we all have introverted and extroverted functions..."
1515,esfp,Small talk. When people insist on talking about the weather or ask me how my summer was for the tenth time because they have nothing else to say. It feels so utterly meaningless and I feel like I'm responding as mechanically as a robot.
1516,esfp,"I disagree. When someone starts with the small talk, it's like they are trying to have a conversation but aren't sure how. Small talk is just a prelude to a conversation about something mutually interesting; it's a way to find out the other person's interests."
1517,esfp,"I’m fairly certain that I have Fi, but unsure if it’s dominant or auxiliary. I wrote a description of myself awhile back that was based on how others saw me, traits I saw in myself, and tried to cover different areas in my life. I got mixed results, a lot of ESFP and INFP. I’ve read about both and I can easily see myself as both, but I know I can only possibly be one, and I’m stumped trying to find out. 
I’ll make my case for each and try to include my motivations as well.  
My main reasons for INFP are the Fi-Si loop: I‘m sentimental and nostalgic about certain events in my past and love sharing them because I’m not ready to let them go, and I’d like to think those around me care as much as I do. I have a lot of photos and remember the specific dates of the events that were emotionally relevant for me, again because I don’t want to forget, I believe that they aren’t truly gone unless you forget about them. I don’t care about my appearance as much, I obviously take care of hygiene but I rarely deviate from my normal clothing style because it’s comfortable, that and because I freaking hate clothes shopping in general haha. I don’t display a lot of your average Se traits, I’m pretty clumsy and uncharismatic, and you could see my cringe-worthy and awkward movements from a mile away if you saw me in real life. I’m not sure if this would be attributed to inferior Te or not, but I’m pretty un-assertive and I don’t like taking the lead for random things just for the sake of taking the lead. It’s not that I dislike the attention, I just hate asserting myself and trying to act as an authority figure. I wouldn’t like being above people, I’d rather be equal and liked than higher and powerful, and plus the added responsibility and pressure is not worth it for me. If it’s something that I’m truly passionate about though, I’m absolutely the first to speak up and let everyone know, whether I not I’d really “take the lead” that depends, but I definitely show a lot of excitement and enthusiasm if something I’m passionate about hits. 
My main reasons for ESFP: I feel like I’m too trusting and enthusiastic about the company of people to be an INFP. I’ve gotten feedback about being very naïve and open to strangers even as a child. Canceled social plans just cut so deep for me, I can’t even explain the overwhelming disappointment when I’m looking forward to hanging out and then it just gets rescheduled or cancled. I love being with people, especially when they allow me to be who I am and let me show my real self. I love telling stories, making friends, laughing my ass off, and being well known in the community/social life. I feel absolutely furfilled and hyped after a fun social night and I can’t relate to needing to immediately go home and be alone to recharge. Whole I don’t mind my alone time, I usually just use it to watch shows or make memes or something, I rarely ever go deep into my thoughts and get extremely depressed if I do. Life is awesome and I think being existential and over-complicated makes things really depressing and weighed down for no reason. I’ve never really seen myself as intuitive, in fact I’ve even gotten feedback for not thinking about future implications, “you need to look at the big picture,” think about the long-term etc. I sometimes blurt things out without realizing the consequences and doing absolutely retarded things in the moment and then physically cringing at myself as I look back and reflect on it. It looks like a great idea and it looks like the best option at the time, so I’d go ahead and then it just blows up in my face. 
Based on my evaluation (and if necessary, my profile shows my previous type me posts), what would you reckon I could be?"
1518,esfp,"Honestly? You talk too much to be an ESFP, I mean that in the nicest way possible! Look at all the other posts on here and how brief and void of analysis they are (maybe that was a little strong). You sound like a great person, my guess would be INFP/ENFP. "
1519,esfp,"Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.  
INFP by Gulenko | INFP by Stratiyevskaya | INFP subtypes 
ESFP by Gulenko | ESFP by Stratiyevskaya | ESFP subtypes "
1520,esfp,"Hard to say. It can definitely only come from within, and not without. But I do well with NTJs, as they have what I need and what I'm not good at, so we challenge each other.
​
The sense of humor never matures. Stays the same."
1521,esfp,"I'm an ENTJ and let's assume this ESFP girl likes me. I'm very sure it's not just normal ESFP liking everything and everyone. I have never really had an ESFP have the hots for me, so I'm wondering how do I show that I'm interested?
inb4 mocking my Fi"
1522,esfp,"INTP girl here. I have a ESFP sister. An older sister. Don't do it bro . They're really annoying. It's not just sibling rivalry. 
But on the bright side for you esfp's like anything good looking. (they're not all that shallow) just don't be too cocky or obsessive. That's all. 
You know what. What am I doing? You're putting your life in danger. Don't do it. The mushiness .ugh. And they always think they're right. Even when they're clearly wrong.
But you can talk to them about anything. Really. 
Also small talk is cheap
Find some common ground. Have a real conversation
Maybe I am not the best person to give advice on this but those last two sentences gave good advice. But don't say I didn't warn you bro"
1523,esfp,"Probably too late, but this explains my relationship of 3 years. Just ask them to a meal. ESFPs love fun. If you are fun and yourself, it will be a great time. Try and be spontaneous and random during the meal. Don't bring all your ENTJ structure and planning. While it will come out, as in all ENTJ discussions, keep the fun and excitement going. ESFPs are the most fun. They are also a ton of work."
1524,esfp,"Maybe you find yourself planning out your weeks more than you think an ESFP would or perhaps the idea that an ESFP takes criticism personally describes you perfectly.
Do you think you spill over into any of the other MBTI types?"
1525,esfp,"What's funny is for me I identify strongest with the supposed weaknesses of an ESFP. For instance I hate conflict, I suck in academics, I cannot focus, and I can't plan anything out. 
However when it comes to the strengths, it's not as accurate in describing me. I feel like I am really good at entertaining my friends but I often find myself tripping over my words and sometimes struggle to  organize my thoughts. "
1526,esfp,"I've found a video on ESFP and you may have already seen it but I found it kind of hard to follow because to me it seemed like it was all a bit fast paced so I decided to try to type it out to make more since of it.  I DIDN'T WRITE THIS THESE ARE THE WORDS OF THE GUY IN THE VIDEO. 
I actually not sure why I typed this whole thing out...actually.. :) :P
I dunno I guess I did it so I could understand it better and maybe it'll help someone else to understand it better too.
The Myers Briggs test has identified you as the ESFP 
or the performers as your personality type.
You have the ABILITY to understand the objective world its facts and reality.
You look at things and say ""this is the way it really is"" you are right on,
you are spot on.
You get it and you see how the world really works.
You have a TALENT for entertaining and pleasing others with words, and actions, and will probably be a pretty good actor, and everybody who knows you probably sees that. 
You have an APTITUDE for getting the most out of any situation  or place. 
You're the kind of person who can go into a situation, and organize things ,and make things happen in the way that other people can appreciate. 
You are SKILLED at finding the best of things for yourself  and for others. You can go into a situation and everyone sends you out to be the ""advance spy"" to kind of check out how things are, and you'll be very good at that.
You have EXCEPTIONAL NATURAL MUSICAL or DRAMATIC SKILLS. You can be the drama king or drama king and act those out and possibly play musical instruments at the same time possibly.
You have a DETAILED and NUANCED appreciation for the outside world. You can look at the outside world and have a real good feel for the little things that make things special about life. 
You can DETECT and RECOGNIZE the effect of minute changes that are made and see those in appreciation.
Especially if you have the strength for MAXIMIZER( the strength to take something that is already good, and making it better.) It very well could be that a maximizer is one of your strengths especially a high strength.
You have refined taste and make it a joy for others to be in your company. So you are the kind of person who can go into a restaurant, and if you are a wine drinker you probably know the best kind of wine if you're a person who is a connoisseur of food you know exactly what to order. If you go in a restaurant you are checking it out and seeing what people like to eat.
You can QUICKLY DIFFERENTIATE THINGS of GREATER and LESSER importance.
You can go into a situation and a relationship and you know what's important to other people you know in  project what's important in a project. It just happens to be that you think that way and you're good at doing hat
You RECOGNIZE and PROMOTE the talents of other people.
You go through this process and you're learning your profile, you can probably get a pretty good idea of how important for other people to go through the same thing. It'll help give you and feed you information that you can use for them and help them build there understanding of wh they are and how they are designed. 
You DEFEND the best and most life promoting aspects in the world. You're looking at the world and you're seeing people in life and are trying to help promote the best parts of life and the best aspects of  the world as well.
Weaknesses
May ignore the preferences or needs of other people.
There might be people around you and you just ignore what there needs are and so pay attention and make sure you take the feelings and attitudes of other people into account as you get through your day.
May perceive objective criticism as a ploy to spoil the fun.
You might look at when somebody says ""If you did it this way.."" and you might very well take that as they are just trying to spoil the fun they don't want me to enjoy this. That's not necessarily the case they might look at what you're doing and say ""wow they are really good. If they just did this they would be even better!"" That may be a strength you want to lean on instead of being concerned about. 
May have a skewed or an unrealistic idea about the feelings of other people. You may believe that you have the ability to read other people but your personality is such that probably are not good at reading other people so having other people to spend time with that CAN read that can be helpful
May blame your problems on the world in general.
Just remember that we're all responsible for ourselves and it doesn't matter what happened in the past what matters is the choices we make daily to make your life better and to make your relationships with other people better also.

May come across as boastful and rash in attitudes.
You might come across as being a little arrogant or egotistical just remember to watch for these things and to read people and there emotions and to ask other people about how they feel about things you say and learn to control that because it will push other people away again.
May rationalize things in inane or simplistic ways.
In your mind you there might be things that are a big deal to other people and you just kind of push them off and don't think much of them 
May believe extraordinary things about inanimate objects.
You may look at something and say ""that thing over thing has abilitys or does something that it really doesn't do. You might look at a crystal and think ""the crystal has powers"" just watch out for that and look at the data look at the facts.
Situations requiring careful consideration may overwhelm you. 
You may need to associate with people who are good at digging into the facts, that are good at understanding what's going on.

Action items:
TEST your intuition on new prospects and opportunity.
MAKE SURE that you are  looking up the facts.
Do the RESEARCH when you find  a new opportunity or a have a respective opportunity make sure you check out the facts. You are the kind of person who can very easily make a decision that is wrong because you don't have all the facts. 
Make sure you check out the facts

You have the ability to react strongly to body language.
ASK questions and understand why others feel the way they do. You have a tendency to jump to conclusions with your type of personality so make sure that you are asking people and find out what the realitys are don't compare another situation with your own just try to discover what is going on for real.
It's important in your relationships to be extremely candid to give them permission to be candid and expect and get the type of feedback that you can actually use so you can bring a little bit more reality to your life. If you think about it reality is the only thing that is worth acting on. 
You have a tendency to be very sensing, feeling and perception oriented  and very outgoing and if you put all this together you can have a tendency to build ideas in your mind that aren't true. Make sure you are grounded in reality and the best way to be grounded in reality is to put people in your life that are very grounded in reality and ask them questions and investigate these things. 
See disagreements and criticism as an opportunity for growth.

It will change the way you think and react to people in general.
Assume the best a positive attitude makes positive situations so make sure you keep your mind on the positive things and the good things in life.
If something seems to be wrong ask questions, again you have the tendency to be a very touchy feely person you SINCE things you FEEL things you PERCEIVE things so make sure that you are getting a lot of information base your reactions to life base your reactions to people to projects and opportunitys on facts look for the facts. Go out and quantify what it is you need to know before you go out and take action.

Things absolutely could've gone horribly had I not found work, but if things are meant to happen they'll happen, and that's why we're on our feet and doing ok right now."
1528,esfp,"When I was in college, my mother called me up one day and told me she will not be able to send me money for groceries. So after my first class (some time mid-morning) the same day, I got on my bicycle and rode it to the nearest Target, applied for a job, and asked to speak with the person that does the hiring. I got a position the follow week (I didn't care where b/c I needed income badly but I didn't tell them that). I had some, and still do, good friends that let me mooch off them until my first pay check."
1529,esfp,"I didn't put very much effort into the job search my senior year of college, only went on one interview and got woken up hungover as shit on graduation day with a job offer. Almost 4 years later I'm still with the same company and have had quite a few promotions."
1530,esfp,One time I was just sitting in a shopping center and someone offered me a job. Another time I just walked into a bar and got offered a job on the spot. I have good luck with getting jobs. And apartments. I always manage to find one right before I get kicked out of the other one.
1531,esfp,"INTJ here visiting the ESFP thread to see the difference.  Latest look at INTJ topics are all doom, gloom, and ""Why do I suck"" threads.  Here the big question is ""Do we have to be the life of the party?""
Interesting contrast of insecurities!  Just thought I'd mention it.  It's good to get some contrast now and again!"
1532,esfp,"I think I (ESFP) just want to have lots of fun and since I'm not afraid of being in the spotlight, I naturally gravitate towards being the ""life of the party""? 
IMO don't have to be the centre of everything, but it's a lot more fun like that ! All the fun stuff happens around you and thats exactly what I want from a party ! :--) "
1533,esfp,"I am an INTJ female and I have liked an ESFP male for a year now. I somewhat recently found out that he liked me at one point but a friend of mine sabotaged the relationship(we are no longer friends) and convinced him not to date be because she liked him. I thought things were going to pick back up in April because we started talking again and went on a ""date"" (he didnt pay for me but we were alone and it felt like a date so?). I honestly thought he liked me but now i dont know. I seem him around other girls and he seems to be flirting with them and although he does go out of his way to talk to me I have no idea if its just because we are friends and those are the only feelings he has for me or if he likes me. I hear people say he's talking to this girl or likes this girl (i can think of 3 right off the top of my head and there are probably more). I want to get him alone and directly tell him my feelings and find out how he feels but i dont want to lose his friendship or look like an idiot for thinking he likes me. I have no idea how he would respond to my directness. He is graduating soon so i feel like i have to act quickly if i want anything to come of this. Part of me doesnt even care if feelings arent reciprocated, i just want to stop imagining what a relationship could be and get over it. Any ideas on what i should do? is just telling him my feelings a bad idea? Does it sound like to you he could like me? i feel like a child asking all of this but i dont know who else to turn to"
1534,esfp,"Just talk to him. You need to be direct with him. No one will think you look like an idiot, and if he's graduating you're going to see him a lot less in the future anyway. It doesn't really sound like there's anything there but if he thinks you're cute and he goes out of his way to talk to you then your frankness may ignite something in him. "
1535,esfp,"ESFPs like to play the field if they aren't tied down. He probably doesn't know if you're that interested so he's keeping his options open. Definitely tell him how you feel or nothing's gonna change. You have a good attitude about it so there is nothing to lose, if he doesn't like you the same way then at least you tried.
As far as not knowing if he's interested. I've found most Se guys can go either way with girls, they can be friends with them or hook up."
1536,esfp,"Talk to him. I love intjs. I can talk to them about anything and we have a understanding. He probably has no idea you're interested. We read body language. And sometimes for some people a lot of their reactions look the same (mad, sad, hungry, constipated) so just say something :) "
1537,esfp,i know he liked me when we went out because i got some pretty clear signals that night. I feel like he has kinda moved on or is just being very indecisive about it and im afraid he has changed his mind
1538,esfp,"from an mbti perspective why do you think that is with Se guys? Ive noticed with this guy in particular he seems to act semi-interested in whatever girls he is around at the moment and im wondering if that is an Se ""live in the moment"" type thing"
1539,esfp,"For myself I try to give everyone equal attention. This use to bother my bf. He felt like I was flirting with everyone. But it wasn't like that. I genuinely cared about the well being and happiness of everyone I was around. And I didn't want anyone to feel less attended too. 
But when I am not interested in someone. Maybe I would be flirting with everyone? Idk?"
1540,esfp,"can confirm. my ESFP friend breaks up with girls and goes back to them a few times - not out of malice he just wasn't ""sure"". She sounded like a INFP.
plus ESFP are people persons. They always sounds like they are fun/flirty/etc. Most other types(Fe) do this and it throws INTJs off a lot.

1541,esfp,"My sister is a 16-year old ESFP with strong depression and few friends. She spends a lot of her time (I'm talking an average of about 5 hours a day) at home watching TV shows she watched as a kid and on her phone on Instagram. She doesn't have many friends and she's a big rules and saftey person and doesn't drink or do drugs or anything, so she feels alienated because of that. She's a tiny bit chubby and has a hard time motivating herself to exercise or leave the house in general, and she has extremely low self esteem that she takes out by avoiding talking or thinking about her problems.
I'm a male INFP and I genuinely don't feel like I understand her or know how to communicate with her well. Whenever we talk she just talks at me for like 20 minutes straight about random things that people did or what some person commented on some Facebook post and the trends they're following and all this stuff. I try to listen to humour her but all of that stuff seems so superficial to me and l think she can tell but would never want to talk to me about that and can't slow down to have an actual back and forth conversation anyhow. I don't know what to do, any ESFPs that have been through anything similar might be able to suggest things that would help them if they were depressed?
tl;dr
my sister is a depressed ESFP and I'm looking for an ESFP perspective on what would make her feel better
Thanks guys, any help would be appreciated, I'm really worried about her"
1542,esfp,"Hi - INFP myself but my wife is an ESFP.  Honestly that doesn't sound like an ESFP, especially the preoccupation on in the face of entertainment or fun.  I honestly might question her honestly when she took that test. 
That being said ESFPs as near as I can tell need to experience SENSORIAL input.  I would look at what might be causing the disconnect.  Is there some type of moral dogma or belief system coming into play?  You briefly mentioned not using Alcohol or Drugs, is this based on a belief system or religion?  If that is the case you may need to find people with similar morals where she can be herself to find self-actualization. 
If I was just trying to get over her the hump I would kind of search out areas or activities that might get her out for sensory stimulation to make her feel alive and if she won't hang with friends because of Moral beliefs system then it might be up to you (It feels it is always up to us INFPs) to intervene and get her to a place where her senses feel alive.  
So if she has alienated herself, you might tell your you need to or want to go do something but get bored on your own (If she'll believe that of an INFP) take her on a road-trip to see and hear or experience new or different sights and sounds. If she voices insecurities like, ""I' over weight, I don't want anybody to see me swimming"" - something I have heard before, Acknowledge in the sincere INFP politeness... ""Oh don't worry about us, nobody will know us there, plus nobody even care anyway and I doubt wanyone will even see us.""  Exact phrases I have used to encourage my wife and mother of 5 kids to come sit in the jacuzzi.  Do something like that as a test.  If that sensory stimulation appears to help then be creative and try to find a place or group where she is both accepted and her morals are not threatened but the fast paced sensorial input exists. Also be aware also according the the popular ""car-model"" you might get outbursts from the ""Effective Child"" which can be quite terse.  Probably the more you can focus on the sensory learning the better. 
However if there is true ongoing depression I would highly suggest trying to get her real help.  Now in my wife's situation he absolutely would refuse that.  However, I did find supplementation with typical mental and stress support supplements quite effective.  I'm not saying exactly what to do but in my case it seems that St John's Wort, Vit B Complex and other natural mood enhancers seem to help.
Oh and on a good day I would have her retake that test. :-)"
1543,esfp,"ESFP/ENFP here depending on the day.
I was extremely depressed throughout my adolescent and teenage years. She doesn't sound reckless, so it won't be the perfect cocktail for a completely tumultuous existence, but these years, developmentally, are extremely important for females. You're being a good brother by worrying about her.
Ideally, it would be great to get her off of her telephone and into the real world, where she can form some real connections with her peers, but I know that's hard to do and not the status quo for your standard 16 year old. Has she considered joining clubs at school? What if you took her for a yoga class? I would say try immersing her in activities that she may hold an interest in, and try spending time with her outside of the house. I wish I had had that at my age. Good luck. xo"
1544,esfp,"now i can't speak for other esfps, but here's what happens to me: while i am perfectly capable of launching into an in depth conversation on intellectual topics like classic literature or biology, whipping out stats and terminology like a geek (no offense!) isn't my preferred method of socialising. i tend to prefer to talk about stupid, superficial little things and act hyperactive, because that's what i think people want to talk about, and i don't want to seem like a bore. also it's kind of... more fun??? i don't know how to explain. so that might be why she seems shallow. my point is, we're not as shallow as we seem.
i'm clinically depressed (i'm on zoloft) and i've found that social interaction (especially understanding) and a little sympathy can be really helpful. i'm not saying that you should cling to her 24/7; but maybe you could try talking to her more, guiding her towards deeper topics ie. her inner thoughts and feelings and making an effort to understand and listen? also introduce her to something stimulating but not physically exhausting, like a no-phone car ride with pretty views, or camping outdoors?"
1545,esfp,"Is it possible for you all to maintain a relationship long term without flirting outside of the relationship? Is it?! Infj female married to esfp male. Considering divorce. Sick of the flirting cycle. Each time is the last time, i can see he means it, he believes himself when he's saying it. Except the last time never is the last time. Is the urge too compelling? Is it uncontrollable? Esfp's are generally flirty and impulsive then add to that testosterone and i don't know how to handle my life anymore man. "
1546,esfp,But I like to flirt and it happens innocently and naturally. I don't act on it when im in a couple. I wont kiss another woman or be adventurous. I just like talking to her. Its just how i express myself and live happy.
1547,esfp,"Hey you, I happened to stumble on you again because I've been visiting this thread to see how ESFPs think lol. I know you're looking for ESFP perspective here, but I just wanted to butt in where I'm not wanted because my first long term relationship ended as a result of this type of situation. I don't know what type he was (although I do really want to know).
Basically he was a self-described huge flirt, which I couldn't tolerate. When I would confront him with specific instances that were unacceptable he downplayed them like they were nothing and convinced me I was overreacting. He constantly described me as a giant weight around his shoulders (healthy relationship, right?). This went on for ~5 years, only 2 of which were good ones. When we finally broke up it was because I had become such a jealous wreck that I broke my own moral code and logged into his facebook. I found that he had been emotionally cheating on me to a much LARGER extent than I previously knew. He had been chatting on facebook with a girl we met at a group event in college. He was telling her he liked her, wanted to give her valentine's day gifts, etc. Swore up and down they had no physical contact. After we broke up, several of our close friends came to me with stories about instances where he had hit on them. Really unhelpful and traumatic, but that's what happened. 
Since then I've learned to trust my gut in relationships - by that I mean standing by my interpretation of the situation as a valid perspective, even though I can easily understand someone else's feelings on the matter. Our Introverted intuition can connect dots without us understanding how, so trusting ourselves is key. If he's committed to you, he's got to give some ground to make you feel happy and safe. You're not being unreasonable in the situations you've described in the comments. 
ESFP I described on the other thread, who is dating a good friend is also super animated, friendly, chatty, and could come off as subtly flirting with everyone, I think. But from what I understand gives our friend no reason to be concerned with fidelity. There are lines. Draw the ones that suit you and your relationship and stick to them."
1548,esfp,"You're not gonna like this comment. But have you considered looking deeper into why it bothers you? Because I don't just give the title of boyfriend (let alone husband) to everyone. That means I view you above all. It's not flirting to me. It's being friendly and playful. Just like you enjoy learning new different things constantly, that's what people are for us. You read science books or take a class to learn something (example sorry for stereotyping) That's what people are for us. So At the end of the day or the year or century or whatever. You're the one I want. "
1549,esfp,"Great response! I think it isn't an ESFP problem. It is a HIM problem. Like I said earlier. I will be super friendly, but I would never send good morning texts or tell them i found them attractive and would date them if I wasn't married. Maybe find out why he seeks that attention. That attention that crosses the line."
1550,esfp,I have read this but presently don't have time to type the response it deserves. Will write later. Dont feel you're butting in where you're not wanted. I appreciate all the perspectives so much. Thank you. 
1551,esfp,"I can relate to feeling gaslighted. He says things like ""nothing happened though"" which he believes is true because he hasn't done what he considers the ""ultimate betrayal"".
Regarding the ""not trusting my gut because i can see all the perspectives"" you nailed that on the head so hard. I can so easily rationalize not doing what my gut says. 
I also broke my moral code to discover this. Which i would not do if i didn't have such blatant evidence in my face with illogical explanations.  He did eventually come clean on his own though, although not without some aggressive nudging on my part. 
I feel i've be so reasonable and so understanding and so non jealous that he perceives that as a free pass to treat me like a throwaway. To not appreciate my trust and leniency as the gift it is. Before all this my friends would respond to finding out he was away overnight camping with comments like ""i wouldn't let MY husband do that"" and i felt like a fool when i found out he abused my trust. me living my life in line with my morals and giving him the freedom i knew i would be able to handle wound up screwing me over. "
1552,esfp,"It bothers me because i think he takes it beyond what is ""innocent"" then gaslights me to try to act like it's just innocent. I described what happened in an above comment. Maybe reading that would clarify for you why i feel as i do. "
1553,esfp,"Don't feel like a fool. Being trusting and open is a gift. Not everyone can do it, especially if you consider our personality type. and for him to have abused that reflects on him, not you. This quality you have is so valuable in relationships. I say this because I have found it to be invaluable in mine. No one deserves to be walked all over, and he might be lying to himself, but I'm sure that somewhere he knows he's done you some serious wrong, especially if you've expressed what bothers you. 
I can only speak to my experience that when I stood my ground, we would break up, and then either I would feel insecure missing a half of myself and turn back, or he would miss me and claim he could be more compromising. But it never worked out that way, and when I left I discovered all these amazingly varied and vastly more understanding people. Even the couple of boyfriends I had after him who didn't work treated me 1000% better, because they truly did want to be committed to me when they were. 
I know marriage is different, however. And love is a strong thing. I wish you two all the best in working things out, if that's what you choose. And again I hope you find strength in yourself to draw the lines you need, clearly state what they are and consequences for breaking them, and stick to them, because you really deserve it. I think you have so much to offer. "
1554,esfp,"Here's a recent example and i'm going try my best to not tldr you(make it short). I give him lots of freedom. I'm not a jealous or possessive/controlling person. He has aspects of his life that i know of but dont include me. Like rock climbing at a rock climbing gym. He made lots of friends there and i gave him freedom to go overnight camping with them to do outdoor rock climbing and attend other such things etc. I gave him the freedom because i dont want anyone controlling me so i was following the golden rule. I know he's flirty innocently. And i expected that to manifest as you described. But i recently found out he had been having 1 on 1 text messages with a girl he met rock climbing. She was at the camping trip. She was at the outings. He was texting with her good morning messages and telling her he was attracted to her but wouldnt act on it because he was married and it would hurt me to find this out. And it did hurt me. Innocent flirting is innocent and i can understand. But my perspective is if something more develops you shove it down. Maybe he didnt ""act on it"" physically but to me he acted on it by telling her. "
1555,esfp,"Ah, i get it. So he's immature and insecure about his flaws. Well I think its very sweet of you to see past the flaws and have made an everlasting commitment. I truly hope he matures a little and figures out how wonderful that is. "
1556,esfp,"Oh hell no! You make it very clean that, that is emotionally cheating and won't be tolerated!
That is NOT ok! I would never ever tell someone else that nor would I send good morning texts. You're very patient and I'm so sorry he's being insensitive
Sorry for the reaction. But it hits home. My ex was very vocal about disliking my ""flirting"" (I hug a lot and love eye contact when talking to people, as I described before) but he was in turn doing the same as your current man. And it lead him to cheating. He's playing with fire. "
1557,esfp,I appreciate you and you all so much. I really do. This is so helpful to me. Beyond measure. I think i've got more out of this subreddit than the friggin therapy i've been paying through the nose for since this all started recently. 
1558,esfp,"Man, I'm so glad my shitty experience can help someone at all. To be honest, it still affects me a little bit, since I haven't door slammed (that's an involuntary thing for me?) and really do still have anger about some things. Seeing you identify with what I'm saying is so validating to me too. And I'm not a hugger either lolllll but hell yeah to being friends. I really feel for ya and know this must be a crazy time for you. Keep your chin up and your inner circle close!"
1559,esfp,"To be perfectly honest with you. I do not believe anything physical has happened. I moved 4 hrs away from my home town to come be with him (after a 7.5 yr long distance relationship). A little while after moving here i discovered he had a 'plenty of fish' profile and saw all that flirting. Seemed like just flirting. Almost left then but fell for the ""its the last time"" line. Believed that. Then in august of this year we were married on the anniversary of dating 10 years. Then shortly after that i saw a picture of him on fb with his hand on a girls knee. ""Innocent"" enough....(?) (so i'm told). Then about a moth after our marriage i found out about this girl. It's all ""innocent"" in his eyes because he's not ""cheating"". To him the ultimate betrayal is physical and thats not what he's doing/done. But these things keep happening. Idk what to do. He's very huggy as you said. The eye contact. The friendliness. It's all there. But he's being a habitual line stepper. I can accept the hugging and the cheek kissing and the mild flirtations and the bubbly personality, those things initially drew me to him. I'm so lost. "
1560,esfp,"I'm sorry i keep getting so long winded. I'm just struggling so much. I'm trying so hard to do ""what is right"". But its so hard to know what that is. I literally broke out in hives over the stress. I'm still taking the prednisone steroids. "
1561,esfp,"Loling because when I went to a therapist after the traumatic breakup in my situation, they said nothing is wrong - it's just a breakup - you'll get over it. Haaaa wish I would've known about Reddit at the time. Maybe someone could have helped me process or something! "
1562,esfp,"Door slam is sort of involuntary for me as well. Once i'm doing it, it sort of feels like something i have chosen-but really i've been pushed to it. A doorslam would be the easiest solution. How long ago was your situation?"
1563,esfp,"You know him and you know yourself. What are you willing to tolerate? What is a realistic outcome? It sounds like you knew what you were getting into, and I'm not sure but that maybe you went into it hoping for a change. Because if he doesn't see it as wrong. He will not change. 
A good friend wouldn't be ok having that conversation with a married man. Are those the kind of friends he wants?? really??"
1564,esfp,"About six years ago. We broke up when I was 20. As I've become more self-aware and experienced other relationships, I've realized the extent of the mind fuckery that went on. I don't think I would've grown as much within the relationship as I have without, because I was always working on him and is, not in me. He didn't give me the support I needed. He did love me in his own way, but it was inadequate, and realizing that was very painful. "
1565,esfp,"You make excellent points. I did go into it thinking making these ""progress steps"" (moving in together, marriage) would be the....catalyst so to speak. That maybe he was flirting because we werent fully committed. I thought with increasing commitment he would take things more seriously and end these behaviors on his own. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt. Can i just be sure here? You are esfp female? Yes? Roughly my age? (25) "
1566,esfp,I want to tell you i'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to go through the pain of that. It sounds like you frame it as a lesson learned though. I think i'm the same. I dont learn lessons unless i learn them painfully. 
1567,esfp,ESFP F30. My best friends are an INFP and INTJ. LOL and they drive me NUTS. But I love them dearly. I had to learn to see things from an intuitive perspective. It gets draining but now that im older I see the benefits of long term friendships and How positive different perspectives are in your life. 
1568,esfp,"Thanks :) and yeah I do see it as a lesson. I think that maybe I had to go through it to be who I am, and I'm a stronger person as a result. Feel free to shoot me a message if you ever need someone to talk to about this stuff. I might take a little while to answer, but I always will"
1569,esfp,"Especially ENTPs & ENFPs? I often wonder if you guys are super weirded out by our Shrek & hitler jokes at 1am lol. 
Or when we go on talking about philosophy or weird theories. 
Does that bother you or make you confused, or are you okay with/like that extroverted intuition?"
1570,esfp,"I find them hilarious and I like how they don't really care if other people think they're weird and it can rub off on me.  I'm feel like I can relax and show my weirder side more.  
I can definitely keep up with philosophy and theories, but at the end of the day I don't find them as entertaining as other things
I just like other extroverted people in general because introverted people make me more awkward because they don't use facial expressions as much and it makes me uncomfortable"
1571,esfp,"Does it make me confused? No. Do I always find it funny or entertaining? Also no.
I'm fine with both. My mom is ENFP. My boss, and neighbor, and colleague, and other friends are ENTPs. Hard to keep up, and especially with ENTPs, being PoLR Fi is not beneficial to me always appreciating that, but I can appreciate the quirky and open mind in both."
1572,esfp,"I’m have been married to an ENTP for 14 years. I think I annoy him definitely as much as he annoys me. But he is HILARIOUS!  I find his “weirdness “ extremely attractive and so fascinating. I could study him every day, he just always has stuff going on in his mind. He has helped me develop my intellectual side and find my inner logic.  I will always want an entp in my life, their evil pot stirring side is just way too fun to witness"
1573,esfp,"doing new things with people I like being around, like going to restaurants, the beach, movies, parties, road trips, etc.  talking about philosophies and theories goes too deep, and people end up talking about it for way too long, and also I used to have really bad social anxiety so I don't like settling on one thought for too long if that makes sense.  Talking about nothing feels more entertaining to me, and its easier to laugh during conversations like that compared to theoretical conversations"
1574,esfp,"Hobbies. I'm a doer and prefer hands on stuff. I have political and social opinions and am willing to talk about them in detail, but damn is it refreshing when someone wants to tell me something interesting they've been up to.
I'll think about government corruption myself. When I'm with others I'd rather discuss good hiking trails or what you're looking to get out of the new camera you just bought. "
1575,esfp,"Maybe I'm missing the sarcasm but I meant that while I do think a lot about politics, social justice and whatnot, when I get together with friends I don't just want to sit on a couch and circle-jerk over nuanced topics we already agree with each other about. I want to go do something. "
1576,esfp,"I think so. I know for myself. A lot of INTPs feel awkward for some reason? Almost like they feel we're uninterested. The only things that uninterested me are cruel people, fake people, extremely shallow people(talk about clothes to no end) and people who never like to do anything but talk and no action (example: ""omg we should go to hike the Hollywood sign"" And never go, but talk about it constantly)
Side note: I have at least 5 intp friends and we get along splendidly. We have a few booze joke around talk about whatever. "
1577,esfp,"I've moved around quite a bit. And I guess I'm social? The funniest thing is I know zero ISTJs and ISFJs which are suppose to be my match or something. 
INTPs are sooooo NOT boring. You're also super fun to bug. And you secretly like hugs. Top 5 favorite type for sure. "

Results Post Here

Hey there, ESFPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESFP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
1579,esfp,"Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!
https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/"
1580,esfp,"Its weird sometimes when I'm depressed I seclude myself from others even though being around people is what gives me life. To be honest i have to be forced to be with people to get energy, or I ride it out until the episode is over and am back to my energetic self"
1581,esfp,"At points of low energy in life, I take it as a sign to recharge. Give myself some introverted time. Yes even as an ESFP I still respect and enjoy some well needed alone time. To the other esfp's out there, get outside, and appreciate some sunlight. Go on a trip by yourself. Get out in the world by yourself for a little while and just do you. Hope this is encouraging!"
1582,esfp,"I'm an INFJ and my closest friends have always been ESFPs. I think ESFPs are adorable and I really admire their strong Se because they notice details I overlook. I also love their Fi because it makes them so independent. ESFPs have this cute, innocent charm that draws me in."
1583,esfp,"Best friend is an INFJ. I love her, but sometimes she can annoy the hell out of me.
I've been asking her to hang out for a while, and she turned me down due to a school project. Fine, no problem at all. But yesterday, when she found out that I was spending time by myself (just jogging, doing errands, etc.) when I could have been with her, she gave me shit for it. I pointed out her hypocrisy, and I only refrained from lashing out due to our friendship. 
She also got nervous because a guy she was dating stopped texting her with the same frequency as in the beginning of the relationship. Lol, maybe that dude has a life outside of talking to you? 
However with all that said, her strengths do compliment mine. She's excellent at reading people and their motives, not just on the superficial level of snap judgments. She's also optimistic about others and always sees the best in them, whereas I allow the negative aspects to eclipse the positive ones. Sometimes I almost wish I could be as empathetic as she is, but then I would have trouble letting go of the toxic people in my life. "
1584,esfp,"ESFPs and INFJ are very similar but in my experience, the INFJ judging can cause problems in the relationship. I have an INFJ friend who becomes quite irrational when criticized for simple things and that can be grating to an ESFP who likes everything to be pleasant. We give criticism and we take it calmly and INFJ are more likely to make a scene. 
Making a scene is an ESFP pet peeve. 
They are a boon to have when working with them on a team because of their advocacy, and they will defend their friends valiantly which is respectable but they are a bit too high strung to hang out with all the time when you are an EFSP who likes to go with the flow. 
Like ESFPs they are good creators if they can keep up their motivation. "
1585,esfp,"Best friend is ESFP. mmmm they are the best. They're loyal friends that always stay by your side.
""I really admire their strong Se because they notice details I overlook"" 
Definitely, one time when we were heading to the movie theater, my ESFP friend found a movie ticket on the ground and managed to exchange it for a free ticket. I didn't even notice it on the ground."
1586,esfp,This! Esfp female. Don't buy me gifts -- let's do fun stuff together! Maybe one of those shops you can paint pottery together. Movie and a photo booth. Laser tag. A cooking or cake baking/ decorating class!
1587,esfp,"^^That. Buy her an experience. A boat trip, and adventure, a shooting or longbow lesson, invite her to a bowling session, a bouldering session...
Combo of developing skills and experience is the best."
1588,esfp,"People gotta stop thinking that extroverts automatically have a million superficial friendships and introverts automatically have a few perfect friendships -_-
Plenty of extroverts cut down their social circle and keep only the ""best"" ones as they get older because adult responsibilities make it hard to maintain many friendships or maybe they choose to devote more time to a romantic relationship. Introverts who are actively engaged in a lot of hobbies usually have tons of friends and acquaintances from the various communities they identify with. And someone of either type could have no friends simply because they're a shitty person."
1589,esfp,"My sister is an INFJ. Sometimes it's difficult to relate to her/ how she sees things but we both like nonsensical humour and I'm happy with that :) She's learnt to interpret my love over the years and same with me to her. 
I feel like she's very subtle and sweet and I'm very out there and loud. I have to be a bit delicate with her and she's often very quiet which makes it hard to bond sometimes but we love each other and that's the short and long of it. 
Obviously family relationships are going to be very different- I've known some people I'd predict were INFJs in past and I wasn't a huge instant fan of them. But I feel like family love pretty much transcends personality types mostly."
1590,esfp,"ESFP here. My fiance is an INFJ. We've been together for over 8 years and are finally getting married this September!
He's extremely stubborn (thinks he's always right-- which unfortunately he is lol) and can come off a bit rude (empathy isn't his strong suit). 
However, with his stubbornness comes his drive. I don't know ANYONE as hardworking as him. When he puts his mind to something, he gives it his all. Extremely goal oriented. 
He's very straight to the point-- tell it like it is, whether you like it or not. Sometimes that comes off as rude, but there's nothing fake about him. 
I wouldn't trade him for anyone else in the world. We're truly opposites, and I think that makes our relationship exciting. 
TLDR: I love INFJs! :)"
1591,esfp,"This was helpful to read. I'm super stubborn, honest, and driven. I was wondering if I was just an unusual INFJ. To be fair though, I'm trying to regain some of my empathy and graciousness. Something about growing up has made me harder than I'm happy to admit.
I'm getting to know an ESFP, so this will be interesting!"
1592,esfp,"It's going to be difficult at times! But if you're both open and understanding, you'll both greatly benefit from each other. I've become much more logical (less emotional) towards certain things; I take the time to think through things rationally vs overreacting due to my emotions. He's gotten a better idea of how to read situations/knowing what NOT to say to people that may come off offensive lol. 
Good luck!"
1593,esfp,"They are stubborn idealists who get carried away. I am more into getting to know someone personally than superficially or intellectually, so after a while, when they don't open up, or that they get too gung ho about something stupid, or try to take the moral high ground, or act too sensitive, I just have no interest in pursuing a friendship with them."
1594,esfp,"If I have trouble talking about my personal life, it probably means I have insecurities regarding that thing and want to protect my self image. But trust me when I say I want to talk about a lot of things that are on my mind, some of the things I might talk about though might put me into a bad mood because they leave me in a vulnerable state. One of my deepest desires though is to be able to talk openly about all my ideas and personal stuff, and connect with others in that way! But this is me personally of course, other INFXs can vary. What I can say for sure is that I love discussing deep, honest things, not superficially, because I want to truly connect to people in that way. Most of the time, the last thing I want to be is superficial."
1595,esfp,"Let's say we are new friends, how do I get you to open up about let's say a girl you've got a crush on, or some of your most transformational experiences as a person, or some life lessons or personal philosophies?"
1596,esfp,"Do most people find talking about those things easy after just meeting? Well, out of all those things, the only thing I would ever have the slightest bit of any issue openly talking about with anybody would be the crush, because my crushes change quite frequently and I generally feel a bit awkward talking about that. But other than that, the things that you listed are actually my favorite topics!"
1597,esfp,"This was a concert on my university campus, i had fun and was loud but after a while it just gets depressing when everyone else has someone to talk to. I have no friends and its been that way for 2 years (im a sophomore 20m). 
How can I figure out whats wrong with me? Im definitely not the best at conversations and slightly awkward, but Im very kind and giving (which seems to not mean shit)  and I always avoid making people feel weird or creeped out. Any old or new people i know/meet never really wanna hang out with me at all, not even talk so meeting new people never works out.
I know there is something im doing wrong, but i can't figure what exactly. Its not like I can force anyone to like me so I accept it but this shit is way too depressing.  How can I figure out whats wrong?"
1598,esfp,"That's how I felt at my first couple shows, but last time I had an hour wait and knew there had to be other lonely people so I said ""hey, you also here solo?"" and he carried a great convo and we had a great time during the show. Remember there's always someone else out there who doesn't want to be alone but is also afraid to talk to random people. It doesn't matter what they think of you, you're just gonna be together enjoying something you love for an hour or two and then probs part ways"
1599,esfp,"I'm sorry you're going through this. Sometimes, there are periods of time, when we struggle to find friends that matter to us. Is there anyone trying to be friends with you, that you are not interested in?
Usually, it's the desperation, that kills it. The only thing I've known to work, is to find hobbies, passions, and interests that I'm really invested in. That allows me to broadcast that, and find people who have similar interests, and to give me something to talk about, rather than having to wait for input from others."
1600,esfp,"You just need to feel more confident alone. I went to greece solo and made 10+ new friends there. Its not that hard if you can just chill and have fun, regardless of whether you are alone or not. Thats my take. Also, if anything, just dance the night away! It works like a charm!"
1601,esfp,"My mother-in-law is an ESFP and I have a really hard time connecting to her. To put it nicely we quite frankly drive each other nuts. I mean since we're family we do make an effort towards each other but we can't live together or things get a bit heated. 
My disconnects with her is that she can't talk about things too deeply, she's very limited in that area. It drives me crazy how spontaneous she is, I'm very much a planner so when I go on big trips with her I just want to rip out my hair because hardly anything is planned. Lastly, she cannot stand sad things, she has to have constant happiness all the time. The only movies she'll watch is fluffy comedies. While I like a lot of meaning and yes, sadness in my media. 
There are of course other things but this is just naming a few. So my questions to you guys are:
What do I need to know to understated her better?
How do you guys feel about INFJ's? Maybe there are things about me that drive her crazy that I'm not seeing."
1602,esfp,"You need to communicate. The INFJs in my life express every sad emotion and feel sooo deeply.  We love people, so if we know what makes you happy we will try to make you happy in that way, but you have to understand your way of thinking is foreign to us. For us sadness is a waste of such a short life. The world is cruel enough. We're very practical, so just be straight with us. And please don't force things on us. 
Bottom line, speak up! Share your perspective. And give her time to give 50/50. Also, you can't be everyone's best friend. It's just not possible. Don't force it, notice your differences and compromise. 
Idk if this is every ESFP but I prefer to share my deep or sad thoughts with a super close friend or not at all. I don't feel the need to express it to everyone. No one needs extra on their plate.  I also prefer to do things rather than talk about them. That's the fun in that?? "
1603,esfp,"No it really didn't, what you described is exactly how she is. When we first got to know each other I didn't really get along with her for the reasons above. I actually think we misunderstood each other, she thought I was negative and wanted to be sad all the time and I thought she was shallow and one sided. My intp husband was caught in the middle of it so for his sake I tried to understand her and it's gotten better :). I just wanted to get more perspective on this board to help a little more with it."
1604,esfp,"What are your favorite bands, genres, songs, albums, etc?
Also, I would love to hear why you like that music. (Or if you would rather just list music, that's fine too)
I personally love Fall Out Boy (I actually was in the top 1% of fans on Spotify last year, so that's cool, I guess), Marianas Trench, and Panic! At The Disco. I like these bands because I can relate to the lyrics. It also feels like they are singing what they really feel/think, instead of just what the general population may want to hear (that sort of music is fine too, but I wouldn't consider it to be my favorite). I like a lot of these bands older stuff (I prefer less autotune). I also really like music with a drum beat, preferably more on the rock side."
1605,esfp,"I want to buy a book to give to my graduating ESFP students, but I have a hard time figuring out what, exactly, appeals to them.
I asked one of them what her favorite books were and she mentioned The Kite Runner and The Fantastic Mr. Fox.  So it seems like she likes realistic stories about relationships between people (or, you know, animals haha).
The other ESFP is a male who's really into basketball/sports and has told me he wants to learn more about business and communicating with people.
Any books along these lines that you guys really enjoyed?"

1607,esfp,"In an effort to understand a friend better I'm wondering, do ESFPs keep up relationships just for the sake of ""being nice"" or avoiding confrontation?  Would an ESFP tell you if their romantic feelings changed or just move on?  This guy is still keeping up with me after 8 months of not living in the same country, we're barely talking, but when I bring up the fact he says he does want to keep me in his life.   We're just friends who had mutual feelings for each other.  It's not that complicated.  I realize some characteristics transcend type, but opinions would be appreciated. "
1608,esfp,"he's being nice, keeping up relationships is an Fi thing, even tho we're known to burn bridges easily. a lot of us wouldn't be able to tell someone if our feelings have changed... we just might insinuate it through the way we text or respond to messages. we want to keep everyone in our life, especially if we think you possess similar virtuous qualities. ESFP with an ISTJ actually has great compatibility. honestly tho, we definitely are extremely flirtatious so keep that in mind. if you're barely talking tho, he's definitely engaged in something new"
1609,esfp,"You're just probably too hard too drop, I don't see other option here. I doubt ESFP would keep that shit rollin if you were a total wreck, but just because you describe your relationships so easy going y, he's not quiting it. And since you're not mad about each other, you're not mad about each other. That's how I see it. As faggy as it sounds, sorry for my Engilsh, leul ;)"
1610,esfp,"I've recently been typed as an ESFP, to my surprise. I've always considered myself to be a strong Fe-user, and me having Fi as my second function just feels very strange. I feel like I always pay attention to the mood of a group, and then make decisions based on that. I can explain in further detail if it's necessary, but I don't want to make this post too long. 
In short, my question is: in what ways does our Fi affect us? How can we notice that we're using it in our everyday lives? I would appreciate some examples from ESFPs to see if I can relate to anything. Right now, I don't really feel connected to my Fi. "
1611,esfp,That sounds like healthy Se and Fi. You use Se to read your surrounding and Fi to act appropriately. To determine your values and then use them in a balanced way to make a positive surroundings with people or anything really. 
1612,esfp,"Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling (Fi)
""The image is one thing and the human being is another. It's very hard to live up to an image--I'll put it that way.""
--Elvis Presley, ESFP
As with all EP types, auxiliary Ji (in this case Fi) imbues the ESFP's character with a sense of personal purpose and integrity, with a conscientious concern for the well-being of others, and a sense of purpose and identity amidst the chaos of constant change and exploration. Most at home in the heat of the moment, young ESFPs may have difficulty slowing down and soul-searching long enough to show any meaningful degree of self-reflection or evaluation. When they do, they almost invariably describe a sense of heartfelt empathy with the needs and feelings of others. Development of Fi allows the ESFP's natural ability to adjust to the expectations of his audiences to be uplifted and stabilized by a personalized vision and unique understanding of the universal needs of all living creatures, spanning the physical, spiritual, and emotional. ESFPs who command Fi will know where they're coming from, where they're going, and why--the personalized ethical, spiritual, and aesthetic vision granted by the auxiliary function will remind dominant Se of the real purpose of its endless search for new experiences: personal growth and development.
It's easy to see how many ESFPs become involved in creative pursuits--and that's not limited to just the arts. Any method by which they can involve themselves directly in the creation of something that reflects the reality around them, and interacts with and affects their perceptions and the perceptions of others, will likely be viewed in a positive light. The key is finding a personalized representation (Fi) of real events occurring in real life, affecting real people in tangible ways (Se). In art, ESFPs find both an immediately stimulating sensory impression and a hint of the weightier and more important personal values by which they will eventually learn to navigate their own sense of virtue and self-evaluation. Fi should ideally lead ESFPs to hold themselves up to the light of the truth, to keep themselves grounded by an unerring sense of private moral rectitude and widespread good will toward life in general: ESFPs will tend to treat most people as good friends until given an explicit reason not to, and it's difficult for most to resist their upbeat attitudes and straightforward, earnest openness.
If developed poorly, it can be difficult for the ESFP to harness Fi in a genuinely empathetic way. He may neglect concern for the emotional and spiritual needs of others in favor of ensuring that he fills his own quota for new experiential input: more than one ESFP has justified his constant (and potentially excessive) need for high stimulation as a simple expression of his individuality, insisting that others respect his right to behave as he pleases or risk threatening his self-experience. This can and does cause a variety of arguments with the ESFP's close friends and family: Where does my right to individual freedom end, and my obligation to the needs of others begin? While it is true that ESFPs must continue engaging themselves with new experiences in order to feel fulfilled, too much emphasis on dominant Se with not enough on auxiliary Fi can result in crude, directionless hedonism. With so much new information of so many different varieties constantly entering the cognitive sphere, ESFPs (much like all EP types) must be cognizant of taking time out to analyze their experiences in depth (via Fi) in order to grant coherent meaning or value to any of them. Left to its own devices, dominant Se will explore to the ends of the Earth, but never retain the importance of the many life lessons it happens upon in the process.
When balanced properly, Fi should provide the ESFP with a sense of personal vision and deeper understanding of her mission and purpose in life. Although her externalized creations often seek to represent physical reality in her own subjective terms, they never quite match the internalized sense of aesthetic and spiritual perfection that Fi leads her to continue seeking throughout her entire life. The more Fi is able to provide subjective ideals for Se to translate into tangible representations of the ESFP's identity, the more it will strike him that he must reflect and further and refine his own sense of self, his own idea of value and hierarchy of priorities. Fi provides, above all, a personalized counterweight to Se's constant attention to the outward expectations of whoever the ESFP may find himself ""performing"" for nearly every day of his life.

1613,esfp,"ENFP here, using Fi as Auxillary as well. For me exploration is the main perceptive value, which is slightly different. However, I also pay keen attention to my surroundings and use Fi to judge how everyone feels individually. 
Sounds like healthy Fi"
1614,esfp,"I'm not even sure. I always find myself being more aware of the people around me - how they're acting, the tone of voice they're using, body language etc - which can help me come to a conclusion on whether or not they're having, primarily, a good time and gaining something positive from this experience. 
I always describe it as emotionally manipulating but also being emotionally manipulated at the same time.
Anyone else feel like this?"
1615,esfp,"That third paragraph about an underdeveloped Fi was very spot on for the person that I was a couple of years ago. I really did not have an understanding for where my right to freedom ended, and I now understand why. I like to think that I've grown a bit since then though , haha. A really interesting read, you've given me a lot of insight into my own personality! :) "
1616,esfp,"Yeah, I agree! It just feels so weird, cause all my other Fi friends are constantly voicing their opinions, always standing up for their values and letting people know when they say something incorrect. I just can't really relate to that, I mean if someone says something that goes against my core values then of course I will speak up, but if it's just something small I can't be bothered. It feels like I care more about the well-being of the group than I do about myself ""winning"" an argument, if you get what I mean. "
1617,esfp,"I saw your survey when you posted it before, but felt like finding a hex code that matched my favorite color was wayyy too much effort for an online survey. I don't think it's very ESFP-friendly, no offense :p"
1618,esfp,"I have a disgusting track record...everyone lasts a few months. I haven't ever done any sort of intentional cheating but I've definitely thought about it a few times in past/ sent suggestive text messages/ cuddled a little too much. I just get so bored. 
I was dating the apparent love of my life and a day before he messed it all up by saying something really horrible- I remember sitting with him in the kitchen baking cookies suddenly thinking 'I'm really bored of this person' even thought I was so devastated after the break up. It's getting kind of concerning, and I feel as if no one is ever going to cut it.
Those of you in long term relationships- what are the key things you've found that has made it work? What things do you look for in partners? 
That being said I've recently started seeing an ENTP and it looks pretty promising BUT I worry about the impending months and what's to come. "
1619,esfp,"I've never been in a relationship but I have been in several semi relationships, but I've never committed to any of them. If I found someone else I'd either drop them or just see them on the side. I dunno if it's an ESFP thing but I think we have a tendency to not commit. We aren't good at stability and being with the same person very long. I know I get tired of everyone eventually, as soon as I find any pattern in their behavior I start to resent it, it's like everyone is too mundane or something. Maybe I idealize people too much.
I think if it ever did work it'd have to be with someone who has qualities I wish I had in myself. That way there's room to grow. Also personality wise I go best with other ESFPs. ENTPs all get on my nerves eventually."
1620,esfp,"I think this is something we learn with time. We don't always need amusement. You need to meet that person, who when you don't talk or are doing routine. You are totally ok with that. I am not ready to commit. maybe...in 5 years? Still curious what it would be like to be with my ideal. ISFJ OR ISTJ. Where do you find male ISFJs and ISTJs (perferably a little easy on the eyes)?? lol
Also, I love ENTPs."
1621,esfp,"I had this problem too, especially when I was in high school. My track record is also disgustingly long and I can't count the amount of boyfriends I've gone through on both of my hands. I have been with my INTP boyfriend for almost a year and a half now, though. I am not sure what it is about him, but I haven't wanted a single other person since I met him. I think that we are always learning more and more about each other since we are such different people, and the constant new experiences make it hard for me to get bored of him. As cliche as it sounds, maybe you just have to give it time until the right person for you comes around :) I really do think there's someone for everybody!"
1622,esfp,Damn I'd ask the same question. I can't stay with anyone for very long. I love the game with girls but when it comes to commitment I am lame. Why is it that some of us ESFPs cannot maintain an invested relationship
1623,esfp,"Ahh thanks for your honesty- that last bit sounds a tad grim but maybe it's a personal thing. Can relate to the seeing other people bit though- I just pretty much start texting others and then I'll end a relationship with the next target in mind (this usually happens within a week- no time to grieve about anything, not that I'm ever really grieving given I'm totally over people by the time I'm done with them). It makes me feel a bit psychopathic but then I think about how much I love my friends and family and the long-lasting relationships I have with them. "
1624,esfp,"I think we can. I think part of it is who we end up with. I know for myself, I have to do new things. I think for some marriage and the word ""settle down"" means more than its suppose too. 
I don't want to stop learning or experiencing. If I can find that, I'll be just fine. I know one older esfp (51f) and she is so happy and just the sweetest and a fun person to be around. I hope I can be her when I'm her age! So yes, it's possible! "
1625,esfp,"Recent lifestyle changes and I agree with the results.  Used to believe I was ENFP for the past 2-3 years but had some friends ask out of the blue about my personality type.  Retook it and ESFP results was surprisingly accurate. 
​
Anyways as title says which types do you get along with best?  Do you guys tend to have a lot of friends?  What do they say about you?
​
​
​"
1626,esfp,"I mostly get along the best with NTJs, ISFPs, ENFPs and ESTPs
It's very easy for me to blend into a new social setting and I know a bunch of people, but I can't call many of them my true friends. People say that I'm easy to talk to, intelligent(lol it's pretentious to call yourself smart, but that's what I've been told), fun, but also headstrong and pretty secretive"
1627,esfp,Best matches for ESFPs are types that appreciate their Se & Fi and who can supply them with Te and Ni. These are NTJs. Other good matches are NFJs (value Se & supply Ni) and STJs (value Fi & supply Te) - mbti types in relationships with esfps.
1628,esfp,Very relatable. Easy to talk to and blending with social situations.  I feel like I’m able to connect with almost anyone if I tried.  I get intelligent I’ve also been told I’m cryptic but probably because I’m always talking and expressing myself. 
1629,esfp,"I have two questions, actually. It'd be great if you could give your opinion on them. 


If an ESFP responds to the question ""are you straight?"" with ""as far as I know,"" how should I interpret this?


How would you respond to a friend confessing to have feelings for you when you don't reciprocate? Would you be able to remain being friends with them? 


If it makes any difference, the ESFP in question is a girl and I (INTJ) am too. We're in college. "
1630,esfp,"

Would also answer the same way, I mean you never know for sure do you. I've fallen for some female Justin Bieber lookalikes.


This has happened and I just say I don't feel the same. I stay friends with them yeah. It's up to them if it makes them feel awkward to stay friends. I'm cool with whatever.

"
1631,esfp,"On #1, we absolutely love to give vague answers, wittingly or not. Several friends have uttered dismay about this.
On #2, assuming she is heterosexual, she probably doesn't care. I would be more concerned if you can be friends with someone you are in love with. While none of my gay friends have ""come on"" to me like that, I have perceived that some have had feelings for me, but I don't mind at all (in fact, I only get flattered). It's only natural, right?
Then again, I too am male, so YMMV."
1632,esfp,"I'm a male ESFP and the spontaneity of our responses surely explains why ""as far as I know"". We are highly emotional and extremely involved with others lives. 

For me, if a girl has expressed her emotional feelings for me, it means a lot. While I constantly have experiences with men/women at the bars/parties ending with ""you're a really cool, person. I hope we get to know each other more""...it doesn't mean anything until a female truly expresses themselves to me... followed by my full attention on the people who contact me after the bars/parties."
1633,esfp,"Female ESFP here
1: I also say the same thing. Not so much because I'm trying to be vague, but more because I don't have a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to the question yet. I've only been with my boyfriend of almost 3 years, I have nothing to compare to.
2: This has happened to me, and although it made me self conscious about whether I was being too flirty with my friend or not, it didn't change anything about our friendship until he continued to confess his feelings for me on multiple occasions (even though I was in a relationship). My initial reaction was to let him down gently and express that I loved him a lot--platonically. The 3rd time, which was a year later than the first, I told him that if he continued I would have to stop talking to him completely. I wanted to continue being friends with him but I felt it was too emotionally straining on both of us. He never confronted me with his feelings again but we have since drifted apart.
Basically, it will only ruin your friendship if you make it awkward. The ESFP is more than willing to pretend it never happened to avoid confrontation."
1634,esfp,"ESFP female here.
1. Things always change so just take 'as far as I know' as it is. It means they're straight but you just never know because ESFPs live in the now and who knows what could happen.
2. I would be able to remain friends as them, but as someone mentioned above, I wouldn't be able to be my full self. I can be a bit touchy feely and that can be misinterpreted as being intimate so I would have to act a bit cold to them.
Ps. I recently met an INTJ and I've connected with someone so well."
1635,esfp,"I'm an ESFP female, I also would answer the first question the same way. I'd want to get my answer across but keep my answer kinda light. I personally would be happy to maintain a friendship with someone who had feelings for me but for whom I did not. I would be upfront with them about only wanting friendship though."
1636,esfp,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
1637,esfp,"As an INTJ I am often severely jealous of the way ESFJs conduct themselves out there in the world! Fame follows them everywhere and charisma oozes from every pore. And every XNTX I know has SECRETLY confided to me that they feel the same envy. 
I have a question and a request. The question is: What are your gut reactions when an INTJ (or similar type) walks into the room? Give me your worst! Your honest opinion will be the key to our improvement as INTJs and you will be doing the WORLD a service!
And here is the request: I am humbling asking for a piece(s) of advice. I may never reach ESFP imminence but how can I start to become more/look more/act more AWESOME (I can also trade INTJ secrets too). "
1638,esfp,"INTJs always seem poised and put together and classy...
Honestly, I think the key is realizing that everyone is so self conscious about themselves that they really aren't judging you. Or if they are, you'll be a blip in their memory tomorrow. It's not worth worrying about how others perceive you."
1639,esfp,"Gut reaction: jealous of your attention to detail, your razor-like logic, and ability to maintain composure under stress. I don't think you should really change anything, except perhaps being a little more open to spontaneity here and there. "
1640,esfp,"Maybe relax a little and try to live in the moment.  Open up to people, but not too much, you don't want to be that weirdo that says too much about yourself.  This might be a little hard for you, but you have to be a people person! :)
I'm secretly jealous of how logical you guys are.  I'm trying to be more like that, any tips? although I don't like it when in conversation I get pushed to be more logical.  My husband is an INTJ and  that scenario happens too much in my opinion.  When he challenges me to think more logically it pushes me out of my comfort zone and I get anxious and frustrated.. I want my Ti to be higher, but it was the lowest of my cognitive functions hahaha so sad.... "
1641,esfp,"My current best friend is an INTJ and so is my close co worker. I think the things you guys do is amazing. I always have a good time as long as they have a good time. I don't ask for them to be like me, just enjoy yourselves."
1642,esfp,"I actually was an INTJ but in the course of about a year I changed to ESFP (nutcase alert, I'm probably BPD but who gives one). I don't have any advice exactly as to how I did it, but I think a lot of it comes from breakthroughs and changes to habits. I think the best way to find these is to try, and try again, until you feel natural with talking to people. Don't pressure yourself to find topics and jokes but instead take it easy, just spend more of your intellect coming up with practice for socialization. It's not a tactic. It's an art. You become better at it without pushing yourself. Hope this helps. "
1643,esfp,"I appreciate what you’re trying to say, but this isn’t about fear of judgment. 
I’m really trying not to make a big deal out of it, but it’s just that I can’t help but notice how some people seemingly have this magic or charisma or something that allows them to have fun and live in the moment. I, on the other hand, feel stiff and awkward and it feels slightly painful. It’s not about what other people think. It’s about how I feel about myself.
I appreciate my gifts, but life is more than just being poised and classy."
1644,esfp,"Wow, that advice seems very doable and makes sense. Thank you very much. 
If you would like some tips on becoming more logical, here are some observations I had when reading your post: 
Don’t be jealous of the logically-inclined. Everyone has the capacity to be logical. Logic is a muscle. That’s why your husband keeps forcing you to exercise it: he knows the more you do it the better you’ll be at it, even if it frustrates you. He knows in his own mind what a powerful and valuable tool logic is. He knows that it is just as powerful as a mastery of emotion.
Another thing is that to become more logical you can’t rush the process. Thinking logically is not just a mode of thinking, it is a way of being. And it takes time to become something new. And it’s easy: even playing chess every now and then will make you into a more logical person over time. Becoming logical is something that you should approach as something fun, beneficial, and extremely doable."
1645,esfp,"Whatever do you mean? Of course INTJs love change! It’s just that INTJs love slow, plodding change that will benefit them five or fifty years from now! ESFPs seem to like change too, but it is more spontaneous and takes full advantage of the present moment. 
The hilarious thing is that INTJs also believe ESFPs hate change. But ESFPs don’t necessarily hate change; they just prefer to focus their change on the present moment.
I am of course speaking in generalities."
1646,esfp,"At the end of the day, a personality is a limitation.  My INTJness makes it difficult/impossible for me to do certain things, which in turn lowers my experience of life.  How awesome would it be, if I could perceive each situation and wear the best possible MBTI hat to fit that situation? I mean, if I could be an INTJ while writing a computer program, and be an ESFP in a party - how awesome would that be, right?  That may not be possible, but that won't stop me from trying :-)"
1647,esfp,"Thanks for the advise.  I didn't know that playing chess would help you think more logically. I use to have a chess app on my phone and deleted it for more space, but I guess I'll be getting that app back.  
Have you had a chance to be more spontaneous?  "
1648,esfp,"A year. I don't know how I did it, other than being a bipolar nutcase who, well, picked a side.
Seriously though, I don't know what happened. Probably hit my head on a counter or something. Who knows, I might hit it again and prove einstein's theories wrong. ""If it works in the movies, it works in real life!"" - Nobody (I'd hope) "
1649,esfp,"Knock 3 birds out with 2 stones!
Study up on chess and then play with your husband :) who will probably be tearfully impressed that you've taken interest in something he's interested in (assuming he's interested in chess), but that you've also done so in the pursuit to improve your logical ability and thus your communicational ability and thus your relationship.
For a third bird, share what you learn with your son and daughters (assuming you have kids) and practice playing with them!"
1650,esfp,"Not matter my tone of voice if I asked him for anything he would see it as me attacking him. We had a baby in Jan. and I have been nonstop ever since. I haven't been getting much sleep. I havent had a day to myself. It's stressing me out. I went to the movies with friends one night after I got her to bed and that is all I have done in the past 17 months or so. All I ask is for general help. He says I need to be more specific bc he doesnt know what to do. Which I think is just an excuse bc he doesn't seem to wanna try. He just plays a game, spends time in the bathroom, and passes out early and doesnt even bother to talk to me or interact with her most days. Until Yesterday, when I started work, he hadn't even changed a diaper in over a month. Comes to me after I have already done something like give her a bath and will ask if I need help. With what? He doesn't pay any attention to anything and gets upset that I consider everything. Someone has to! I need a moment to think and he doesn't give me any relief. When I was working nights and he was working days, on weekends AI would pick up the slack. Since we were doing equal parts. I dunno what happened to working on this together. But it's killing me bc I cant talk to him. All I have been doing is trying to approach him with a better understanding of my personality and his. I know how bad it can get and I am trying to prevent us from fighting. And he doesn't care about that stuff. I'm trying to be a better person and consider all options and he wont even consider my feelings. I'm so close to saying fuck it. Am I asking too much. And how can I relax when I literally cant relax!"
1651,esfp,"If he really is SF then he's a progressive conservative in good times
and revolutionary communist in really really bad times. He appreciates
freedom and exploration in small doses, or when other people do it in
a safely contained environment. He does what he knows how to do which
he knows works. Unlike RWAs he'll quickly abandon anything that
doesn't work or is destructive, and be much quicker at adopting new
things once they're proven to work.
So, assuming he is definitely PC then the reason he hasn't been
helping is because he doesn't know how to do it, and the reason he
didn't try new things is because it might lead to disaster, and the
reason he didn't approach you to help while you were busy is because
it might lead to disaster, and the reason he didn't adopt a framework
(babycare) which is revolutionary to him is because he simply didn't
have any theories or intellectual framework to understand it with. He
never saw it done, he didn't participate in it, he didn't read any
books on it, and he didn't attend any classes.
As an SF type he should be supportive and helpful ... when he knows
what to do. Expect him to flounder when he doesn't. You need to
supervise and micromnaage him, and clearly articulate standards, and
not expect much initiative until he's got a solid grasp on a subject.
SFs like solidity. Don't ever expect him to read your mind and don't
ever expect him to smoothly grasp an entirely new situation."
1652,esfp,"I'm and Infj with a ESFP. You really have to be independent and stand on your own two feet. I don't have any children with him, but basically they want you to accept them for who they are, not what you would like them to be. And allow them to have their faults. You really have to know yourself, and be self-reliant and he has to be able to do the same. They don't like nagging, bitching, complaining, and want a peaceful environment. They like time to themselves, but also like being with friends at time. They don't like being pushed into anything. So, basically what you need to do is be strong enough to do things on your own, and ask other people to help you. Be straight and honest about your feelings. Don't play mind games. Don't lie. If they feel you're not being honest and direct they pull away. And you'll have a heck of a time getting on their good side if you betray them. You really have to have a gentle spirit with them, and be a man whisperer. Know his language and accept his differences. We hardly ever fight, because I understand where i begin and where he ends. You treat him like a king, he'll do anything for you. It sounds like you're just not approaching him the right way. You have to be very positive and loving towards him. Focus on the good in him, compliment him, tell him how much you appreciate him etc. When you respect him as a man, he will do the same in return."
1653,esfp,"He told me, a few days ago, that there is an event in his game and he wont be doing much for the next week. I wish I could say ""hey, I'm gonna sit around on my ass and ignore you and the baby for 7 days. I will go and come as I please and spend what I want and leave everything up to you. See ya next week! 
He did this to me once and I had no idea what was going on. All I see is him not doing anything and not engaging with me or her. And it broke me bc I was going through some stressful family stuff and needed to tell him what happened. He didn't bother to give me any feedback other than ""That sucks."" I am always game for whatever it is he wants to do. Bc I wanna understand him better. As an INFJ I cant help but to give all of me to the people I love. And is it so wrong to want that in return? I have things I need to do. I cant do them if I have no help. 
I want to become a writer, I dont see myelf getting the time to sit and write. He thinks I do too much. And I agreed with him, I do take on too much only because he lacks initiative. i dont believe in having to make decisions for him. Then he went on to say that he just lets her play alone and he is able to do the things he wants. And that it seems like i'm always doing something with her. I suppose he means ike going to the park and spending a day (not just 15 minutes), reading to her, making sure she has a set schedule and a bedtime. He rather her just fall asleep on the floor when she gets tired. He has no organizational skills. And doesnt seem to be interested in learning fromm me like I am learning from him. I dont see how letting our kid do whatever she wanted, waiting until she is crying bloody murder before giving her food, or putting her to sleep. He just waits until she cries. And I should let him do it? I shouldnt have to say hey you shouldnt do that, its unhealthy for her. He admits to not knowing anything about childern....and I do! why cant i give you advice. If you are doing something the wrong way when there is a better way. why wouldnt i pass along this info. And I am suppose to let it go and let him do his thing? He has no thing! Winging it with a newborn is not a thing!
He gets so angry when I bring anything up. We once could talk about anything that bothered the other person. and we listened to each other. now he wants to close up shop. I can easily count my losses and move on. But I'm not doing that this time I wanna know what is going on in his head. He thinks that he is just a guy and doesnt realize anything about his personality type. And doesnt care to understand mine.
A few days ago I had to take a drug test at a clinic for a job I wanted. And was nervous not to fuck it up since I had 48 hours and a crap ton of errands and a doctor's appt to get to the next day. So I woke him up (he always passes put too early) and asked him where exactly the place was and how do drug tests work. I have never taken one before so I was worried. He kinda snapped at me bc he thought I was being mean to him! I didnt understand it. I told him i'm just really nervous about the process. 
I'm the kinda person who is always concerned about looking dishonest and wanted to get it done as soon as I could In the middle of an already busy day. The next morning I started to apologize. Told him that I didnt mean to sound rude I was just trying to get my plans lined up and make sure I could squeeze it in. He cut me off and in an aggressive way told me to forget it and that he didn't want to hear it. I didn't understand that either. 
When I told him today that we need to start communicating better started a whole new mess of crap. And we cant outright fight because we both get so closed off. I am 28 in three days. I have no more time to waste when it comes to the career and life I want. I want to develop. I am trying to tap into my genius. I know what I need to do to be successful. I want to have a peace of mind and not have to worry so much. I hate that I have to rely on another person for help. I am learning to voice my concerns even though it's being met with lack of interest. I just want us to get along. I hope that made sense for any of you. What do you think? how should I approach this situation? (sorry for the typos. i don't think I'm going to edit any of this. I'm mentally exhausted now)"
1654,esfp,Yeah we never fight either. We usually just say our piece and get over it. I was having a tough week then. Got a bit of shocking news and was feeling vulnerable. It has been the only time I felt there was an issue. I think we do well learning from one another.
1655,esfp,"Yes and now it's time for you to think about yourself in the equation
that is your marriage.
As an INF you think and act fluidly, and you seek equality. You wanted
an equal repartition of baby care and definitely an equal repartition
of the pain and suffering involved. Like water flowing downhill until
its level equalizes. And you wanted ambivalence, an equal distribution
of all life's experiences, bad or good, for each of you. Like water
supporting fish at every level, or like rainbows showing every color.
As an INF you looked at the baby situation and sensed what was
necessary. And you expected that if you dragged your husband to see
and hear and feel the same things you do, be in the same location you
are, then his reason would lead him to the same conclusions yours
does. You expected common senses (shared senses) to lead to shared
reason by way of pure reason.
As an INF your methods of controlling others, from the inside, are
both ineffective and extremely corrosive and maybe even destructive to
SFs. And vice versa. When you control his external actions by telling
him directly what to do, that's par for the course for him and he
won't bat an eyelash even though it would drive you to bug the fuck
out if someone did it to you.
But if you resort to trying to change him from the inside, he will
experience this as brainwashing. Because where you are strong, he is
weak, and where you are weak, he is strong. So when you try to control
him the INF way, in a way that respects what you believe his strengths
to be, you're really punching your fist through his stomach and
pulling his intestines.
He believes that controlling people from the outside where they're
constantly on the watch out anyways is useful but limited, and
controlling them from inside (eg, using guilt and insecurities) is
vile as it bypasses all of their defenses and all that he cares about.
You believe that controlling people from the inside where they're
constantly on the watch out anyways is useful but limited, and
controlling them from outside (eg, using laws and third parties) is
vile as it bypasses all of your defenses and all that you care about.
His outsides are strong and no amount of rough manhandling on your
part will make him do what he doesn't want to do. His insides are weak
and squishy.
As an INF you can surmount these obstacles by changing yourself.
Dealing with another INF might be easier but knowing HOW to deal with
people very different from yourself will give you more freedom in
life. Your non-INF husband also can do things that you cannot, that
you will never be able to do. And vice versa.
You should not expect your husband to change himself, because he's not
INF. And you should not try to change him. Because he's not INF. But
changing his actions in exchange for you changing your expectations
and beliefs? That's a fair trade. (Or in SF terms, it's you
collaborating to reduce each other's unhappiness and make each other
happy.)
You may want to show him my advice, it's only fair. And you won't be
equal if you keep knowledge and advisors secret to use against each
other.
Finally, as you're going to be raising a child soon, look into Taking
Children Seriously since it's the best INF way of doing so. Even if it
teaches you nothing at all, especially if it teaches you nothing at
all, it will teach your husband what you expect."
1656,esfp,"Holy shit. This doesn't sound like an ESFP problem, it sounds like a my-boyfriend-is-actually-a-manchild problem. Seriously, this guy does literally nothing, has no responsibilities, and is selfish beyond measure. I can tell because I used to be that same way. It took a lot of growing up, a slap in the face, and some serious time alone on my part to realize what exactly I was letting slip by me, all because I'd rather do nothing. 
Fuck, maybe this is an ESFP problem. Or an extreme one, at least. I know some ESFPs who aren't like this at all. But that's besides the point.
What would I recommend? Have a sit-down, heart-to-heart, family meeting. Schedule it a couple days in advance, like after dinner in the middle of the week one day so he knows and doesn't pull some ""I'm doing something on my game today"" bullshit. Tell him exactly how you feel. How it isn't fair, and this relationship isn't healthy the way it is. Tell him you love him, but you don't see that he loves you back. Otherwise, he wouldn't be acting like this.
There is no excuse for this kind of behavior. You can't let him guilt trip you at all, either. No pulling the ""depression card"" (trust me, I've been there.). There's going to be a lot of tension, emotions, and pain for a while after that. But, if he does actually decide to make a change for you, if he decides that you're something he actually wants, and a family is something he wants to put effort in to, he'll do it. He'll make it better. 
If there's anything ESFPs are at least halfway decent at, it's protecting and loving the things we truly care about. It might take us a while to realize just what that thing is, or just how much it means to us. Shit, it may even take some time without that thing for us to realize what we're missing, but once we do, we will do absolutely everything in our power to get that thing or person back. To make it right, to love them wholeheartedly and strive to make their lives as easy and painless as possible. 
Humans only sacrifice for things we care about, and that goes double for ESFPs. We're a passionate bunch; we love fast and hard. Sometimes we stumble, forget, and get in the way of ourselves. We think we're above the thing or person we used to care so much about. It takes a major reality check to bring us back up or down. 
ESFPs have amplified symptoms of the human condition, which is both a blessing and a curse. The only thing you can do for him is tell him how you're feeling, and hope he snaps back to his reality. That's all any of us can hope for."
1657,esfp,"Sorry, I haven't been on Reddit in some time. So, let me be clear... Not interested in changing my boyfriend. Been there with another, we hate each other. Never again. I enjoy him as he is. After ranting on the internet about half my problem. I found out that he had been ignoring our child and I because of a video game. I was going through a pretty rough time. He was too consumed to even realize what I had been telling him. I came to the internet...I ranted, collected my feelings and talked to my boyfriend. Thank you for you response. But it's just not the case. I do not use tactics with him. He told me to just say what I need, I do and he agrees to it or doesn't, whatever the case maybe. The man is turning 30, I can't change him. Wouldn't even try. This original posting went from me wanting to legitimately wanting to know how to talk to an ESFP to a full blown rant about baby duty. The other half to this problem was the real problem. And it had nothing to do with him. He just wasn't there for me after I got heavy news. So after telling him my news and later asking for help so I could introvert didn't bode well for him. He wasn't available to me in a time of situational depression. When all I needed was time to think and bring myself out of my funk. Was trying to prevent an issue by getting my most petty feelings out of the way I guess. I was affected by my issue in more ways than one. Thanks. "
1658,esfp,Well. I have started venting my frustration in a way he can understand. I just need to be honest and not so afraid of my feelings being rejected. I know he is a doer when he is involved and not a talker. He can make me feel better as long as I just say what it is instead of being cryptic. He is starting to understand me ion his own way. And I am fine with it. =)
1659,esfp,"Lol. 
Also I will watch SouthPaw as soon as I can! I fell in love with Gyllenhaal after watching Priosners and Nightcrawler. He is a great at getting into a character right down to the strange quirks of his characters! "
1660,esfp,"Hey all!! I am an ENFP, and have a really good ESFP friend. Lately, she’s been acting really distant and just giving off a really sad vibe. She occasionally has these spells, but this has been the longest one so far. It started right after dinner the other night when we had a great conversation with another friend. As soon as we left, she came across like she was almost upset with me even though I did nothing. I asked her about it and she said nothing was wrong. She’s been like this before, but it was when she felt anxious in a crowded environment and she directed her discomfort towards me because she knew I could take it. The difference is that there she immediately apologized afterwards and explained what happened. 
Any tips or just general insight as to what she’s going through?"
1661,esfp,"I love everyone, but the people that I ""click"" with are S's and P's, especially if they're both. I find it difficult to get along with people who are strongly opinionated without any open-mindedness. 
Seems ISTP's are a big weakness for me. I've dated 2 of them and had crushes on a few as well."
1662,esfp,"Pretty much anyone, too. Yay for typical ESFPs approachableness!
But I always click with xSTPs immediately - like, always ESTPs for sure.
I generally also get on very well with xNFPs and xNTPs. 
One of my good friends is also ENTJ, although she scares me a little sometimes, haha. 
Also, despite our ""approachableness"", does anyone get kinda bored of small talk?"
1663,esfp,"Can anyone explain to me in Jungian terms (or really any terms) why ESFPs tend to be so good at being socially popular? I read once that this type tends to ""win"" in social situations and I find this to be generally true. 
ESFPs tend to be stereotyped as being the class clown or like the pop star, but there are other less flashy, notable ESFPs who just know how to work a room. The politicians like Bill Clinton or Chris Christie are two examples. 
Is this a function of Extraverted Sensing? Given that they intuitively know what people in a group are looking for, so to speak, some ESFP's I've met seem to have a sort of version of Extraverted Feeling. "
1664,esfp,"I can only speak from personal experience. I feed off of the energy in a room and am pretty aware of the vibe and the roles everyone is playing in any particular crowd. Because I can get caught up in a bad vibe as well as a good one, I gravitate towards whoever has the best energy and then bring people into it ! It pumps me up and inspires me to try to include everyone in that bubble of happiness. lol. 
I also LOVE people. I love getting to know them and the feeling of breaking through social carriers with them. 
I can admit, however, that I won't stay for too long after I feel satisfied with the conversation. 
Also, being as adventurous as I am, I always have a good story to tell. 
I hope that answers some of it. I feel like I ranted a little. "
1665,esfp,"I would actually disagree with this to an extent. A lot of the people most assume to be ESFP aren't ESFP. The two most common types that are likely to be mistaken for ESFP are ENFJ and ESFJ, both of which have dominant Fe a focus on group harmony, which results in being either more adaptable to fit the group dynamic, or by being more capable of influencing the group dynamic to suit yourself.
I wouldn't say that ESFPs are popular per se. Some are very much so, others not at all. ESFPs value Fi, hence are individualistic, and are only willing do to so much to adapt to the social situation. However, they are an ethical type, and they lead with dominant Se, which enables you to perceive the world through opportunities, being aware of the environment, giving you a heads up to adapting. The popular ones are popular because they are fun and fearless. Also, if they have a more 'cheerful' Enneagram type, paired with dominant or auxiliary social instinct, they will be more likely to be popular than an ESFP Enneagram 6, with a 4 fix, that is sx/sp or sp/sx, which will stick out like a sore thumb, may attract a more cult following, but definitely fails at social."
1666,esfp,"It's easy for me to tell the moods of everyone around me and I'm confident, which attracts people. Another thing is having the right words to say, which I attribute to Fi and Te, I find it easy to talk to people in their own language so to say. Instead of trying to bring everyone into my own world I use phrases and examples that they can understand and relate to. Also the general awareness of my surroundings, I can notice something that's happening that will interest everyone and generally check on people in my group to see that everyone is good"
1667,esfp,"I would say I am too fickle and selfish with attention to be any other type. Although it's exciting and I like to inspire, I also know I'll become disinterested and move on once I get to know them. 
Buuut, im new to this stuff. There's an awesome group chat that might help. It's in WhatsApp. Want me to see if I can send you the link to join ?"
1668,esfp,"I relate to a lot of things about ESFP, but this is definitely not one of them lmao. For me, it’s more HOLY CRAP A BUNCH OF PEOPLE I WANNA GO TALK TO THEM XDDDD, then I go and most likely make a fool out of myself, or they laugh, who knows. But I definitely don’t “intuitively read the room,” in fact quite the opposite. I just go off and be myself, and if I get rejected, shiieeeett, if I don’t, noiicceeee. lol 
I also suck with social cues, it’s not that I don’t see them, it’s because I feel like “ONE DIRTY LOOK AIN’T GONNA SHUT ME DOWN ECKSDEE” and I keep going. Bites me in the ass a lot tbh but I’m working on that"
1669,esfp,"In my experience I genuinely enjoy meeting new people. I'm excited to hear their story and tell them mine. I always welcome new friends and opportunities to be social. I'm also goofy, energetic, and always looking for something fun to do.
I've been told I come off as approachable for this reason.
I tend to make friends (and boyfriends) easily."
1670,esfp,"Se/Fi
the Se gives the here now thing (as we all know), and this generally works the best in average sensor-based social situations (which, if we run the numbers, are far more common than intuitive-based interactions), and the Fi auxiliary tends to give the user a greater sense of empathy, so what i assume is happening is that here in the conversation right now, the esfps are easily able to connect with many persons' emotions in encountering everyday problems. this (for some reason, i personally cannot fathom why this is), tends to be a really attractive personality for this reason.
also, the Fi makes their social interactions a lot less assholey than estps, making interactions benign enough for the more sensitive types to be comfortable dealing with."
1671,esfp,"How much of what you read about people is driven by their appearance? I could be wrong but this seems like it comes into play more with Se-users. 
Thanks for the reply, feel free to elaborate even more:)"
1672,esfp,"This sounds really Fe to me. I don't love people at all, only people close to me and I don't want to include everyone in my happiness either, I've always hated doing what everyone else does and if people start copying me I'll get annoyed and start doing something else specifically to not be like them. I might be wrong of course, but I feel like you're an ESFJ(like more than half the people on this sub really)"
1673,esfp,"I am like this too. I feel like I can really have short and sweet social interactions too. I love the deeper stuff, but I tend to also not keep it going for the hell of it.
​
Especially when people ask how a holiday or something was. I went away for a month and summed it up in a 2 minute recount, where my sister can talk about a 2 minute encounter for 15 minutes (she is not ESFP)."
1674,esfp,"Nah, I'm good bro. Well, ESFJs like attention too and can definitely be selfish. Btw you should press ""reply"" if you want to respond to someone's comment, otherwise they don't get the notification and might not see your reply"
1675,esfp,"Looking back a recent experiences, it seems to be the most open people (body language) and larger crowds. 
For example, I went to a restaurant by myself and made friends with a table of 6. The person that stood out to me was a guy who was almost reclining back on his chair, arms open, one holding the chair next to him. His legs were relaxed as well. He seemed confident and ""open"". 
His friends were chatting, laughing and making more noise than the rest of the tables so when I came up to start conversation, I made eye contact with him first and then started to include the rest of the table. 
After I was able to have conversation with the table, I brought it back to the sushi chefs and, eventually to surrounding tables. It would have been really awkward to start a conversation if he wasn't there. "
1676,esfp,"I was also thinking Fe-dom, though ENFJs are as likely mistyped as ESFPs as ESFJs. They share their perceiving axis, and use their Se too. Betas (ESTP, ENFJ, ISTP, INFJ) are also more focused on social power dynamics."
1677,esfp,"Hahahah. You get me ! It's so weird. I've had to be very mindful and proactive to keep any relationships longer than 4 months. I get so excited so easily I'll be on the the next thing without blinking. 
Since I've intentionally made sure to keep friends, it's been really cool, bit it does take effort on my part. 
I can do the same with encounters. Lol. But if im entertaining a crowd, I'll be detailed and dramatic with my body language."
1678,esfp,"Develop an interest in the people you talk to.
Ask questions, when they tell you stories about their life compliment their wins, empathize with their losses. 
A big development for me was when I started reaching out to my favorite friends to hang out instead of waiting for someone to ask me. If I feel like I want to be social I'll go through my list of friends one by one and ask if they're busy. Don't be afraid of rejection, people are busy there is a decent chance that no one is available but they appreciate that you thought of them and are complimented that you want to spend more time with them.
If no one can come out and I really feel like I need to be around people I'll go to bar or cafe and just be there, around strangers until I feel satisfied. Sometimes I'll have a nice conversation with a stranger, sometimes I won't. If you want people to talk to you be approachable. Smile if you make eye contact, greet people near you, and it helps to be cute and well-groomed."
1679,esfp,"Haha awesome! I feel that thing with relationships too. I have a one year long bf now and it was vveeeeerryyyyy against my natural state of how I have relationships for me to stick around once the excitement wore down a bit. 
Very interesting. "
1680,esfp,"Are you sure you're not confusing Ne with Ni? I dunno, you just feel like an ENFP. ENFPs are drawn to people, but aren't as suave as Se users, I think. Reading other people's emotions and the vibe of a given place is very typical of ESFPs. Social cues even more so, if someone gives me a dirty look I'll 100% notice it and will hold a grudge against that person"
1681,esfp,"Yes, I don't mean to offend, but they know within a group who's more popular and who's less accepted and kind of ""go with"" the public opinion in that space. They also seem to pick up on the unspoken physical standards in the group - how people dress, language used, what the group values. In that sense, they seem like Fe-doms but less focused on changing the emotional tone of the group in the same way ESFJ's and ENFJ's are. I wish I had a better way of explaining it. It's similar to Fe but different because it's funneled through Fi."
1682,esfp,"Well, I’m definitely not “as suave,” that’s for sure. And I definitely don’t hold a grudge against people giving me a dirty look, they’re cool, and I don’t blame them lol, but I won’t let it stop me from being myself. The reading other people’s emotions and the vibe sounds more like Fe if anything, and even then I don’t really relate to that, as I said with me sucking with social cues lmaoo. 
But I don’t think my cognition is Ne, I’m not absorbed into abstract possibilities and I pay attention to what is instead of what if, I don’t display any intuition whatsoever, and I’m more practical than idealistic. The suave Se thing is a stereotype. If I have to fit into all the stereotypes, nothing will fit."
1683,esfp,"I mean as someone that talks to PuttingItAllOutThere quite frequently, she definitely seems like an ESFP to me. However, regardless of that I don't think she should be forced to justify herself. Typing is a personal thing, and it's not very productive to spend tons of time arguing about random people's types.
I also don't see why you're being downvoted, Putting."
1684,esfp,"1) your judgements could be wrong and you are not an ESFP yourself 2) who was forcing anyone to justify themselves? I gave my perspective, she can do whatever she likes with it and I haven't seen her complain about it 3) who is spending lots of time on this and why are you deciding what's productive for other people?"
1685,esfp,"My judgements could be wrong, but what matters is what she types herself as. No one was forcing her to do everything, but people can sometimes feel backed into a corner and like they have to justify themselves.
""  I haven't seen her complain about it  "" - some people don't feel comfortable doing so.
The tons of time comment was a general blanket statement. 
I was defending a friend who was being downvoted for no reason. And now it looks like someone has also downvoted my comment as well. 
Have a nice day :)"
1686,esfp,"Any personality type is probably capable of cheating under the right circumstances, and ESFPs have a reputation for being the flirtiest type, but I feel like they are relatively unlikely to cheat for a few reasons:

They would not stay in a relationship that makes them unhappy enough to cheat. They’re more likely to cut ties first. 
They don’t have the patience it would take to try to cover up their infidelity. This would require a lot of strategic maneuvering/planning that they’re not interested in. 
Because introverted feeling is such a major part of their being, they wouldn’t be comfortable with the “fakery” that would be infidelity. In other words, they need to be themselves so wholeheartedly that they couldn’t bring themselves to either stay in an unhappy relationship nor sleep with someone else while being in a relationship. 

Of course, there’s the possibility that an ESFP’s impulsivity wins out, and they do actually sleep with someone but soon after regret it and realize how much they love the partner they’re with. Has anyone ever been in this situation? Some people need to test boundaries and experience something before they can understand it, and I think ESFPs are definitely that type. 
Also, what about sleeping with an ex? It seems like introverted feeling would stop them there as well. Obviously, you broke up for a reason, and introverted feeling tends to like emotional closure to a point where you wouldn’t have any interest in reopening that door. 
Anyone have any experience with any of this?"
1687,esfp,"Like the other poster here, I put off dating for ages. It felt futile. Either I get close enough about the person to kind of be forced into monogamy and miss out, or I end up just amusing myself for a bit until it gets too serious.
​
I am in a relationship now, and I addressed the monogamy thing with him and how much I was struggling with it (I was contemplating cheating), but it felt so dishonest and unfair I couldn't premeditate it. So the only times I am considering it is when I could potentially slip up in the moment.
​
Interesting what you said about our need to be ourselves wholeheartedly in our relationships. After having the convo with my bf, I felt instantly 10x better having just spoke about it that the urge went away. I think we hate being told we can't do anything and need to make out own decisions. We need to know we have the freedom to act in a moment, rather than try and figure out some plan about that moment.
​
But no to the ex as well. I think we don't like ambiguity and repeating our mistakes too much to do that most of the time. Unless it was an in-the-moment thing.
​"
1688,esfp,"My boyfriend is an ESFP.
He has cheated on his previous partners, but not on me. (As far as I know. But I have no reason to believe that he has.)
His reason for cheating was that he was unhappy, and his relationship was incredibly unstable. He would get drunk and his impulsivity got the best of him."
1689,esfp,"i studied in 4 different high schools (long story) and loved all of them except one (only went there for 2 weeks so no fond memories, don't hate it but don't love it). All the others were great. I was known as the captain of the school cricket team in one, super nerd math whiz in another (that was the American high school), and a shy introverted geek in the third (school was full of morons, I kept to myself and had 1 friend only). I enjoyed all three for different reasons but my favorite was MEIS where I got to be captain of school team and got rep as a cool friendly guy who knew everybody, those were some of the best days of my life."
1690,esfp,"In high school ATM. xSFP. 
I am fond of saying controversial things, and often I say bizarre things out loud without realizing I'm talking.
That being said, no one hates me or anything. I don't have one fixed group of friends, I just talk to everyone, yet I make zero efforts to communicate with anyone outside of school hours. "
1691,esfp,"I'm in High school right now (16). It is Ok could be better. I am very tenacious out going and genuinely nice. I have a lot of friends, then there's my best friends which is 6 people. I am pretty smart,some people assume I'm dumb because I act goofy and dumb with my friends. My teachers love me because I'm always participating and am doing well and am not dumb. I also get told that I am unique and eccentric which I agree with. I either get along with people perfectly or I clash with people like an explosion. When I do it's really intense and cringey."
1692,esfp,"Unpopular but only because I was too cool for school. Hung out with all the rebellious ""badasses"" who ditched and smoked weed. Lost touch with basically everyone save for Facebook. But damned if I wasn't super hot. Now I'm trying to get back into high school shape."
1693,esfp,I was chill. High most of the time and just there to be happy have a good time and learn some shit. The teachers liked me. I am an ESFP who learned to chill in the background and not get in trouble for stupid shit. Which allowed me to do what I wanted. 
1694,esfp,Male here. I was student body president every year in HS. I was highly involved in just about everything. I was a football player and a member of student council. I played/singed in every talent show and competed for prom king every year as well. 
1695,esfp,"I don't want to in any way offend you, I just wanted to state that I read that some ESFPs have a predisposition for Bipolar disorder, so if your friend is moody a lot, it may be worthwhile to check out the symptoms and make sure he's okay. It may be stupid, he probablly doesn't, but when I find information that can help someone I'd rather have said something than not have. :)"
1696,esfp,"I changed a lot during high school, I was super introverted and this is no longer the case. I didn't ""evolve"" per se but you know, people change. 
I originally did the test over 5 years ago, and redid it just a year ago, I think ~5 years is enough for people to change, especially when we're still relatively young. 
I stood in high school because I kept telling myself I was close to the end, and that this diploma at the end was worth the effort in just finishing a single year. 
I dropped out of school right after tho, but I'm still glad I went through and finished high school."
1697,esfp,"What he's saying is, you were never an INTP. You were an ESFP that was probably shy, perhaps overestimated your Ti or the test you took didn't have the best questions to evoke the proper response out of your type. Something like that.
People can change, but in the system that is MBTI, it is, as far as I know, impossible to change the neurological underpinnings of what makes you tick in such a way as we're discussing. "
1698,esfp,"The amount of assumptions they make drive me crazy, I've been talking with a few on their threads and their main point is that they feel misunderstood and like ESFPs don't listen well enough. 
This sounds like a load of shit to me. 
The ones I know IRL are frankly just boring people. Talk about nerdy things. Don't really do much. Almost impossible to drag them along for a ride without them wanting to know the plan for every 5 min. 
How do y'all connect with Ni-doms? 
Why do you think they think they're so misunderstood?
I would argue ESFPs are way more misunderstood especially in MBTI. IRL too, people assume we're dumb because we're happy. Or that we don't care about the future because we choose to capitalize in the moment. Or that we don't value our lives because we aren't philosophical. These things have all been false in my experience and the other ESFPs I know. The opposite seems to be true in fact. "
1699,esfp,"lol of my friends use Ni (dom and aux), so I often get jokes about how I’m stupid. But when it comes to figuring out how to do something, they are all lost without me. Just last week, the endless possibilities of how to make ice cream cake baffled them. Silly Ni doms and auxes. Still love you tho."
1700,esfp,"ENTJ here--not sure why you keep spending time with people you think are boring. If someone has interests that are really different from yours, you might just be incompatible as friends.
On the planning thing, maybe try meeting them halfway? You might not give them a full itinerary of the day, but even something as vague as ""around 4 or 5 we'll get dinner"" might go along way. Like bullet points.
In my personal opinion, the reason many immature Ni doms think of themselves as misunderstood is because they think it is other people's responsibility to understand them rather than their responsibility to make themselves understood. They also tend to be paranoid and therefore are often indirect and vague in their communication rather than direct. I think many harbor a secret fantasy where someone (probably an ENFP) finds them sooooo mysterious and alluring that they obsess over figuring the INXJ out.
I say this all as an Ni-aux: Ni sucks. At least it ain't Ne tho. "
1701,esfp,"Yeah we rock, I know that. I just wish we had more respect ya know. That's one of the reasons I'm joining the Air Force, so people have to respect me. (Plus 30 days vaca and free flights anywhere in the world) "
1702,esfp,"INFJ here, Ni dominant, I’m really good friends with 3 ESFPs, that’s a lot compared to other INFJs. I guess I’m drawn to them for some reason. Yeah, it could be difficult having a conversation with each other, but if you have a commonality for something to talk about, it is much easer like you said. As an INFJ I can be emotionally deep with some of them, the assertive ESFP can follow through. I Guess having both a feeling function as our auxiliary helps, but I can’t stay there for too long because that would be too intuitive for an ESFP to handle, so I have to have some fun too, and I’ve learned how to be a bit more crazy with them and I do really have a great time with you all. Y’all give out this great positive vibe that everyone is drawn to and are very funny, crazy, and great especially you assertive ones. But don’t lie, all of you are terrible at lying and INFJs are great at detecting lies and really disliking lies too, even though we may not point them out. Don’t, it makes us upset and we want to trust all of you desperately. If you do lie too much, we may shut you out of our lives."
1703,esfp,"Thanks for the reply,
I don't really spend that much time with them, but I am very interested in them. I know they have a lot going on in the noggin and I want to see what it's all about. 
Haha i don't even mind planning and I'm more than happy to make a plan for key aspects like departure time, ETA, etc. I just feel like when making plans there's ALWAYS another question they have before they are comfortable saying yes. 
Side note, how do you feel ENTJs use their Se? Kinda pissed y'all get the really cool ""I'm the capable boss"" stereotype and we get ""fun"". I get along with ENTJs a lot, work with them a lot, and we have tons in common usually. I even thought I might be one, if the adventurer in me wasn't so apparent. I wish we could be seen as capable like you, after all I feel like Te and Se are the most ""doer"" functions. We both get shit done, just different shit. "
1704,esfp,"I think with INxJs you kind of have to build trust over time. If they realize that they can trust you (this will take a stupidly long time) you might be able to get them to a point where you can say, ""Look at our track record, we always have fun--maybe this time we can leave a few things in the air.""
On the Se thing, I can't speak for other ENTJs because I don't really know them, but I feel like my life has gotten a lot better since I've turned down my Ni and turned up my Se. I've heard it said that the tertiary function is the ""escapism"" function and that is very true for me. I like going out dancing as stress-relief and when I was younger I used to have very non-ENTJ ideas about nature (personified a lot of landmarks). If you put me next to the ocean I basically turn into an ISFP because I just want to lie down in the surf and listen to Florence & The Machine.
I really feel like an atypical ENTJ because I'm generally disinterested in power for its own sake. I often do end up in positions of authority, but that's because I have an objective/initiative which requires other people to accomplish and so I start delegating. And this only happens when I've established myself as skilled and capable; I don't try to overreach my knowledge and put myself into authority positions until I'm confident I can handle it. That's just at work though, in my personal life all my hobbies are single-player. Personally I think ESFPs are just as capable of being good bosses as ENTJs. "
1705,esfp,"I agree with the escapism thing. I make tons of plans when I need a break from doing stuff. And usually don't even execute any of them. Like I'll plan a vacation I can't afford to take for example. Or like play strategy video games. 
Haha I love going out with ENTJs, we push each other to have a good time. Although I have been ditched in the club a few times by ENTJs, but oh well "
1706,esfp,"Haha, I never ditch friends in clubs (but also I'm a girl and ditching other girls in the club is comparable to throwing a raw steak into a hyena pit). I think it's really cool that you make plans as escapism! I've been planning a vacation recently, though it's one I actually intend to take--planning fun stuff if I feel like I won't be able to do it just makes me sad. But when I do know it's going to happen I LOVE doing it.
I think the pushing-each-other-to-have-a-good-time thing is probably accurate too, though I've never gone out with an ESFP--most of my friends are introverts. I feel like one of the greatest things I offer as a friend to introverts is my willingness to be the ""stupid"" one--In the club, for example, I have no problem dancing on a table, throwing my bra across the dance floor, and slinging a feather boa around random people. Because of this, my introverted friends feel like they can be semi-ridiculous and no one will stare at them because I'm already taking all the judgment! I think going out with an ESFP might be kind of dangerous though because where would the one-upmanship end?"
1707,esfp,"Hahaha the one-upmanship usually ends after we both black out 😂🤷🏻‍♂️ 
Or the entj barfs and needs to take a breather. I'll barf and then go for more booze to restock my stomach. 
I think ENTJs give slightly more of a fuck, but still both of us don't give much of a fuck when we're out. "
1708,esfp,"Yeah, I don't care about what I do around strangers (as long as I don't get arrested/get banned/go viral online). I definitely do care about what impression I make around people I see regularly, though!
This conversation is making me wish I had more ESFP friends haha."

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
1711,esfp,"I am an INFP but my mom types ESFP.  I really want to improve my relationship with her because we clash constantly and it's exhausting.  She is very highly-strung, gets angry easily and lashes out verbally and physically.  Then she'll turn around and expect me to give her a big hug and listen to her tell me all about her day, which frankly I'm not interested in after I've just been screamed at.  I just don't know how to handle it.  We disagree on anything and everything - my career choices, my social life, religious and political issues.  Even when I want to agree with her she presents her arguments in such a harsh and unbalanced way that I resent her for it.  How can we reconcile our personality differences?"
1712,esfp,"I hope someone on here can help you out. These issues don't sound particularly related to her MBTI type to me though. She sounds like a bit of a narcissist, although I could be way off base. If you think it's possibly the case, I know there is a sub for kids with narcissistic parents. Again, I hope I'm wrong and someone can help you out through an ESFP lens!  "
1713,esfp,Wow that sounds complex. If i were you I'd get her in a good mood just tell her what you think. Say you want to preserve a good healthy relationship and you feel that the way you are being treated is unfair. Acknowledge that she does apologize but it keeps happening so you want to help. I think if you say it in a caring way and under the idea of preserving the relationship it should go pretty well. 
1714,esfp,"i'm an esfp - i don't have any infp family members but my ex is an infp. as an esfp, i kind of think that while her temper seems volatile, she probably doesn't mean harm. esfps have Fi which is supposed to help us take care of others' feelings well and serve them but in the case of an unhealthy esfp they make them callous to others' feelings, stubborn, prone to outbursts and self-centred. your mom sounds like she's an unhealthy esfp - perhaps she's under a lot of stress? or that could be narcissism, which can be caused by unresolved childhood trauma. 
as for her 'immediately expecting you to hug her', i think it might be caused by her inner struggle/manipulative tendencies. esfps (especially female esfps) are rather intimidated by displays of anger, particularly when they are from those who we percieve as 'nice people', or shall i say, 'harmless people'. my infp ex used to be really easygoing and chill all the time (most of the infps i know give me that vibe) so when he got mad he'd scare me. i'd automatically panic and act like a child that needs comfort, kind of because we just want the scariness to go away. so i guess i could be that. or if she's being manipulative, then it could be her attempting to elicit a positive reaction so you'll be more likely to bend to her requests/confuse you/emotionally abuse you so you feel guilty for something that isn't your fault. sorry for such a long rant lol
!TL;DR could be an unhealthy esfp, narcissism, her natural esfp tendencies or her being manipulative."
1715,esfp,"I'm going to agree here. From what OP has said, the problems are less with the MBTI and more with her own personal issues. Lashing out both verbally and physically isn't a healthy sign for anyone regardless of their personality and, depending on the severity, might be considered abuse. 
Obviously I know nothing about the situation except from OPs description, but I think it's an issue to be resolved through a long conversation or two between child and parent."
1716,esfp,"The following survey has moderator approval. Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ
Thank you again for taking the time"
1717,esfp,"Done! FYI there were a lot of repeat questions, and the question “there are rules men and women should follow” is too vague. In context, I can gather what you’re trying to ask but it’s likely you’ll want to dismiss those results from your findings. 
Also what’s with the “Choose strongly agree” questions?? Jus curious if it had any purpose or just needed for troubleshooting problems "
1718,esfp,"Haha let's pretend it's not already like this 😂😇
I think we'd be with ESTPs and ENTJs because us three are the most capable of getting what we want without sitting around wasting time thinking about it. 
Enemies: intps and intjs in my opinion, still on the hating train tbh I will be until they stop bashing Se all the damn time. "
1719,esfp,"Well you know that Sensors are more likely to be disinterested in this stuff. So maybe that’s a good start for labeling everyone in your life. As an INFJ, I can use my Ni that is very accurate at detecting people’s types easily without a test."
1720,esfp,"Yeah, sometimes I have to force it on people and they turn out to be S’s usually, but my father, an ENTJ lol, will question MBTI entirely because that’s ENTJs for you, but I’m stubborn so I made him do it anyway, sometimes I can be annoying with these tests, but I see what you mean. ENFPs will bond easily because they ask me for the test and they say how awesome it is. Extroverted intuition is very curious. It’s funny as an Ni dominant and Fe auxiliary, I’m just curious of what everyone’s type is and you have the Se dominant function and Fi auxiliary function, so you use the test for bonding experiences. I just find that a bit interesting and funny."
1721,esfp,"Lol I see, I try to do the the same, hopefully you can do it, go for the people who seem like XNFX types, I think they are most likely to take the test and fulfill the emotional aspect based off experience."
1722,esfp,"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/2QSNJPP

Thank you!"
1723,esfp,"Been friends with this guy for a while now, things started getting more flirtatious of late, but it could've been purely circumstantial (us being thrown together as two love interests in a recent production, etc)... we obviously like each other but I definitely get vibes that anything that seems too serious too quickly could really overwhelm him... not that I'd be taking any giant leaps like saying I love you this early, or trying to force an exclusive relationship, but it's more just that he seems to avoid any conversation about what his sudden affection meant, and he's got a slew of female friends that he also seems to be flirting with at any given time, although it seems like more of a playful kind of thing than sincere affection?? i don't know this rant is going nowhere point is i'm confused and he's hard to read and idk how to broach the subject of possibly dating/not/what does he want/what are his intentions.. i'm fine with whatever they are, but i'd honestly just like to know. anybody have any advice/experience?"
1724,esfp,"Agreed, also an esfp and i flirt with just about everyone past the introduction stage too. Also if there is a girl i like i really try hard to flirt and compliment her and she usually knows that im into her, but everyones different."
1725,esfp,"My ESFP bf was a huge flirt when we met. Still is but to a lesser extent, I wish he was still that touchy but I’m not touchy to him so it happens less =(.
He’s still a flirt with other servers at his new restaurant but I have zero fear of it leading to anything. It’s just who he is. "
1726,esfp,"I saw this place was dead and without a mod so I requested the sub and spruced it up a bit. I took the style sheet from the main /r/MBTI sub. If anyone has any ideas or something you'd like to see let me know, hopefully we can get this place a little more active!"
1727,esfp,"The stereotype that we are all shallow people with zero inhibitions and care for others, makes me so mad. In person we're  likeable but on the internet (especially myerbriggs forums) we get torn apart and called all types of names. Players, party animals, flakey, all types of things that act as though we're a two dimensional character in some shitty book who lacks inner dialogue and actual feelings.
Of course I don't mean everyone, but do you feel like people think we're ""shallow"" because we dont wallow constantly on what is worrying and plaguing us? What constitutes someone as deep? Do you have to be someone who constantly talks about how you think life is meaningless, or what happens after death?? Do we have to make every conversation forcefully heavy and uncomfortable?? Maybe instead of spilling all our private and deepest thoughts to everyone, we like to keep it to ourselves!!! and only reveal it to the people we trust the most!!!!!! instead of laying all this shit on everyone else!!
Maybe the reason why we seem so fucking stupid and flighty is because we're torn between not wanting anyone to truly know us, to wanting to be understood and loved!!! maybe we're afraid of being truly known. maybe we're afraid of being hurt. why does everyone reduce us to something so surface level and shallow? 
I don't know, this is a stupid rant but it just hurts to think some people think we dont have any actual feelings, thoughts or depth. Because we definitely do. I know it. Sure we enjoy life's physical pleasures but it doesn't mean our heads are filled with sand! just because we dont spew all the things we feel out to everyone, doesn't mean we dont feel.
I'm tired of this stereotype. Like everyone, I want to be loved and understood. Not everyone can give you that though, so of course I'm not going to open up to everyone. I'm going to stay surface level with people who I believe don't connect with me on that level. 
sDHFJKDSHF anyways thanks. Rant over. "
1728,esfp,"A lot of people think like that, but honestly who cares? I know myself, so there's no need for the validation of others. If someone thinks I'm stupid then let them think that way. I like to act dumb on purpose to mess with people. 
In reality, a truly smart and ""deep"" person is not going to look down on someone for not being sophisticated, because any intelligent person(who is older than 15) realizes that it's not wise to go through life trying to complicate everything. The happiest people enjoy simple things and are true to  themselves, while people who always put on an intellectual facade are barely enjoying themselves at all, so who's the dumb one at the end of the day?"
1729,esfp,"I'm completely with you. I hate the idea of certain people or types being ""deeper"" than others. As if it were measurable, and as if it meant they would be overall better or smarter people. 
I think function orientation describes ""attention"" more so than it does ""skill."" So everyone has an intuitive function they can call upon to be ""deep,"" or use to analyze and abstract their world. But they also all have a sensing function to use when dealing with the here and now, and getting things done.
Some people might pay more attention to their intuitive function, myself included, but they doesn't inherently make them smarter and it has drawbacks in other places, such as less attention for your sensing function. I just think about Si things less than I think about Ne things. I need less of them, they are of less value to me. I believe the same goes for ESFPs and their Ni. 
Embrace yourself, man. You have your own strengths and are a fully capable person in your own way. "
1730,esfp,"Aww, I don’t think you guys are shallow. I think you guys can be extremely sensitive and kind, clever and honest. I think you guys might be a bit flighty, but there’s nothing wrong with that. The people who think you’re shallow are usually pretentious and close minded and who cares what they think anyway. They often think themselves into circles. 
— ENFP"
1731,esfp,"Tbh, I think the ""party girl/fratbro"" was a stereotype that existed before MBTI got involved, but people were basically looking which type to slap that stereotype on, and it fell on you...
Come now, that's just you stereotyping the other side. The ""N"" stuff is more about the abstract, etc, than worrying per se.
Personally, I would say the time spent thinking about something, refining it to something simple, like Einstein coming up with that E=Mc² that summarize everything. A very novel point of view, one that just clicks, one that fits all the piece of the puzzle, that's depth. 
I'm not very receptive to Fi, but hey, seeing from what I saw of ESTPs, you Se-doms have a very simple, yet, very pure/raw way to look at things that is enjoyable too, you just don't express it ? If you say what matters is how true/verifiable a fact is, then you guys should lead
I guess ""depth"" will always be associated with N, though. But well, when you have as much data as you guys do, isn't building a worldview rather easy ? You've got to concentrate/crystalize it in one point. 
Tbh, taking the opposite of Se-dom, Ni-dom (INxJ), you get types that way over their heads, but appear confident. That's a mask. Calling them on their BS isn't that hard once you know the odds. 
Anyway, in a sense, I kinda consider you guys ""deeper"" than INxJ because at least, your stuff isn't wanky spiritual BS half the time.
Funnily, nihilism, at least Nietzsche's version of it, comes to that conclusion that life is meaningless, and thus, that you should enjoy it. He's typed as INTJ, and if you look at his idea of the ""Ubermensch"" or the idea of ""will to power"", well, it's pretty SeFi actually.
What he recommands is to be like you guys. (Maybe because his weakness as an INTJ would be FiSe.)
The true lesson with this typology stuff is that we all have something other lack and want. 
That one goes for everyone I think
If you talk about online, it's obviously N types who were bullied by/envious of Se types during highschool, lol. 
As for IRL, are you seen as shallow too ?"
1732,esfp,"Yeah, being shallow has nothing to do with your type. Being ""deep"" to me means that you are thoughtful and you put effort into knowing yourself. All types can be shallow by that definition. I am in touch with the way I experience things, and with my feelings, and there is a lot of depth to be found there. I'm not talking about myself necessarily, but Se and Fi as functions are just as deep as Ni or Ne or whatever else is considered ""deep"". There is a lot of meaning to be found in Se and Fi, just as much as in ""deep"" functions, and if you're willing to dive in and explore that meaning, to me you are not a shallow person."
1733,esfp,"That's funny cuz I think other types are shallow. They're the ones being superficial by judging you, and they're the ones who are basically frivolus chatter boxes, gossiping about nothing, etc. Then they think you have no depth. Pretty stupid of them."
1734,esfp,"Iv felt that way about the stereotypes behind ENTP. how they are very non committed / sluttish/ always wanting to move on to the newer more exciting thing , ""being bored easily with people"" and just quickly moving on.. "
1735,esfp,"This speaks to me so much right now! I’m currently experiencing this in life in my surroundings. Lately I’ve been feeling like my friends don’t take me seriously and girls think I’m shallow. 
I’m just bubbly, with crazy ideas, and I just want to have a good time ..but I’m turning crazy to think that I have to show I’m not shallow. "
1736,esfp,"Example of when Fi gets pissed off. The fact these things annoy you is just an example of the struggles you identify within yourself. At the end of the day, not everyone will care to take a second to understand, love or respect us. It doesn't matter because you recognise you true value after learning not to care about what others think. Your type is just one thing that doesn't matter because its an avatar (or I think so lol). 
People can attack you and they will continue to until those issues deep within you resolved. Be thankful for being alive, there was a 1:400000 chance of existing on this planet! That's fucking amazing! The purpose, the need you have chase it like a mother fucker. 
​
You probably already know this, but you cannot except to be loved when you don't love yourself. 
​
​"
1737,esfp,"I've thought about that too. It's funny that a lot of people who like him seem to be edgy nerds, which is pretty much the opposite of what Nietzsche was preaching.
To me personally the more annoying stereotype is that we are these emotional people pleasers, who break out singing every 5 minutes.  That's why I like the socionics descriptions, because they shed light on our ambitious side(which is completely absent from the popular MBTI descriptions). They describe us as one of the democratic leader types(similar to ENTJ), with the negatives and positives that come with that, which to me at least is a lot more relatable. Se and Te are pretty assertive functions and Fi can manifest itself in a very stubborn and individualistic way. The MBTI descriptions are not completely off, but they overemphasize how we act under certain circumstances, without analyzing us any deeper than that. One of the reasons for that is probably the fact that despite readily socializing on a surface level we don't share our inner worlds with a lot of people."
1738,esfp,"Socionics is a lot more obscure than MBTI, so in a way, it was less tainted by the shitty descriptions. When you read something about socionics, at least you know it doesn't come from tumblr.
Also, MBTI, as a test, is a big business, so that explain stuff. People saw money could be made, and they went staight for the kill without any remorse. Doesn't matter if the descriptions aren't as accurate as long as you make that $$$."
1739,esfp,"Nietzsche also thought you shouldn’t drink, because it’s just how we numb ourselves to our own dissatisfaction with our life.
Do you not drink, ESFP?
^Not making a point, just being an ass.
Actually, I appreciate a post-nihilist ESFP.
But some of us are still going to be edgy nerds while being post-nihilists. It adds some flavor.
I’ve been an existentialist since I was 10, but I’m still occasionally an edgy nerd. You just gotta find what’s fulfilling."
1740,esfp,"True. Socionics is also a business in a lot of post-soviet countries, but it's never been implemented into any sort of professional settings on a large scale(or had the same popularity as MBTI), it mostly boils down to people meeting up for paid seminars and typing sessions."
1741,esfp,"lol I think there are better recreational drugs, so I usually don't
He was kinda right, but of course not everyone drinks for that reason(especially if you're a younger person)
Yup, you gotta do what makes you personally happy, also Nietzsche himself didn't really follow his own advice in that regard, sitting around and writing about philosophy is not exactly ""living dangerously"""
1742,esfp,"Hi All,
I am doing a survey out of sheer curiosity about whether your MBTI type influences the type of dreams you have. Out of over 200 responses, I only have one ESFP response. I would love to hear more about ESFP experiences! So if you are interested in helping me out, the link is below. It will only take 1 to 2 minutes and I will post results to anyone who is interested. Just let me know!

I will have later posts that will break the information down into types so feel free to keep checking back for more insights.
Thanks to all who participated!"
1744,esfp,"Why happened for her to block you in the first place?
I had falling out with my high school best friend. We caught up a few times but things were never the same. But then again I caught up with another friend from high school, and it was like we never stopped talking."
1745,esfp,I ended up falling hard for her sister and dating her. She got drunk one night and told me that she had feelings for me and I had picked the wrong sister. She had a boyfriend though and I preferred her as a friend. For whatever reason when her sister and I broke up she cut me out of her life. To this day I still don't know her reasoning. 
1746,esfp,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.
My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.
I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.
Cheers!

1747,esfp,"I think all these types are confident in different ways. But this absolutely applies to ESFPs, probably more than to the other 2, because we are confident in ourselves regardless of anything, while ESTPs have to be in a good social space to be confident and ENTPs care a bit less what other people think of them(among these types)."
1748,esfp,"You're right, they are detatched concepts but the systems do collide at certain points. For example, an Se and Ne dominant will often be more confident than a Ti or Fi dominant because Se and Ne have a keen focus on extroverted behaviour with the slight disregard for their introversion. This applies the exact same way for especially Ti doms but vice versa. This means that Se Ne is more concerned about operating within the world as it is or as it may potentially be. For this reason, a lot of Se -and Nes (I believe especially Se doms) have created a very much ""fuck it"" mindset towards a lot of things. For this reason, a lot of them are more naturally prone to become more confident than other types. I know this is the case for a lot of ESTPs but I am wondering if this is true for ESFPs as well. To be honest, I think their Fi might make them more considerate of their actions as to not attack their own perception of right and wrong. But I still think they might overall be more confident than mist types. This is just my conclusions though and I wouldn't come here if I wasn't willing to hear more opinions or have mine validated by object sources. That last sentence is supposed to sound friendly (I'm inf Fe as you might have guesses already so I do apologize if I'm overloading a bit)"
1749,esfp,"No worries, no offense taken! Maybe you're talking about a certain type of confidence? I'm an ENFP, so while I may appear confident on the outside (I think there are lots of things I do that I don't think twice about that awe by introverted friends), there are lots of things I'm insecure about. Particularly when it comes to trusting myself internally. My brother is an ISFP and he's a lot more confident in himself, but I would say that I'm a lot more adventurous and fearless. I don't think very far ahead and am not super practical so I don't always know what kind of shit I'm going to land myself in until I do. But that's not necessarily because I'm confident, it's more because I don't think about the consequences...if I did, I'd probably be a lot more cautious. Does that make sense? "
1750,esfp,"Oh, so it's like accidental confidence over the object but inconfidence over the subject? That would be really interesting cause I experience the opposite proble. It is probably attachable to extroversion and introversion then"
1751,esfp,"Inwarded orientation towards the subject, such as thoughts and feelings etc. Outwarded orientation towards the object, for example: people in your surroundings or observable patterns. 
Did that clear up anything?"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJHf4-B2V6g&list=PLCPzIFw2QJDer7qKkge6mAd4cKb2JqvER"
1754,esfp,"Hi all,
We have 3 kids, and our darling, gregarious ESFP girl is causing us some consternation. She's 14 and she lies (a lot; always has). The problem is that we can't figure out how to parent this effectively. We are pretty permissive parents who try to engage the kids and get them on board with decisions like chores and rules, and it works beautifully with the other two, who want to be honest, and will tell us ""Hey, I don't think I did enough chores today to get my allowance. Is there anything I can do?"" 
Not our ESFP, though. She lies and we know she's lying and it creates this uncomfortable situation. ""I know you didn't do that, but now you said you did and I'm staring you in the face, dumbfounded."" If confronted, she will cry and claim persecution ""You never believe me!"" 
She lies to make her stories sound better (it usually works -- she's charming and funny). She lies to get out of things. She lies to get into things. It's just a tactic that works for her. The problem is ... my husband and I both really value authenticity and it's straining our relationship with her. We don't believe much of anything she says. Every anecdote is suspect, and the intimacy is suffering bc of that. 
The question is ... what would appeal to an ESFP to encourage honesty? She's not idealistic, so that approach doesn't seem to work. Does she need to know what it means to us? Does she need to get punished harshly for lying (I would think that would just make her lie more)? Help, please? I'm INTP, by the way. Thank you!"
1755,esfp,"Oh boy...I remember going through that. I had the same thing going for me, and I think getting caught was really what got me to really stop. You have to set the rule up and enforce it. I know you can't say no to those puppy dog eyes and innocent act, but you have to. Trust is very, very important so assume that she's telling the truth otherwise she'll say you never believe her like she does now. Give her the benefit of the doubt initially. When she gets caught (because she will), you HAVE TO enforce it. If you're going to ground her, don't back down half way through. Don't take any of her shit with emotional blackmail and making you feel guilty. She will grow out of it, but you have to show her that rules apply to her as well. What we learn early on is that rules are for suckas, and we're no suckas. She won't go for the ""we're disappointed in you"" or ""you're better than that"" bit. We don't care as much about what you think because we have strong opinions of ourselves to begin with. We like clear cut things. If we lie, you're in trouble, and that's final. No talking your way out of it."
1756,esfp,"As an ESFP they are naturally good at knowing right from wrong. So once they find lying no longer worth it, hopefully they see honesty WILL be worth it. ESFPS like to learn a system and then ride it so if you make honesty the next best thing they should gravitate towards it. "
1757,esfp,"As an ESFP, growing up I remember going through that stage and growing out of it.  Firm boundaries are key.  I would lie about stupid things and get away with it.  This in turn let me lie about more serious matters.  I was around 9 when I realized how stupid lies were.  Maturity is a key part of growing out of it.  If we lie, we'll just go with the ""flow"" which consists of keeping lying.  Establish firm boundaries early on if you want to weed that habit out.  It really becomes second nature if you don't.  "
1758,esfp,as an ESFP my parents raised me to be honest and truthful... the Fi function supports that. She is in a developmental stage and it seems that she has a strong grasp on her Se which allows her to lie often. With more growth she will develop the other functions that make us ESFPs truthful beings to our loved ones. I would suggest more consequences... my parents did that with me and it allowed me to develop my other functions.. just know that our Se dominant allows us to create anything up on the spot.. 
1759,esfp,"I am an ESFP and I also have ADHD. I lied all the time growing up for absolutely no reason. The entertainer in me wanted top make things larger than life and the lack of impulse control and hyperactivity didn't give me a chance to think through the consequences. It wouldn't surprise me if there was a link between the ESFP personality type and ADHD. If she shows any other signs of ADHD, it might be worth checking into."
1760,esfp,"Man, that is really helpful.  Other people are so frustratingly not me.  Ha!  
That would never have worked for me. I broke all the rules until I grasped the empathetic perspective.  For me the light bulb was ""Don't take things because it sucks when people take your stuff.  Don't lie because you hate being deceived.""  I never cared about getting in trouble, and still mostly don't.  So, I appreciate the pragmatic perspective, no matter how foreign it seems.  I will try it.  "
1761,esfp,"Fascinating.  As an INTP, I always found rules really dismissible unless somebody could convince me of the logic or the empathetic perspective behind them.  But I've tried logic and empathy with her.  I guess rules are next.  "
1762,esfp,"If she matures in a healthy environment, the empathy will follow without question. We like to enjoy life however we can, and that can make us care more about ourselves than others. It's not that we DON'T care about other people. We just care about our enjoyment and ourselves more. This'll be true until she learns how much better it is to enjoy ourselves alongside everyone else. That's the golden moment when she stops being a people person and becomes a person of the people. "
1763,esfp,"I’ve known this one girl for a while, and we’ve gotten to know each other pretty well (been friends for about 3 years). My question is, what traits do you look for in your SO (more specifically, what do you look for in guys)? I’ve been told I’m too soft, so should I toughen up? What hints do you guys typically like to throw to let someone know you’re into them?
(I am an ENTP)"
1764,esfp,"Oh, and there goes my personality right there!  I didn’t answer your questions. Be upfront with how you feel. We don’t need you to be tougher, I like my husbands gentle side. You have been friends for 3 years, you know her well, take her out to do something spontaneous. We aren’t great with keeping in contact, so do that work for her, it isn’t a sign she isn’t in to you. We like excitement, be up to do anything. Don’t analyze anything, throw your brain out the window and just go for it. That last stuff is from my entp husband. He says stop thinking so much about it and go for it, ESFP’s love it. "
1765,esfp,"I'm pretty direct with interest. What I'm looking for is someone focused, who can help me with direction, rather than be dispersed with interests in multiple directions and random. I need a vision to follow. I like someone internally disciplined who would inspire me to try do the same, and focused on efficiency, yet feeling. I like an understated, yet dry, dark sense of humor. And confidence. I'm looking for someone who is complimentary to me, yet compatible. My guys tend to be a bit aloof on the outside, but softies on the inside.
But each ESFP is different and will have different preferences."
1766,esfp,"I am an esfp and my husband of 14 years is an entp. It actually works very well. You have to be okay with an ESFP’s emotions, our need for total freedom, and our impulsive decisions without a care for the future consequences. I find my entp spouse incredibly interesting and he keeps me grounded. I help him take risks and forget about the future for a few moments in life. I couldn’t imagine my life without him and he couldn’t me. Do we drive each other insane?!!  Absolutely. His constant research and droning on about his future and his many ideas that he will never actually accomplish can drive me to sheer boredom. My emotional outbursts and money spending sprees make him batty. But we have so much fun. Don’t be worried about us ESFP’s, we do well with ENTP’s and you guys find us very exciting. Haha. Ask any questions!!"
1767,esfp,"TLDR: What quality makes it easier for you ESFPs to have and maintain a close friendship with someone 
Hello. waves awkwardly I'm an INFP. I don't belong here, but I seriously need help so whoop here I is. 
I've known an ESFP for 3 years now and I adore her more than I've ever loved anyone. She's nothing like the narcissistic, elusive, party-clown stereotype you'd read about on a tumblr description. We were always drawn to each other but were basically strangers. Then over a month ago she broke down crying in an emotional moment and I was the one that held her. I'm still the one that holds her. We've texted every single day since then and haven't broken the streak, plus we volunteer at the same facility so I see her up to three times a week. In the beginning it was quite like the rush of burying deeper in depth, holding your breath in anticipation of what's under the waves. She would text me the second she'd wake up and we'd talk and laugh until she fell asleep. She'd visit me at work and I'd bring her gifts to her work. We clicked on all the things we had in common and were amazed by our differences. She laughed at mah sick memes, would constantly say she loved me. 
Now it's just not the same. She still texts me when she wakes up everyday but the conversation fizzles long before the afternoon, and I'm usually the one trying to chase the spark. She doesn't visit me anymore, or care what I think about things, doesn't laugh at my jokes as much, rarely says I love you. I feel annoying and worthless, I fear I'm losing her.
In person, the last time I saw her I held her as she cried again, but that doesn't mean we really click when we talk. Mostly we just vibe. I'm very boring when we're not working on something or listening to her play music. I'm two years older, so maybe she sees me as a
If you read this, any advice? Thanks!"
1768,esfp,"as an esfp i tend to stop giving my attention to people once it becomes tedious to do so, either because the conversations don't flow or they aren't interesting anymore. i can't tell you to become a more interesting person and i'm sure you're interesting in some ways although you say you're boring. 
if there's something you're passionate about that she doesn't know, you could try telling her about it. i love when people talk to me about the things they're passionate about they get a look in their eyes that's so so wonderful. if not, maybe tell her that you miss the time yiu guys would spend together and talk about it with her, why she doesn't spend as much time with you now. "
1769,esfp,"I'm an INTJ with an ESFP best friend of 10 years. I've noticed he likes to collect people for his different moods. If she is always crying with you then you are the shoulder to cry on friend. Next time you get together do something fun to change her perception of you. Might not work, could just confuse her, but worth a shot. Over time you might develop into a multi mood friend. "
1770,esfp,"For me it's pretty easy to fall head over heels for someone really quickly, and they're pretty much all I think about. Being in love or having a crush on someone is like the best thing ever and I'm constantly checking people out... I am constantly going through phases of being in love with someone and there is always someone on my mind. I can't think of a time in my life when I have been mentally ""single"".
On the same token though, if I get tired of someone, the passion runs dry very quickly.
Any of you guys like this?"
1771,esfp,"damn. this is tough for me for sureeeee. I fall for people quickly, but it lasts a while for me. For instance, I dated an ISFJ in HS, went to prom and whatnot and it was great. I felt way stronger feelings for her than she felt for me. In college, I met another ISFJ who I became very close with. I suppose I have very close feelings for her too. In between these two girls i've met and interacted with girls I like, not sure their type... but after my attraction toward them, I immediately lose it when I hear that they have interest in me. Idk what it is, but this has happened with at least 5 girls in the last 3 years. "
1772,esfp,God yes. I just think that we need to let ourselves be more patient with people and the passion will return. Just like being angry or remembering that your cat ran away. I feel guilty for forgetting so easily since I haven't seen her prior to like 1.5 years ago
1773,esfp,"I fall quickly. I can get over someone quickly if I find someone else to be interested in. I am not very good at being alone.
Right now I am trying to stay mentally single. I am actually trying to overcome my falling quickly, and make myself take things slowly in my next relationship. I don't want perfect, but I want long term and happy. My focus today is finding friends, which is tough - I've recently returned to this area and I feel like I have no community whatsoever."
1774,esfp,"I used to always be romantically interested in someone (sometimes more than one person at once) and they would consume my thoughts and I would always be wanting to talk to them. But recently I haven't had feelings for anyone most likely because I haven't interacted with many new people and all of the people I know, I'm not interested in. "
1775,esfp,"This sounds exactly like me. I'm 22 now, but reading through my old diaries (from my teenage years) I realise I've almost always been ""in love"" with someone and when I got bored of that poor soul I found someone new in just a couple of weeks. Sometimes I did it just so I could have someone to write about..."
1776,esfp,"Yeah there have been a few people who I have really fallen for and it took a couple years to get over. I never really get over anyone completely but I do move on pretty quickly if that makes sense. That is interesting though, about losing interest if they like you. Sounds like it might be a commitment issue?"
1777,esfp,I thought about this a while back. But idk that functions would have anything to do with likes or dislikes. I play halo pretty frequently and the list of other types that like it just as much as me vary. But then again we all get together to play chess too. 
1778,esfp,"I'll play any game as long as I'm mic'd up with some friends. 
When Skyrim came out my roommates gave me shit because I didn't follow any storyline and only wanted to beat the game. I guess when it comes to video games, I just want to finish the campaign as quick as possible without knowing what the story actually is. "
1779,esfp,"You could start with a survey and see if there are any connections there.
Personally, I like immersive games like Skyrim or really silly little phone management games. Maybe I'm not a typical ESFP but I have no interest at all in multi-player games"
1780,esfp,"Your logic seems to be operating under the assumption that cognitive functions have nothing to do with game preference because multiple types like the same game. I think an alternate approach to looking at it is people can like the same game for different reasons, and different games have multiple things for different people."
1781,esfp,It doesn't take into consideration the cognitive functions and is a bit bare bones itself....it's also more about where they prefer to research/play games rather than the games themselves which is a bit different from my purpose here.
1782,esfp,"Yes and no, of course every individual has different reasons for liking different things. But wouldn't upbringing be a bigger factor? Maybe cognitive functions do come into play. However, no one type will like the same thing every single time, for the same reason. Might as well say, were robots. "
1783,esfp,Hello everyone. I’m an estp or entp. I’m not sure. My girlfriend is an esfp. She’s a teacher. Definitely an entertainer. Super personable and charismatic. She’s looking to get out of teaching and into another career and I’ve suggested she check out reddit for guidance but she’s very skeptical. Any advice? Heads up I’ll probably be showing her any feedback. Make it real af please! 
1784,esfp,Anything involving speaking in front of people or being sociable in general. It’s funny she’s a teacher because I’m doing education too. But here are some other things I would consider. I really liked working in sales because I get to talk to people and educate them about a product. Being an event planner works well because it requires tons of social skill behind it. Anything where connections with people is the primary task will be a good bet. Good luck!
1785,esfp,"Are you sure you've typed her correctly? If she's really an ESFP tell her to Fi and Ni the fuck out of that shit lol We all have different interests, so it's hard to give such advice to someone you know so little about. I'd suggest her to not take advice from reddit and to figure it out by herself, to think about the things she likes and things she's good at, preferably compile a list. From there it shouldn't be that difficult. Most importantly, tell her to not worry too much about it, she's gonna figure it out eventually and she can change her line of work later on if she feels like it"
1786,esfp,"On a side note, I've seen a couple ESFP teachers on reddit, which is weird to me personally, because I couldn't imagine a worse career for myself. I can see ESFPs being instructors(fitness trainers for example), who work with clients individually, but not in a school with a bunch of smelly, disrespectful children, where you have to make them do things they don't want to on a tight schedule. I despised every aspect of school and didn't learn anything from there, except for social skills(which had nothing to do with the subjects I was taught). I don't like educating large groups of people either, when I find out know-hows to things I'm honestly keeping them to myself and will only reveal them to a select few if I really feel like it. 
I think that we're cut out for things like individual sports, entertainment, art, diplomacy, business/salesmanship"
1787,esfp,Haha she definitely is because I tried suggesting she check out reddit again last night and she came to the same conclusion as your suggestion. She's totally going to go about it as you have described here. I think she'll do just fine and I'm pretty pumped now that she is absolutely sure she wants to change it up. Just gotta go through the process
1788,esfp,"I taught summer school for a while and tbh I loved it. Obviously it's not the same, but I did things against tradition, got what they needed to learn and made sure they had fun while doing it. It was admittedly really difficult to focus on the kids who either excel too quickly or fall behind but the job got done."
1789,esfp,Am I the only ESFP who doesn't really...have much to say? In general? I don't identify with the ESFP description of being lively and jovial and a party hostess or anything. But I'm quite sure I don't identify with being a Fi Dom either. And I'm most certainly not ENFP.
1790,esfp,"I'm really quiet in class or at my
job. Mostly around a professional setting. Everyone thinks I'm really shy until they get me around my friends and I'm really loud and I talk non-stop. I think because I am a very playful person that I try to keep my play side and my professional side very seperate because I don't want professionals to see how crazy I can get. Sometimes it's disheartening though because I feel like most people I see every day don't really even know me."
1791,esfp,"I tend to be extremely shy on first meeting people and extremely irritatingly chatty when I get to know them.
I'm not sure, though, if this is just because while I keep rolling ESFP on personality tests my E and S are actually so borderline I could be an ISFP or INFP in disguise.  Certainly I think I have ENFP stereotypes (idealistic, restless, emotional) and am missing some ESFP ones (people skills!, and I'm certainly not straightforwardly 100% social 100% of the time)."
1792,esfp,"I second this! people who meet me for the first time in school and other 'professional' settings probably think I'm kinda shy since I don't say that much and often wait a while before sharing my ideas etc. Another example is when I met my SO's friends for the first time, I didn't quite know what to say there either and certainly did not live up to the esfp stereotype ""always being the center of parties"" and all that. But after some time, when I've gotten to know people better and feel more comfortable, I can joke around and act crazier than most others! "
1793,esfp,"I observe almost everything: People clothes, what they look like their facial expressions, buildings, trees, what song lyrics are about and really abstract stuff. My favorite things in school are: History, Science, Choir and Lunch"
1794,esfp,"As another visiting INTJ, we won't do that. The fear of retribution is too high. We can barely handle externalized emotion as it is, being rejected and possibly ostracized from a group of friends would hurt so badly, it would have physical effects.
We essentially won't give any physical shows of affection without it being completely obvious that you're okay with it, even if we want nothing more than to hug and cuddle like an oversized humanoid puppy. Not being completely sure, makes us feel like we are forcing ourselves on you, and we like you so we don't want to force anything on you.
So, if your dating an INTJ... act first. If you act first, there will be no doubt. Once we know, we go. "
1795,esfp,"ENTP HERE.
It wasn't really your fault, but she had to blame someone and you were the nearest person in the wrong place and wrong time. I could rationalize with her but she refuses to see me?
What's the best way to make an esfp forgive you?"
1796,esfp,"Funny!  My husband is an ENTP and I am an ESFP.  Open up about your feelings for her, tell her you love her and don't hold back.  We love that.  Entp's can really struggle meeting our emotional needs, but you guys do really fascinate us.  When you open up, it's super sexy.  Esfp's typically forgive really easy if you meet her emotions not her logic.  Do not approach this logically.  Tough, I know!!  Good luck! "
1797,esfp,"INFJ here with an ESFP fiance. this is pretty good advice. for my type, opening up and sharing my thoughts and feelings is pretty difficult to do, but whenever there's tension between the two of us and i open up to her she always understands and the tension eases up significantly.  "

1799,esfp,"Big fat ass and a sense of humor
Other than that I think that optimism is a major thing, I can't imagine going out with someone who's a downer. Confidence is another one. Make the first move and see where it goes from there. Sometimes ESFP's try to downplay the depth of our emotions if we're really into someone, but in general we're not too secretive about who we like"
1800,esfp,"I have a few INTJ friends and I absolutely love them. At first it was rocky. They were constantly trying to figure me out and from what I know now. They thought I didn't like them. There's nothing to read between the lines, when I'm being nice, there is zero motive other then I like people.  I do have a hard time with how unaffectionate they were at first. I greet everyone I meet with a hug. It's just who I am. But the conversation is great. Very open. All I want is honesty and that's what they give me. So it's great!
They do offended me at times but I try really hard to communicate that I was offended and why. Not easy for me, but I'm working not avoiding communication. I'm not sure if that's an ESFP thing or a me thing 
Also, how do you get along with them? "
1801,esfp,"I think INTJs and I get along great.
Found that many are my best friends.
Then again, I can't be certain if that is their type or not. At least a few of my friends seem very sceptical about Myers-Briggs types in general. "
1802,esfp,"I'm visiting from /r/intj, there seems to be many of us INTJs with ESFP mothers.
You have been warned XP
When I was a kid, I thought she was just easily angered and at the same time more things made her happy. I was confused at how easily she could get over things, when I couldn't stop my own mind from grinding over it. Even when things were hard and she had to work two jobs to keep my sister and I fed, she could seemingly get over her day by watching her favorite shows for an hour and she would be happy again.
Now that I'm an adult, I can see it has way more to do with how we approach problems and even perceive things. I feel that we pretty much come at them the complete opposite ways.
So when you come to me with a problem, I will not give you the response you want. You tell me ""my car battery is dead"", my response is ""I'll be there in a minute to give you jump or a ride to the store to get it tested and replaced"" not ""I'm really sorry to hear that, what can I do to help you out?"". It's not because I don't know that your day was ruined, it's because in my mind the solution is obvious and I want to get your day back on track as fast a possible.
That being said, I have learned from having a ESFP mom how to respond to these things better than some INTJs do. Just pretend we have pointed ears and things will work better."
1803,esfp,"See I tend to think ESFP females don't like me either haha. I think I somehow misread them as being patronizing towards me, so maybe other INTJs make this same mistake. It takes us a long time to warm up to people for whatever reason, it's nothing personal, we just like to fully know what we're getting into and do not feel comfortable before reaching that point. 
I like ESFPs if I'm out drinking and thus being abnormally social- it's weird, the more I drink, the more I can relate. It lets me let down my guard, relax and have fun, and I have found it's easy to connect with ESFPs- they are so open and and excited about life. "
1804,esfp,"Patronizing? Really? That's interesting. It's hard for myself to not like you, when I just met you. You're new and exciting. And I find that the more I get to know some, the more I like them. Hardly ever will I not like someone I just met. And I'm very genuine in what I'm saying to you. I'm not one for passive aggressive remarks. Idk if were all this way. I only know one other ESFP. And we're the same person. I just want to have a good time and I want everyone to have just as much of a good time as I am. 
I always find my conversations with INTJs so refreshing and insightful. And I love that over time, they show how they feel deeply. I always jokingly say, ""you are human"". And they can be insanely loving. I do hear some have a bad connection with them. But I haven't. :) thanks for the insight! "
1805,esfp,"""Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression."" (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)
A price of freedom? ""Glorious"" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)"
1806,esfp,"Internet ftw! Yeah I don't fancy the pill too. I don't take it personally. And that pill invention is far from greatest. 
Hehe, yes I am interested in the path that feminism nowadays is going... don't you think it went in some weird direction? What do you think about that movement?"
1807,esfp,"As an ESFP, I find small talk to be incredibly asinine and boring. I prefer to talk more about astrology, psychology, and other metaphysical things, I don't think this makes me less of an ESFP, as (cognitive) I don't feel like I am an intuitive type at all. I don't use extroverted intuition really. 
Do any other ESFPS relate to this?"
1808,esfp,I relate to that although I don't skip the small talk because its a conversation starter and the conversation itself. I do find it to be a mere formality and skip to the good stuff as quickly as I can. 
1809,esfp,"That doesn't make you any less of an ESFP.
Small talk is more a necessary evil sometimes. Very few people never do it. However, I don't enjoy it. I use it only as a means to find the topic we're both passionate about, and then deep-dive into that. Or as a means to find a call to action. It's a tool I'm not fond of, but will occasionally use.
ESFP have inferior, but valued Ni, and could be considered Ni-seeking."
1810,esfp,"Astrology and metaphysical things can be explained by inferior Ni
Otherwise I don't relate to this. I get bored when having long conversations in general and I don't mind small talk at all. I prefer having a little harmless exchange of new information to having a ""deep"" discussion"
1811,esfp,"I don't think any type likes small talk more than real talk. Small talk, by definition, is what you say to people you don't know very well. Which means it's about superficial stuff rather than the things that are really on your mind and which you only talk about to people you know well or trust. My ESTP friend says she doesn't mind small talk because she likes learning about people's lives, but she definitely likes talking to me about the stuff that matter more...like her kids and her husband and the things she is worried about. "
1812,esfp,"Hans Oberlander from the SF-UR radio station. I've recently replayed San Andreas and I think that he must be an ESFP. Hilarious character, I think the idea was that most of the time he's doing ecstasy and going through euphoria where he's acting like a house music cult leader and saying that his listeners are bad doggies who are not worthy of the music he's playing, which is then followed by a comedown where he says that he loves his mother and needs to be held. Also SF is in the name of the pirate station he hosts, so that's gotta be something

1813,esfp,"I hate that it's often seen as the ditziest or dumbest type. I went to a STEM high school where the majority of people were INTJ's, and I rarely felt understood. I think I'm just very sick of emotional arguments being invalidated in general. Just because I'm outgoing and kinda loud and open doesn't mean I'm not an intellectual, you know? I guess I'm just trying to see if anyone relates"
1814,esfp,"I actually don't mind being seen as ""dumb"". I remember in high school when people were getting accepted to colleges, everyone was so surprised when I got in to a top 20 university. I like surprising people that I can be both fun and the ""party type"" but also studious. People are still surprised to this day when I meet them for the first time at a bar or party and they ask what college I go to and I answer hahah"
1815,esfp,"That hasn’t really been my experience at all. While I do find some types a bit dull, as an ESFP I can generally read a room and adapt my energy to what they’re comfortable with. I’m not a studious person but my quick wit has always given me street cred with the intellectuals."
1816,esfp,"I have had a friend that's an ESFP. I think it's best that you have that confidence in yourself (Fi) then keep doing what you do. My friend is intelligent in the way that he thinks of stuff (so in no way, because you're ESFP then you're not an intellectual) but from what I observe is that ESFPs loves to have fun in the moment, being spontaneous and all. Maybe use that to your advantage? However I understand that immature INTJs tend to not take feelings into account perhaps that's why you felt this way.
I know ESFPs are awesome, and I know you will be too : )"
1817,esfp,"Do you mean you're seen like this IRL, or from the personality community? 
Also what do you mean by emotional arguments being invalidated in general ?
One thing that probably doesn't help you is how many of the personality videos / websites like to 'suggest' or imply what careers different types will/should go into. 
It's bad enough they give generic function descriptions, assuming everyone's level of psychological development is the same, but that feels like a fuck you to anyone who wants to be unconventional for their type (and anyone who has well-developed functions). 
In theory doing intellectual things as an ESFP should bore you to tears and make you quit in frustration but apparently it doesn't for you so if you enjoy being an intellectual then that's that. 
Some people want to be intellectuals because it's something they think they should become, not because it's something they love being. Personality tests can give great insight into our minds but they can also push people into trying to be something they're not. At least with you you know what you want is true because everything is telling you not to do what you're doing."
1818,esfp,"I definitely feel like I'm seen like this IRL, but when discussing MBTI, (which comes up surprisingly a lot in the education system,) it's exacerbated as ESFP is ""the entertainer"" and its most famous example is Marilyn Monroe. 
For the emotional argument aspect, I'm talking about how in an argument with thinking types, I've found it hard to explain to them that my or someone else's feelings being hurt is just as valid as the logic behind the argument. For example, if someone said something with good intentions but it hurt my feelings, my feelings shouldn't be automatically invalidated because they didn't mean to, even though that's logical. Not to mention, being sort of naturally dramatic, I've found that overreacting makes people think the original thing I'm reacting to is absolved, per say, because I took it too far in my reaction. I hope that makes sense.
And I totally agree! The generalization of personality types is extremely annoying and encourages those who struggle to see past a surface level. I have always been drawn to STEM, and I'm a math and physics major with a CS minor in college right now. I don't associate my personality with my interests really at all, and I think that's where I differ from a lot of people. The INTJs at my STEM school loved books, art, and concepts because it's what they were hardwired to love, but I love parties and events and just so happen to be good at math, too. I definitely don't love the intellectual trope that people often accidentally fall into where they, in my opinion, over analyze everything for the sake of being intellectual, but I do love learning at its core. I guess I'm just frustrated because I feel like a rarity in STEM. If I want to party and have fun, I find myself settling for people who live at the surface level, but if I want to be stimulated in conversation, I'm stuck doing so with people who act nothing like me. Didn't mean to ramble, just getting this off my chest I guess hahah"
1819,esfp,I mean different people value different things. I value education so I worked hard in high school to be where I am now haha. College has opened a lot of doors for me so i don't think it's a scam personally.
1820,esfp,"lol you're not the only one who doesn't like people who over-analyze everything. <--- that's group intellectual masturbation; fun at times but also annoying and pointless at times too - and sometimes used pretentiously by the insecure to appear smarter. Also something those filthy Ne/Si, Ti/Fe users would do... they think they're so cool... lol j/k"
1821,esfp,"I guess I should preface this saying that I have social anxiety so a lot of my personality when being around people can be blunted. I wouldn't describe myself as charismatic though. My boyfriend says I do have a very magnetic personality which draws people to me. I guess I've never noticed it happening and in high school I had a relatively average time making friends. As I've gotten older I realize that maybe I can come on too strong so I try to tone it down, even when I'm with close friends, to not be overwhelming. 
I'm borderling ISFP as well so I pick and choose who I hang out with carefully as well. Being an ESFP is fun but being mentally ill can be hard because I don't feel like myself often. I love to hang out with people and being with my friends gives me life, but I often feel like secluding myself when I'm having a bad day."
1822,esfp,"my charisma is through the roof. This is somewhat of an example but one night when some friends and I went back to our house from a party I was extremely wasted and overheard some gang members nearby the backyard of our house arguing and fighting with each other (by gangmembers I mean some 19 yr old kids who tagged a lot of stuff by our house and were always up to no good). anyway, I was very drunk and barely remember going back outside to talk to them, but from what my roommates recall, they told me that they heard me outside talking to them for 20 mins and then when they came outside to retrieve me, the gang members were hugging and had completely made amends with their troubles. as far as other parts of my charisma go, I've never met someone who I wasn't able to make open up to me and become comfortable with talking to me. I'm also a salesman and have had many customers tell me that I 'seem genuine and able to make people feel that they are not being bullshitted with'. Maybe if I was an ESTP i'd have much more sales, but I still want to stick with my own morals and beliefs when it comes to selling"
1823,esfp,"I'm sorry to hear that D: From time to time, I get anxiety, and it sucks to have that looming over you. Would you say that the social anxiety is like being paranoid or over thinking in your case? I got over mine recently after years of having trouble."
1824,esfp,"Thank you for your words. 💕
It's become more clear to me after hanging out with a lot of INTJs actually.
They dont feel the need for small talk, i get scared to have to do it. They don't care for strangers, i fear them. I worry that people will judge me for being overweight or unattractive or stupid. If i have to make a phone call i worry about not knowing what to say or stumbling over my words. I constantly crave human interaction but worry i am smothering my friends or that they pity me and just tolerate me. If I am the only person standing on the bus i feel like people are staring at me and judging me. I dye my hair and have facial piercings so i tell myself theyre staring at that vs. Staring at me for being ugly or fat.
I guess i would say its fearing being singled out or getting (negative?) attention on me. Is that the jist of it for you?"
1825,esfp,"well in high school I was student body president 10th-12th grade, since then I've been tuning it to better read the person I'm talking to so that I can immediately but on the face of who they'd want to be talking with. It doesn't matter what type of person they are, I am able to have an immediate connection based on only a few words they have said. It makes it really easy to meet people. Drinking at the bars only makes it even easier because my charisma is on hyper drive and there is no limits to my abilities"
1826,esfp,"Yeah, it was that fear of judgement too. I had this glorified image of myself in my head, and all I ever wanted to do was show people that I was a good, fun person. The problem was that every negative reaction cut me to the core because it meant they didn't see me the way I saw myself. It was brought to my attention that it was hurting me a lot, and people would never think the way I want them to. I had to make the conscious decision to get that out of my head, and the paranoia went away. I also noticed that I had a hard time staying in the moment because I was too busy in my head. I started thinking visually instead of verbally, and that really helped keep me in the moment and sure of myself. With our Se dom, we're supposed to ""think"" with our senses, so thinking visually helped get out of my head completely. Give this a read and let me know what you think!"
1827,esfp,"I think the biggest difference is that I am better at reading people nowadays. Half of being charismatic is knowing your audience. I know  what to say to people, and I know what people want to hear. I'm still myself, but I'm a version of myself that people like."
1828,esfp,I so understand what you mean! I think my ego (literal sense of the word) gets hurt or I worry do see me how i see me (which is bad since I'm insecure) so it's something that holds me back. Thanks for the site I'll check it out. 
1829,esfp,"Best job I think I'll ever have in my life. I've been going through a crisis in my career, so I took the easiest part-time job I found, and I'd honestly be happy staying here forever.
I can be impulsive and silly, yet everyone loves it. I'm also attuned to the children's needs, so the harmony between us all is fantastic. 
I know it's a bit of a random post but I've felt comfortable being me for the first time in ages, and I wanted to share the fucking joy. I thought being impulsive and seeking more stimuli than 'normal' wasn't good, I mean my last post is about finding guidance in life, because I didn't know how else to live. 
The truth is: fuck what's good or bad. So long as you ain't hurting anyone, just be true to yourself, because it's what makes you love living. Eventually I'll need to find a career with more hours and better pay, but at least I know what I want in a career and in life."

1832,esfp,"Hello, ISTP here.
My girlfriend of 1.2 years is ESFP.
She moved away from home for study and feels like she doesn't belong. As a result she is a lot more reserved.
She has expressed that this is undesirable. 
She moved here about 4 years ago. She has about 4 close friends, another ~20 normal friends, and a million more acquaintances. Her only family is 1 cousin who she doesn't get along with too well.    
I have been doing my best to try and make her happy here; we go out regularly, and spend time both by ourselves and with other friends. She also sees her friends, without me, regularly.  
She said that she misses high school, where she was constantly surrounded by close friends and classmates.
She's been here 4 years and still can't wait for the holidays so she can go back home. Which is fine, but she's not really comfortable here (she's still able to enjoy herself, though).
It's also been difficult for her to leave behind her family and friends. She misses them a lot.
Has any ESFP here been in a similar situation? What helped you out?
Any pointers and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."
1833,esfp,"Patience. Make sure you're making her feel secure. Go with her next time she goes to see family. Show how you fit in and that you're also part of that home feeling. Are you very affectionate? Are her friends easy to confide in? We're very private people. And for us to feel at home is very important. 4 years is a long time to feel out of your comfort zone. Exercise together. Cuddle a lot. 
We're strange, I feel. It's like a switch with us. We will be completely unsure and then suddenly bam we decide to change something drastically. Keep trying! "
1834,esfp,"Yep, I always try my best to make her feel secure.
And in fact I am going with her to see her family in less than a week (for the first time).
I'm very physically affectionate, I hug a lot.
We have been going to the gym and doing other execises together too :)  
Maybe I just need to keep it up then. 
Thanks for the advice.
Edit: 
She generally doesn't have an issue talking with me about private things.
I'm quite happy she feels comfortable doing that :) 
To be honest I've never really talked at length to her friends about her. I do also consider them my friends, after having spent a decent amount of time with them.  
She does speak to her friends about issues and whatnot with her life (including relationship things).
Her most valued friend, I feel, is her mum. They typically call daily for around 10 mins and talk about what's happened, any issues, etc."
