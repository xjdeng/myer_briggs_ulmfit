0,estj,"About 1-2 weeks ago, my boyfriend started having an existential crisis. It's been weeks and he still is really distressed from it, like especially at night while he's working/studying (related subjects) he'll start thinking about it. I (infj) try to approach the situation by asking him to describe what specifically he is thinking and what he's worried about. He's not very good at talking about his feeling so all I've managed to get out of him is ""what happens when we die?"" and ""I'm so scared and confused about not existing"". I used to feel like this when I was younger, and have now accepted death is inevitable and am comfortable with the idea of non-existence for myself. So I try to comfort him by telling him that he will find his own answers some day, telling him about my opinions on the matter, and how I got to where I am (on the matter). It doesn't seem to be working as what I'm doing seems to make him not want to tell me any more about it, other than when he's having the crisis. He's talking to other people about it, which is good, but I really want to help as well. I feel helpless but I really want to help him get through this together, but I'm not sure at all how to approach this situation!
Tl;dr, partner has been having existential crisis for weeks and what I'm trying to do has caused him to stop sharing with me. What do I do?"
1,estj,"My ex-boyfriend, who was also an ESTJ (I'm an INFJ), would go into bouts of dark thoughts. It was scary because he was such a rock most of the other times.
ESTJs do worry a lot. But they're also problem solvers so their worries keep them working and solving problems until they are no longer problems. 
With existential problems such as his, I think gently having him engage with more people and in the social life would be the best. They tend to recede into solitude when sad. That's actually not a good spot for them for an extended period of time.
Give him some positive ego boosting support so he know you're on his side for everything. We INFJs are great at that! And if he's not comfortable, just let him solve his own thoughts. We don't have to be counsellors all the time. We can just be a cheerleader :)"
2,estj,"It's frustrating talking to people who are completely ignorant about personality type and most people are. That's the attraction and appeal to personality type based communities, you talk with like minded people who are aware and have an active interest in it. So what we are seeking to attain is a Typology/Personality type, Ennegram aware community that has a great balance between banter/casual conversations and serious discussion/typology. All feedback is appreciated. Join and check us out, we are very friendly and welcoming.
You can join by clicking here."
3,estj,"I work with someone who claims to be an INTJ and he is overbearing, arrogant, judgmental, and won't hesitate to trash traits he doesn't agree who in front of anyone else. It is incredibly annoying and frustrating.
At the same time, he is highly intelligent, logic driven, and very, very helpful."
4,estj,"I am an ESTJ and have an INTJ mother. She is one of my best friends, but also the one person who can drive me absolutely crazy. She is very controlling and opinionated, and when she believes in something, that is the way it is. Period. However, I do appreciate how objective she is when I have an issue I am trying to resolve with work or someone else close to me. "
5,estj,"I'm an INTJ and my father is an ESTJ (at least I suspect). We get along really well and always have. Only things I get annoyed at are how he's always pointing out things in the environment that I couldn't care less about. Like ""look at that roof it needs repairing"". Why would I care about some random dude's roof? I'm guessing this is his sensing at work. He is seriously out of control with this and does it all the time. I don't know how he notices some of the things he points out.
He also has a tendecy to ramble on and on and I can just tune him out and give the occasional yep and he'll go for hours. I kind of like this though because I am more introverted. And he gets impatient easily and can't stand a lack of care for household items. He'll keep old things forever and try to reuse things whereas I'll spill water on something and want to throw it away.
I think we get along really well because we see the big picture in a similar way. We both like to keep emotions out of decision making and just put our heads down and get the job done. We both absolutely despise manipulative people and can sense them from a mile away. We both love watching shows like shark tank, the profit, and american pickers together. That's about all I can think of for now, maybe I'll add more tomorrow if I can think of anything."
6,estj,"I'm an INTJ and my workplace almost kicked me out because of this. I had no idea I was a burden at all. I've been stepping trying so hard to avoid stepping on eggshells for about a year now. Please, I beg of you, even if you think it's obvious... tell me what this INTJ did specifically to trash on others' traits.
I feel like that's what others thought I was doing, when I was only trying to bring discussion and to be proven wrong to learn. I don't do that now, but I don't do much of anything anymore either."
7,estj,"Communication problems. I have 2 of them as colleagues and I don't think they express themselves well enough and sometimes they simply would not bother communicating (even when it's standard procedure to report their progress) at all, which is frankly highly irresponsible when you have to work in a group."
8,estj,"I'm just using my intuition freely right now. These aren't strong opinions or solid conclusions. This is a tiny window into the gears in my head.
It's because of the lack of care others put into any discussion we're having. We aren't smarter, but we spent over 30 minutes sitting still and thinking before making a decision. When the others we talk to only spent 15 minutes thinking about something, it's so hard. Either they blindly trust us for practicality. Or I have try to explain my 15 minutes of thinking that led me to my decision, in less than a minute. Then it's like I'm lecturing them all the time. If groups had a platform that made it easier to lay down our thoughts, this would fix the problem. Design the group to work only for people who know how to express themselves, and those are the only kind of people that work well in the group. INTJs can be incredibly helpful. I admit it blows my mind people don't consider INTJs when designing how to run groups. Yes, they're much more rare to come across. But it's inefficient to not include them in your plans. Having an INTJ try to make up for the lack of thought takes away almost 50% of their time and efforts from things that actually have to do with their day to day workload.
Do you agree? Disagree? Am I an opinionated asshole? I never know what non-N types think of me. I want to know and want to do more than wish it was easier."
9,estj,"It's quite a specific situation you're speaking of, surely there are circumstances where people actually care about what the conversation they actively participated in is about?
But still, it seems that what troubles you the most is how you're communicating with the other participants of the conversation. No one wants to hear someone rambling on, sure, and no one wants to accept an opinion with no apparent base or context whatsoever. It's how conversation works, really. One just have to make oneself understood without boring other people. It's conversation skills."
10,estj,"Oh. I like that. So others don't like that. Thank you.
The problem though is that conversation skills aren't taught. They're assumed to have been worked on throughout our lives. As if it's a natural thing to do. No, it's natural for your personality type to communicate with other sensors. And the majority are sensors. Simply that. Nothing more. Nothing less.
Guide us through it. We want to learn. Don't be judgemental, especially everybody in the room all at once.. you'll burn us to the ground.
Our rambling is our attempt to have conversation.
Does this make sense?"
11,estj,"To put this on the rather extreme side, to make a conversation efficient and to don't lose everyone's interest, every word you utter needs to support a point that's not established before- AKA be succinct and to the point, make a mental note of things you want to get through beforehand, etc.
Skills could be taught and practiced, otherwise they would be traits or features rather than ""skills."" "
12,estj,"Hello! 
I need some advice about a coworker who I believe is an ESTJ for a couple of reasons:


He has a strong presence. As in I sense the dominance and I'm just a little marshmallow. üòÇüëçüèª


He's very articulate in the way he speaks. I asked him once, ""How was your weekend?"" And he said, ""It was pretty uneventful."" I like his word choices though. Also when he talks to people, he's so smooth. The way he can add on to the conversations so easily, I'm shocked. 


His facial expressions can be very... serious. Like he's a serious person.


He said he didn't believe in ghosts. Okay this one isn't really a trait lol but just wanted to add it in as in he has strong beliefs?


*I thought he could be an ESFJ, but I don't see him as a feeler.
This is what I need help with:
I've noticed he's taken a liking to me. It really became clear when he asked me about my future goals and rarely anybody ask me questions about me so I was flattered. The way he tries to compose himself with this serious persona but I know he's a bit nervous talking to me. I accidentally flirted with him out of nervousness and shyness of him liking me lol. I hope I not giving him missignals because I'm unsure of my feelings of him.
But at least he laughs at my jokes lolol. üëçüèª
I'm an ENFP (sometimes I feel like an INFP but idk anymore) and I can't decide to pursue him or not. I've found I dont do quite well with ESTJ/ISTJ's but for some reason I like how he's so grounding and the way he makes me calm. Like I'm going to his level of energy in a way? 
Also, he's transferring in a month and I don't know if I should make something out of it or not. üòï"
13,estj,"I'm an ENFP(m) dating an ESTJ(f) for 5 years now. Though it has its challenges, it is absolutely worth it. Like talking about anything touchy, feely is very hard for her. On the othere hand, there is a very easy open communication possible between us, which makes things great. Her absolute 
 stability is great when I'm being chaotic again. And ESTJ's are great at helping you make choices, which can be hard as ENFP.
So be open, honest and blunt with him, he'll appreciate it. Just ask him out and see where it goes :), he will probably fall for your childish charm ;)! "
14,estj,"Lots or simulation games or any video game with a sense of progression ,where I feel my time invested is getting somewhere and picking up random hobbies with a learning curve  (languages, water skiing,paddleboarding), fun to me is feeling im improving and getting better at something."
15,estj,"ESTJ, Self-Preservation 8w7
I receive this typing often but those who've typed me don't know that I break some big stereotypes / have some characteristics which most ESTJs don't possess
Bossy, controlling, natural leader
I'm good at leading / managing ppl but I don't always want to lead unless I know I'll excel (ie if I suck at biology I won't lead a group project). When I lead I'm not bossy / controlling I just get things done quickly and efficiently
Blunt and confrontational
I'm aware of what's rude so I don't have the tendency to say things that can offend others. I'm not all that straight forward to prevent drama. I don't confront / get into conflict with ppl Idk often bc I'm uncomfortable arguing with ppl Idk unless it's online. I believe not confronting others is mainly due to appearance insecurities bc I'm quite confrontational and open to conflict online
Sensitive to criticism
I'm often described as defensive bc ppl will say something that wasn't meant to be rude but I'd take it the wrong way and get pissed. Criticism doesn't make me sad it just makes me really mad. I believe this is due to narcissism
Easily stressed
ESTJs are stereotyped to be very high achieving and can handle working a lot but I get stressed easily and frequently. I find myself most stressed when I can't get things done quickly and have time to relax
Lazy, slightly hedonistic
I get all my work done but I just put in enough effort to barely get As. I have all As but I don't take honors or advanced classes bc I want to do little work and enjoy life. Though I want to enjoy life I still take obligations seriously
Comfortable with my emotions
When I find myself upset I allow myself to cry and wallow in my emotions. I just won't allow others to see me crying
Can I still be ESTJ (SP 8w7) with these characteristics?"
16,estj,"ESTJ here.
I get this. I really do want to do well, but I often find myself procrastinating on doing a task. A lot of people immediately assume I don't procrastinate because on the surface I look like I'm very organised. However, if it's the night before a project is due and I've procrastinated up until that point, I'll be willing to stay up until 3 AM to finish it if I have to.
I'm comfortable with my emotions. I don't cry a lot just because I don't feel the need to, but when I do cry, that's okay."
17,estj,"I'm sensitive to unhelpful criticism and will probably get defensive. However, I do feel I require constructive criticism, especially in my work, and actively seek that out.
I'm easily stressed, but I find that's when I work my best. I like a bit of stress, it keeps me focused."
18,estj,"I had a similar situation to that. I had to write a short report on a picture from WW2 every week. Each individual one didn't take that long to write so it should've been fine, but technically they only all had to be in at the end of the term. In the three days before they were due, I must've spent almost 24 hours on those reports. It also didn't help that I'm an ultra-perfectionist, I had to re-read each report up to five times before I was willing to submit it. But after all that procrastinating, I still did very well. I blame them for my procrastination, they're enablers :P"
19,estj,"Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!
https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/92ynz1/academic_temperament_and_humor_all_over_14_welcome/"
20,estj,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESTJ personality type? Instead of ‚Äútraits or characteristics‚Äù that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
21,estj,"I am with an ESTJ. We drive each other crazy. And often not in a good way. Of course, we've been together over a decade, so that says something too.
I find he keeps me grounded, and makes me step back and rethink some of my crazy ideas - if he can tolerate listening to them. Sometimes he shuts me down too fast. The idea of changing something makes him stressed, even when nothing has changed yet. 
We discovered it was best to clearly communicate when I was just ""thinking"" and when I was actually wanting to implement something. Also, we had to learn to communicate clearly when either of us had committed to something. Sometimes, he would think we'd made a plan, and I thought we were just brainstorming. ;)
All in all, it has been both a good and bad pairing. I sometimes wish I had someone who was more willing to be flexible and dive deep into interesting subjects with me - but I have friendships that help me to accomplish that. He is solid. Like, totally dependable. He is my rock, and I have learned to appreciate the benefits of discipline and stability (even when they are thrust upon me). He has learned to lighten up, and I have helped soften his rough edges - especially with relationships with other people.
That's just a smidgen of insight, but we are evidence the pairing can work. Many people have admired our relationship, as there has been a lot (LOT) of give and take, but it's more iron sharpening iron. You just have to be willing to accept and appreciate the differences, because if you wanted to, you could focus on the negatives and get in a mire pretty quickly.
Side note: Unfortunately, NT and NFs tend to dominate the internet forums related to Myers Briggs. (I think the SPs are out actually living life, and the SJs are out making sure they're doing it correctly without killing themselves...) Because of that, you'll find quite a bit of 'S' bashing - and especially SJ since they are practically the exact opposite of NTs in many ways. This is unfortunate, since SJs are the ones that have the patience and discipline to follow through with the day to day realities of life and help keep and restore order when our crazy ideas don't quite materialize in the way we anticipated. ;)"
22,estj,"I've got an ESTJ friend. He's pretty much a big swingin' penis all the time but he's also willing to take criticism which is always a good thing. It seems the best way we get along is through building off of the others views on people/society.
Then again, we're two straight guys so I don't know how much my input applies. I THINK we're straight anyway. I tend to attract either gender and if he really wanted to, I guess I'd poke his hackeysack. "
23,estj,"I'm super late to the party, but hey.
My ENTP boyfriend is the most unexpected, wonderful thing honestly. We balance each other very well. Then again, I have this weird subconscious thing for ENTP's. My best friend, ex boyfriend, and current boyfriend are ENTP's, and my ex girlfriend is an ENTJ. I like sniff them out or something lol.
Anyways, as far as good things go:
ENTP's get really deeply excited about things, which is good, because ESTJ's often feel silly expressing that sort of thing so it gives us permission to let loose.
ENTP's are very creative, and ESTJ's can thrive off of this by putting their ideas into actions and helping to trim and shape them.
ENTP's are never boring to be around, and are generally down for socializing, although they need more introvert time than we do.
ESTJ's are ENTP rocks. Treat one well, care for them, help them plan, and the ENTP will always do right by you. ESTJ's are extremely reliable, which is great, because ENTP's tend to be less stable.
Potential problems:
ENTP's /do not/ plan. Like, hardly ever. This can be stressful.
ENTP's and ESTJ's can both be bery awkward in outward expressions of emotion until that barrier is broken, although I think ENTP's less so.
It can be difficult for the ESTJ to understand the ENTP sometimes, because they're off in weird intuitive land and we're trying to keep up. They also have a terrible habit of half smirking 24/7 which is hard to interpret until you've been with them long enough.
ENTP's might find a more strict ESTJ a buzzkill, so that relationship won't go anywhere.
Many ESTJ's have a huge pet peeve for people not putting in their share of the work. ENTP's have a nasty habit of procrastinating and just plain shirking their work, and this may drive an ESTJ up the wall.
Overall, I love my partner, I wouldn't want anyone else, but tbh I'm not sure this pairing is for everyone. Treasure your ENTP's though, guys."
24,estj,"ENTP married to an ESTJ (with ENTJ tendencies) here. We argue a lot. Most of the time it isn't even because we're angry with each other; we just have very strong differing opinions and have to intellectually duke it out until one of us admits the other is right. Don't be afraid of the arguments as long as they are respectful and yielding productive results.
Which is one great thing about an ESTJ--they have the stamina to argue the point and the graciousness and logic to concede when incorrect (I try to do the same).
Something that pisses me off is--as another redditor pointed out--even the suggestion of change to their plans is enough to get them all bent out of shape. LAME!
But another great thing is their ability to take care of day-to-day details. I am notoriously terrible at stupid things like getting paperwork turned in on time, taking out trash, etc. My ESTJ spouse keeps my life running! We often joke that I'd be living under a bridge somewhere if I weren't married to him.
We've finally reached a point where we're learning to meet each other in the middle for many things, but it wasn't always that way. We broke up several times before we decided to nut up about our differences and take the plunge. "
25,estj,"Thanks so much for replying! I actually did notice that because when I searched the internet for SJ and SP information, it seemed a little too sparse, but in an odd way. Then I realized most of them probably are just doing their thing and not thinking about the Myers Brigg tests like the NTs and the NFs. Haha.
This is a great insight, I really appreciate it. I've recently started dating an ESTJ and there has definitely been a lot of ups and downs. Even though I'm ENTP, there are a lot of times when I am pretty emotional or more sensitive, but I think it's a result of over thinking the simple nuances of everyday actions. It seems that he doesn't even realize a lot of the ""hidden"" things I gleam up on, simply because he's not even aware of those things. Or they just don't even exist in the way he views the world, but it's really hard for me to put myself in his shoes so I've been doing some research. 
He's actually leaving for two years soon, and I don't think this is something that could be long distance for that long. I don't think the way our personalities are would allow for such a thing, but we'll see how it goes. "
26,estj,"I happen to be an ENFJ male with an ESTJ girlfriend. Many of the things you said were shockingly similar to our relationship. I think we're brainstorming plans, and she thinks we've made them! She has helped me be a little more selfish (in a good way, so I'm not such a pushover) and I've helped her learn how to explore her empathy. When we fight, we resolve it very quickly because we're very good at being explicitly honest with each other in the best way possible. "
27,estj,"The ESTJs and INFJs are like polar opposites, maybe even more so than ESTP and INFJ. They wouldn't understand you, and they'd see everything you do as illogical or impractical because they are wired differently."
28,estj,"You tend to be irrational idealists that seek undermine established natural order and traditions for mainly emotive reasons. It indicates lack of self-control and logical thinking.
Your idealistic sense of morality often leads to decisions that favour out-groups. Hence you make decisions that are not in the best interests of the community and the tribe. 
I consider your type as dysfunctional and dangerous humans and would keep a close eye on or purge entirely."
29,estj,That's.. your opinion but usually we don't know what others think about us/how we come off. We tend to be one of the most self actualized type.
30,estj,"As an INFJ dating an ESTJ, I find this post pretty interesting. I do believe that at times my ESTJ finds me frivolous, child-like, too idealistic, and overbearingly emotional for his liking. But he manages to harness his harsh honesty when we disagree, unlike many ESTJs who seem rather unwilling to attempt a friendship or even a mutual acceptance with an INFJ. We both work hard to communicate openly and honestly so as to minimize misunderstandings. "
31,estj,"Hm, this makes sense.  I'm sort of new to the types and I've just been exploring subreddits.  this is the first subreddit where I experienced some hostility.  Totally unexpected.  Thanks for your moderate and cogent answer:) "
32,estj,"There are contexts within which the relative strengths of any type shine.  My boss is an ESTJ and he's great in many situations, especially at the current company I work for.  While very intelligent in many ways, he struggles mightily with understanding systems in sufficient detail to improvise.  He is very much a ""broad strokes"" thinker, which is good in many respects for management, but simply flat out fails to fully even understand the concept of ""nuance"", which is a fatal error when it comes to software development.  
Personally I would much rather collaborate with an INFJ, and leave him to hold down the fort where innovation, and nuance, aren't required.    
Those statements aren't logically linked or supported by history.  Again going back to innovation: it was ""out groups"" who fomented a separation of church and state, and drove the scientific revolution.  You wouldn't be reading this were it not for out-groups.    
What does that mean?  "
33,estj,"I have a legitimate question about this: With Fe as the INFJ's second function, which extremely dislikes conflict, favors group harmony, and puts consideration of the group over the self, how does that fit with your assessment? I agree that Ni makes an INFJ's morality highly individualistic, but it tends to find expression within established groups and making necessary changes without undue strife or upset. I agree that an INFJ could consider abolishing a system and starting over if it were too broken to fix, but otherwise they work within the comfort zone of their society."
34,estj,"yeah I guess I just meant because our Fi is less developed.  Also, it seems we spend so much time trying to know and understand others that we usually ignore ourselves.  At least that's what I've read but obviously I'm not an expert or anything:)"
35,estj,Haha I dunno we don't tend to be close.  I've worked with a few and they're not my least favorite type to work with by far... but yeah never been tight and people are different.  They do tend to be VERY concerned with what has been done before or by other people they respect rather than wanting to figure shit out... which means I don't like being managed by them.  
36,estj,"This is how my INFJ friend was. He called me a coward for following the beaten path. Unhealthy INFJs are so quick to reject the suggested path and go on their own road regardless of what is good for them or for the group. Get your head out of the clouds and come back to reality. You came to an ESTJ subreddit, a type known to dislike your kind, and started attacking us. Get out of here."
37,estj,"INTJ here and that is SUCH an INFJ response. Got into a rather frustrating conflict with an INFJ friend/acquaintance of mine and basically lacked any awareness or feelings of personal responsibility for their contribution to the interaction. Maddening. 
That said, INFJs help emotionally constipated people like me express emotions, so y'all can be thankful they're just one of the rarest types."
38,estj,"This obviously (I couldn't think of a better word other than horoscope).
Why are you attempting to guess (or devine) my life circumstances?"
39,estj,"Hi,
Whenever I am reading review of the restaurant (tripadvisor for example), I get annoyed when a person describes the dish, but does not mention the price of it. To me it is absolutely crucial information and I do not understand how it would not be for anyone else.
Let me explain why - you read a review about the dish, see its photos. And in order to decide if that is a good deal (and if you'd consider visiting) you must know the price. Simplified example to get the point - lets say the average price of x dish in the city is 10 euros. So depending on the pricing you would know if it was a good deal (and worth visiting) or not. If it is 15eur, then maybe skip that place, if it is 7 eur - super deal and priority visit.
Restaurant reviews without price mentioning is almost useless to me, because how would you know the value?
Can anyone relate? I am curious if this is something of ESTJ thing, or just me thing (I value everything via price/quality ratio).
‚Äã
Ps: I also get a facepalm moment when someone writes ""price for two with drinks was X"". I am like - wtf, do you know that drinks have various pricing and you di not even mention how many of those you got. It is completely useless information, how can anyone not understand that when they write it."
40,estj,"Well, I don't really trust reviews, to begin with. 
People aren't thorough or detailed about why they gave it 2 stars.


Didn't like the color (2 stars) That has nothing to do with the product. What about the quality? The fit? 


Ordered the wrong size (1 star) Again, YOUR FAULT. Or when they say they ordered small and they complain it was too tight, like I'm sorry you lack the ability, to be honest about how big you might be. Not trying to sound so negative, but some people just cannot accept they are bigger than they think. 


Didn't know this was part of the jacket (1 start) --- You FAILED to read the description about the 
article of clothing, that does not warrant you the right to give it one star 


Also, you can agree with a review on Amazon or say you found the review helpful which I find very misleading because all you need is an account, not proof of actually buying the product or knowing anything about it. So you could get a bunch of people agreeing that the product sucks when they have NO knowledge regarding the matter. That's a great way for competitors to come in and ruin reviews. 
I just have serious trust issues with reviews because I rarely have issues with items I buy. And having a background in business I know companies will pay people to do reviews, both good and bad. 
And don't forget Yelp. The most untrustworthy of them all. 
Seriously I could go on and on about how much I hate product reviews. Leaving out the price isn't that big of a deal, it's not understanding how to give a fair review that I hate.  "
41,estj,"If you have some critical thinking you can well have a full picture about something if you have enough reviews. If you have only 1 or 3, sure, you can not trust. But if you read 30-50, you can easily have the correct picture about something.
But lets end the off topic here."
42,estj,"IA with it being quick and to the point. You...might want to have a bulleted list of reasons why your PERSONALITIES are incompatible (because to an ESTJ, it can often feels like if someone ""really"" cared about something, they would do their best to bear the discomfort and change their actions for harmony). Explain that it's not fair to ask either of you to do things that make you unhappy, and that sometimes even when you care about each other, the dynamic can get so fraught with fundamental differences that it grows into plain resentment on both your parts. 
You'll be okay, and you should feel no shame in wanting this for yourself. Even if he doesn't react the best, you are right to want something different. Trust me, he'll eventually realize the breakup makes sense, once the initial emotions patter out."
43,estj,"We end up laughing after I've spent an hour explaining why he is so harsh to live with. He's so funny that I can't help it. Then the next day, he'll lose his mind over something small like a light-switch being left on and we're back to square one. He must control everything..."
44,estj,"Don't expect them to ask you out, do it yourself, ESTJs love that.  We also suck at picking up hints. 
ESTJs are commonly found in some sort of community or group and it's going to be a hobby they probably enjoy. 
They are also very likely to spend the majority of their time working"
45,estj,"This whole idea is so foreign to me. I can‚Äôt imagine sniffing around for a particular type and hoping they want to date me. 
I‚Äôm not a dude, but I don‚Äôt hang out anywhere in particular. I go out in the world to do the things and then I leave.

48,estj,"Hello dear ESTJ's. I'm an INTP man married to an ESTJ woman. We are having a lot of problems in our marriage and sometimes it seems like we just don't understand each other. Could you guys help? Any and all information would be greatly appreciated. In particular: what makes you most happy in a partner? What annoys you? If anyone is in a relationship with an INTP, how does that work out? What do they do that's great? What could improve? 
It often seems like my wife wants me to behave in a certain way, but it's never clear what that way is. It's almost like she expects me to follow some hidden script that she has in her mind. Does this ring any bells? Is there some particular code that I'm supposed to follow?
Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
49,estj,"Idk if this is fully a MBTI problem but seems like you two have a communication problem. I can tell you what makes me happy and what annoys me, but you should probably be asking your wife about her own needs and dislikes. Take the time to listen to her and share your own desires. If you both can't do that, that's where a lot of the problems lie."
50,estj,"I am an ESTJ (female) married to an INTP (male). We actually took legit MBTI tests before we married. The pastor who married us sat us down and discussed with us our results and what it would mean for our relationship. Here's what he said:
The T is where you will get along the most, and understand each other the most. If you were not both Ts, this relationship would be very difficult. 
The place where you will clash the most is in the E and the I. Try to compromise with each other here - noting that the E might go out without the I every now and then. But that it is still important that the I come along for important things. 
Obviously those tips might differ depending on your percentages for each letter. But I do remember him saying that the SJ and NP are compliments. Which makes intuitive sense, since one of you will ask the questions while the other makes the plans. 
My husband does a really great job at listening to what I am saying and considering it. Sometimes we might dance around the root issue... Often times I don't even know what I am really upset about until I stop to think about it (probably the S in me). But once we get to the root issue, we always come up with a compromise. ""I understand you want the dishes done everyday. But, can you try to understand that stresses me out? I can work on doing the dishes more regularly, and being more aware of when you need my help.""
This reminds me of another issue we came across... I would get so mad that he ignored me doing chores to avoid helping. What was really going on; he was just caught up in what he was doing, and didn't even stop to think about what I might be doing, slamming cupboard doors in the other room. 
Make sure you are both talking, and both working. If she finds a way for you to be better, great. But she can't expect that much of you. She has got to know how much pressure and disrespect that puts on you. Let her know you are trying, but that you need her support and understanding too. Hope that helps!"
51,estj,"I have no idea how you two ended up legally bound to one another. The very idea of staying that close to an INTP is a slow, painful annoying death(for me at least). Anyways the advice I can give is pretty limited but I hope it helps in a way. 
When I was dating an INTP, I think the main problem in our relationship was communication. It was very reminiscent of my younger brother who is also an INTP. He was very independent and felt little to no reason to share with me the decisions he made or even why he made them. I could have, and I did on many occasions, explicitly told him why something made me upset and he would never express that he was ""sorry"" in a way I could tell was truly apologetic.
The bit about how your wife wants you to behave in a certain way & having a hidden script is true cause that's exactly what I wanted from my ex. But every time I asked him to make small changes he would ignore it and keep doing whatever he was doing. He would never do or even entertain the idea of changing to better our partnership. 
The week after I broke up with my ex was the most ""progressive"". He communicated with me like I asked a number of times before. He attempted to include me in his decision making, it wasn't perfect but the step forward meant a lot to me. Ultimately he asked for me to come back. I did and surely enough he did the exact same bullshit. I broke up with him again and he still won't leave me alone. Long and short of it is: I will never go down that road again, fuck all that bullshit. 
And if I'm being really honest, your relationship is a ticking time bomb before she says fuck you and all your bullshit. I will happily be wrong though, maybe you two have something my ex & I didn't. 
Note: Everything I'm saying here is from personal experience. Every ESTJ won't feel the same and vice versa blah blah. "
52,estj,"ENTP married to an ESTJ here. I know we are not the same, but as an ENTP I likely share some of your same pitfalls.
I'd say for my husband, the thing he most values is thoughtfulness, and it's really easy for him to interpret my spontaneity and inability to communicate my thought process in a step-by-step fashion as somehow thoughtless. He expects me to behave as a partner and to have his back, but if I think he's wrong I'll tell him so, and I'll debate him on it. That can make him feel I don't put him and our relationship in the central place it deserves. But, I take nothing as sacred. Just because I love someone doesn't meant I'll have their back if they're wrong.
Anyway, I think we had to really learn how not to interpret the others behaviours as being about us, but being about our individual differences. My husband has to accept I'll have his back if I think he's right, but that's not because I don't love him. I have to remember to include him and be straightforward during situations that involve planning or logistics.
Ask me anything you want to know about how we relate to one another. Happy to help."
53,estj,"Thank you for your answer. I did ask my wife as well, but we seem to end up in conversations that I find hard to understand. That's why I figured I would try it this way, to see if I could learn something useful."
54,estj,"""I could have, and I did on many occasions, explicitly told him why something made me upset and he would never express that he was ""sorry"" in a way I could tell was truly apologetic.""
This is definitely something I recognize. When my wife and I have discussions or disagreements and I realize that I have done something wrong, I will apologize. But very often she will not accept my apologies... like she wants me to go through some kind of humiliating process of atonement before she will accept that I truly want to change my behavior. While I would never ask that from her, because I don't want her to feel humiliated, I also don't know what exactly counts as proper atonement or properly saying I'm sorry. When I ask my wife she will say vague things like ""you have to really mean it"". But I don't understand what parameters she uses to decide that I ""really mean it"". Could you enlighten some  more? What would you count as properly saying you're sorry?
""The bit about how your wife wants you to behave in a certain way & having a hidden script is true cause that's exactly what I wanted from my ex. ""
Well, I'm really glad to hear that at least that part is true. But how does that work? How am I supposed to know the script if it's hidden? How was your ex supposed to figure it out?
When you asked your ex to change, did he outright say that he did not want to? Or did he try and fail? Or did he say he would try and forget? I think my wife thinks that she should be able to ask me to change something one time and then if I agree it should be changed for all eternity. Well, I don't know about you people but I don't work like that: I need time to change my habits and I need time to understand what exactly it is that needs changing and how that would work. But my wife seems to think it's just a matter of flipping a switch and then it's changed. Does that sounds recognizable to you?
You seem to be quite sure about your relationship with your ex not working, yet you were somehow attracted to him in the beginning. Could you reflect on that? Did he change? Did he deceive you in the beginning?
Thank you for your thoughtful and honest response and thanks in advance for any additional insight you would be willing to share. "
55,estj,It's hard for INTPs and ENTPs (which I am) to include you in our decision making because it's not a linear process. I almost never purposefully decide something in a way that I could include someone. It just sort of happens. That's the P vs J.
56,estj,"Look at you, knowing each and every intimate detail of every interaction between OP and his wife.  You definately fit the stereotypical ESTJ stereotypes.  Since we're having an unsolicited negative feedback party here, just thought I'd throw in my two cents."
57,estj,"Hi there. ENTP woman married to ESTJ man.
You'll note if you read through this sub that ESTJs often respond to these types of questions by saying they don't think it's MBTI related and is just an issue with your personal dynamic. Ostensibly, if they're like my husband, they don't really buy into MBTI much at all, which is why this sub is so dead I'd wager. "
58,estj,"You apologize? Just like that? Interesting. I would have been happy with a hug and an ""I'm sorry babe"". But for your wife, she could be using humiliation as a teaching technique (cruel & unusual but it must have worked for her a few times somewhere if she keeps doing it) try this: ""Wife, I'm sorry I [insert actions]. It was upsetting and I will do better. How can I make it up to you?"" Also figure out her ""love language"" because you may need to buy her a gift, spend time with her, say kind words, hug her, etc based on her love language ( http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/ ). 
In regards to the script, mine wasn't meant to be figured out because I'm still writing it. I'm making it up as I go. It's just something I held it in my head, you either fit it or you don't. Simple as that. If you don't fit the script, it's easier to change the actor than change what I think is an already phenomenal script. When I tried to change my ex, there just wasn't any effort. I would first ask him why does he do that, then I would suggest he do something else instead. It was like talking to the wall. 
""I think my wife thinks that she should be able to ask me to change something one time and then if I agree it should be changed for all eternity."" 
That's the point, she shouldn't have to remind like a child to keep changing if you already agreed to it. You said you'd do it and you're not, so now she has enough reason to believe you're not going to change.
""Well, I don't know about you people but I don't work like that: I need time to change my habits and I need time to understand what exactly it is that needs changing and how that would work. But my wife seems to think it's just a matter of flipping a switch and then it's changed. Does that sounds recognizable to you?"" 
Yes it's recognizable and I'm happy I dodged that bullet. All that happens is you overthink it to the point that you see nothing wrong with what you were doing prior to her asking you to change. So you keep doing the same thing. Which, after you already agreed to changing it, IS ANNOYING and counterproductive.
""You seem to be quite sure about your relationship with your ex not working, yet you were somehow attracted to him in the beginning. Could you reflect on that? Did he change? Did he deceive you in the beginning?""
We met online, he was a different person online. Online he was persistent, and determined to get to know me even though I blew him off a few dozen times. He'd volunteer sharing parts of his day and asked how mine went. But when the time finally came to meet in person he was extremely introverted and wasn't talkative at all. He gradually got more comfortable with me but it's like he'd do a completely flip in his personality online and in person. Which is why I got into this mbti stuff; I wanted to understand him more. Do I feel deceived? No I don't. Did he change? Yes but not in any measurable increment that made me want to stay."
59,estj,"Oh, come on. In the OP, he described that they clearly have some communication problems. It's a very relevant factor that instead of having a discussion with his actual wife about how they should proceed, he asks the internet. So no, I don't think I know every interaction between OP and his wife, but in what kind of context would that not be relevant?"
60,estj,"They don't, they will scream out how there are a million personality traits that MBTI doesn't take into account, yet remain utterly transparent regarding their belief that there are only two true personality types.  Valid, like them, and invalid, everyone else."
61,estj,"Indeed.  And it is quite obvious that OP is having discussions with his actual wife, and your snide insinuation of ""look at this guy! Come to intarwebs instead of actual discussion with his actual wife!"" adds nothing to the discussion except probably making you feel superior in that of course, you would be doing things in the correct and logical manner unlike this fool, OP.   It is utterly ridiculous that someone having problems with a ESTJ come to a forum nominally full of such creatures, I absolutely agree.  It is exceedingly obvious that ESTJs have all the right answers and a neverending well of destructive criticism, and it would make more sense to beat one's head against random cars in traffic than to come to /r/estj and hope for any constructive feedback, as you yourself do an exceedingly resplendant job of cementing that stereotypical notion.  Oh, come on."
62,estj,"lol, believe what you want to believe mate. 
I'm sure there are ESTJs in your life that you just haven't typed as ESTJ because of your preconceived notion of how an ESTJ should act. I had a friend who was into MBTI who switched between typing me as ISTJ and ENTJ because gosh, I'm not bad enough to be one of those terrible ESTJs! 
I have good friends of nearly all types (no INFJs or ENTJs unfortunately), and I believe that they're all pretty valid people. Frankly, by claiming a whole personality type is shit, you're kind of limiting your experiences a little bit."
63,estj,"What the fuck?
No, I don't feel superior. I'm saying that their communication problems are pretty obvious if OP believes that an internet forum can tell them more about their relationship than his actual wife.
MBTI can't answer everything. There aren't only 16 personalities in the world. Relationships are complex things, and to suggest that we'd be able to find a better solution for their communication issues than his wife or a friend would be insane.
Thinking I know each and every intimate detail of their interactions would be the only context where I would be able to comment."
64,estj,"I have a roommate I believe is a(n EXTREMELY unhealthy) ESTJ.
I'm an INFJ and preface this by saying I dated an ESTJ for 3 years. When we disagreed, we always just agreed to disagree, and it was never an issue. The coworker I also work most closely and best with is also an ESTJ. So my issue isn't with ESTJs, it's with a particularly unhealthy ESTJ (or simply just an unhealthy person).
With my roommate, she moved in and needs everything to be how she wants it to be at all times, and she has zeroed in on me to bully me. We're fundamentally different. It's more important to her that our house ""look"" like a nice happy place than actually being a nice happy place. For example, she put up Christmas decorations this weekend, but was angry and snapping at anyone who touched them. Her sisters kids came over to help. She yelled at them the entire time, but then made them pose nicely for a picture.
A happy house to me is a place where everyone feels safe and comfortable, even if it's not that organized.
So, she's started narrowing in on me. For example, I put my broken down boxes near our recycling in the kitchen. She will somehow decide this is not okay, and start throwing them down the stairs to my bedroom door.
I am the only one that drinks coffee in the house, and my coffee maker is on the counter plugged in. One day she decided this was not okay, and moved it to the cabinet. I keep putting it back, she keeps moving it.
She will do things like leave her things out where she knows that my cat will urinate on them (because I've explicitly told her, and because he's urinated on mine in the exact same spot) and then complain and demand monetary reimbursment. When I tell her I won't reimburse her because she had all this information beforehand, she flies off the rail and starts telling me she'll take me to small claims court.
In the past, I've complied with her newly enforced ""rules"", like our fridge used to just be where we put food. She organized it and wants everyone to have their own shelf. Okay, sure. I did that. But it's like the more I give in, the more she pushes. She knows no personal boundaries.
It's an excessive need to covertly control, and her lack of respect for other people's living habits in a house in which she is the newest member of. The ONLY thing I have seen her be semi-responsive to is our landlord, who she perceives to be an ""authority figure"".
I realize that unhealthy is just unhealthy, but if anyone has any tips for how to deal with her best, I would love to hear it. So far I have tried to confront her directly, completely ignore her, return the passive aggression. All of these make her completely livid."
65,estj,"My old supervisor was an ESTJ. She publicly took her anger out on me in work after her train was delayed. I didn't respond to avoid giving her the reaction she wanted, then quietly typed an email threatening to report her for bullying. We didn't speak for months and she left. But she was still a complete bitch right up until I said goodbye to her. You can't win with ESTJs - they seek the quieter ones to bolster their egos and need for control. My boyfriend is an ESTJ and is making my life a misery, see my previous posts (I'm an ISFP) x"
66,estj,"ESTJ women are so different from ESTJ men... Sorry I don't have much to offer. I think with this much stress accumulated (and threats like you mention above), I would redirect my energy and focus on finding a new place. Good luck! "
67,estj,"A member of my family is an ESTJ and ALWAYS has to feel in control down to the most minute detail. As an INFP, we fall on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, so this behavior has always been incredibly foreign to me (and sometimes unbearably exhausting). I love her, but could never in a million years imagine living with her. 
Just find another roommate. Some people need other people to push down in order to feel like they're in control‚Äîdon't let that person be you! It's your life."
68,estj,"Oh definitely. Forgot to include that I am looking to move out ASAP, but I live in a city with a housing market similar to SF, so it will take a bit of time.
There was a time when our landlord did talk to her (she got a dog without asking her roommates or him, and he charged her a high pet deposit). She played victim and sulked like a sad puppy for a few days. I know ESTJs seem to respect the status quo, so going the landlord route seemed a good option."
69,estj,"I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.

70,estj,"Hi, I am an INFJ woman in mid 30s, and I have been in a relationship with an ESTJ man in mid 30s for 1.5 years. We are engaged.
We have the most intellectual discussions and have a great connection. However, one thing that constantly gets between us is how emotionally dry he can be sometimes and says insensitive (but super logical and factual) information. I am sure this is a common attribute of ESTJs, but have you ever been convinced by your SO or that being sensitive and less abrasive is actually a positive and necessary attribute in personal relationships?
How do I go about opening this conversation without him cutting me off and saying, ""well, everything I said is true, though""?
Also, do ESTJs readily share personal information to others? Most ESTJs I have come across share their own, their friends', and their families' private information to others, and as a private INFJ, this is a tough one to swallow.
Also, what draws you to us (for those who have INFJ counterparts)?
Thanks in advance!"
71,estj,"I'm an ESTJ female but I can try to give you a little insight. Yes, ESTJs typically live in a world of reason and facts, so the way I consider problems and topics is from a logical perspective and I don't naturally recognize the emotional aspects of a situation right away. My good friend is an ENFP and my mother is an INFJ, however, and they've definitely kind of pushed me to see or consider how people feel in a situation more. 
I would say don't push back on him that he is necessarily wrong (unless he blatantly is) because us ESTJs are stubborn. Instead ask questions like ""well how do you think that makes so and so feel?"" or ""have you considered how the person may feel in the situation"". I can't speak for all ESTJs, or people for that matter, but for me it's not that I'm trying to be insensitive, but I'm just not aware all the time of people's emotions or process those need to be incorporated into the equation. So it helps me when someone else prompts me with questions to dig deeper, beyond the black and white, and I'll usually come to the conclusion or understanding of emotions much better. 
I don't think that's particularly a trait of ESTJs about readily sharing information? I'm very loyal to my friends (I think we're literally typecast as ""the guardian"") and don't share secrets or gossip private information.
Can't speak specifically to dating an INFJ, but as I mentioned, my mom is one and I love her dearly, although we clash sometimes. I enjoy her creative perspective on things, and her very mothering/nurturing side. I'm dating who I think is an ENFJ and I'm drawn to that ability to read people and situations quickly and understand emotions pretty effortlessly.
Hope this helps :)"
72,estj,"Relative to Socionics, an INFJ (Socionics IEI) is going to be the most difficult relationship for an ESTJ, while INFP (Socionics EII) is going to be one of the best and easiest.
We figure out what things to be sensitive about from INFPs through body language and expression. It helps that it is expressed extremely strongly because ESTJs can be very dense, even to our own feelings.
In terms of being sensitive to you in personal conversation or explaining things to other people, ESTJs have a very divisive line and we'll go right up to that line but not beyond it. We also tend to be bad at managing our tone of voice and expression over sensitive issues. Sometimes we can manage it very well, but it isn't consistent."
73,estj,"You seem to be going at this from the idea that you need to meet him halfway, but he is wanting you to meet him only in reality, away from subjective opinions and preferences.  To him, it isn't a matter of abrasion and sensitivity (why should reality offend you?), but a matter of getting things right and correct--of understanding the actual situation you are in.
If he is being logical and factual, and he is right, does that mean you are being somewhat illogical or opinion-based, and that you are somewhat wrong?  Is this desire to label him as insensitive and dry a deflection away from your deficiencies?  
He may not see much point to being sensitive or warm if he thinks you are starting off from a place of irrationality, ignorance, or delusion.  It may be surprising to you, but to him, any effort to be warm and sensitive when he thinks you are quite wrong is patronizing. ""Well, she's wrong about this, but I'm going to be extra nice and careful to her so she doesn't get upset.""  This would be an attitude of superiority and condescension. 
The alternative is to make his opinions/judgments/knowledge plain even where you disagree, which is treating you as an equal who might understand what he is saying and agree, or disagree with good reasons.
For matters that are more subjective, he might not give your opinions much credence if you can't explain to him the basis for them.  Why should someone agree or accept an opinion just because someone else holds it?  To do so would be just giving in and being a doormat."
74,estj,"As an INFP with ESTJ influence on my entire life.
Just like channel Te.  
Just kinda get in his face, logically put down what the fuck is going on, and why he is going to stop being fucking disrespectful.
Then grab his scrotum and drop kick it 5 or 6 times and like laugh.
This will have the effect of like, well, it's kinda random but ESTJ Fi is like......
Anyways ESTJ's have a lot of respect for people who put them in their place.  They may not show it till after a hissy fit and whatever the opposite of silent treatment is....but that's how they ultimately learn.  
As an INFP with reverse function order I don't have that luxory.  When I was a still-inebriated alcoholic I would black out and like lost my Fi block on being a fucking dick for no reason, was basically a retarded ESTJ.  So I'd wake up in the morning having no idea why I apparantly got the shit kicked out of me, like, I can't even learn the lesson like ESTJ's.  I did quit drinking 7 months ago but anyways.
Good luck, and I mean that.  ESTJ's are like the best people to have in your life, as generally they really deserve to be treated with respect (opposite of above) as they really go out of their way to be awesome when you are on their team or a loved one."
75,estj,"INFJs are among the most difficult for me as well, INFP.
I swear they have a logical reason for like what they believe or do or feel or accuse me of feeling or whatever.
I just have not a fucking clue whatsoever what the fuck that logical reason is.
I am pretty much obsessed with INFJ and the 4 functions we don't have as INFP or ESTJ.  I am going to figure this out.  But ya sometimes I need a break.
I appreciate your reassuring validation regarding my ability to cognate, and back at you.  I often do realize if I could just be more like my Dad, holy cow my life would be a lot more less nuts, less chaotic."
76,estj,"Thanks for the reply. My point isn't that he should choose irrationality/opinions above his logical reasoning. I guess I should've given an example to demonstrate what I mean. For instance, last month, I got a huge allergy flare and had a weekend with stuffed nose, coughing, and itchy eyes. I'm rarely the type to get sick or complain about sickness, but this was a bad one. So I talked to him about it. What I got in reply was all the ways I could've avoided this flare, e.g. taking medications before the flare, not going to places where my allergies will be triggered, etc. He was 100% correct and logical in everything he said (and hence I have no argument against it), but I wish he had shown some empathy for how weak I was feeling that weekend. Maybe order some food for me, or grab a cup of water, or say something like, ""oh you just feel terrible."" I just felt like I was being lectured more tha cared for. And that made me a bit sad.
In another instance, I had watched a foreign movie that had a very dramatic but touching ending. I was moved by it and shared the story with him. He went on to talk about why it isn't a good ending and thus being touched by it does't really make sense. I tried to explain that that was merely my response to it, but he logically explained why the story wouldn't make sense in real life. Again, I had nothing to say because he is stating facts... 
I'm not here to trash on my fiance. He is a wonderful wonderful man I dearly love. But this unwavering attachment to facts and logic when the situation calls for more empathy or just a listening ear does bother me. Hence this post!"
77,estj,"We are cool being called out, but we want it to be done with respect. If you don't, we'll probably leave or fight back from a stronger position.
INFPs usually do it so nicely, even when they come on strong. We can handle their intensity just fine."
78,estj,"Hey, 5-4-3-2-1-1-1-1, just a quick heads-up:
apparantly is actually spelled apparently. You can remember it by -ent not -ant.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
79,estj,"It sounds like he just isn't very good at reading your emotional state.  This is more of a life skill than it is a ESTJ-specific trait.  He's more interested in the cause of your problem than you are.
He probably sees the discussion about the cause of the problem as just normal conversation.  When you complain about a situation, the natural reaction is to explore the causes of that situation.  
One idea is to be more explicit about what you want from him.  In the allergy flare, could you say, ""Sure, that's probably true, but it doesn't help me now.  Would you be willing to order food or get me a cup of water?""  
Another tactic is to phrase your complaint in a way that leads him to a more appropriate response.  Instead of saying, ""Ugh, these allergies are brutal"", you could say ""I wish I could freely go for a walk whereever I wanted without taking Zyrtec all the time--these allergies are brutal""  You've shifted the complaint from a bare problem to your particular situation.  You don't want him to solve the bare problem; you wish it wasn't a problem at all and you want his sympathy.  In fact, saying that part in bold explicitly isn't a bad idea either.  (Also, it may be hard for him to relate if he has no allergy issues.)
This might be more of an example of what I was saying with well-founded opinions.  For him, a bad movie can't emotionally move him, but a good movie can.  If you were moved by a bad movie, it may seem a bit silly to him--but he's going to argue the point out of respect rather than patronize you thinking to himself ""What a silly girl to be touched by such a lame premise"".
Of course, a more mature person (ESTJ or otherwise) could acknowledge that different things can touch different people without them being wrong. :)
I also wanted to mention that ESTJ is not the same as psychopathy/sociopathy.  I recommend you watch this episode together and discuss.  I'm presuming he's not a psychopath, but his ESTJ reaction to the tendencies of psychopaths might get him to think outside the box a bit."
80,estj,"Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".
And your fucking delete function doesn't work. You're useless.

81,estj,"Hi I‚Äôm a ESTJ who just found out about the Mbti test. And I found out my girlfriend and I are opposite types, and I was wondering if you guys had any relationship experience or advice you can share about the INFJ type. As I want to get closer to her without being a overbearing ESTJ"
82,estj,"I am a INFJ female dating a ESTJ Guy. Been together for over 4 years now. In dealing with her insecurities; don‚Äôt be secretive about anything. Just be open & honest, even if it seems like she is asking trivial questions. We like information and a clear understanding. Also, reassurance is crucial. It‚Äôs not an attack against you or her not trusting you, she probably just needs to hear you say that you like her/love her or are simply still happy in the relationship. 
Let her be alone sometimes, I know you probably love being around people as much as possible but she will need space to do her own thing at home. Again, not a personal attack and it‚Äôs not forever; just a small amount of time where she can focus on herself daily or enjoy a hobby. But trust me your overbearing side will be appreciated because it puts less pressure on her to make moves or hold all the conversation. 
Don‚Äôt stop pushing her to go outside of her comfort zone (invite her to concerts, movies, dinner, suggest a game night with friends etc), it might be hard at first but she will love you for opening that door for her. Expect to be the leader in those situations and you may want to ask her what will make her more comfortable when you are planning the event. 
I hope everything works out! It is a challenging dynamic but can be very rewarding once you understand each other better."
83,estj,"I‚Äôm an INFP dating an ESTJ! I can‚Äôt say I know too much about the differences between infp/j but something I think my boyfriend has come to learn is to be patient with my intense desire to avoid conflict/ communicating. Honestly at two years in, I‚Äôm finally just reaching the point where I‚Äôm comfortable speaking my mind and trusting that our relationship is solid enough to survive an argument. 
He‚Äôs got opinions on literally everything. He‚Äôs taught me to be more sure of myself and make decisions!  what he‚Äôs been excellent at is encouraging me to expand on a feeling I express, and trying to see my thought process before he gives his opinion. 
Good luck!!"
84,estj,"Thank you I really appreciate the advice. We‚Äôre still relatively new in the relationship and she has some trust issues so I‚Äôm trying to work past that, without forcing her to open up to me. But I definitely agree it‚Äôs hard to open up communication with our types, but I love her and the challenge of her personality type."
85,estj,"Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.
I will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScS5h6KfDSrc5C1gEBh4mNb56HvXeUWBuYoRfAFOUC-LVyBZg/viewform?usp=sf_link
Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two."
86,estj,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
87,estj,"INTJ here. Just wanted to ask your opinion about a pattern I've noticed:


My father is ESTJ. The man which he holds in the highest esteem -among everyone he's ever known- is an INTJ colleague of his. He used to talk to me all the time, about the conversations they where having and the opinions he has formed through them. In one way or the other I guess he unconsciously did everything he could to shape me, his son, in his friend's image.


Some of my best friends are ESTJs. I get the same kind of vibes from them.


I've noticed that ESTJs open up to me so naturally even though for some of them I'm barely an acquaintance. I guess they see something in me that I don't quite readily grasp. Is this common? What's the deal here?"
88,estj,"Because ESTJs are naturally compelled by the thought of an INTJ's approval. Well, that's basically what a Relation of Supervision boils down to.
Your dominant Ni is their blindspot. You're both making decisions in the same way (Te), but the knowledge you are accessing to make that decision, the ESTJ is unable to access. It could be the powerful foresight associated with Ni. It ends up looking like the INTJ has the upper hand."
89,estj,"I‚Äôm currently with an INTJ and have pretty much loved every one I‚Äôve ever met. 
Every one I‚Äôve met has been brilliant in my opinion and none of them give themselves enough credit. 
I had a lab partner who was one too and I always wanted his opinions on things because he could explain things to me without making me feel like an idiot. And he would do it in a way that made me even more interested in the topic. I don‚Äôt like talking to people about politics or social issues because it always gets out of hand but with an intj I can ask questions without them making assumptions about me. I like playing devils advocate and getting as much info but some people automatically jump on you when you want to understand something from both sides. 
I‚Äôm not asking because I disagree with you I‚Äôm asking to better understand. And when you assume it just shuts me down and makes me less likely to wanna ever open up again. 
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so attracted to INTJs. 
On my first date with my INTJ I opened up quite a bit. We had some of the best conversations. And I was able to open up about something that is a pretty big secret to most people and not something I wanna share on a first date. To me INTJs are very open minded and not as judge mental as others are. "
90,estj,"INTJ  Here, popping in to see how you all think and respond.
Since you asked a question about  ESTJ / INTJ Social Chemistry, I could not resist answering this question and I wanted to weigh in with my two cents. 
My husband of 38 years is an ESTJ.
I still think he may be the smartest man, that I have met.
I was smart enough to recognize his/your fascinating  qualities and hang on for the ride.
What a ride!  You guys may be d**k's sometimes but geez, I could not have chosen better and had a more intellectually stimulating ride.
My answer to your question is a bit simple.
In my experience, when an ESTJ notices someone with talent or smarts, an ESTJ will seek to utilize him or her. 
They,  or in my case, my husband will recognize that talent, treat the person as an equal and expect that person to be on the exact same page as the ESTJ is.
They will not nurture talent because why, and that is not a question.
They  don't need someone to nurture them,  and why should you. Again, not a question.
In other words, an ESTJ can be funny and smart and a big time A*,  who is very very bossy.
The moral of my story is to be flattered if ESTJ 's are drawn to you. They recognize you and include you."
91,estj,"As an ESTJ, One of my old best friends is an INTJ. He's very good at brainstorming and having abstract thoughts. He knows I tend to be self-centered at times, but we both respected each other. While I was more authoritative and rigid, he was more relaxed and had a big imagination. Granted he was suffering through depression and I cared about him deeply. Love INTJ's because they are good at planning just as much as I do."

‚Äã
ESTJ Strengths
ESTJs are loved by almost everyone they meet. They have their own brand of humor, and others are drawn to their charisma. They love to be the center of attention. They always try to be straight-forward with others ‚Äî a trait that others often appreciate ‚Äî and rarely sugar-coat things. ESTJs value security and stability, and expect others to follow through on their responsibilities. They hold themselves and others to high moral standards.
ESTJs are very strategic and are great problem-solvers. They are very resourceful and are able to adapt easily when necessary. They are able to think critically and logically when making decisions, rarely letting their emotions cloud their judgment. When confronted with a problem, ESTJs try to use the information available to make the best decision, hoping for the best. They place a great deal of trust their own judgement, which is based solely off of unbiased logic and reasoning. They have little tolerance for intuitive judgments. Rather, they prefer to evaluate the information available to them and make a decision quickly.
ESTJs feel a strong sense of duty. They feel a strong sense of civic duty, and likely vote in every election and seek out opportunities to improve the community.
ESTJs have initiative, and others often describe them as ‚Äúdoers‚Äù. They are very competitive, and are always pushing themselves to be the best. This helps them become very successful in life, particularly in their careers. Others view them as reliable, trustworthy, honest, and likeable.
‚Äã
ESTJ Weaknesses
ESTJs always stick to their beliefs and values. They trust their own judgement above all others, even when they are wrong. Because of this ESTJs can be inflexible and stubborn. Others may see ESTJs are too forceful in their decisions.
Because ESTJs are so idealistic when it comes to their values, they may be unaccepting or judgmental towards others who do not share those values. They may seek out friends who are like themselves, and/or try fruitlessly to change others.
Because ESTJs are so focused on logic and reason, it may be challenging for them to deal with emotions. They have trouble expressing their emotions, as well as feeling empathy for others.
ESTJs thrive on structure and routine, and may have difficulty in new or unusual situations. They place a great deal of value on tradition, and change can make them very uncomfortable. ESTJs would much rather stick with a tried-and-true method, rather than a new idea that may not work.
‚Äã
ESTJ Parenthood
ESTJs are very family-oriented and take their responsibilities as parents very seriously. Ultimately, they want their children to grow up to be responsible and hard-working adults like themselves. ESTJs‚Äô home environment is very organized, and their children are expected to follow the rules. They expect their children to help with chores around the house and do their best academically.
As much as they want their children to develop a sense of responsibility, ESTJs also want their children to develop strong ideals and values. They always do their best to instill their own values and sense of responsibility in their children. Their hope is that their children will become strong-willed adults who stand up for what they believe in.
‚Äã
ESTJ Romantic Relationships
ESTJs value their romantic relationships highly, and are looking for a long-term commitment. They want a partner whom they can find stability and security in ‚Äî any partner who is unpredictable is not well-suited for an ESTJ. ESTJs will do whatever it takes to help their relationships succeed, and will put a tremendous amount of time and effort towards developing a deep, meaningful bond with their significant other.
ESTJs may have trouble being in-tune with their partner‚Äôs emotions. If their romantic partner is an ‚ÄúF‚Äù (feeling) personality type, this can be especially problematic. To overcome this, the F type partner must express their emotions directly with their ESTJ partner, rather than just holding them inside.
‚Äã
ESTJ Friendships
To an ESTJ, friends are secondary to their family. Others are often drawn to ESTJs outgoing and enthusiastic nature, and they are usually well-liked by others. ESTJs generally seek out friends who are like themselves ‚Äî someone who is dependable and smart, and shares the same interests and values as themselves. Their friendships center on trust and loyalty. Friends of ESTJs never have to worry about an ESTJ betraying them.
ESTJs are very aware of their own and others‚Äô social status. They are drawn to others who are well-liked, successful, and respected. However, ESTJs heightened awareness of social status can sometimes become overly-concerned with their social status. They may become preoccupied with getting others to like them.
‚Äã
ESTJ Work Habits
ESTJs are very organized. They have no trouble prioritizing various tasks each day, and enjoy the sense of accomplishment they get from checking everything off of their daily list. Seeing the tangible outcomes of their accomplishments is very rewarding and motivating for ESTJs.
ESTJs get along well with others in the workplace. They are often others‚Äô ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù people when something needs to be accomplished. Others can always be certain ESTJs will follow through on any assigned projects.
‚Äã
ESTJ Career Paths
ESTJs thrive in an environment centered around routine and rules. Because of this, they may be likely to seek out careers that allow them to enforce these rules. ESTJs often work in law or government.
In addition, ESTJs are often good at a variety of things because they believe they can achieve anything they set their minds to. ESTJs are often well-suited for careers as military personnel, managers, police officers, detectives, judges, teachers, sales associates, and financial officers.

Ben Shapiro Is an ESTJ"
94,estj,"I'm an INFP, and my dad is an ESTJ. So, really, we're polar opposites. I live with him, and this provides a lot of friction. You guys know your type best, so how can I improve relations with my dad?
Note: I'm not looking for specific advice, like a therapist or family counselor could provide. Just... general stuff to get along better with your type. Thank you so much!"
95,estj,"I am an INFP and my twin brother is an ESTJ. We get along great because he's a great support system to have. He's always been the type to help me out (financially) and just goof around with. We clash on our beliefs all the time though, just yesterday we had a huge argument about whether or not graffiti was art (totally is). When we have heart-to-heart conversations, I usually can always tell what he's feeling/trying to tell me. Our difference in personalities works for us. I'm grateful for him and I'm sure he appreciates me as well. "
96,estj,"Hmm, my ex-best friend is an ESTJ. I learned from our failed friendship that neither of us were wrong, but that we really do care about COMPLETELY different things.
ESTJs value efficiency and regulation. In my experience, they're good at the social aspect of life if they choose to be because people are attracted to them due to their confidence and blunt honesty. Others hang onto them like a big tree trunk if we all lived in a metaphorical flood and wanted to stay socially afloat (sorry, INFP metaphors... 
She's always the one nagging people to do chores at home (I live with her and several other friends) and she's always the first one to deliver a negative judgment about someone. She delivers both of these things in a very critical tone, but it blew my mind that she's really not trying to hurt people when she does these things. She is just really focused on categorizing things, being successful in life, creating the ""best"" situation possible, etc. She's the moderator of the household, telling us when we err at chores or violate a social norm - if noone did that, the sink would be full of dishes for weeks at a time. They are masters of keeping order and pushing for improvement in a practical manner.
That said, they're not really thinking a whole lot about valuing people's self-realization and personal growth and feelings and whatnot. I guess that's what we're for... hooray INFPs. =p"
97,estj,"And I forgot to answer your question.. -_- Sorry.
Honestly, I haven't been good friends with an ESTJ for awhile, having ruined more than one relationship with an ESTJ. I can still be their normal friend or acquaintance, but I know I'm too sensitive to bear their 'harsh' words for too long at a time. 
But I guess understanding that your innate thought processes are worlds apart, and neither of you are wrong, is very important. If you're INFP, my guess is that you might be easily hurt by the things that the ESTJ says and wish they would be more careful with people's feelings. Accept that they probably won't change anytime soon unless they choose to work on their weaker functions, but also accept that everything you feel in response to their behaviors is okay. You might perceive something they did as a gross trespass of your values or feelings, and you should let them know. They might never see it that way, but the important thing is that you let them know."
98,estj,"Oh yeah, big time. I feel like I'm some sort of rebellious teenager when I say this, but he really just doesn't get me. We don't really fight, but we don't talk much either. I guess we just don't have anything in common and we're just so opposite. Like, I'll say something jokingly and he'll take it seriously.. I don't know. "
99,estj,"Yikes! ESTJ here and I love the MBTI and psychology. I tend to be a nicer ESTJ because I care about how people are feeling. Now, I haven't always been that way, but as I've gotten older I've become more in tuned to how people are feeling because I've pushed many people away with my harshness."
100,estj,"He just has such a hard time empathizing (and I don't think he ever tries which is a whole other problem) that he doesn't realize the impact of his words or actions. Also, back to the ""hogwash"", he has a tendency to disbelieve in the existence of depression, or ADD, which is ridiculous considering he's a goddamn healthcare professional.
It's hard for me as a feely person. Got too many o'dem feels."
101,estj,"What‚Äôs your enneagram? And please answer if only you are an estj. For anyone else find my post it may be under u/estj136 and answer that one, it asks for type and enneagram. But I am really interested to know what type all the other ESTJs are here."
102,estj,"Counterphobic 6 (easily mistyped by others as 3 or 8) but that basic motivation of safety/comfort and providing it for others is DEFINITELY still the core...
also with the in group/out group stuff and the admiration for what we think is ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù authority/structure while completely devaluing/ignoring what we think is ‚Äúillegitimate‚Äù or ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù authority/structure, I‚Äôm surprised there aren‚Äôt more ESTJ counterphobic 6s."
103,estj,"Very interesting you seem to be the only one so far more of us is 3s. But that‚Äôs probably not surprising, I think entjs are more 8s. But the stereotypes is that more of us are, but that‚Äôs pretty interesting."
104,estj,Wait what? An estj 9w1? How does that work? I mean not that it‚Äôs not possible but interesting indeed. Most of us seem to be 1 3 or 8 I mean other types are not impossible but now you‚Äôve peaked my interest.
105,estj,"Yeah, I realize I‚Äôm a bit soft for an ESTJ. I think it could have something to do with being the middle child of an alcoholic. I hate conflict and anger. I‚Äôve had to learn that those things aren‚Äôt necessarily bad. Yet, my Te and Si are absolutely dominant. 
I‚Äôve certainly questioned whether I‚Äôm an ESTJ, but aside from testing it every time, I‚Äôve been called an ‚Äòasshole with lack of empathy‚Äô too many times to not be in the club."
106,estj,"I suppose but 6 is actually not that common, but I can totally see it. Haha! That‚Äôs funny about the 1 thing.
I am 3w2 and my tritype is 317. But if my 7 could have a wing I‚Äôd probably be 7w6. I think I have a little six in me but not really that much. But I am definitely not an 8."

108,estj,"As an ENFJ, I am ambivalent about the description. The first part is right, we are hard workers, don't tolerate bullshit and are fast paced. In a ""get things done"" perspective, I enjoy working with ESTJs. You will keep on your commitments, and will work hard towards what needs to be done. There is some room for humour as well, which is nice.
However, I have yet to meet an excellent ESTJ boss. At worse, ESTJs are micromangers, and at best, they are managers. While very good at creating a ""game plan"" (that must be derived from a very concrete framework), all ESTJs I know are poor at inspiring leadership and have very little vision. Also very likely to kill innovation from workers because they hate ""insubordination"", ""it isn't the way things should be done"" or because they don't want to appear incompetent. "
109,estj,"Given it's one person's perspective, this isn't actually that bad. Although, as an INTP, I want to claim that we solved the bottom-of-the-food-chain problem by getting out of the food chain. Most of the MBTI humour stuff does have us as goalpost-movers."
110,estj,"This made me laugh because basically he says ESTJs can't get along with anyone for any length of time. Some he dismisses right out of the gate, others he states can handle for a brief time (maybe), and yet others he starts out liking but basically says the relationship is doomed. Is this typical of most ESTJs???"
111,estj,"telegram is a free messenger app that‚Äôs available on mobile, in a browser, and as a desktop app. it‚Äôs way nicer than kik or skype chat or imessage

112,estj,"Hello! I am an ESTJ-T that is 53% Extroverted, 47% Introverted. Essentially, an Ambiverted ESTJ. (Not to be confused with an ISTJ. The description and definition of that type doesn't match me)
So basically, I was just given a job offer by a family friend, who is the owner of a brand new StateFarm branch. I would be doing daily 4 hour shifts as a Telemarketer for the insurance company. Convince them to get a ""free quote"" and then transfer the number and move on to the next call.
My question is, has anyone else here with the ESTJ (or ESTJ-T) personality had experience with Telemarketing?
I am wondering if this is a good job for an ESTJ, or not. 
I only have 2 concerns.
1: My ability to ""move on"" to the next customer. I have noticed in myself that after a conversation, my head gets a little ""clouded"" with thoughts on the convo, until I allow myself a short time to ""gather my thoughts"" or ""mentally process"" the convo or interaction. I can BEST move on, after that point. I figure it would likely take me around 1-2 minutes after each call, unless I trained myself to do better than that.
2: Another concern is what people think of me. I worry a bit too much on the opinions of other people. If I were to have an extremely negative reaction over the phone, I may likely find it really hard to move on to another call. Especially with confidence/enthusiasm.
Besides those 2 things, everything seems fantastic about this offer. It would basically be my first job, and I am nearly 18 years of age. And as I said, the employer (and most of the employees) are friends.
Thanks so much guys, it means alot to me that you read all that."
113,estj,"Honestly I hate talking on the phone and have had some awful jobs where I had to do it. 
The only job I liked talking on the phone was when I was guest services at a gym. If people‚Äôs cards expire or don‚Äôt go through we call them letting them know and have to charge a $10 fee. 
My boss ended up giving me responsibility of it because I did such a good job. I wrote myself a script and just did that. Some people got pissed off but I do surprisingly well with angry people. 
But when we had to call people to ask how their membership was going I flat out refused. And just made a deal that I would do all the phone calls for the cards that didn‚Äôt go through. 
I also was an intern for a big company that does a lot of recruiting so I was constantly making calls for that. I hated it. 
Handling phones are a toss up for me. Sometimes it‚Äôs great and other times I can‚Äôt wait to hang up. "
114,estj,"I don't think it's a bad job as an ESTJ in some respects. I worked in my university's call center for all four years making alumni relations/giving calls (basically chatting up alumni and asking for gifts). In some ways it goes with the ESTJ personality because you follow a script, I assume, and it's a very routine after a while. My campus job also had a clear cut structure of moving up, so I became a student manager, which is definitely right up the ESTJ alley. In general I think ESTJs, from what I've read and know about myself, can be fairly adept at separate emotions from the practical/logical knowledge this is a job."
115,estj,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority. Do the right thing.

116,estj,"Amazing. I hate to use this particular word to describe anything or anyone but I've come to realise how compatible many of them I know have been with myself personally.
I like how they could always manage to have the sort of calm but unrelenting dedication when it comes to their work/ hobbies/ the things they're doing. As an ESTJ I'm familiar with ""dedication"" itself, but what the ISTPs have is completely different. I especially enjoy the professionalism and precision that lie within their actions and thoughts- they make things so much simpler. 
I suppose it wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that I'm quite fond of some of their common traits, and when you like a few things of someone too much you become blinded and will definitely feel that some of the flaws on them, although jarring on the others, have become completely acceptable (which is never a good thing.)
So responsibly speaking, I'm completely biased on the subject matter, at least on this one, I can't tell you much about the negative experience I had interacting with the ISTPs, solely because I don't think there has been any."
117,estj,"I think you people are amazing as well. It's like, you people are good at what we are not good at and we are good at what you're not good at. That's what makes us compatible. Looking at my experiences with you ESTJ, I can definitely say that I've never thought anything bad about ESTJ. I know only two ESTJ in my life and one of them is a teacher and I always get amazed by how great she teaches us."
118,estj,"Hello! I'm doing a research work about the relationship between MBTI and music preferences. Please click the link
Could you please answer this mini test?
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXr3BAVjpMLzh1DEQqTlAyVQZLGBTDN3lOun8MGJFSNH7wWw/viewform
Thanks  #Music  #Share  #MBTI"
119,estj,"So did I, the difference was when I was younger in my teens and early 20's I didn't have social skills so I was more introverted. But I figured that out and spent a few years learning to work/read/effect and enjoy social situations and now I identify as an extrovert. "
120,estj,"I have an ESTJ friend for whom I feel a lot of empathy. The guy is consistently buried by project details at work. He's getting them all done, but he is doing most of them by himself. We laugh and joke around a lot when we hang out, but I'm concerned about his stress levels and I don't really know if he just needs an ever-present pile of things to fix in order to feel like his best self, or if he could use some help fixing the ever-present pile of things to fix by setting some kind of reasonable boundaries. I can't think of another person in the world who could juggle the tasks he does while also holding others accountable as needed, and I'm sure his employer would gladly let him take more time off, take things at a slower pace, etc.
Have you ever been completely buried and then set a boundary with another person or employer to get out of it? Do you do that sometimes? Often? Not much? Thanks."
121,estj,"He probably gets a lot of self-worth from these tasks. I know that if I don't have a lot of responsibility at work I feel really shitty... almost as if I'm not important. What happens after that is I start to get insecure about my worth and then I make it my mission to get on top of it all again, usually by throwing myself at ALLTHETASKSEVER! 
I don't have good advice here because I'm literally exactly like your friend. Lately, I've been feeling more and more stressed out (I work for a software company on a development team and I'm averaging 50 hour work weeks the past few weeks). I know I need to take stuff off my plate, but the thought of letting go seems not worth it because I believe it'll make life harder for me later. Or even the idea of training someone to help me seems like a waste of time because I could spend that time just doing it. Logically I know it makes sense to invest that kind of time so that I can take a break, but there's something in me that just won't let it go. I've been doing this for about 3 years straight and I'm just now starting to feel like I'm reaching some sort of limit. I'm assuming that's probably a lot longer than others would be willing to go, but I think it's just how I'm wired. The most insane part? All it takes is getting some sort of formal appreciation or acknowledgement from higher-ups and then I'm even more driven and the stress has melted away. "
122,estj,"If he does as you say, then he probably will need release when his stress levels hit high, if he doesn't already have a system in place for release, that's probably when he'd need you, or someone who can help him.
ESTJs learn best from experience, if you're or someone is there to catch him when he (hopefully not) falls, he will be grateful to you or the person, and will make sure to not let it happen in the future.
Good luck! <3
Keep us posted!"
123,estj,"Thank you for sharing your experience. That does sound a lot like my friend's situation. He gets lots of positive recognition from his boss and others, fortunately, so I'm glad to read that it may be helping him out more than it appears on the outside. :-)"
124,estj,"Just like /u/redgluesticks said, I too find myself throwing my name in every hat, but more often than not the accomplishment of doing it and doing it correctly makes it all worth it.  When I was really young, before I had actual 'work' to do go to, I would try to do anything and everything around the house all the time and even at bed time, I'd be brushing my teeth and trying to change clothes all at once.  My mom used to try and make it my mantra to say ""one thing at a time, one thing at a time"" until it was all done.
As an adult, I still find myself saying that sometimes.  I've gotten better at task-switching quickly when I need to, and focusing on one thing to completion when I don't.  I will though, at times, still find myself inundated with things.  As difficult as it is, when I don't have a lot to do I feel worthless.  I hate sitting around.  Even when I want to 'veg out', I find myself playing strategy or competitive games because I need to accomplish something.  I hate doing data entry or typing long reports, but I'll masochistically throw myself into it for hours on end just so when it's done, I know I did it right.
As for getting out of those whirlwind messes, it usually works out best when the boss is giving me tasks and he understand giving me only a few at a time, otherwise I'll take them all.  More often than not I get kicked out of the office for staying too long.  Or, when I'm at home, I create a schedule for myself so that when, say, 1700 rolls around, I stop whatever I've been hellishly absorbed in all day and I go cook supper.  I won't go back to it until that thing's scheduled time the next day.  
I don't think you'll ever get him to stop inundating himself with work.  Someone else would have to do it for him to an extent.  Or, make completing that work worth so little that he doesn't feel accomplished by completing it anymore.  Go ahead and make my work totally worthless, that makes me worthless.  That is absolute hell and the fastest way to get me to stop doing what I do best."
125,estj,"An ENTJ would be  commanditive. ENTJ is more like you have to do this and this and if you don't I won't be happy. Meanwhile an ENTP would cricize you 7 times as much , but would ultimately leave the decision to you. Even if you didn't do what he sees as correct he wouldn't rage on you, unless it was completely illogical.
Is that simple enough for you to understand?"
126,estj,"As a parent , yes he/she would. Parents want what is best for you, they might criticize you in different ways. Every type has his own way of opposing to the child's views. ENTP will likely convince the child that his point of view is right and why. And why the child's point of view will likely end in a disaster. That's called criticism, the other way this can take form in as manipulation. Just because there is Fe it does not mean criticism will not take place. Fe seeks harmony , there is more than one type of criticism and it can manifest itself in different forms. For example there is destructive criticism and constructive criticism. ENTPs are more likely to criticize while babying their child like you said older ENTPs with Fe developed will likely follow up with hugs and rewards. "
127,estj,"Hello there.
I did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).
I was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.
Here's the survey.
Feel  free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type  identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay  since there was a fetish survey a week ago on /r/MBTI. Hope it's alright!"
128,estj,"You probably should change 'commando' to 'none'. Usually surveys should have no idioms to be as foolproof as possible.
Also I would abstract the choices to 'sexy', 'comfortable', 'traditional', etc. Some of the choices seem rather redundant ('Bikini' and 'G-String'). "
129,estj,"Hello! INTP here. I'm fairly new to this system and I'm having trouble typing the types I'm not familliar with.
I gave my mom (53) multiple tests based on functions to get a basic idea (I know tests aren't to be trusted, but I needed to start somewhere because she's very confusing). She scored as ESTJ multiple times. I then read the description to her and she agreed with a good part of it, but I'm still not convinced.
(I'm probably going into stereotypes here, but I barely know anything about this type, so I apologize)
First of all, I was almost sure that she was a feeling type just because how emotional and irrational she can be, especially in comparison with me and my brother (INTP and INTJ). But while she was doing the test, she always ended up choosing thinking over feeling options, especially the ones related to Te. 
And now that I think about it, her Te is strong when it comes to her job, I think? She has also been a manager for 15+ years and stepped down only because it was too stressful and she got tired of fixing what other people messed up. The thing is, everyone there respects and loves her, and even now they want her to be a manager again. She is both nice and demanding, very annoyed with mistakes but won't punish anyone unless necessary, knows how to do her job but often ranting about those who don't. She's good with everyone but won't be fake nice (says she dislikes those who put on a fake show?).
She loves to be in the right. Often when she tells a story, she needs to pinpoint how the other person told her 'yeah you are right'. She's proud of how rational she is. And now I'm thinking she's probably a thinker indeed, but it's different at home.
She has been a wonderful mom to us. This is where I'm most confused. We lost our dad at very young age so she tried her best for us to live well and she managed it. Both me and my brother made it a standard to do well in school so she hasn't had a chance to be demanding and stern. In fact, she's quite lenient and we get along really well. The only times we fight is when we don't show enough emotion/compassion or when we say something sarcastic or accidentally harsh.
We have it, of course. When my mom is sick or tired, I'm deeply concerned, but I fail at showing it. Then she sulks for hours and I can't communicate it with her. Her usual sentence is (in calm and emotional voice) 'you have to understand me'. She is never hysterical but often has such moments where it's like she's requesting an emotional response. She doesn't have actual arguments, it's just her feelings being hurt. But maybe this is just mom behavior? Or maybe she's lonely? Does it have anything to do with ESTJ?
She has a few good friends but doesn't have much energy to meet them often - she comes home from work tired and doesn't like having guests over for too long. But she likes it when it's people who are very fun or if she hasn't seen them in a while. At those times she's very outgoing and cheerful.
She takes pride in being very independent and says she will never remarry because she would hate it if a man came into our house and started ordering around. She always minds her own business with people unless asked for advice.
She isn't too intellect-oriented or a researcher; she wishes she had a hobby but never starts anything and is pretty stagnant. She is interested in history but won't make active effort to read about it.
I won't make this even longer lol I hope I gave you enough insight to try and confirm that she is an ESTJ or deny it. Thank you in advance!"
130,estj,"I resonate with a lot of things you said, but I suck at typing sooooo
I guess the only thing I feel like I should probably explain is this and ESTJs reasoning behind why we do things
When people are relying on me, I see it as my duty to do what I have to do. Everyone has been through shitty things, but the world doesn't stop just because those horrible things happen. People need us, so we can't be focusing on the past-we need to help those and look after those who need/are relying on us-hopefully that makes sense.
‚Äã"
131,estj,A mom ESTJ here! Your mom sounds very much like me. I think women ESTJs often present very differently than male ESTJs because we are often a lot more feeling and less demanding. The ESTJ descriptions you often read seem to describe the men more so it can be a little confusing. 
132,estj,"Can‚Äôt be sure she is. What do you mean by irrational. I mean I think all the time even at home. Possibly ESFJ?
I am rather good at typing so maybe we can figure it out.
I mean lots of people are good at some of the stuff you‚Äôre saying."
133,estj,"Hello ISTJs.
I'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the ""Sentinels"" which according the the 16-personalities website ""Highly practical embracing and creating order and security and stability wherever they go."" 
In theory Sentinels tend to enjoy each others company and have common goals. So I thought I'd create a chat to see if this is true. So come join us.  
Here is the Skype link to join the group:

134,estj,"I love games! I mostly play strategy based games, fighting games and jrpg's. I like Pok√©mon the most. I also play persona and danganronpa. Smash is fun to play with friends.
Edit: I forgot to mention that I am an enormous achievement whore."
135,estj,"I mostly have Nintendo stuff. I have a PS4 for good third party games that don't go to Nintendo consoles, but Nintendo games are usually better for entertaining guests and playing with others.
I've been skipping out on more games as time has gone on, but I've played the Splatoon franchise very consistently since the first game came out in 2015. I invested a ridiculous amount of time, like, I think over 1500 hours into the first game. I've been playing less Splatoon 2 than I played 1 when it was released, but the game came out maybe 2 months ago and I've invested well over 100 hours into it and reached all the top ranks.
There's just something about the Splatoon games that I really love. It's the only game that I've ever been interested in competitively, so maybe it's just the fact that I feel really confident in my skills, which is rare for a shooter. But I think it's more than that. I don't know really, there's just something about this game that makes me so happy."
136,estj,"I'm a big sports fan, specifically sports management games. Although not recently, I've logged several hundred hours in the Football Manager franchise. Now, I'm playing Wolverine Studios College Basketball 17. Also a lot of FIFA, GTA V, Rainbow Six Siege, and CS:Go, Day of Defeat, GMod type games. "
137,estj,"I'm a 25-year-old female ESTJ and apparently something I struggle with is a common trait of ESTJs: a desire for excitement in relationships. I've been in two serious and loving relationships but I find myself longing after someone else, even though there are no major issues.
So how have you other ESTJs known when to stay with someone and do you have advice how? Since we like excitement I wonder if having shared interests might be more of value to us than other personality types."
138,estj,"My husband is an ESTJ and he's incredibly committed to our relationship. I mean we just got married in July so knock on wood lol but we've been together for 2 1/2 years and he's the one that proposed to me so that's gotta count for something :-P I know in our relationship we make sure we have other interests outside each other. He plays basketball with his friends, I play D&D with mine. We have very very different career paths- he's an accountant and I'm a nanny- so we interact with very different kinds of people. Having interests outside each other keeps us from getting bored and gives us plenty to talk about when we regroup together at the end of the day. We're also always finding fun things to do when we're together! We go to local festivals, try new restaurants or recipes, go see live shows, etc... Not to get too personal but it also helps that we're sexually compatible and we don't get bored of each other in the bedroom.
ETA: I asked him and he said I was the first girl he ever brought home to meet his parents. He says when you know you just know."
139,estj,"Was with an ESTJ for 11 and a half years.... I'm either ENFP or INFP (can't seem to figure out if I'm introverted or extroverted). We had a great first 10 years, we were extremely content, then her eye started wandering, but I don't necessarily think it's an ESTJ thing."
140,estj,"Me and my man really don't small talk and we've been together 12yrs. It's everything else that's essential. We can compensate for each other's weaknesses, provide structure and security. He's told me that my presence alone is comforting. He's extremely logical like me, but we have different viewpoints on all matters that always keeps things interesting. Is that the kinda answer ur looking for or am I off? "
141,estj,"Well I logically broke it down like this. He has been my best friend since I was 15. No matter what, we weren't gona leave each other's lives. After so long we couldn't imagine it any other way. We had already been to hell and back for each other. I knew we were always going to be there to support each other whether we were a couple or not. If your scared that your going to get bored of one individual for the rest of ur life, then your with the wrong person."
142,estj,"Yeah, I see those as being valid reasons for choosing to commit to oneself. I can relate to that a lot too, logical, not much small talk, and security.
What I fear is an issue for me though (and apparently many ESTPs), is staying in that one relationship forever."
143,estj,"Just a thought for you guys. My man is ESTJ and I'm an INTJ and we've been together for 12yrs. I see ESTJ and INTJ ultimate power couple. You give an INTJ your goal or end game and they figure out how to make it happen, they will work out the whole plan for you to execute. The Introversion has them preferring to be behind the scenes as your support while you do your thing. Helping you succeed in your goals actually is a way an INTJ will show their love and affection, they aren't big on typical romantic chivalry either, having you help bring their goals and plans to fruition will also be seen as sign of love. They definitely appreciate your strengths. 
As with keeping things exciting, an INTJ will challenge you and keep you intellectually stimulated, always. Also quite independent, you can have different interests in many areas and do your own thing, yet still have this solid stable relationship that is ever Interesting. INTJs aren't chaotic, they are very structured and self confident which I think is appealing to ESTJ. Also both types aren't very outwardly emotional ppl, so where other types may be hurt by some insensitive things ESTJs say an INTJ will not be. I find myself pretty hard to be offended, but also can see through things said in the way of logic and not get emotional about it. I find as a strong female INTJ Its hard to find a type compatible, but ESTJ  is probably as close to perfection as it gets. If you get the opportunity you should see if an INTJ might be a compatible type for you. "
144,estj,"I made the mistake of posting this as ESTJ but actually I am ESTP! Also, my significant other is an INTJ and everything you described sounds on point. We've been very happy together, it's just come to a point that I'm starting to also fancy someone else, perhaps who is also an INTJ :("
145,estj,"Just out of curiosity: do you care for chit chat or do you dislike it? 
I found it really hard to be with an INTJ who detested chit chat and I am trying to find an answer to the question if it is an INTJ 'thing', or something related to the person I am referring to.. tnx in advance"
146,estj,"My INTJ loved me deeply, but it (I?) wasn't good enough. Small talk has it's purpose imo; it's a stepping stone for deeper conversations. Like a glue. What would an INTJ consider a glue for the relationship?"
147,estj,"Who are we?

Typology: How does personality affect our personal and social development?
We also have channels dedicated to community, media, and other topics, such as venting/advice.
What else do we offer?
We offer many other things, such as:
-Over 800 members!
-A diverse community from many backgrounds

148,estj,"I'm an INFP and I'm pretty puzzled by you guys. Which might seem weird since we share all our functions. But when I try to look into how you guys work in terms of cognitive functions it's hard to imagine what you guys act like, if that makes sense at all.
I have one acquaintance who's an ESTJ. I'd describe her as very independent (she seems to spend a lot of time to herself/with one other person, I totally thought she was an outgoing introvert before I introduced her to MBTI), witty, quietly charismatic, and confident. She's seen as very effortlessly cool and a bit of a hipster. People are very very very drawn to her, more so than anyone else I've met tbh. Her sense of humor is very understated, silly and weird/raunchy. I wouldn't have pegged her as an high Si user at all, tbh.
TL;DR - what are some common traits and behaviors of ESTJs? How would you define yourself? What's your general impression on people? How would you recognize a fellow ESTJ? "
149,estj,"I always thought of myself as a introvert, but generally in a social setting with introverts I was more extroverted. People would be more drawn to me, I wouldnt necessarily want to talk to people all the time because it can get exhausting, but  I did find that I attracted people more in that sense. (That they wanted to talk to me and etc)
Very independent is a great trait to describe myself, generally I'm always only with one of my best friends or close friends. Confidence ? Well I am but only when it comes to talking and my writing, generally I like to simplify whatever im saying to make it easier for everybody to understand where I'm getting at.
So being coherent is very important. 
My humours more along the lines of being dry/sarcastic. 
I like people, but when someone goes out of their way to be blatantly ignorant or rude, I dont see the sense of hanging out with someone like that all the time.
But because I'm a eneagram 1 this could be the reason I'm more reserved quiet, then most Extroverts I don't know. So again this could differ between all ESTJs."
150,estj,"my father is an estj, and i always thought of him as introverted. but i guess he's just more selective in who he hangs out with and his interests.  He actually enjoys being around a lot of people.  I'm unsure if to classify this as ambivert or what."
151,estj,"I totally understand this. I like being around people, but I'm not the kind to hang out or talk all the time. I need a lot of alone time after work because my coworkers are all extremely extroverted, and can be draining after spending all day with them."
152,estj,"Jung Street is a more serious, independent domain into typology.

153,estj,"*question 3 was edited in later
I'm back to understand more about my dual!
Here are a couple scenarios...
1) You say something harsh that ends up (mildly) upsetting 
a. an acquaintance 
b. a friend 
c. a lover 
d. a relative 
Regarding your decision to say this thing, which statement(s) usually describe your thought process? (choose 1 or more)
i. ""I didn't know that would upset them and I feel bad"" 
ii. ""I didn't know that would upset them but I don't care""
iii. ""I didn't know that would upset them but I'm happy about it""
iv. ""I did know that would upset them but I feel bad""
v. ""I did know that would upset them and I don't care""
vi. ""I did know that would upset them and I'm happy about it""
Lets say the importance of voicing that thought was neutral, but feel free to explore if the situation was critical, or if the upset was more than mild.
2) You end up in a heated argument with someone 
a. you dislike and is generally an insensitive person, including towards you
b. you dislike and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you
c. you like and is generally an insensitive towards, including towards you 
d. you like and is generally a sensitive person, including towards you
You end up attacking one of their deep insecurities, shutting them up almost instantly. In the silence that follows, you think (choose one or more)
i. ""I went too far and feel guilty now, I need to make this better.""
ii. ""I shouldn't have said that but this will smooth out on its own.""
iii. ""Interesting, I wonder what they'll say next.""
iv. ""Good, I'm winning the argument.""
3) You prefer the follow the following types of people
a. kind but incompetent vs. unkind but competent 
b. similar life experiences but few similar interests vs. similar interests but few similar life experiences 
as 
i. lovers
ii. coworkers
iii. friends
iv. nowhere in your life
Bonus unrelated question: Do you like such compliments?
""I find you so interesting/intriguing""
""You're very creative""
""You have a unique personality"""
154,estj,"I often just say what I think or feel and I almost always realize it came off the wrong way.  This has been something I have struggled with my whole life.  People thinking I'm an asshole because I just say what I think or feel.  
I take pride in my honesty, and one of the biggest insults I had ever received was when someone called me a liar.  I have spent my whole life being honest about everything.  In almost all of my jobs, my bosses will come to me regarding issues because they know they will get the whole story.  When people need the truth they come to me.  That is the one part of me that I love, knowing that I am known for speaking the truth. 
But this specific trait means not everyone is going to like me, and most relationships will take time to develop.  I have had to learn it is not okay to just say whatever I feel, and when I've realized I possibly approached the situation wrong, I'll go back and talk to them about it.  I will own up to every mistake I make, no matter how big, even if I know I'll get in trouble for it.  
If you want to be known for speaking truth, you have to be honest about everything, even when it might hurt your name or reputation.  But I've learned it's better to just take ownership of your mistakes and people tend to be a lot more forgiving if you say you messed up right when it happens versus trying so hard to maintain this perfect image.  
A lot of my closest friends will say that my honesty and straightforwardness is their favorite part about me.  So even though not everyone will understand my intentions and people will dislike me, that's just something I'm going to have to accept.  
My favorite kinds of people are people who don't make apologies for who they are.  So my best friend is an INFP.  She is weird, silly, passionate, kind and the best person I've ever met.  I love her because she has a personality.  There is a uniqueness to her.  She isn't like every person I meet.  She can be extra and over-emotional, but I love that part of her.  Being different is what she takes pride in.  
I like compliments when I know it's genuine.  "
155,estj,"I say ‚Äúharsh‚Äù things to people all the time without realizing it fully, especially with my boyfriend and my family. I don‚Äôt realize things will be upsetting until I see them react, and when they do react, I don‚Äôt usually feel any different about what I said. Usually these are things are constructive criticism in my mind, but I‚Äôm very matter of fact and direct and I mean well but often say them in ways that are too insensitive for other people I guess. I‚Äôm a no BS person and I say what I mean; if people have a problem with that they can fuck off.
As an ESTJ, I would like all those compliments, especially that I‚Äôm interesting. I also like being told I‚Äôm competent."
156,estj,"Whether I feel bad or not depends on how well I understand why they feel bad in terms of my functions. If someone is upset about what I said for silly reasons, I don't care.
I'm not great at managing my tone with most people. Understanding problems related to my tone is hard. ESTJs tend to want argumentation to be all about the argument and ignore technique and tone.
If I know what I say is going to hurt someone, such as force them to change their life in a serious way, even for the good, I'll probably wait for the right time to say it. I probably won't say anything unless we have a close relationship.
Working with INFPs helps as they have deep emotional empathy that I can kind of copy.
""You end up attacking one of their deep insecurities, shutting them up almost instantly. In the silence that follows, you think (choose one or more)""
iii) I might poke around with a question. I won't feel bad until I understand why they were hurt.
I tend to associate with outcasts. These people aren't always outcasts because they are insensitive though.
I pay the most attention to people who have a good mix of things that they agree and disagree with me on. I usually want people to disagree on different things from each other so I have a variety.
On compliments:
I like being found as strange or weird. I like seeing myself as a bit of an outcast.
I like being seen as creative, but I'd rather people compliment me on a specific work and show understanding of it.
Similarly with ""unique personality"". I'd rather that people show understanding of me and my personality. That is the bigger compliment.
------------Edit-----------------
I noticed this quote in one of /u/happy_crazy replies and it helped put other things into context:
""I've noticed before personality types that prefer to offend people in certain situations, because they find those reactions entertaining. I suspected that wasn't the case with ESTJs but I put that option there anyways.""
As an ESTJ, I like teasing people to get a reaction from them. I don't necessarily care whether the reaction is good or bad. I like teasing people, though I tend to focus on people that I like. ISFPs will feign anger over my puns but ultimately enjoy it. They take my teasing in a similar way.
Some ESTJs take this to arguing and will troll people in order to get a strong reaction from them in order to prove their argument wrong. This is an extension of our teasing behavior but tends to be more destructive."
157,estj,"1) i. I don't know why I'd ever feel good about hurting someone's feelings. I do hurt people's feelings accidentally sometimes, but I'm not trying to do it. If I agree with my statement and think it needs to be said, I'll feel bad about it but I won't take it back.
2) i or iii. Whether or not I like the person is irrelevant, but if they're generally an insensitive person towards others I won't feel guilty immediately (unless it's really personal). I'll be interested to hear their response and piece together if they're aware they do the same thing, but if they feel very hurt, I'll obvious have a little bit of guilt. If I don't like them but they are sensitive towards others, I'll feel bad no matter what. It's not their fault I don't like them, they didn't deserve that.
3) I prefer kind and incompetent people in my personal life but unkind and competent people to work with. 
Bonus question) Yes, I like receiving all of those compliments, the ""creative"" one not as much as the others. It A) sounds kind of sarcastic (obviously you don't mean it in that way, though) and B) I feel the word ""creative"" has lost some of its value. It's either ""you're dumb, but you drew that picture kind of alright that one time I guess"" or ""you're very unimpressive but to me you seem impressive because I have no idea what I'm talking about"". I like the other compliments because I like to stand out, probably in a competitive way. I want to be known for doing something, and I'm not going to be known for doing something if I'm just like everyone else."
158,estj,"It is really hard to answer these with out any form of context. 
For example the choice of who I‚Äôm upsetting is confusing to start with. I may say something that upsets any one of those individuals should I assume the question is asking about frequency as in which of those categories of individual I speak with most and are most likely to upset or upset most?
To the next question the issue is similar that with a lack of context the question seems to be about frequency. It becomes problematic in that the answers are answering conflated questions, first whether or not you consciously say upsetting things in a binary sense and then a minimal response to how I feel about it. I could not really answer the question because I both consciously and unconsciously say upsetting things to all categories of people and I might feel good or bad about it depending on what was said to whom and why. "
159,estj,"I'm a female ESTJ and have been told I have decent empathy ""levels"". There's always what I really want to say (super blunt and direct) and what I actually say (sometimes blunt and direct, sometimes watered way down). I make this determination based on the other person's sensitivity level/personality type, my respect for them as a person, and what level of peace the environment demands. When I'm talking to my ISTP friend, I'm super direct but respectful. When i'm talking to my ISFP friend, I try to word it more sensitively but am still honest. When I'm talking to an ENTP boss that I dislike, I'll stay ""appropriate"" but won't sugarcoat anything or be too passive. 
I feel free and unchecked when I am speaking with healthy ISTPs, ESTPs, ISTJs, INTPs, INTJs, and even some ISFPs."
160,estj,"But it's organized ; A;
edit: it's in that structure because I wanted really specific answers to hypothetical scenarios to evaluate ESTJs on...if you pay attention, you'll notice it's multiple choice and quite simple to follow."
161,estj,"I had to learn this the hard way. But people can't demand honesty, and expect to be happy with it as well. 
That's really sweet about the INFP, I'm sure the feeling is mutual!"
162,estj,"I'm kind of like that too where I need to understand why someone is upset to care, but I don't mind feigning concern because I don't like people having issues with me if I can avoid it. It must be nice to care so little how people perceive you."
163,estj,"I've noticed before personality types that prefer to offend people in certain situations, because they find those reactions entertaining. I suspected that wasn't the case with ESTJs but I put that option there anyways.
""It's not their fault I don't like them"" - that's kind of funny
Interesting that ESTJs/INFPs both are nitpicky about how they get complimented. I'm also sensitive to misplaced or effusive praise, and unless I feel accomplished I won't accept peoples' compliments. I have similar trains of thought..."
164,estj,"Concerning the ""free and unchecked"" thing, and you haven't included my type....Since I'm an INFP, I am a wee bit sensitive but I may not always feel comfortable showing externally that I'm offended or hurt, especially in a professional setting. I usually stay quiet and try to get back to a neutral state as quickly as possible. A lot of INFPs are like that as well...even in those cases, given that you don't know anyone's type immediately upon meeting them - do you feel free to say things as bluntly as you want to towards those kinds of people, or can you somehow ""tune into"" their unexpressed feelings? I don't want to assume anything, but I imagine it has to be related to the second possibility that you monitor your words around INFPs. "
165,estj,"
You‚Äôre making the assumption that this is a decision. As everyone else has described, I‚Äôm generally not looking to be harsh. I‚Äôm just thinking aloud; the words are out before I have a chance to measure them. To say I knew or didn‚Äôt know the words would be upsetting is inaccurate. It‚Äôs more like I forgot and am only reminded by the reactions of people around me.

2a. ii or iv 
2b. ii or iv
2c. ii 
2d. i or ii

Just so you‚Äôre aware, this question is backwards compared to the last two. The letters should be the 4 types of people and the numerals should be the 4 reactions.

3a. Competent i ii iii iv
3b. Similar interests i ii iii iv
Bonus: I like honest compliments. I don‚Äôt like being placated. 
Bonus bonus: I love these kinds of questions; they‚Äôre so much better than the endless ‚Äòhow do I get my estj crush to like me‚Äô posts. I initially had a response similar to the others you have gotten, but the more I revisited the actual questions, the more complicated it got to share my experience while making it fit your system of nested multiple choice. And implying I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to something ‚Äòsimple‚Äô was a dick move.
(Yes, that second 1 should be a 3. Formatting sucks on phones)"
166,estj,"Like I said though, I accept when I am wrong, and freely admit it.  People only win when you let them.  People fuck up all the time, mistakes happen, but accepting you were wrong and admitting it takes the power away from the one who did it to bring you down in the first place.  "
167,estj,"Honestly not a lot, because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cruel and like I said I always mean well. The times when I feel bad it‚Äôs usually because I was being too hard on a little kid or made someone cry, and I feel bad because I couldn‚Äôt make them understand my point and not because I think I did something wrong. 
I get upset when people refuse to acknowledge facts or truths, because I‚Äôm very logical/scientific in my thinking. The only thing that really offends me is condescension, especially when it‚Äôs unfounded. That just plain pisses me off. "
168,estj,"My mother is an unhealthy INFP and I know a handful of others of various health.  I definitely adjust my tact/sensitivity level for INFPs that I respect and care about, but not-so-much for those that I dislike. I don't discuss anything of importance with my mother because she is SO sensitive that I couldn't even express things to her as a child without her over-responding to my expression of concern.  (e.g. She would hurt my feelings and I would try to tell her that she had hurt my feelings, but she'd become overly emotional about it - no matter the topic.  I felt like I wasn't allowed to have feelings because she had all of them, if that makes any sense.)"
169,estj,"And I'm pretty good at knowing when INFPs are upset but hiding it.  I'm not sure that's true of all ESTJs though.  I do think female ESTJs have different expectations put on them by society (e.g. be nurturing, inclusive, demure) than male ESTJs do, and that I've just been forced to adapt my type to fit a mold (that I don't want to be in)."
170,estj,"Thanks for answering! There were no assumptions on my part...if I did, I wouldn't have a asked you guys. Sorry for being ""a dick"". I wanted to learn more about an ESTJ in my life. I'd be happy that someone wanted to learn about INFPs because they knew one in real life, not care at all about crappy formatting."
171,estj,"Mature ESTJs seem to be like that but it could be that the females have more of an incentive to develop earlier. 
Personally I'd rather someone be their selves around me even if I get upset from time to time. I get upset either way (blunt AND indirect criticism) so might as well say whatever you want. "
172,estj,"Is it normal for an ESTJ to dislike their own type? I mean I really dislike the idea of being an ESTJ (I just hate the idea of it), however there is no doubt that I am one. One thing I love, however, is that we pair with INFJ's and that makes me really happy. Can anybody else relate?
I just hate the rigidness, the organisation, the lack of versatility that comes with ESTJ. I strive to be imaginative, abstract, creative, intuitive. But now that I have learned about MBTI I feel like that the things I am trying to make myself are all just a lie and I am only fooling myself by pursuing them.
I also think that I should not let MBTI dictate what I do in my life, but I really strive for perfection and do not want to be working in the wrong direction. I suppose I should just continue as if I was unaware that I am an ESTJ and trust that life will naturally pull me towards my correct path?"
173,estj,"Continue on not caring or putting any weight into your MTBI results.
Seriously.
The test measured what you were on a particular day at a particular time.  I switch between ENTJ/ESTJ/ISTJ depending on the day.  
You do you, don't let four letters define you."
174,estj,"I feel the same way, especially with the negative view of ESTJS on reddit.. I am an ESTJ and sometimes wish to be otherwise.
Can't believe u said ESTJS and INFJ pair well! I agree, my girlfriend is INFJ and we are great, despite all the negative research that claims we are the worst fit possible. Agree with all u wrote"
175,estj,"Thanks. I just feel that MBTI can be a really powerful tool if understood and used correctly. However, if it is negatively affecting my self perception maybe it is not so great... I am very interested in it and I think I will continue to learn about it. I shall define myself though, and be who I want to be."
176,estj,"I know 2 prototypical ESTJs that share one trait that I find problematic and relevant to OP's dilemma - they want truths to be absolute. Either a tool works, or it doesn't. Either the answer is A or B.
In this particular case, OP is probably just not a textbook ESTJ - so I fully agree with owlcandle. IMHO, the reason OP might be worried can be ascribed to a natural tendency to seek a correct answer.
Unfortunately, finding ""correct"" answers is not the strength nor the purpose of MBTI."
177,estj,"I have had a relationship with an ESTJ for 4 years now. we have very little trouble together. I was wondering if there are any others that have had this relationship work.
When I look at it on paper it doesn't seem like it should."
178,estj,"I remember reading somewhere that if the people involved have well developed personalities it doesn't really matter and they can get along. It might also be that both of you share the same values, but you express them differently, one using logic and the other using feelings. "
179,estj,"First of all, welcome to this subreddit and thanks for reaching out :) 
I can say from my personal experience that some of the people in my life that I cherish the most (romantically or otherwise) have been INFPs.  Granted, as with most relationships, there's a series of ups and downs associated with companionship.  I found that our strengths acted in a complementary manner.  Together we were able to have a more comprehensive view of the world and we picked up on things that the other was missing in their life.  It just seemed very easy for us to support one another and something that seemed so rudimentary to me was considered a herculean feat for the other (and vice versa of course).   
Additionally, you can find some additional information on the oddly developed types site that references some studies that found ESTJs and INFPs had a tendency to end up in relationships in comparison to other types.  If you want to look into this with a larger sample size that's where I'd recommend starting.
Edit: grammar "
180,estj,"Hi.  I know I'm late to the party.  I may be able to provide a little perspective.  I'm 39, I am INFP and I highly suspect my Dad is a ESTJ, though he refuses to take a trivial test.  I need to say I love my Dad to death, and there is a lot that I admire in him.  I cannot deny that I have his genes, just that my mother's genes are extraoridinarily more prominent in me.  I love his work ethic, his matter of fact point of view, and when we can break down the natural walls and really discuss something that fascinates us both, it can be an amazing conversation.  OK now for the warning flags, heh.  Basically my entire life he has let me know that I have a ""blue personality"".  He views this as a mental handicap, and he refuses, to this day, to accept that healthy human beings can think and feel like this.  In a episode a couple months ago, he shared with me about 5 mental illnesses that he self-diagnosed for me, and that he feels that without him guiding me, I'd be dead in 10 years.  He is very condescending and much of what he says to me I feel is gaslighting, because he assumes so much and presents it to me as absolute fact.  Also sometimes, he does gaslight me.  One example is we used to both have the same psychiatrist.  One day, out of the blue, he told me that she said she shouldn't have told him this, but he had asked her if I was scizophrenic.  (I take a anti-psychotic to dull my emotions, and slow down my brain.) He told me she said yes.  This really bothered me that she wouldn't have shared information like this with me, so after a couple months I straight asked her.  She denied every having spoken to my Dad, and assured me that I absolutely was not scizophrenic.  Which is absolutely clear anyways.  I guess my Dad has always found it strategic to make me doubt my view of reality and break my confidence.  When I was a teenager, I would say at least once or twice a week, he would...at any moment....snap into a mode of evil and abuse the hell out of me.  He would come in my room at 9:30 pm and for whatever slight he had that night, he would spend 2-3 hours screaming at me, cutting me down, bringing up all my past failures, telling me I had an ego 10 football fields long.  Looking back, I can honestly say that my father made me absolutely clinically insane.  Before I took the PSAT I kept hyping myself up all night long...no sleep.  I played Dragon Warrior 3 and Mega Man 3 on NES all night cause I love the music and I had those songs roaring through my head.  I took the PSAT, and it was the most fun I think I have ever had.  I finished early...I was in absolute command.  Of the results of that one test....I was labeled a National Merit Scholar and I had about 100 colleges in my state offer me a full ride.  Now keep in mind when I finally got freedom from my dad for the first time, the world literally blew my mind.  I was in no shape or fashion ever prepared for the real world, and while I grew a lot at this time...I did drop out of college almost immediately, and I can't say that was a success, but I'm pretty happy with me.  And my dad finally did find the right medication and the abuse stopped...until a couple months ago, and as he feels absolutely no remorse and in fact knows that I deserve it..I am having to distance myself from him again.  I know he won't be around forever and I will not hurt myself by cutting him out of my life.  Well that's probably a pretty twisted account of INFP vs ESTJ.  But I wish you absolute good luck, and thanks for asking.
Oh, one other thing.  He has always been absolutely no help and in fact insulting when I reached out for advice on women and stuff.  He basically always immediately cuts me down and lets me know that no woman would ever be interested in a twisted person such as myself, and looks for ways to let me know that it is inappropriate that I would ever have a interest in a woman.  That's one thing I really wish he could have helped me with, but honestly?  He probably doesn't know.  He doesn't have like any real friends other than my brother, who is very similar to him.  He married my mom soon out of high school and never has really had to deal with other people.  It is very insulting to me that he thinks my friends are horrible people and he goes out of his way to insult them, even when they are there.  That is one thing I can never accept, and I will never bring my friends to him to screen them.  He actually has asked me to do so.  He is a hard man to love...but you know a mbti description isn't everything about a person, and there is a lot of things to love about him."
181,estj,"I've never had a romantic relationship with an INFP, but some of my very best girlfriends in the whole wide world are INFPs! :)
As an aside, my husband is an ENFJ and supposedly we're completely incompatible. But if you and your partner are well-rounded people and willing to learn, having a partner that views the world in such a different light helps broaden your horizons and make you a more balanced person. :)"
182,estj,"I find our opposites compliment each other too. One of the things I have trouble with is always wanting an immediate answer. I can't give immediate answers when I do, they are based purely out of emotion and I know that isnt the best way to deal with a problem. 
I am not an in your face person. We get along well other than that.
I am always surprised that my lack of organizational skills and my inability to see that the floor needs sweeping. 
We both seem to understand where the other is coming from and it helps us, well it helps me deal with the strict regiment.
And the fact that I am unorganized etc and its just the way we are made lol. 
Thanks for the site it was very interesting. :)"
183,estj,I am so sorry for what you have to go through. I however don't think this has to do with personality types. It sounds like you might be dealing with a narcississts. You could always visit r/raisedbynarcissists which is where I have found my solace. 
184,estj,"We are usually interested in the same topics, and share similar viewpoints, but with a different focus. We usually enjoy talking about things we've discovered that improve our lives. They usually appreciate the help that I give them, they have a similar attitude towards caring and loyalty. I like that they don't tend to be dramatic, and they have a similar sense of dry humor. "
185,estj,"I feel like I can give an immediate answer when it has to do with problem solving or logistical matters if I need to.  Where I struggle with giving an immediate answer is when it comes to answering questions pertaining to my emotions.  I need some time to figure that stuff out, and even then I can't always come to a satisfactory conclusion.  The INFPs in my life make that process of self understanding infinitely easier. That might be what we have to offer in return for keeping an eye out on the status of the floor."
186,estj,I should have said that too it is mainly when emotions or people are involved.  Logic type stuff doesn't usually cause me issues either. I do ha e a hard time deciding on where to eat or what cereal to buy  if someone else is with me lol.
187,estj,"Hello, ENTJ here 
Question: how do you go about in developing a romantic interest in someone? 
Details: 
For example, I analyze people constantly, subconsciously and consciously. Within the first meeting(s), I can determine what this person can mean to me and if I go towards a romantic path, I can determine if it can work longer term or not. Basically, from the start, I decide if I like this person romantically. 
As an ESTJ, Do you take time to develop feelings for someone? If so, about how long? And what is your thought process behind it? Do you choose or feel that you like this person? 
Thanks! "
188,estj,"It took me 8 months to realise I liked someone, the feelings kind of crept up on me. 
Then I assess everything. Do we have common interests? Do we have common values? Can I see myself being with them forever? As well as generally how they interact with people and what kind of ‚Äòvibe‚Äô I get.
If I can‚Äôt see myself with the person in the future, then I won‚Äôt do anything about it."
189,estj,"I am an ESTJ and my approach is the same as yours. I know it when I like someone in 1-2 meetings or not. I don‚Äôt take time to develop feelings for someone. Once I figure out I like someone, I plan how I‚Äôll go about asking them out on a date or something"
190,estj,I mean same as you I can analyze people very quickly and know where they‚Äôre at on their life path which is usually wins behind me so that goes no where. I think it depends what you want out of a relationship really. I‚Äôve been forcing myself out of my routine to meet people lately because I‚Äôm looking to change my lifestyle. I‚Äôve got one guy right now that after date one I can tell you just needs a female friend to boost his confidence but it‚Äôs probably not going anywhere long term. And I‚Äôve got another that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gonna be purely carnal with.
191,estj,"This is a horrible answer, but I have no idea. I saw him in the morning and later that day, something clicked. I think my brain realised that he‚Äôs actually crush material and I‚Äôd date him haha and my heart was like ‚Äòthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying all along‚Äô. But honestly I have no idea, maybe it‚Äôs because I was around him so often and I wondered why I always was when I didn‚Äôt have to be‚Ä¶
I have no pursued him, if you‚Äôve read my other posts you can see my dilemma haha, but no‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt done anything. I haven‚Äôt gained enough concrete evidence he‚Äôs interested and honestly I don‚Äôt think he is - I think he sees me as a friend. He‚Äôs more on the reserved side so I don‚Äôt want to scare him away‚Ä¶ so I have not done anything (besides the usual unintentional flirting etc.).
I‚Äôll think about a proper answer and send that to you when I come up with one - I‚Äôve never really thought about it, it just happened :)"
192,estj,"Re-post from r/MBTI
I have never met an ESTJ that held psychology as a field in particularly high regard. In fact, I have found quite the opposite. From what I can tell, they seem to think that it's a load of nonsense, imprecise, vague, not reproducible, and generally pointless. One major reason I have heard cited by them is that everyone is unique, and therefore there is no point in trying to categorize people or look for patterns. This strikes me as being incredibly narrow-minded, and quite frankly runs counter to everything I believe in, but I still want to understand why they believe this. I understand some studies are better than others, but the blanket aversion to and condemnation of psychology as a field is really surprising. A lot of studies in psych have not been replicated, but that does not mean they are not reproducible. The same holds true in other scientific fields like biology, chemistry, etc. Academics are under pressure to produce new findings as opposed to replicating old ones. Can anyone explain to me the apparent ESTJ dislike of psychology (and probably other social (soft) sciences as well)?"
193,estj,"It's funny seeing this post cos I'm an ESTJ but I studied psychology. Currently I'm taking my postgrad study in Human Resource Management. We can say that both are social (soft) studies? I think it's one proof that people with the same MBTI don't necessarily share the same characteristics/ interests.
I think, we ESTJs don't like social studies because of the grey areas and uncertain boundaries / classifications. It's quite difficult for us to gain conclusions from something uncertain and see it as a valuable input. If there's no exact conclusions that can be taken, we would automatically disregard it during our decision making process. We prefer clear answers and straightforward results, which is probably why most of us avoid these kind of fields.
If you're wondering what's driving me into these areas of work/studies, it's my need to harden these ""soft"" boundaries if that makes sense? Deep down I believe that we can put people in boxes. And by studying psychology I know how to do it correctly. That's also why I love MBTI. It helps me differentiate people and understand them. I also always have this interest for human beings and social issues, which maybe helps too."
194,estj,"I was like that, disliking psychology as a field because of the pretentious mythical vibe people like to put on it and act as if they could bloody read your mind when they did 3 years of psychology in school and that could get annoying very quickly. For me it's more or less like when a surgeon brags about how he does voodoo when he cuts up a patient, he instantly loses all respect and credit from me."
195,estj,"Interesting. See now HRM is really not all that much into psych compared to pure research. More about leadership and organization I should think. 
Ok, so which areas of psych did you most and least enjoy? The more specific you can be the better. I just really would like to know for future reference when interacting with ESTJs.
See now this is exactly what an ESTJ told me he hated about MBTI and personality psych. I actually made him take the test, and he got ESTJ. To him, everyone is absolutely unique, and any system that tries to reduce the ""infinite spectrum of human uniqueness"" to a pattern is to be avoided. This fits in with what Jung described about ESTJs in that they are reductionist in the sense that empirical facts will always trump first principles. This is why I'm surprised to hear that you love personality theory since it really isn't concrete, in any sense of the word."
196,estj,I'm ESTJ and anything grey can't be proven - so that's hard for me. I like psychology but I'm always trying to figure out ways it can be proven as absolute. I want to be taken seriously if I were to talk about it.
197,estj,"No I don't have a problem with it anymore, I've come to realize that in every field there are people who over-glorify things and then ruin it for everyone else, and that's just normal. If I could I would try to learn more about it as a whole, frankly as a subject it is quite interesting (though intimidating.)"
198,estj,"Well some of the people in the field would actually glorify what they could do. Which, really, often isn't quite within the premises of their profession. Again it's not about the field, really, there will always be commercials that give you all the false hopes, but due to their specialty it could become personal. The example is quite personal itself so I'll skip most of the irrelevant information and jump to the ambitious person who's responsible for my feeling about it. She was quite young and all but after a few consultations she straight up told me that she could actively ""cure"" me within a rather short frame of time. Ridiculous as it might sound, it actually gave me hope in that regard. It ended quite disastrously, though.
To me it's a little intimidating, the whole subject. It's quite a new field of science not in how long it's been studied but how much of it is proven fact and how much of it remains hypothesis. It's hard to be exact or be sure about lot of the topics and so to me it's quite 'unstable' or even unreliable in a sense. And both qualities are interesting and intimidating at the same time."
199,estj,"That is a very interesting and valuable answer. Thank you for your honesty about that. I can certainly see how someone might be turned off from the field after an experience like yours. The mind is a tricky thing to master, and it takes a lot of work I've found. I've seen several psychologists for my various problems, and none of them made much of a difference. The only thing that's helped me is meditation and mindfulness. Just always being in the present moment and never getting lost in the future or ruminating about the past. But again that takes much effort and dedication.
It's very interesting to me that you say the field's ""instability"" and ambiguity is both interesting and intimidating. For me, and I would venture for most ENTPs as well, I live to explore new knowledge, patterns, and possibilities, so that's never a problem, but I do agree that the lack of precision in psych is sometimes annoying, especially when the sample size is too small. But that just makes me want to find out if there really is a correlation or not. The grayness of the field for me I would say is not at all intimidating. If I see something that catches my interest, I'll delve right into it. The stuff about norms and values kind of turns me off, in an annoying kind of way, but sometimes it can be useful and interesting.
What areas of psych are most and least ""stable"" for you?"
200,estj,"Sure thing. The most stable part about it is actually the fact that it is useful, as in it could be used to aid the process of mending minds. And that is also the most unstable part of it. It is a part of being a new concrete scientific field, really, as in most of the time no promises can be made. Currently there is too much (and thus too little) limitation that's been imposed on the subject- as when the foundation of the science is not yet vastly understood or accepted, it needs to be put into practices and to be tested thousands of times just for the professionals to get a glimpse of something akin to the full truth and to impose reasonable boundaries under consideration of safety and well-being on it."
201,estj,"I wouldn't say that I believe in it (some things are still highly dubious,) it hasn't completely lost its credit yet, is all. I wouldn't talk about it in a tone that suggests that I'm sure that the theories are all true or false regarding MBTI, but I'm interested in knowing how people believe it all works and want to personally make my own judgement on how useful this whole concept is. I often feel reluctant relying on anything when I know it might not work properly, and this is of no exception."
202,estj,"i have a thing for ESTJ men (i'm an INFJ woman) but i never see you guys! where do you guys hang out, how do you meet women?
i've had 2 relationships with ESTJs in the past.. we met quite randomly at friend's bday and at the gym - haha. does this resonate?"
203,estj,"Hello Boss.  There are a lot of things about you I can respect.  Your efficiency, your ability to push on that tender area to get people to react and do your will, your absolute adherence to the logical, to the numbered list.  Your passion and your absolute devotion to be the best you surely are.
I have one message to deliver to you, boss, and I know you have the wit to understand.  
Basically, you are obsolete.
Your model has been the sexiest of the sexy, the fit guaranteeing the fittest, the sharpest amongst the pointedly stabbing.
But you deserve to be informed, that your model has had it's time and is deserving your glorious time off you generally won't consider you deserve.
I am faster than you, I am more efficient than you, I actually have a utilization of logic that isn't self-cannibalizing.  I can lead other men without making them want to deservedly stab me in the throat, I can speak to someone without being patronizing, I do not have time for your sadism or your disregard.  In the same vein you look at a person and can quickly sum up their value and their worth to you, I am saying to you now, there is no use for you in a world that never asked you to teach it a fucking lesson.  The lesson you have to teach is that of cruelty, of disregard, or of lack of even the understanding of what you cannot understand or possibly comprehend due to your configuration.
Basically, it comes down to this.  The next time you decide to flex your superficial power to hurt either myself or my compatriot, it's over.  I'm not only ripping out your jugular, I am taking out that which you love.  I am grabbing your wife by her pussy, and giving your mother a throat transplant.  I will speak the language you understand, you mother fucking masochistic piece of shit, and I will take you to that place you are too much of a fucking pussy to ever venture at any time due to lack of guts or anything resembling endurance, or basic tolerance.  I am your doppelganger and your nemesis, and you have taught me well.  You will scream like an utter bitch in absolute disbelief as I give you that which you have begged from me since my inception, and I will assure you, you will be satisfied with my performance.
Hope you have found god, you worthless cocksucking waste of any fucking resource with absolutely any fucking worth whatsoever.
So take it easy, enjoy the day, spend a few minutes sniffing the rose bush, but know that there is absolutely no animosity here.  You will not suffer, nor will those you love.
It's time for payback, mother fucker.  Open up and say ah :)  Daddy is coming home."
204,estj,"Seek professional help. Really, this is bizarre, and I highly doubt that you're exclusively having this reaction due to ""ESTJs"". Not trying to sound ""patronizing"", but I hardly think this post deserves a long, eloquent reply detailing a bunch of resources. Hope you get better."
205,estj,"Kinda harsh to point directly at ESTJs with this. My bro is an ESTJ while I'm an INFP and he is legit one of the nicest people out there, actually nicer than me.
There are many assholes out there. Just learn to stand up for yourself  and you will be rewarded in the end. Hierarchies of power never worked and never will, these people will go down soon enough."
206,estj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbti] ""What makes INFPs so innocent""

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
207,estj,Sometimes things keep building up when you stay quiet and at a point you'll blow up and show the amount of hatred you've had to hide over the years. But this post is a good thing for an INFP. To express what they feel. They should do it more often. But still... Not really ESTJ concerning.
208,estj,"This is your ESTJ interpretation. 
Ive a INFP friend, and with Te POLR (INFP is NiFeSiTe in socionic and I really think the OP is the socionic INFP especially from saying ""I actually have a utilization of logic that isn't self-cannibalizing""), they are like that when healthy actually. What I want is that ESTJ be able to understand their contrary type.
Me = INFJ (FiNeSiTe)
And the OP is right and not unheatlhy, you are just interpretating it that way"
209,estj,"Background information:
--- I'm ISFP, single, and have been working with an ESTJ for a little over two months. 
--- when I initially transferred to this job I worked in a different department than he did. He seemed to immediately notice me and often approached me for conversation. 
--- He exhibits thoughtful gestures, both big and small. He also remembers subtle things I say in passing and asks me about my family. 
--- He immediately hired me to work under him when I confided to him that I was unhappy with the position I was currently in. This despite the fact there were at least three other people in my department, who had privately expressed to him their desire to be transferred, and they have been with the company longer than I have. 
But he hired me instead. 
--- After he transferred me I was promoted and told there would be several opportunities available if I continued to prove myself. 
--- He continues to be supportive, helpful, and encouraging. He expresses concern when he thinks I'm struggling (both personally and professionally) and he seems interested in me as a person. Always laughs at my remarks, makes an effort to drop by and see me whenever he's there, gives me insight and advice. 
--- He is clearly charming and good with people in general. 
--- I do not think he is married and haven't heard about any girlfriend or significant other (not that I've asked. We have very strict anti-fraternization policies at work.)
--- I recently noticed he was ""friends"" with my former boss and one of my co-workers  (who, like me, is also his subordinate) on Facebook. Since the ESTJ and I are forthcoming with each other about our personal lives anyway, I attempted to add him. He did not acknowledge it. This was late last night. This afternoon I cancelled the request, feeling somewhat snubbed. (I would not have taken it so personally had I not seen him on my coworker's ""friends list"".)
--- Today he acted the same as always, charming and interested, and never said anything about the pending friend request. I didn't either, and was slightly more aloof and disinterested than usual. I do not think he noticed because the change in my mood was subtle and could easily have been attributed to stress at work. I came home and canceled the request.
--- What's up with this guy? What are his intentions, if any? Should I just shut my mouth and stick to my work and be grateful for the opportunities he's given me? Or should I continue to be friendly with him (which is nearly impossible to do when I can't be honest and open and blunt...I'm Fi dominant) and let him decide the boundaries for this friendship?
--- one more thing: he has never directly said or done anything that could be misconstrued as inappropriate. He is always professional and the only reason I've read so much into his behavior is because of (a) the kind gestures he's made toward me and (b) I'm interested in him. 
Anyway thanks for reading, if you still are. Any advice or interpretations would be appreciated :)"
210,estj,"Am ESTJ female, might be able to offer you some insight. I think that he's cautious because he is also interested. He's not sure where to take this interaction, nor does he know the boundaries to set for this friendship. "
211,estj,"Just another thought: I'm an ESTJ and have a Facebook with lots of friends on my list but I don't check it daily at all. He might have just missed it. :)
Also, ESTJs don't play games. There's no underlying context you're supposed to be picking up on, so don't read into anything too much. If he's interested, he'll show you lots of personal attention and eventually ask you out if the workplace rules allow for it. If he's not interested, he'll just treat you the same as he does everyone else."
212,estj,"Thank you for the explanation. I wondered about that. Our workplace fraternization policy is restricted to people of different ranks only, so technically co-workers of the same position (ie two managers) are not seen as problematic.
I thought maybe he was waiting, but that seemed kind of presumptuous on my end. 
What do you suggest I do, if anything? "
213,estj,"Well...the workplace rules don't allow it because he is my boss.  
Personally I find rules like that ""flexible"" but I'm assuming you lot do not feel the same way...
I think about it way too much and you're right in that I shouldn't.  I wondered if maybe he didn't see it, like you said. Or didn't add me because he actually is in a relationship and just never mentioned it to me. 
But then I wondered if maybe he's waiting until (or to see if) I get promoted and then I'm fair game?
But...SPs don't really have the patience for long term pursuits (or I don't anyway.) 
I think I'll forget about it. I saw him today and it was business as usual. We have chemistry, but if there's not a good chance something will come of it I'd  like to focus my attention elsewhere. 
Thank you for the input :)"
214,estj,I don't think you can really do anything at this point. He's being very helpful and attentive to your professional needs so definitely ask for help when you need it. Romantically I wouldn't hope for too much. ESTJs tend to follow regulations/rules unless there is a definite chance of things working out within these limitations. 
215,estj,"As a female INFJ, I'm wondering what your sex life is like. What does it mean for you ESTJ men? How is it different from having sex with someone you're in love with versus with someone you may not be in love with?"
216,estj,"You're coming to the internet to ask ESTJs to talk about their feelings.  Best of luck with that. 
Anyway, I can try to take a crack at it.  Love, to me, means taking on all the other person's triumphs and failures as my own.  It's a transition from being an individual to a team.  Having sex with someone that you're not in love with is more so going through the motions so to speak and wouldn't have much of a long term impact.  The focus might be more selfish and about one's personal desires. If it's within the context of a caring relationship then there's a sense of connection, reciprocity, and tenderness that wouldn't necessarily be there otherwise."
217,estj,"Thank you for your reply :) ""A transition from being an individual to a team,"" that is such a well written description. I love that so much. 
Since we're in an MBTI forum, what types have you dated in the past and how have they been?
I've always felt my connections to ESTJ men were the best and most compatible, despite many redditors expressing otherwise about that S and N dynamic. "
218,estj,"Personally, I've dated an INFP, ISTP, and ESFP.  My most fulfilling experiences were with the INFP I dated.  We tended to be more supportive of one another.  The ISTP, in retrospect, was more of a rebound so that's not the best comparison.  I couldn't get on board with how reactive vs proactive they were.  This particular individual wasn't as motivated towards achievement in life and that made it difficult for me to see a future with them.  The ESFP was an energetic and fun time while it lasted.  We ended up calling it off when we moved to different places to accept job offers/return to school.  
Some of my closest friends are INFJs though.  By some I really mean two.  I enjoy some of the unique insight they provide in discussion.  They tended to be highly academic and passionate in conversation, which I really appreciated.  I think we tended to have the most fun when I would attempt to query them on their views and play the devil's advocate for them.  I think in the long run we both came away with a better understanding of the topic and one another's mindset."
219,estj,"Thank you! It's rare to have such an articulate ESTJs to talk about romance. Haha. 
I can't tell if you're a woman or a man, but I'm glad you like your relationships with intuitives. Are you attracted to highly motivated/successful people as your romantic partner? Most of my ESTJ friends are very driven and I always wonder if they seek the same in their s.o."
220,estj,"Ah well, the articulate part took practice.  It's not easy talking about this kind of stuff most of the time. 
To answer your question, yes.  Being highly motivated in an individual's chosen field is something I find attractive.  People that are overly content with themselves don't seem to be trying to grow or improve.  Self improvement is something that's very important to me.  I might not accomplish it all the time, but it's certainly something to strive for.  That's a quality I look for both in myself and those I cherish (S.O. or otherwise)."

Results Post Here

Hey there, ESTJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESTJ) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance! (see below for more info)

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven‚Äîsometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
222,estj,"Are you still taking responses?
Openness - 92%
Conscientiousness - 85%
Extraversion - 62.5%
Agreeableness - 46% (I'm actually kind of surprised by this. I think it's because I select relatively high in some categories like ""I criticise other people"", but I'm really just doing that in a fun, silly teasing way)
Neuroticism - 46% (a lot of people would probably agree I should've scored higher in this, they tend to think I'm very anxious and worrying. I'm actually not that anxious or worried, though, I just come off that way because I'm a super contingency-planner and tend to think of a lot of negative things, but it doesn't worry me too much, I get worried when I don't consider possibilities)
Core patterns of thinking ranked:

Analytical thinker
Empathic idealist (only slightly below 1)
Logical mechanic (waaaaay below 2)
Practical caretaker (only slightly below 3)

If I had to personally rank them, I'd probably also start with Analytical Thinker, but then next up would be Practical Caretaker. I'm very much a practical person when it comes to helping people, more in a Te way than a Si or Fi way though. Logical Mechanic doesn't sound too much like me because I pretty much question every solution put in front of me until everyone else wants to kill themselves, and Empathic Idealist just doesn't capture any of me at all.
Alright, that's all the data I get with the free report. Hope this helps :)"
223,estj,"I‚Äôm an ESTJ
Openness: 67%
Conscientiousness: 85%
Extraversion: 75%
Agreeableness: 62.5%
Neuroticism: 50% (honestly expected this to be higher)
Edit: adding my ranked core patterns...
1 Empathic Idealist
2 Analytical Thinker
3 (just a bit lower) Practical Caretaker
4 Logical Mechanic
This seems to contradict with my ESTJ type, right? Or maybe my Fi is stronger than most ESTJs and so I‚Äôm able to be empathetic? I‚Äôve always questioned my type because I seem to have more feeling / empathy than you‚Äôd expect for an ESTJ. "
224,estj,"ENxP (sorry I can't give you my specific type, I'm not totally sure)
Openness: 81% Conscientiousness: 29% Extroversion: 73% Agreeableness: 52% Neuroticism: 56%
Core Pattern: Empathetic Idealist Analytical Thinker Practical Caretaker (Big jump down from 2) Logical Mechanic"
225,estj,"I am a healthcare fraud & abuse detection data analyst. I absolutely LOVE my job. It allows me to focus on finding people breaking the rules (which oddly satisfies me), sift through mountains of data to find patterns of fraud/abuse, and also present my findings in both written and verbal form. My job lets my brain do what it is intended to do, which is very satisfying. It does bring out my more introverted side (I'm only just slightly more extroverted than introverted), since I can get sucked into my work and not come up for air for a while, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. "
226,estj,"I'm a sales and service coordinator. Don't ask me what it means, I do just about every job in the office, including service, office management, shipping manager, sales, trade shows, customer service, vendor and distributor relations. "
227,estj,"That does sounds oddly fun. I'm a server and a substitute teacher right now. I'm pretty good at keeping even middle-schoolers in line, and I'm just extroverted enough to sell drinks to my guests pretty easily later on."
228,estj,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
229,estj,"I think you linked the wrong one because that clearly wasn't a cognitive function test. You even gave the results at the end in the form of the dichotomies. That being said, once again, I got ENFJ-A.
E - 49% (for some reason I got E on this despite scoring higher on Introversion)
N - 63%
F - 51%
J - 62%
A - 68%
EDIT: Ignore this, I found the functions at the bottom. Maybe put them closer to the top.
EDIT 2: That being said, based on my functions, I should've gotten INFJ or ENFP.
EDIT 3: Either way, whether or not I was scored on the cognitive functions, those questions were obviously testing the dichotomies as they weren't tailored to the functions."
230,estj,"Once in a while, a friend will talk to me about how sad they are, or how they're depressed, something bad going on in their life, etc etc. I really want to be helpful to them, but all I can end up doing is either stay silent and listen to them because I don't know what to say, or just saying things like ""it's gonna be okay"" over and over again, both of which I know are some of the least helpful things I can say. 
‚Äã
So, fellow ESTJs, what do you do in situations that require Fe?"
231,estj,"I flat out ask them what they need. 
‚ÄòThis sounds really awful or challenging etc. How can I best support you? Would you like a hug? A meal? A distraction? Advice?‚Äô
It has been a useful approach for me."
232,estj,"This is accurate enough. Why not delegate the task to someone better at this. If no one is around I'll suggest an outlet/liesure activity that's cheerful. To be honest, this is more so for people not very close to me even if they believe we're closer than we are. With close relations I'll try more."
233,estj,"It honestly depends on who the person is, if I‚Äôm not friends with them, I‚Äôll ask their friends to take over. If I am, then usually I know what to do-but usually I‚Äôm not the one providing emotional support"
234,estj,"I have done my research. I know what the functions are, I can type people fairly well. I can recite definitions but I am not going to do that. I can go with how the function stacks look in my dreams. Hahaha! Anyway. 
I know what Ni and si are. But what are the differences pragmatically? In real life? Give examples caused by Ni and si differences.
Also here are some odd questions
Do you think as estjs we are louder or brasher or both than entjs?
Do you think it‚Äôs easier to tell what we think then with entjs?
Do you think that ESTJ and ENTJ tends to express there te differently or how much they are willing to exercise it?"
235,estj,"I think our Si makes us less likely to take risks. 
I see a lot of ENTJs being entrepreneurs and honestly there is nothing remotely exciting about that to me. My old boss put all of her savings into her business and thank god she was successful because I couldn‚Äôt think of a worse disaster. 
I also have seen ENTJs to be a lot more open on social media. Active every day always posting something new. Sorta too open in ways. And I haven‚Äôt logged into Facebook in a year and only use Snapchat to send videos and pictures of my cats and Instagram to send memes. 
In a way, ENTJs actually intimidate me. I think they come off way more confident and sure of themselves and their ability to put themselves out there makes them more likable. "
236,estj,"There is a number of differences listed in these profiles. Generally ENTJs give a lighter and less serious impression in conversation than ESTJs and are more visionary, while ESTJs are much more thorough, reliable, and demanding in their work.  
ESTJ by Gulenko | ESTJ by Stratiyevskaya | ESTJ subtypes 
ENTJ by Gulenko | ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya | ENTJ subtypes "
237,estj,"This is so true. My old boss is an ENTJ and is very politically open on Facebook and has a tendency to provoke others and still manage to win every argument. 
I just can‚Äôt be open about my views unless I am ready to fight and honestly I‚Äôd rather keep the peace. 
I also think ENTJs are a lot more creative. She created her company from nothing and put all of her money into it. That is a risk i would Never take. And I see myself as more of a fixer. I‚Äôd rather join a company and seek out the problems it has and make it better. "
238,estj,"What do you mean more open on social media? More open personally? I use social media a lot but mostly it‚Äôs news related or to make some sort of remark but yeah.
I think you‚Äôre right about that one. I can be very cautious, at least the older I guess. When I was younger not so much but these days I think it over quite a bit.
Interesting observations though.
I don‚Äôt like this ceo and manager stereotype though maybe it‚Äôs just me? I mean maybe they just mean that they are more opened and less cautious, but I mean who‚Äôs to say we can‚Äôt be founders of things? But yeah, I don‚Äôt know if I see myself starting a business. This manipulative INFJ I know friends with on and off keeps wanting me to go that way...."
239,estj,"Like she shares everything. Always posts pictures of herself and her kids and all the happenings. When she needs advice she goes to social media and just shares
I‚Äôm just not that kind of person. She loves attention. I love recognition. If you‚Äôre going to be talking about me, I want it to be about my success or something nice about me. I don‚Äôt just wanna draw attention to myself for no reason. 
It‚Äôs just not likely, possible sure, but it‚Äôs rare. 
I‚Äôd love to work my way up the corporate ladder and work in a high position but i really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd enjoy the top position. 
Sometimes when they describe ESTJs as the middle management it can sound insulting in ways, but I think we‚Äôre the best man(woman) for the job. I‚Äôm good at being somewhere in the middle. Because I‚Äôm good at picking out problems and solving them and you just can‚Äôt do that at the top. And I‚Äôm a team player. I‚Äôm not someone who likes working alone. 
My Boss did so much at her home. Ran her business like that and I would be miserable. I love having people around me. She was constantly on the phone and working with people through emails and such but I still would go crazy doing that. 
I need a job that allows me to interact with others. I do enjoy time alone and working alone, but when I‚Äôm alone for longer periods of time I get depressed and unmotivated. 
I can see myself as someone who helps someone else‚Äôs business launch. I am the one who helps push others to succeed. I would start it alone because i just don‚Äôt have an inventors mind but if someone had an idea and it wasn‚Äôt much of a risk for me I would absolutely help them out. We‚Äôre good with details others forget about. "
240,estj,"ah that makes sense about the diffferences that‚Äôs interesting about the 
ENTJ friend you have. I can agree with you.
Also, yeah, I guess it just sounds really not that good but I can see that. I don‚Äôt know if I want to or have the abilities to be the top man. I am not sure if it‚Äôs other factors or having si but I work slower. I work in incredible details. But yeah. For that reason I just don‚Äôt know."
241,estj,"I have been reading little tidbits about what life would be like up on the ISS and the plans and struggles are in going to Mars. What are your thoughts on this? Is it worth it?
Just seeing that we can put people in a livable environment nearly 500 kms above our heads amongst the dark vacuum of space is really insane. It will be very interesting to see how conquering the environment of mars will turn out.
Apparently there are many people who would opt into a one way trip to Mars if they could, but I wouldn't ever want to do that. I can only begin to imagine how much I would miss simply being able to freely go outside."
242,estj,"Once we get Warp Drive, Artificial Gravity, Holodecks, Replicators, and Transporters, sign me up!
Otherwise no thank you. I'll leave it up to the adventurous people who don't mind living in perpetual discomfort and fearing for their lives all the time."
243,estj,"It's a glorious endeavour that taps into the human need for discovery and generates much needed hero's for Western civilisation. 
Ever since the ease of travel and the discovery of all land masses over the world, society has become sedate, fulfilling the void left with degeneracy."
244,estj,"Hey it's your mortal enemy, an ENTP.
I've been researching about this type because I'm curious to see if it really matches with my friend.
But most of the description detail how an ESTJ is professionally. But I'd like to know how they are in their personal lives.
The good and the bad."
245,estj,"My husband is ESTJ - maybe this will be helpful from another perspective? 
He‚Äôs outgoing and will talk to anyone and everyone but mainly because he really receives a lot of assurance from people liking him. However he doesn‚Äôt love people flat out. You have to fit his particular requirements for him to bring you into his inner circle. Once you are his person, however, he is incredibly loyal and protective of you. 
He is very fact based, to the point, and sometimes lacks empathy when the situation doesn‚Äôt relate to him, or is illogical. 
He is very regimented which means he‚Äôs extraordinarily reliable, however on the downside, inflexible. 
Perhaps it‚Äôs just him, but he‚Äôs incredibly coachable. You have to be someone he respects or loves but he will take it heart and immediately start applying that feedback.
I‚Äôm an ESFP - I think we balance each other really well. I think our shared E&S means we perceive the world the same and have the same kind of language but I have more of a free heart-driven approach vs his scheduled head-driven approach. It‚Äôs a wonderful way for us to bring both sides to the world and meet in the middle."
246,estj,"Outside of work and school I pretty much keep to myself. I like spending time alone and don't want to be all that active. Which has led me to have quite a few introverted friends. I'm actually best friends with 3 INFPs. I honestly don't know how I keep finding them, but I'm just so drawn to them and I feel like we really click. One was from my a job, one was my roommate and the other I met in class. 
This might sound a little weird, but I don't like sharing my friends. I want time alone with them. If they have a hobby or favorite activity, I'd rather make it more personal for them. Instead of getting a bunch of friends together, I'll find time to hang with them alone. I do have friends I hang within groups, and I enjoy that time, but one-on-one is what I prefer. And I think that's why I get along so well with introverts. 
I also really care about family. I try and visit when I can, even relatives. I grew up with a big family and we always had gatherings so I know my relatives pretty well, so any chance to catch up and meet them, I make the time. 
I care about work and school a lot and can seem very serious at times, which has rubbed others the wrong way. But I promise, the second I clock out, I'm no longer on work mode. Work stays at work, and I am really good at separating my work life from my personal life.  
My weak point is I sometimes get really frustrated when those I care about don't live up to the expectations I have for them. My (INTP) brother dropped out of college for a year and I was so mad at him. I felt like he was so close to graduating. It ended up being really good for him and he did go back and found something he's passionate about. In hindsight it was good for him, I just had a hard time accepting that. 
The INFP who was my roommate is the exact opposite of me in every way possible. I honestly don't know how we get along so well.  And she needs to be given the space to be her own person. She's brilliant in my eyes but struggles academically. She's read so many books and is so creative, but if she isn't passionate about something, she struggles to find the motivation. She's taught me that most people aren't like me. They don't want the same things as I do, and I need to learn to back off and let people figure things out for themselves. "
247,estj,"Oh my GOD. Your description is literally like reading about my own life (also ESTJ). I live with my best friend who is an INFP (also someone I find to be BRILLIANT but dropped out of college and hates school) and also prefer one on one or one on 2-3 time with my close friends as opposed to giant groups, despite being very extroverted. DAMN. My INFP friend makes me a better person because she forces me to recognize how normal it is to sit down and take breaks, and to back off from trying to problem-solve when it‚Äôs not something others explicitly ask for (I have a tendency to offer solutions to problems because it‚Äôs how I show I care, but i don‚Äôt need to research the best migraine medicine for her if she doesn‚Äôt explicitly ask me to lol). I also have a trigger point at the concept of ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù‚Äîif other people (esp in the work setting) are displaying what to me appears incompetence, I will feel RAGE towards them. (Kind of a ‚ÄúYOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!‚Äù Sort of thing). I think I take a joke pretty well and have a lot of self-deprecating humor myself, but even JOKES related to my own competence I will shrivel up and die on the inside. Getting older I‚Äôve learned how to not react destructively to that but it still STINGS. Unsurprisingly, there‚Äôs not a lot of situations where friends joke about my competence because there‚Äôs no material for the jokes-lol. But when they do it‚Äôs usually about social competence and I internally just lose my shit. Trying as an adult not to lash out irrationally at that üòÇ"
248,estj,"Male ESTJ here.
I often don't know how I think or feel about something unless it comes up as a topic or someone asks about it. Then I'll organize my thoughts extremely quickly and answer as if I had something prepared. Sometimes I would have to write about a book in school and my answers were terrible because they were generic because the prompt was generic and I didn't know what was important. Then we'd have class discussions and I'd do amazingly well and my teacher didn't understand why I could do one and not the other.
I crush on INFPs really easily. I'll try to hang around and talk with them for a while so it looks like it's happening naturally and gradually. I actively seek out TV shows, movies, music, art, and comics with INFP themes characters, and writing.
With some people, I'll talk for hours if I can pick through their mind or I like their stories. With most people, I'll get tired of it within 30 minutes or an hour and want to play a game or something. This is especially the case at parties. This is comparable to other people preferring to get together with 2-3 best friends. It's easier to control things to do your favorite things and have good conversations.
I have witty, dry humor. I like teasing people just a tiny bit and getting a big reaction out of them. I have a friend that I got really good and he says he'll hate me forever for it. We're still best friends and whenever he brings it up I laugh so hard and tell him I love him for it."
249,estj,"You can get to know me if you want, just send me a message. I love to talk! School is starting so yeah, may be more prudent to trade numbers or e-mails or I add most anyone on facebook I have mostly the blind community on there. I am a blind ESTJ. But I don‚Äôt say anything important I treat it like another forum and I just post up some thoughts here and there, welcome to join and we can talk on messenger. But what I am suggesting is find me outside of reddit but message me here first.
I think it depends on eneagram.
I am a 3w2 317.
I am really social outside of school and I imagine work. I‚Äôve done a few things. And when I do volunteer and called to mentor and stuff I am quite different. But yeah, outside maybe you can tell maybe you can‚Äôt. I act no different then I do on here. Well maybe, I answer mostly questions on here but yeah. I am very relaxed. I think it‚Äôs harder to see te really at work. I don‚Äôt know what you see. You see it more in a laid back way in my speech and interactions but yeah. Not sure. I don‚Äôt know what function is dominant in outside of work fun conversations.
My 7 of my enneagram tritype comes out really well after work or not in school or doing mentor consulting type of stuff.
I can be a show in itself. Hahaha! I talk a lot. I can be really entertaining in my own way. But my 3w2 is still very prominent. So it‚Äôs not a pure 7 thing. But I have some fun too. Silly jokes like being goofy.
I can‚Äôt see so now if I run in to someone to make light of things I say.
‚ÄúOops, I forgot you were solid sorry.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt joke around or blatantly tell joke after joke, but that type of humor comes out.
I am very jovial and talkative. I can talk someone‚Äôs ear off. Hahaha! I talk aboutn the other person a lot or a shared interest.
I am also a 3 so I blend in to the environment type of conversation. Whatever interest them. Ah, yes. Si is probably the function I use most in social interactions. I try to match you in conversations.
I had an ENTP friend and still kind of do. He‚Äôs an interesting character. Apparently he and I share a bit of similar music, I use jazz only when studying. And he likes that stuff. He use to chase me around twitter and debated anything I posted on there. I got tired of that. I never said no for a while. But I sometime saw Geoff‚Äôs name and just never got back to him for a while. I was with a controling ISFP boyfriend. For a while and I finally blocked him. And then later it‚Äôs like this is really stupid? And then I unblocked him. We sometime talk but it‚Äôs rare we didn‚Äôt talk for a while."
250,estj,"Wow yeah high expectations for others is such an ESTJ trait. Also my husband is an introvert collector too, I think intellectually stimulating people are attractive to ESTJs so it does seem like introverts are likely to have some amount of introspection that makes them really interesting to ESTJs."
251,estj,"Hmm this is quite close to what my friend is like ...
She emphasises the importance of her family and has very high expectations of others. My other friend pranked my ESTJ friend about being pregnant and she yelled at my other friend, because she believed that she should put her school and career first before having a baby. I must say her outrageous reaction was so amusing üòÇ
The only difference is that all her friends are extroverts and so are mine, but she acts the most introverted despite being an extrovert."
252,estj,"When I lived with my INFP friend we would sometimes have plans and when she would say she was ready, what she meant was she was going to start getting ready. But when I say I‚Äôm ready I‚Äôm ready to walk out the door. 
She would drive me up the fucking wall and would laugh the whole time over how frustrated I would get. And honestly that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs my favorite person. Someone who can take my crazy side and poke fun at it. Someone who can teach me that being 5 minutes late isn‚Äôt the end of the world. 
We also lived with her mom and her mom would sometimes ask us to do stuff before she left for work. And I‚Äôd want to do everything right away, but she would push it off. And I swear she acted casual because she knew I would take care of it because I couldn‚Äôt stand something not getting done. 
I also love how easy it is to pick out when they are mad. They tend to shut themselves in act all closed off and all it takes is inviting them out to their favorite vegan restaurant and now they can‚Äôt be mad at you anymore. 
Truly the best type if I had to pick one. "
253,estj,"Reading all of these responses of reported interest in INFP's is so fascinating. I'm dating an ESTJ and I'm an ENFP-INFP...almost 50-50 on E-I.
We met online and I originally wasn't into him. He literally wouldn't take no for an answer on dating him. Ha, so here I am still dating him after having broken things off multiple times. So funny. He's a man who seems to get his way in life. 
The longer I date this man, and learn about him...the more I like him. He's really great. I just didn't understand how he processed the world. I'm learning through reddit and by talking to him more in depth. 
I always tell him that I have NO idea why he even likes me, as I'm always running from him. I'm also assuming that he probably doesn't comprehend my brain full of whimsical thoughts and emotions...just like I didn't get his logical mind. 
What do you think the draw is to these INFP types? "
254,estj,"Yeah I‚Äôm dating an INTJ. He‚Äôs a smarty and is always introducing me to new information. Constantly reading new books and watching documentaries. 
I‚Äôm not a big reader and usually just watch tv shows when I‚Äôm bored. But if it‚Äôs a good topic I‚Äôll gladly join in. I love a good debate. "
255,estj,"Yeah I put school and work first too. But I do it because I want to provide my kids with a good life. I don‚Äôt really care if you want kids earlier on but I‚Äôd like to pay for their college and set them up for success. 
I work in sales and retail and am a marketing student and am on ALL DAY LONG which is probably why I come home to a quiet place and like people that aren‚Äôt full of energy. 
I like working with enteric and outgoing people and I obviously love my job and then as a business student it‚Äôs a lot of working with others so that‚Äôs kinda why I‚Äôm not as outgoing outside of it all. 
And then my old roommate was an ENFJ and we did karaoke every week and we always went out and I loved it and miss that but I think school and work are too demanding right now. "
256,estj,Socionics claims that the opposing functions attract each other (Te to Fi and Si to Ne). It's also stronger when the functions match primary to primary. They predict ESTJ and INFP (EII) as each other's best relationship.
257,estj,"Lol yes‚ÄîI am 100000% extroverted, I took the super fancy paid assessment for work and the coach came and interpreted stuff for us‚Äîextroversion is the strongest of my 4 preferences.  It‚Äôs more about the preference for getting energy from being around other people rather than by myself. Being alone is reallllllly draining for me, and I come alive around others. Introverts have found my extroversion intrusive in the past actually. I never feel intruded upon when others spontaneously want to hang out with me, even people who are not my ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù, and get very sad when plans get cancelled. I think because I have the preference for extroverted thinking and not extroverted feeling, I enjoy one on one conversations the most, and my tendency towards efficiency just pushes me to be more interested in spending my free time with people who are interesting/fun/I enjoy that time with.
I‚Äôm actually really curious about this in ESTJs, especially with our interest in good outcomes rather than perfect processes, we are actually way more flexible than we seem, and less rigid than ISTJs. I wonder if the Extroverted Thinking function differentiates our type of extroverted activities that we enjoy most from those types that lead with Extroverted Feeling. When hanging out with my INFP bestie, she needs to have silence/do a passive activity together like tv after like 30 minutes of conversation. With my other bestie who is an ENFP, we can literally talk for 12 hours straight and just be the happiest clams. But ENFP bestie will literally do that with anyone, because she doesn‚Äôt really care about ‚Äúwasted time‚Äù and also enjoys loud social spaces like concerts more than I do, like she can pick up on that FEELING without the conversation/discussion/extroverted thinking element being present."
258,estj,"Ah, I just don‚Äôt know a lot of e that spend a lot of time at home or prefers small groups. It‚Äôs interesting. I don‚Äôt love gbig groups but it‚Äôs more I don‚Äôt have a preference. Friends and I go out a lot.
Maybe it could be different enneagram types.
I just posted such a post."
259,estj,"Idk. I‚Äôve always preferred smaller groups but I like to be with people a lot.  But I take 18 credits and work 30 hours a week so I guess with that amount of work my time alone is what keeps me sane. I love being busy, I actually perform better with a packed schedule but I also want time by myself. "
260,estj,"I'm an ENFP. 
1) Usually when ESTJs (and ENTJs) are into me, they try to hire me at their workplace so that they have an excuse to spend more time with me. 
2) Maybe it's because I've known a lot of ennea 3s, but they talk about achievements and current work stuff. That's their version of a come on. But, I am a 3. So it is definitely a ""come hither"" sign for me :D lol.
3) The ESTJ I knew would spontaneously become goofy and joke a lot. Some of the jokes weren't necessarily funny, but I laughed anyway, because I thought it was cute. 
4) Try to talk to you a lot, compliment you or flirtatiously insult you."
261,estj,"I'm an ESTJ.
I usually try to figure the person out as best as I can. I ask them a lot of personal questions and I'll ask them to hang out as frequently as possible. Eventually, I just tell them I like them. I'm not really one for playing games."
262,estj,"I'll normally compliment a girl I like on her hard work or the things she's done or made. I want her to know that those accomplishments are attractive and valuable to me.
Also I'll ask her a lot of questions about herself and give her more than the unusual attention during conversation"
263,estj,"I'm dating an INFP and as I understand its a duality relationship, so thoughts on INFP=pretty awesome she gives me space to be able to process feelings which is difficult for me, cant say wether or not it is for other ESTJs so you guys will probably be best friends for a while lmao"
264,estj,Hey! I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend is an INFP. I love her to death. She doesn‚Äôt have deep connections with that many people but she‚Äôs constantly observing everyone and taking in her environment. She‚Äôs kind and gentle when she‚Äôs not going through anything. She internalizes a lot of feelings and thoughts though so it can be hard trying to pull those feelings out to try and resolve issues. I hope this helps
265,estj,"I feel like this gets asked once a week but I‚Äôll say what I always say. 
I love INFPs. 
I love my INTJ SO and while I can‚Äôt imagine dating an INFP I have 3 INFP best friends and y‚Äôall are amazing people. 
You just get people better than anyone else. Most people see me as difficult or intense but y‚Äôall just love me for who I am and make me feel accepted and loved. 
I had a really tough year a few years ago and the only person who didn‚Äôt judge me and was a real friend the whole time was an INFP. I lost a lot of friends during that time because I saw how fake they were and how little they actually cared. My INFP roommate was just there. She would go to the beach with me to watch the sunset and watch Tv late at night. She would make homemade French fries with me. Let me vent and just listen. 
And now I‚Äôm in a much better place. So much better and I was asked to write down a beneficiary and I wrote her name down. Because she was the only one who deserved it since she got me through that year."
266,estj,She is the caricature of how intuitives seem to think female ESTJ's are like. She is very much the messed up stereotype lol. I'd say a more close to reality fictional female ESTJ is a character like Hermione Granger.
267,estj,"When an ENFJ thinks they know what's best for you if you choose otherwise they will be very hurt by it. 
Do not let them manipulate you into doing something you don't want to do. 
I had 2 ENFJ mentors so not necessarily parents, but still older and important to me. 
I hate how ENFJ act like they know what's best for others because if you take a look at their own lives, they usually don't have a lot that could even back them up. The two that I know one was a druggie and severely messed up until she got pregnant, that somehow changed her and she made sure her daughter had the best life possible. She is a good mom but has been divorced twice now.  I love her but I don't really think she makes the most logical decisions. 
I remember when her daughter who is also a really good friend of mine (INFP) and her weren't on speaking terms and she saw her daughter as bratty and misbehaving and closed off and she was really upset about the whole thing. And because I'm best friends with the INFP I knew what had happened.  One of the mom's friends saw a photo quote on facebook about ""being a good daughter to your mom"" or some other bullshit and she tagged her in it. So it made the INFP feel like her mom was talking a bunch of shit about her behind her back. When the mom and I had been talking I had mentioned that and she was livid. She knew exactly who had sent the photo and couldn't believe they would do that. So she ended up standing up for her daughter and deleting that friend of Facebook, which was good, but it took her a while to understand that there might be a bigger issue. They have big hearts and care for their loved ones, but INFPs aren't as confrontational and for as empathetic as they are, they can really struggle to take a step back and understand that there's a lot more to most situations than they think.  
The other one also almost got divorced until God saved her...
She was extremely manipulative though and would pressure my mom into doing things and used God as the reason why. When her and my mom stopped being friends she cut me off without even giving me a reason. I've been abandoned in the past and it hurt me a lot. She never really apologized for it or understand how much damage she did to me. 
Nobody is perfect, but ENFJs could really take a step back before they decide to judge others. And that's really the only complaint I have with them. They love people and helping people and working with others, but they struggle to walk the talk.  "
268,estj,"Thanks for writing this. I am ENFJ and my son is ESTJ. We have a good relationship and I want to make it better. He complains I try to kiss/hug him too much (he‚Äôs 10). 
I can see what you mean about the manipulative tendency. I have caught myself doing it in the past. ESTJs (even a 10 year old one) seem to have an uncanny ability to see the manipulation. 
Thanks for your story."
269,estj,"It can apply beyond us, but the song ""head full of doubt/road full of promise"" by the Avett brothers sums up how I feel about things as an ESTJ. 
""When nothing is owed,deserved or expected/your life doesn't change by the man that's elected/ if you're loved by someone than you're never rejected/decide what to be and go be it""
The first line sums up a lot of how I think about politics... Anti entitlement, meaning I'm willing to work for what's mine instead of hoping it comes to me or thinking i deserve it. 
The second line.... The idea of emotional security, that if you're loved by someone it doesn't matter if you're unloved by another. As an ESTJ I think we naturally find ourselves in positions of leadership and management and you aren't always liked by everyone, so having the security of love from someone else helps counterbalance that; basically, I have friends and family, I do not care if you do not like me for doing the right thing.
And finally, the line that really resonates with me: decide what to be and go be it. It speaks to how I think of goals as an ESTJ. There are no frills attached to success, it is simply something to be attained if you are of mind to get it. No magic potion or secret formula, just hard work and elbow grease. "
270,estj,"If you're planning on replying ""any type can exhibit any behaviour"", I just saved you a few seconds. I'm asking for personal opinions and maybe even anecdotes from people who are (or who know) an ESTJ who attends protests, organises strikes, etc., as well as their reasons for supporting that cause.
(X-posting to /r/mbti when it actually lets me)"
271,estj,"I've known a few ESTJs with a passion for political opinion.  It doesn't seem too far a leap to imagine them lending their organizational and leadership skills to them as well.  The ones I knew just didn't have the time or were perhaps not yet developed enough to do so.  Many politicians are ESTJ, which is similar to activism when you consider the grassroots efforts of campaigning and reaching people with a message."
272,estj,"Everywhere online i‚Äôm always seeing people complaining about how their ESTJ dad or mom has ruined their life in some way or how they have a terrible relationship with them. As an ESTJ who would like to be a mom one day, reading all this has really made me wonder if I should just not be a mom at all. I would never want to have a child if my type is just generally not made to be a loving parent. Does anyone out there actually have a positive experience with an ESTJ parent or is it hopeless? "
273,estj,"Omg do not ever let that stuff make you second guess if you're going to love your kids.
I say take a look at all of it as excellent anecdotal tools to help you prepare for any conflicts in case your children turn out to be really sensitive feelers (NFs). I have an Estj stepfather and lemme tell you, I'd be some spirally dreamy depression biscuit if he didn't bring some semblance of order and discipline into my and my ESTP mother's life üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The common thread I see for gripes with ESTJ parents are those who lean HARD on Si and close off any Ne. If you listen, communicate, and compromise with your children where necessary, while still keeping your head level about what boundaries NEED to be asserted, I have great faith in you. "
274,estj,"I've actually seen quite a few posts on the main mbti sub where members actually had really good things to say about their parents.  It surprised me too. 
My dad is an ESTJ and the funny thing is, although he was man of the house, he was no where near what people claim ESTJ parents to be. 
He was amazing and is my role model now. He was very involved with our lives, he got us in sports at a younger age and that was something we all stayed with until we graduated high school.  He coached all of us and went to as many games as possible and would even take off work so he didn't miss us. 
As far as being those controlling parents, he wasn't even close to it.  My dad was a strong believer in letting people fuck up and suffer the consequences. Because we all played sports we had a lot going for us and my dad said we could party and drink all we wanted to, but if we got caught and in trouble, that was our own problem.  He wasn't constantly hounding us wanting to know where we were or what we were doing. And all 4 of us stayed the hell away from those crazy parties, and never really did anything horrible. He gave us the freedom to do whatever we wanted, and none of us did. My ESTP brother was the oldest and pushed the most boundaries, but he also had the most to lose and my dad would always remind him of that.  
The only thing I wish my dad did differently, was to help us out a little bit more financially.  He sorta threw us out into the world and wanted us to learn how to be adults, but quickly learned that it's not the same as when he was younger. He also didn't want to contribute to our educations at all which set us all back further than we wanted. 
My mom is INFP and we had an awful relationship for at least 10 years. We never got along and she always assumed she knew me when in reality she had no clue. It's much better now, but I still have a lot of trust issues. 
As far as my mom and my dad parenting together, my mom was a lot more open to allowing us to try new things and was good at convincing my dad that it was okay. They made sure every Sunday we had a family dinner and did a family vacation once a year but other than that they weren't too involved in our lives. I think they did a really good job. "
275,estj,"Also, keep in mind that because of the overlaps between the common ESTJ stereotypes and the actual job of parenting, it‚Äôs hard to know how many people actually have ESTJ parents and who just has parents.  If you think anyone who enforces a rule is an ESTJ and you‚Äôre a kid whose gross experience with rules has been with parents... Not everyone is an expert at typing.
Plus, people rarely go on rants about the things they like, so you hear more negative than positive.
All parents screw up. It doesn‚Äôt matter what type you are, you‚Äôll mess it up one way or another."
276,estj,"This is a big one. 
My ESTJ dad wasn't as controlling as some of my friend's parents who were ISFJs, ESFJs, ENFJs, and INTJs. 
Heck, my friends, INTJ mom is the actual worst parent I've ever seen.  My friend is married living in the different state and her mom still has influence over her life. It's just pathetic and sad. She never allowed us to hang out as kids and was always demanding that her vacations home be spent with the family. I ended the friendship for other reasons, but her inability to tell her mom to back the fuck off definitely contributed to a list of reasons why it wasn't going to work anymore. "
277,estj,"About 2 years ago, I was dating someone casually but I had an ESTJ friend who was interested in dating and attempting to do all sorts of things I would consider romantic. We were great friends, but I turned him down and only wanted a friendship at the time. Our friendship began to grow distant over the months but occasionally kept in contact.
Months later, we sat down to talk about things and he mentioned that I had ""really messed up his psyche."" As an ESTJ, what would this entail? He's such a strong person, I was taken aback when he said this. 
We are at a point where we are now dating casually and have been for a year, but taking it really really slow, mostly on his part. I want to make things serious, but I feel he has this barrier up in letting me closer. I've told him if he doesn't want anything serious with me, to let me walk away. He doesn't talk about feelings but his actions of spending time with me and doing things, like take care of my house problems or car issues, show he cares. Why then is he taking so long to make a commitment with me? I wonder if a big factor is letting him down by rejecting him in the past.
I would like some feedback from ESTJs. Anything helps. 
Thanks!  "
278,estj,"As an ISTPish sort of person who has had the best dating relationship ever with an Es/nTJ, I'd say, yes--it's because of the previous rejection. An ESTJ who creates a deep romantic attachment to someone will find themself ""undone"" by the predicament. "
279,estj,"So, I‚Äôm an infp and I‚Äôve been pretty close friends with an estj for almost 10 years now. She used to be so much fun when we were younger, as long as I didn‚Äôt bring up any topic that wasn‚Äôt purely fluffy/surfacey.  But of course, you can‚Äôt continue that way in a friendship for 10 years. She‚Äôs never been willing to listen to anyone with values or feelings different from her own. Her extreme unwillingness to listen and need to be right and in charge has lead to some really rough treatment of... a lot of people, including myself. She‚Äôs grown some in the past year, but she‚Äôs still very very mean to me. She thinks that she‚Äôs a very nice person. She always says that she‚Äôs a good problem solver in arguments and that she‚Äôs kind, but she‚Äôs neither of those things because of her stubbornness and need for power/being right. I also have finally accepted the fact that she does and says things to tear me down and hurt me on purpose. The relationship has honestly been toxic for years now, but I‚Äôve just been too afraid to end the friendship. I really don‚Äôt even know how to go about it. But I honestly just can‚Äôt stand it anymore and for the sake of my mental health, I just really need her out of my life. As stated above, she won‚Äôt listen to anything. So there‚Äôs no point in more attempts at gentle/civil conversation about how she‚Äôs hurting me. Please help me. I‚Äôm tired of being her doormat. 
Also, I just want to say that I know that not all estjs are terrible toxic people, so please don‚Äôt take offense to anything I‚Äôve said about her! I‚Äôm aware that she‚Äôs an unhealthy person that‚Äôs just completely unwilling to grow. "
280,estj,"Or you could pick out three statements to honestly and kindly explain that you do not wish to be friends. You've grown as a person by knowing her, but see that you two are growing apart. Express that you are adamant about your decision and that it's final. 
Be kind and firm in ending it. If she ignores your demand, then close off communication.
This ghosting thing is so childish. Adult this one out and be honest. You'd want the same in any type of relationship. "
281,estj,"Yikes. 
Alright, eradicate your one on one time. If you do hang out with her, do it as part of a larger group. Stop making plans with her. 
Be as boring as possible. No opinions. No thoughts. Don‚Äôt tell her about your life or your plans. If she‚Äôs got nothing to use to pick on you, she‚Äôll get bored and move on. It‚Äôs called grey rock - google it for more information. 
Use your introversion to your advantage! She‚Äôs a confrontational person and she wants that confrontation with you. Don‚Äôt do it. Say nothing and walk away. Bonus points will be awarded if you do it while she‚Äôs mid-sentence. If there‚Äôs no escape to be had - wield the mighty power of the awkward silence, don‚Äôt respond, don‚Äôt say anything, keep your poker face and embrace the awkwardness. 
You can do it!"
282,estj,"For an ESTJ time is the most precious asset in life. Just tell her you don't have it. She will eventually respect it and you will slowly drift apart if you keep being consistently busy.
If not, there's another way to use time to solve your problem, although you're a ""feeler"" so it might make you a bit anxious. The easiest was to get rid of an ESTJ by using time is to waste theirs. Make plans with them and be late. Cancel last minute. And the worse thing ever? Don't show up, don't pick up your phone, call them two hours later with apology and tell them you simply forgot. That would make her fall out with you instantly "
283,estj,"I‚Äôve tried to just stop hanging out with  her or talking to her, but she won‚Äôt leave me alone. She also lives, like, two miles away from me, so it‚Äôs really not easy to get away from her. Do I just need to suck it up and be more assertive? Or just stop worrying about being mean and ghost her? "
284,estj,"I agree with the ghosting idea. I (INTP) once had an overbearing ESTJ not picking up on my ""hints"" that i didnt want to hang out or talk. So i decided i tried doing it the nice way by hinting and it didnt work so i stopped answering phone calls and texts. Its still took awhile for him to stop but eventually he did. In the beginning i felt a little guilty for it, but really there was no other way except for flat out saying i don't want to hang out but then that felt mean too."
285,estj,My son is only 3 years old so still quite young but his personality is quite developed for one so young. His personality screams ESTJ. Do you guys and gals have an ly advice on how you would have best responded to being parenting. Like what would you have responded best to (what do you wish your parents did for you/ to you as a kid that would have been a more positive experience for you)
286,estj,"LOL are you serious... I would hope that he's not fully developed at three and is still going to go through changes as he grows up. But if you really want to know, I think it would just be nice to have a parent who is there for you, listens to you, encourages you, etc."
287,estj,Of course not fully developed. But it shines through still. He has more personality developed than you would expect for someone so young. He's more advanced in a lot of things than kids his age and even older in some cases 
288,estj,"What kind of stuff do you think is his ESTJness shining through? I sincerely doubt even the most developed 3-year-olds on the planet would have an identifiable MBTI type that young.
Try not to raise him like an ESTJ, just raise him like a child."
289,estj,I wasn't going to raise him completely as an estj. I was going to just impliment one or two and see if he responded in a positive manner. I'd rather conform myself slightly to how he would respond best than change my kid to how I think he should respond. 
290,estj,"Also I'm sorry, I forgot to actually answer your question. After looking at several assessments as to how that type typically acted as children I noticed quite several alignments: tries to keep other children in line, enjoys structuring things to their design, staying active, says what's on their mind,  is extremely curious. I'm not saying it's a forsure thing.  I but I can see similarities to which I would say it's worth learning maybe a new way to approach some things "
291,estj,"Seriously, I'm at the point where I look back at my kids' first few nights out of the womb and think, ""OMG that thing he did was so fundamentally a part of the [ISFJ or whatever] life picture."" it's very intriguing. Can't really share stuff like that with many people though. It's a bit shocking and maybe you just have to be a parent. Haha"
292,estj,"Not to this extent. To be fair, you don't know him and the abilities he possess. Otherwise I'd understand your reluctance to believe what I say. I've been around enough children his age to know that he's well above average in every aspect of his development "
293,estj,"In general, ESTJs are the most likely to consider an argument on it's merits, separately from the person. We are probably the most likely to be devil's advocates because of that.
It gets more complicated when people stake certain assumptions or parts of the argument on their own reputation or someone else's.
At that point, I'm more likely to lose interest in the argument but it varies."
294,estj,"I think it‚Äôs easy to get frustrated with people who are using emotional appeals because it‚Äôs like we aren‚Äôt speaking the same language. So in that sense, we may intend to attack what we perceive to be a poor approach to discussion (because it‚Äôs not our preference, not because it‚Äôs actually worse) and in doing so, come across as attacking personally, even if it wasn‚Äôt our intention to do so, and especially if we aren‚Äôt intentional about strengthening that introverted feeling function. 
Also, I definitely tend to be very suspicious of debaters using emotional appeals unless they are very empirically supported because being emotionally manipulated is my demonic nightmare-so I start losing my cool when I sense that another person is attempting to be emotionally manipulative (ie personally attack them as logically incompetent) out of a perhaps immature but stalwart duty to protect those who would be susceptible to manipulation"
295,estj,This hits close to home - I work as an engineer and the easiest way to make me mad in my job is to start using emotional arguments in a technical discussion. It's really surprising how common this is...
296,estj,"I actually think If anyone is going to personally attack it‚Äôs an ESTP. I‚Äôve seen it on more than one occasion with them. 
They pick a fight and mid way in they decide to mention something personal and Irrelevant just to get a reaction out of you. 
Feelers aren‚Äôt necessarily the first to even want to debate with someone and if they do it‚Äôs almost always personal from the start. "
297,estj,"I am a pretty textbook ESTJ and recently broke up with someone I suspect was an ESFJ...it was very amazing for awhile. My ex before her was an INTJ, which was a lot more difficult and less rewarding.
Is there a non-introvert type that pairs well with ESTJ romantically? Most of the cookie-cutter guides suggest I types, but they drive me insane."
298,estj,"Well, that depends on what you're looking for. If you want an extrovert, you're going to have to choose if you want Se, Ne, Fe, or Te, and which auxiliary function Fi, Ti, Ni, or Si, you think you would personally pair well with. If Judger/perciever is important to you, perceivers have either Ne or Se with an aux Fi or Ti, and judgers have Fe/Te with aux Ni/Si. Do you think you'd do best with a thinking or feeling type? Do you want an intuitive or a sensor? ESFJs can be a good match, because both tend to be neat and orderly and concerned with practical matters. I wouldn't suggest two ESTJs in a relationship, as it can get competitive and combative quick (Te). However, both tend to be dutiful if that's important to you. If you're looking for perspective and emotional support, ENFJs pretty much pair well with anyone. Upside: ENFJs and ESTJs don't use any of the same functions, so you could learn a lot from them. Downside: you might not understand each other as well as you'd like to if you don't make communication a priority. I would not recommend ENTJs and ESTJs, as I mentioned above it could be too much Te but not enough connection with Ni/Si. It depends on how well developed the Ne/Se is.
As far as percievers go, I wouldn't recommend ESFPs who would take Te criticism to heart, or ENFPs who will have big dreams and ideas but not always the desire to realize them (which may frustrate the ESTJ). ENFPs aren't typically good at keeping up with everyday tasks and chores, which might annoy the ESTJ. ENTP or ESTP would be a good match. Both are fun and tend to have witty senses of humor, but aren't usually too sensitive and won't usually get offended by criticism. They also tend to be adventurous and open to trying new things, which helps ESTJs get out of their comfort zones. Overall, I'd recommend EXTP or EXFJ."
299,estj,"The 'ideal' matches happen along the lines of having same cognitive functions in common. The logic here is very simple: having same cognitive functions means that you and your significant other have similar interpretations and similar values in life, that when you say A they understand A and not interpret it as B, and that they also value A same as you. This increases compatibility in any relationship, from romantic to professional.        
For ESTJ the functional set it {Te,Si,Ne,Fi}. The types that match all of these functions are ENFP, INFP, and ISTJ, out of which only ENFP is extraverted.   
As for which type is supposed to be the ideal match for ESTJ romantically, it is the INFP. Although it's not extraverted, INFP shares every single cognitive function of ESTJ in exactly yet opposite order, making them be the 'yin' and 'yang' of each other, or two opposing halves of the same integral type. In socionics this relationship type is called duality relations and it is described under the EII-LSE section for INFPs and ESTJs."
300,estj,"My estj sister in law is pretty much perfect for my estp brother. They have a lot in common, but my brother really helps her relax and enjoy life more. And she provides him with some guidance/structure when he needs it. They're very social, athletic and family oriented and they're able to have a lot of fun together because their interests/values are so similar. "
301,estj,"ENTP here married to an ESTJ. 
Most sources will tell you it shouldn't work, but I like that we can discuss things and that our relationship is focused on building each other up and not wishy washy mushy stuff. 
The downside is that my sporadic, unconventional, and haphazard thought process and way of behaving makes him uneasy, and his need to correct and control drives me nuts. But, if you are aligned in terms of values and life goals it can work well as we both have strengths and weaknesses that kinda equal each other out. Essentially, I think ENTPs and ESTJs have a lot to learn from one another, but I would only enter into that relationship if you're mature and ready to learn from the other person. "
302,estj,"I found my introvert relationships to be exhausting. It was hard to get at problems, they did not do well in social situations with my friends and family, and it always seemed like they had trouble expressing the fun thoughts and ideas that make dating fun. I always felt like I was their tourguide or authority figure rather than an equal partner."
303,estj,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
304,estj,"You're probably right.  Its not a common practice to segregate a company/floor to such an extent, but there are a lot of places that take your individual personality into account.  
My personal feelings though are to not divide up the floor like they did.  What they've done is created working groups whose members are too similar to each other.  You need the diversity and difference in personalities to really set up a great team.  Most places just make people aware of their personalities and their traits."
305,estj,"What are some things y‚Äôall do during breakups or tough times that help you cope? 
My roommate recently was dumped by her boyfriend of 3 years, I would really love to support & be there for her but don‚Äôt quite understand her thought process. I am an ISFJ & came here looking for ideas to help her out & to motivate her to go to class etc. I listen to her & try being there for her but is there anything more specific I can be doing?? 
Thank you guys :)"
306,estj,"Do things to take her mind off the break up :)
Personally-idk whether it's an ESTJ thing or not- but I thoroughly dislike when people tell me everything is going to be ok and 'you're ok', if I'm sitting on the ground crying, I am probably not ok. "
307,estj,"All of these are on target, when in pain I tend to want to withdraw but that leads to awful effects for me personally. I agree with taking them out extra points if it‚Äôs something new so they can really get lost in the experience. I also agree I don‚Äôt want to hear patronizing little statements like ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok‚Äù, I know that what I need is distraction from wallowing"
308,estj,"I think taking her out would be good. When I get into a relationship, I tend do go out less and focus on my SO more. I have to relearn how to socialize after a breakup. I had a friend that whenever girl troubles were bad he and I would go out bowling, talk about what happened, what to do now, etc. I find I tend to do better after being able to talk through it a handful of times and just getting out again. "
309,estj,"Hi Everyone,
This survey is entirely anonymous. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if you don't like your answers.
CLICK HERE FOR SURVEY
I'm really interested in Brene Brown's work on shame, vulnerability and wholeheartedness. I've noticed that, while MBTI focuses on highlighting our strengths, the discussions in many MBTI communities seem to focus on the struggle to overcome flaws or struggles with vulnerability. It seems that we're all drawn here to tinker around inside our behaviors, understand something important about ourselves, or understand the way we interact with the world. I'm wondering (informally, this is just for fun) if there's a pattern to MBTI personality types, and ease of wholeheartedness/living with courage.
So, I made this quick survey. Enjoy!(?)
Bonus Question: What socially or emotionally vulnerable experience has done the most to define your identity?"
310,estj,"ESTJs get along with INTJs, but rarely will INTJs get along with ESTJs because INTJs highly value the N trait and INTJs absolutely loathe control.  INTJs think big picture, and ESTJs are good at the day-to-day focus (great enthusiasm for knocking out chores, climbing the corporate ladder, going to church/work/family events).  It would also be exhausting for an I to keep up with an ESTJ in any event, and INs crave deep conversations with no restrictions (practicality and propriety be damned).  That would drive an ESTJ up the wall to listen to round-about comments or dreamy conversation regularly."
311,estj,cough cough INFERIOR FE cough cough 
312,estj,"I just don't like texting in general, it's annoyingly slow. I'm a fast typer, but I still dislike not being able to immediately clarify what I say as to avoid misunderstanding. A conversation is much more than just the words spoken, and texting reduces so much nuance that I feel incapable of illustrating my point. I almost immediately lose interest in text conversations, I usually try to squirm out of them when people try to initiate them, sometimes literally just telling them ""I hate text conversations, do you want to meet up?"" That being said, I prefer texting to calling people when arranging things. I don't like my plans not being recorded somewhere."
313,estj,"I'm in the process of developing a more advanced analysis than the one I provided. It will be based on people global reddit activity and take into account their type. 
If you posted in /r/MBTI and your flair is set, I already got you in my database. Otherwise, please set your flair and post here. My script will find you that way. As a bonus, I will provide everyone that made it into my database their own graph comparing them to other redditors of their type."
314,estj,"How do you feel about INTPs and ENTPs?
The reason is I had issues with ESTJs growing up in elementary school. It was a communication issue, but my Ti had trouble justifying my Ne, and I wasn‚Äôt given knowledge that was actually useful for me.
When I did something my way (e.g. the way I formed my letters), I‚Äôd do it in an unorthodox way and do it based on my Ne. The ESTJ teacher would, in short, assert her Si on me and pretty much say (not word for word necessarily) ‚ÄúDo things the traditional way!‚Äù We‚Äôd go back and forth until the teacher would just give up and think I was being stubborn.
The other reason is, no offense, but I feel like I‚Äôm around ‚Äúold‚Äù people when around/see the ESTJs I‚Äôve been around/seen, although that could just be the ESTJs I see/have to spend time with.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
The other thing that I tend to have issues with with ESTJs is they (based on the ones I‚Äôve been around) tend to be misinformed and indoctrinated.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
It‚Äôs not so much that I have a problem with ESTJs nor Si even but the effects of the manipulation of Si. 
Since people aren‚Äôt educated on psychology nor sociology, nor have a good understanding of science, TREMENDOUS problems occur. In fact, I think many major problems in society would be fixed if this were fixed.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Again, I don‚Äôt have anything against ESTJs. What I have a problem with is how unethical and broken the US education system is, and its effects, which XSXJs tend to be the most vulnerable to.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
You KNOW the system is flawed when even 7 year olds notice how flawed it is."
315,estj,"Really, this felt like more of an excuse to bitch about ESTJs than to ask a genuine question.
You don't write letters in an unconventional way based on Ne. ""Doing anything outside the norm"" is not Ne. If you had to attribute that to any function (which you shouldn't, because it could literally be anything), it would be Se. Manipulating an object based on how it feels right to do so in the moment.
I mean, you were being stubborn. So was she, and being a teacher she should take more responsibility for that than a student, but I don't know how that wasn't stubborn.
Being misinformed is quite literally contrary to the nature of Te. Te is all about sourcing outside information to make logical decisions. I'm not even going to respond to you saying they're ""indoctrinated"", that's beyond an insane generalisation and a bizarrely close-minded statement for an NP.
This can apply to most people.
As an aside, just an interesting thing in Socionics, the Dialectical-Algorithmic cognitive style is supposedly the types most likely to be indoctrinated into cults and stuff, which does include ESTJ and ISFJ, but also ENFJ and INTJ.
The education system is flawed, you're correct, but once again, saying SJs are the most vulnerable to its shortcomings is a gross generalisation (I'm noticing a theme in this post). Have you ever considered that it isn't SJs who are vulnerable to being sheepish traditionalists, it's just you who types sheepish traditionalists as SJs?

Now that I'm done with that, I'll answer the question that was originally intended. 
I generally like NPs more than I like NJs and SPs, they're capable of loosening up whereas SPs and NJs just worry me. 
Friendly and well-rounded INTPs are potentially some of my favourite people. They make for great conversation partners, I feel like when I'm having a discussion with them we understand each other's ideas and they all seem logically consistent but we still have different perspectives. They're difficult to connect with in the first place, but once you get to know them they're great.
ENTPs are like that but fix the ""hard to connect with"" problem I have with INTPs, but I can sometimes find them somewhat vindictive when angry. I generally really enjoy their company, however.
ENFPs fix my problem with ENTPs. I sort of become ENFP-ish in their presence, they're just so fun to be around. The only issue is that they get a bit tiring sometimes.
And INFPs fix my problem with getting too tiring after a while. More extraverted INFPs are able to make me feel excited like an ENFP can, but can tone it down too. My problem with INFPs is they can get intimidated too easily and be hesitant to share their opinions, or sometimes when they do state their opinions, they don't have a lot to back it up.
To round it off, INTPs fix my problem with INFPs.
I'm happy to answer further questions. Sorry if I sounded too angry at the start of this post, I've unwinded a little bit now that I've switched onto another topic, but I really encourage you to try further understanding the perspectives of SJs in your life."
316,estj,"Or, you know, some day you‚Äôll have a job and they won‚Äôt make a lot of exceptions for how you want to do things either.
Maybe that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs trying to teach you, since it seems like it‚Äôs something you need to learn."
317,estj,"I know some intps and entps. I like the intps more than they seem to actually like me. And entps I can usually get along with. I won‚Äôt even start on your rambles about your teachers. About the indoctrination, I think it depends on your perspective. I think some people would say that I am, and others would say that I am really fair."
318,estj,"(INFP) That was awesome. I admire your way of living so much. And I will say I'm scared of sharing my opinions with you because I admire you so much deep down. I know your Te is super strong and I don't want to seem stupid, and in the past I've also never wanted you to seem stupid infront of others because I knew you were wrong about something. However I think healthier INFPs won't do this. I used to do that but not anymore. Also the reason opinions aren't always backed up by logical outer evidence is because it's usually more of a feeling, or a principle. You must know how Fi works but since that's your weakest function you might find it harder to understand. However again, healthier INFPs will share and try their hardest to explain why. But NPs usually will find it harder to explain why. They will back it up, especially when they care. On thing that's similar between me and you is that when we care, we show it. Although when we don't care, you will show it more. 
Again I'm an INFP and I'd like to be closer with ESTJs because logically they are stronger in what I am weaker in and vice versa. So we can make each other the best versions with work. I'd like to think this is using my growing Te but I can't deny it's also my Fi. I just feel this is right. 
Well anyway. Have a great day. Love you. Bye."
319,estj,"

Fair. My question was poorly formed. I‚Äôm VERY sleep deprived.


It was Ne. My movements looked like this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=elUY4WeDVxA
Yes, I realize this an extreme, and yes, I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs an anime, but it‚Äôs what Ne looks like in movement nonetheless.


Precise, unorthodox, like a plasma ball (the Ne user at the center, the electricity homing in on things, resulting in a feedback ping).
I meant letters as in characters (e.g. g k J R p)...Handwriting..

INTPs tend to be stubborn when it comes to Ne. Plus, there was a misunderstabding, resulting in pain and anger. Her Si was trying to force itself on me, and Ne pretty much says ‚ÄúOh heeeeck no! If someone is going to force themselves on me, it‚Äôs going to be Ni or Ne.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. The more Si forces itself on Ne, the more Ne says no.
I also had trouble using my Ti to justify my Ne due to a limited vocabulary (instead of learning practical words, words like ‚ÄúSesquipedalian‚Äù were encouraged to be used and learned) and ignorance of psychology (instead of being educated on psychology, I was being educated on things with virtually no practical application in my case like historical dates (I just generalize them to an era due to neuroplasticity..which is pretty much another reason it‚Äôs stupid).
I was always oppressed as well, although INTPs in general usually are (e.g. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a misbehaved ISTJ with aspergers, ADD, and OCD).

I‚Äôm not sure how...Indoctrination is the forced beliefs, opinions, and views onto a person.

This is Texas. People here in general deny science, worship Trump, confuse culture with science, just quote the bible without understanding what the heck they‚Äôre quoting and make some REALLY farfetched interpretation of the quote, hate on liberals and democrats, are heavily indoctrinated and try to indoctrinate others regarding politics, morals (pfft! they‚Äôre often not even the person‚Äôs morals; they‚Äôre just copying their mommy and daddy instead of doing actual research), and more.
That being said, I think you know where I‚Äôm coming from pertaining to the teacher (the traditional way is the right way; you need to do it the tradititional way).
There‚Äôs also this: Creativity, originality, and questioning things encouraged Student questions, tries to be original, or tries to be creative Teacher: Scolds student

True. Si doesn‚Äôt bother me much. It‚Äôs misinformed Si and Si ignorant of major and critical things (e.g. conditioning, where authority stems, MBTI, etc.)

I often heard XSXJs say thibgs like ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù in regards to a person‚Äôs behavior. It angers me the US education does things like this. People are taken advantage of via psychological and sociological ignorance.
ENFJs and INTJs tend to be indoctrinated on the less traditional side of things. Although, I wasn‚Äôt refering to cults. I was meaning stuff like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a girl thing.‚Äù and textbooks being full of crap.

I‚Äôve considered this. The place I live is SJ territory. Chances are, if you step outside, you‚Äôll come across an SJ within 5 seconds. It‚Äôs Texas, though, and a weird (sociologically) part of Texas at that. Texas is also pretty much the propaganda-worshipping, indoctrinating state.

The problem is indoctrination occurs at an early age. Who are the parents? Unresearched people who think they‚Äôre entitled to special treatment, because they‚Äôre parents. They also think they know what they‚Äôre doing simply because they‚Äôre parents and are past the age of 30, so they think they‚Äôre wise.


THANK GOD!!!


I‚Äôve actually made some interesting things about the SJ perspective. Like I said, I think the problem is, growing up, I‚Äôve always had to deal with indoctrinated, ignorant people making claims that are scientifically flawed on a fundamental level. That and I‚Äôve had to deal with people pressuring me and trying to get me to behave like an ISTJ my whole life. ‚ÄúOoh! They‚Äôre an INTP. They don‚Äôt have the same strengths as other people, and they‚Äôre different!‚Äù I‚Äôve always had to deal with adults who put too much stock in their own age and experience and who think they know better because of their age.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a girl thing. Trust me. I‚Äôm a 40 year old woman.‚Äù Me: Detects several logic fallacies, biases on a fundamental level. It‚Äôs so stupid that you could literally just go talk to a random person and chances are fairly high you‚Äôll be debunked by that one interaction.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a parent! You don‚Äôt know.‚Äù I may not be a parent, but I‚Äôve done research..Oh look. A book! Written by people who experienced things and made observations.
Heck! A bunch of the adults don‚Äôt even know how experience works. Yes, you can gain knowledge through experience, but that‚Äôs usually a pretty stupid strategy, considering we have books, the internet, and more.
Example: 10 Years..Makes 10 actually correct discoveries.
Person: Reads book. Makes hundreds of discoveries in one month."
320,estj,"I don‚Äôt think so. It was a communication issue, and I was 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. My Ti wasn‚Äôt able to justify my Ne well. My vocabulary was limited. I was ignorant on psychology. Reality does not make exceptions. It will maintain order even at the expense of the existence of the human race."
321,estj,"Aww, this was sweet. Thank you, I appreciate it.
This isn't going to be a comforting statement, but if you don't speak up, most Te-doms have already assumed you're a bit stupid lol. It isn't true that you're stupid, but I know that before I started using MBTI, I thought that when someone didn't share their thoughts, their primary reason was that they didn't have anything valuable to contribute. There were some more personal situations where I understood why someone wouldn't speak up, but I didn't understand for situations like what the most effective course of action would is, or an inoffensive topic like a hypothetical question asked for fun.
Some Te-doms will feel offended if they're proven wrong. However, most healthy Te-dominants actually welcome criticism and debate. In fact, when we start springboarding our logic of other people, talking out our thought process, that's basically our implicit way of asking ""what's logically wrong with this idea?"" When there's silence, we either assume it's well received and there are no criticisms because if we were in their position we'd be critiquing away, or we get frustrated that we're the only one contributing. So, if an open-minded Te-dom is talking their ideas out loud, feel free to criticise!
Yeah, you're right, I do sometimes feel it's tricky to understand, especially before I started MBTI-ing. That's another bit of advice I should give you; when a Te-dom is looking for criticism in their arguments, they're looking for logical criticisms, not value-based criticisms. This is something Te-doms have to work on. A healthy ExTJ will help the IxFP develop their belief into a more rationally justified argument, and an IxFP will help give the ExTJ the values to base their argument on. However, some ExTJs will dismiss the IxFP's viewpoint before getting to really understand it. Before I knew about MBTI, I would dismiss Fi-based arguments not as a Fi-based argument, but as really shitty Te. I think I assumed everyone thought like a Te-dom, and some people were just really bad at it. I didn't tell them this and I tried to be friendly about it which is more than some Te-doms do, but I didn't think it was valuable. However, ESTJs do value Fi, we too have that internal set of values, we just tend to dismiss them pretty easily.
Looooool. That's probably true. I'm not trying to be mean! Sometimes I say something and then a few seconds later I think ""damn dude, that was cold"".
I always find myself relating to INFPs quite a lot. On the outside, we seem very different, but then I sit down and talk to them and it's like looking into a mirror of deep down in the more externally repressed sections of my mind, it's a bit eerie. In general, we just tend to ""click""."
322,estj,"I think you've had some trouble with the formatting of your post. It's a little bit hard to interpret right now, but I'm going to try summarising what I think your argument is, and then respond to that. If this isn't what you intended, let me know.

Point 1: Living in Texas, a more conservative culture, closed-minded, traditionalist opinions are likely to be taught to the younger generation.
Point 2: You stand against these traditionalist and conservative beliefs, and dislike the people who preach them.
Point 3: Si-users are likely to take on-board the values taught to them.
Conclusion: Since Si-users are very likely to adopt the values taught to them, you're likely to dislike Si-users.

Now, I think there are a few things that need to be addressed in your argument, but the most glaringly obvious problem is Point 3. 
Depending on the model of personality theory you're using, it varies as to whether or not Si-users will adopt their culture's viewpoints. If you're using the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, then yes, you're correct that a lot of SJs can be closed-minded. If you're unaware, Keirsey influences some of the most popular branches of typology. He designed the commonly used ""Keirsey Temperaments"" (NT, NF, SJ and SP), websites such as 16personalities base most off their work off of him, and it's the most popular form of testing in workplaces and such. However, as far as I'm aware, Kiersey didn't use the functions, so that's obviously not the system you're using.
Within most other branches of typology, Si has nothing to do with adopting values. Sometimes a description will tell you that SJs are ""traditional"", but that isn't intended with the typical ""conservative"" thing in mind (though many misconstrue it that way). In this case, ""tradition"" might just take place in the form of little rituals, or relating a current situation back to how you solved a previous issue. It isn't to do with conservative viewpoints and only looking to what people before them thought.
I'm going to end this here. Sorry for the abrupt ending, but I thought I was going to go on further and changed my mind when realised I've said all I wanted to say. Thanks for reading this."
323,estj,"I understand if I don't speak up, you guys will see that we have nothing valuable to say. There is no reason you shouldn't to be honest. Of course you can try to understand other reasons but what's the point. INFPs should speak up. Especially when they have something valuable to say. We should also point out when we know you're wrong because this way the other person actually learns something.
Of course Te and Fi doms will have issues but overall they both bring enormous value to the world. I don't think the world can exist without them. They are probably the two biggest strengths of humanities progression. Art is all about inspiring and bringing value to the human experience and logical execution is all about progressing humanity into a better time. I don't think one has ever existed without the other.
Oh and trust me. I can be cold. I've been cold a lot quite recently lol. And it's not in ways to actually hurt the other person. Because I think INFPs are more likely to do that. I don't think you'd care enough about the other person to purposefully hurt them with your words. For example recently my brother has been addicted to getting take out at night. He doesn't have a job and gets money off other people. He asked me one night for money and I did not let him have any. He really pleaded but I found a logical reason to not feel bad. He could eat without my money. He wouldn't starve so he doesn't need my money. It's weird because I did say it was my principle and I think it was a Fi decision at the end, but I sure as hell got help from my Te. 
That eerie similarity you see is Fi my friend. I definitely see it. A lot of Fi doms will feel too offended or sensitive about you guys to see the similarity. But really they should use some Te and they will see it, and if you use Fi you will see it.
The INFP-ESTJ mix can be magical. Really. They both get so much support from each other. I also love seeing Fi build in Te doms. I don't know why but I find it attractive. I also just find the ESTJ way attractive. I haven't met many ESTJs in my life, I know more INFJs (Who I don't love lol....) But ESTJs are special. I really dig you guys haha."
324,estj,"They don‚Äôt preach them. They indoctrinate them.
The conclusion is a bit off. I dislike misinformed, indoctrinated Si. Although, Si DOES tend to annoy me.
SJs tend to be more likely to believe things based on authority, title, and source. Children are also more likely to do this. Due to corruption in the US education system and issues with the US education system, the US education system HEAVILY indoctrinates and conditions people to do this at an early age and continues until they graduate high school or college. They also don‚Äôt teach psychology nor sociology yet teach outdated culture and history. Who‚Äôs left to teach them things like relationships, social skills, communication, developmental psychology, and parenting tricks, techniques, and ‚Äúskills‚Äù? Their misinformed, ignorant parents who went through the same thing.
I don‚Äôt mind tradition. I DO mind misinformation and stupidity. What I mean by stupidity is more along the lines of perceived stupidity but adults that think they know what they‚Äôre talking/doing about because of their chronological age and are difficult to persuade out of the conditioning/indoctrination they went through."
325,estj,"I may be something of a unique situation here, I'm an ESTJ (Phew! Can finally say it!) raised by an ENFP mother, and probably surrounded by other feelers (dad and bro, both Fi driven fosure!) who had such an influence from his mother, that when he tested ENFP the first time he took the test, like a true ESTJ continued to identify with the ""ENFP"" all his life since (at least a decade), to the point that he Googled ""ENFP"" and wrote down the points listed under personalitypage's Strengths/Weaknesses when he had to list them out for his first job interview, I still remember them (Strives for Win-Win situations, which I thought was the awesomest part of the ENFP),
and like a true ESTJ made ENFP and intuitive friends with whom he always felt like he was more grounded, not really ""like the others"", but the ENFP profile said that ""they are rare"", and they ""feel different from the crowd"" (something on those lines), well that must be why. Especially the former, ENFPs, they flocked to him, and he bossed them around, with love and practicality ""You have such a strong Te"" they said with bunny eyes and such innocent faith in the claimed MBTI result,
until well he finally began to realize that something was REALLY off, that he was getting along with sensors, better, wanted a traditional wife, valued family, friends, and society, was FAR too stable and grounded, and practical, and began to seriously study the types, until Si led depression (heart break, inability to forgive harshness of self) led him to pursue Astrology for a year and a half, all day, everyday, until he could remember everything, and probably predict your chart just by looking at you (no seriously I will need your details, but I have done it TWICE) because he one day wondered, while dope high (only respite during trying times, after a hard day at work) if the moon could raise the seas, can it not affect us?
was convinced by an ENFP friend that he was NOT an ESTJ because she didn't say so, and like a true ESTJ, began to think he was indeed an ENFP with too strong Te, SHOULD develop DAT Fi, spent the Astrology year trying to IDENTIFY self, blamed everyone for nothing, and became a 5 year old (3 as per some estimates) for the next year and a half, DESPITE astrology telling him the SAME thing - Dude your Te SO HIGH, it goes outside this software.
until he convinced himself he was an ENTP till last night, took a test on Values (by psychology today), and for the umpteenth time scored HIGH on social, traditional, theoretical, and realistic values.
So ladies and gentlemen, as a fully realized ESTJ who can safely say he was on the other side and beyond, hello!
PS - I found this gem of a podcast this morning, (https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/09/17/the-childhood-struggles-of-every-myers-briggs-type/), and an article stating the kind of childhood an ESTJ child would thrive in (https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2015/09/17/the-childhood-struggles-of-every-myers-briggs-type/), as well as what hell is (https://thoughtcatalog.com/heidi-priebe/2015/05/the-definition-of-hell-for-each-myers-briggs-personality-type/). xD"
326,estj,"ENTP here! Married to an ESTJ...
Man, you don't sound super ESTJ to me... but maybe that's because you talked about being into astrology for a year, and I know my husband thinks both astrology and MBTI is bullshit. Same with almost every ESTJ I've come across. You seem waaaay too introspective. Maybe because of your ENFP upbringing? For the record, my ESTJ husband tested once as an ENFP and once as an ENTP! So, anything's possible. 
You just don't come across as a Sensor to me.
Now, the functions are all about preferences, not necessarily the conclusions of those preferences. So, not saying you haven't considered these things already, but let me ask you... when you think about a concept, are you interested in its possibilities or its tangible reality? Are you focused on the present, or are you interested in the future? A year ago, we had professional typing done at work. The psychologist broke us into groups based on the dichotomies. She put the intuitives on one side, and the sensors on the other, and asked both our groups to define ""time"". The intuitives wrote things like ""fleeting"", ""cruel"", ""illusory"", where the sensors wrote ""a measure"", ""clock"". 
So, what do you prefer? Abstraction or what's concrete? 
Either way, ESTJs can be wonderfully supportive people, forming the bedrock of communities when they're not being nitpicky and controlling. If that's you, use your powers for good ;) But also this ESTJ space is rather dead... I take it many ESTJs may not be very interested in MBTI or self analysis..."
327,estj,"I've had the same observation as /u/b_withthegoodhair in regards to cycles.  Personally, I find it difficult to keep a hobby for longer than a few weeks.  It's a brutal cycle of getting interested, doing exhaustive research, investing in that thing or activity, getting bored or dissatisfied, ceasing hobby/interest/activity.  I quickly pick up two or three things and get super absorbed in at least one and work it through to either completion or until it isn't worth it anymore and then drop it.  My girlfriend will let me engage in just about any hobby I like because, as she often says, even if it pisses her off or annoys her, she knows I ""won't be doing it anymore in two weeks anyways.""
Some people might say that's indicative of a long-term attention problem, but my counter would be to say that some hobbies I have managed to continue for years and years, just also on their own on-off cycle.  Brewing beer, for instance, only requires a day's worth of work every few months depending on how you do it -or- I can work on it every damn day if I want.  My job responsibilities have the same underlying duties from day to day but also include a ridiculously broad range of other requirements that change anywhere from daily to monthly to yearly.  That really suits me as I can maintain my comforting consistency of my personal daily duties and still flex and change with all of my additional duties.  The way I see it, it's all cycles within cycles for me.
Now, as for astrology, that's a specific subject that personally, I don't have a broad understanding of whatever the modern version is because I disregarded it long ago as a clever ruse.  Create generalized descriptions and sell them to people to assist in generating self-worth or understanding from an outside source.  A lot of people have trouble with defining their own self-worth. Even I seek out value from other people's opinions and such.  Really though, the whole astrology thing isn't something I could discuss at length."
328,estj,"Interesting... as an ENTP we're quite well-known for getting excited about an idea or plan, initiating it, then getting bored and dropping it. I guess some things transcend type! I've always looked up to the ESTJ as one of the archetypal ""finishers of projects""."
329,estj,"Well, I would definitely say that I finish what I start.  Not always does that mean there's a definitive end state though.  Either I accomplish the task, finish building the object, or I satisfy my curiosity.  A lot of 'getting bored' with something is me satisfying whatever questions I had about it (Is this something I want to do?) or reaching an acceptable level of accomplishment (I am proficient and no longer entertained.)."
330,estj,"In contrast to other comments here, my wife is an ESTJ I believe and identifies with OP - likes to sleep a lot (though isn't a deep sleeper) and is terrible in the morning.  She will aim for her full 8 hours."
331,estj,"Kind of. Although sleep should have a consistent fall asleep and wake up time 7 days a week, I sleep in till 10 sometimes on weekends.  Full time work and part time school encourages the weekend sleep ins. "
332,estj,Do ESTJs have a tendency to freeze up and do nothing if they're afraid of making a situation worse? Do they worry they're bad people and their loved ones will leave them anyway whether or not they apologize/if it's worth it to even try to remedy a situation? At what point do you realize and trust you have others' forgiveness?
333,estj,"My ESTJ Ex-Girlfriend hesitated on saying anything ""critical"" towards me because She doesn't want to say something she'll regret later . She was very fixated about saying the wrong things in case I'd be mad or think shes weird. As an INFP I do slightly get insulted at harsh criticism but I'd rather hear it than avoid it. I also never bark back or hold grudges."
334,estj,"Most of the people I know have come to respect my directness and don't respond with anger, even if they get a little bit intimidated at times. Sometimes I'll be working on a group project with someone and seem very mad, then come lunch break, and they're shocked to see that I'm immediately back to my normal friendly self. Oftentimes they confuse my honesty as anger when I'm really just trying to make sure we're being the best we can be. However, for people who don't know me well and understand that, they might get mad and try to confront me.
Occasionally I'll have a conversation with someone and they'll think some of the individual things I say are mean, but then when we speak in more general terms they think I'm a very friendly person, so I don't usually take it personally. 
Some people do hold grudges against me. A few acquaintances of mine sometimes get mad at me over seemingly small things, and you can obviously tell that it's not directed at that action, but me in general. When I'm hanging out with a group and try to make a helpful suggestion, sometimes acquaintances have a go at me for no good reason (""stop being so analytical!"" ""who cares?!?"" ""it doesn't matter! Just stop!""), leaving me and better friends in the group thinking what the fuck, and then the other person getting confused at why they snapped and saying ""ugh, forget it"". Generally, I don't worry about this happening beforehand, but I feel pretty bad when it happens.
Overall, people do get angry at me a fair bit, which I'm okay with most of the time, but feel pretty shit about it when it's directed towards me as a whole. I rarely freeze up in emotionally-charged situations, usually trying to seek out the problem they have with me if they aren't willing to say it. I never worry I'm a bad person and pretty much always think I'll have my loved one's forgiveness, but it still hurts when people attack me sometimes."
335,estj,"How do you show it? When do you say it (if ever)?
My ESTJ boyfriend mentioned during an argument that he would be sad if we broke up because he had ""fallen in love with me."" That was over a month ago and he hasn't said anything since. If I try to bring it up, he says he's ""waiting for the right time to talk about it."" I don't understand why he's acting strange since he's the one who brought it up to begin with? Can any of you ESTJs offer some insight?"
336,estj,"Personally, I'm not much of a verbal person at all. It has definitely caused issues in relationships in the past. 
One thing that my ex and I did was to go to separate rooms then start the dialogue via text message. Once everything was teed up we would discuss it verbally. 
Hope that helps :/"
337,estj,"ESTJ girl here. I guess I can say that from our Fi function we have this sense of insecurity and fear of being emotionally open unless we are really really sure about the situation. I've dealt with this too. It was so scary to take a step further with relationships, and I had to reflect over and over again to make sure that what I'm feeling (and telling people about it) is worth the risk.
If your boyfriend has told you about his feelings (on the spur of the moment), he might have been thinking about it already, and you don't need to feel unsure. ESTJs are tend to always avoid blurry subjects, so I suggest that you wait until he's really really sure about how he feels, because he will tell you when he is. For us, emotional issues are hard to deal with inside, let alone talk about it. It would make us seem vulnerable, and we hate that. Give him time to take it all in, and when he's ready he'll talk. We're just weird like that.
Another note, we might be so afraid of telling others our emotional side, but we are a fan of grand gestures. We would go the extra mile to make people around us happy, especially the ones that are important to us. So maybe you can observe what he did instead of what he said."
338,estj,"I need constant reassurance from my SO probably because of some rooted insecurity or something. I tell him a lot, but I think that the way I show it the most is my actions. I make him dinner each night and pack his lunch-- not because I'm his mom, but because I noticed he was losing weight and not taking care of himself because he wasn't eating right. I wanted to fix that for him with home cooked meals. I'm sure he has something where he shows you.  
Also, I'm pretty rough around the edges. With my ex boyfriend, I wouldn't say it until he said it first. I was just naturally stubborn and proud."
339,estj,"I guess I worry that he'll just ignore it and we'll never talk about it. 
But I could see him having those fears. I'll try to be more understanding (and patient). Thank you for the advice! And the insight into an ESTJ's mind. :)"
340,estj,"Yes, you're right, he shows me in so many other ways. :) But that's why it bothers me that he won't admit it. He has never just outright said, ""I love you."" I need to hear it sometimes. :/
He told me when we started dating that a girl said she loved him and he said it back even though he didn't feel the same way because he didn't want her to feel weird about it. That's the only reason I haven't told him...I don't want him to say it just because I did. I want him to really mean it when he does."
341,estj,"That's the thing. He shows me that he cares...but I just don't like leaving this issue unaddressed. He should at least tell me if he meant it or not. I would understand either way, but he's just ignoring it. That's what I don't like. :/"
342,estj,"Right. I'm also not a sociopath. I'll say what needs to be said when it needs/I want it to be said. I'd hate to be in a serious relationship where I didn't feel comfortable saying or hearing anything affectionate. My guess is that he's embarrassed that he showed his hand like that and would rather just forget about it in case you didn't feel as strongly towards him, maybe because of some failed relationships in his past. That sort of unbalanced scale could cause a rift between you two and it doesn't sound like he'd be too thrilled about that. "
343,estj,"By using I mean being conscious about what they are good at, and thus helping you understand and manage them. I do it this way:
ENTP: this friend is perfect for shaping ideas and finding errors in my logic. Also they are really good mental  and verbal challenge.
INFP: she is my gf and she is perfect for finding reasons to give to other Fs. Also I can test ways of saying some things to people un order not to offend them.
ISFP: You can always rely on this guy, he is like my little bro. Se also enjoy martial arts together.
INTJ: he is perfect for finding alternative ways of doing stuff, while also being very reliable when told what to do
ESTP: he is very similar to me. We enjoy debating stuff and he is perfect for a good laugh.
ENFP: honestly, most of my Friends are ENFP and they are perfect filler for a plan that involves a lot of people."
344,estj,"Similar to the other user, I don't see people that way. 
I'm dating an INTJ and I like him and want to be with him because he supports me and is someone I can talk to about anything and he will always be there for me. If I only saw him for his problem-solving abilities and someone who talks me through the pros and cons of decisions it's safe to say it'd be a pretty lame relationship. He is kind, a great listener, he's got a bigger heart than he shows, he's hard-working, and someone I enjoy by my side in life. 
I love my INFP friends because they have big hearts and aren't afraid to stand up to others or fight for causes even if they are standing alone. I'm not their friend because of what they offer me. 
My friends can and do teach me different things but I don't just have them in my life for that purpose alone. 
If your friend ever heard you speak of them like that I don't think they'd ever talk to you again. 
I think you had well intentions of making this post, it just makes you look a bit out of touch. I hope you see people as more than what they can offer you."
345,estj,"My bf is an ENTP and my mum is INFP and they help me tremendously for the same reason as your ENTP and INFP, do.
I know quite a few ESFPs and ESTPs and i love their energy, they get me hyped up and ready to do anything. My sister is an ENTJ and she's another person i can turn to for ideas and have debates with. 
I work with an ESFJ she's so lovely always happy, caring, easy to talk to we have a lot of fun at work, i have to keep track of time otherwise we could spend hours just being silly."
346,estj,"I like to think that it would be no different than my asking her out because the end result is the same but I love the chase and I like being assertive by initiating. Her asking me out might detract from that?
I highly doubt I'd say no, though, assuming I was into her. "
347,estj,"Thanks!
Another quick question - so if you were chasing, and the girl ""gives in"" or gets attracted to you pretty quickly, does that make you feel less attracted?
I'm asking because the ESTJ man I know really seems to like the chase, and whoever seems too easy becomes less attractive to him. Maybe it's just men in general, though. haha."
348,estj,"My personal answer is yes, even though I wish it wasn't. It's like a push/pull dance of validation. I like to work towards something great and I like to work to keep it. It may be an unhealthy mindset, but I feel like in order to have/achieve something/someone awesome, I need to be awesome. "
349,estj,"I am an, for lack of better term, aggressive (I get shit done) kind of person. I am not looking for a wishy washy guy. I want someone who can push me to be better, do more. The relationships and dates where I've asked the guy always turn into total flops because he just isn't motivated. I need that motivation in a guy and the making the first move is a good indicator of that. "
350,estj,"People always say that ESTJs are natural leaders and that their desire to take charge comes naturally to them. However, is it possible to still be an ESTJ if leadership does not come naturally to me? Could it be that other factors (such as my enneagram) may affect why I'm not a natural leader? Or is it impossible to be an ESTJ if you don't have natural leadership abilities / desires?
I have many Te traits and have been typed by many people as ESTJ, but I don't naturally always want to take the position of a leader and I'm not as blunt / direct as most ESTJs. However, I think I have more Te than Si"
351,estj,"No, being a natural leader doesn't mean it all comes naturally to us. That statement is really over-simplified, having 4 functions arranged like this doesn't magically give us the power and will of a commander. We do come off as domineering because most of us have this mentality that would make us look like we want to achieve robot efficiency with every task perfectly done, but the way every ESTJ deals with this mentality is very different. Personally I become impatient quickly when anyone in my team makes a mistake or does not understand a point I've explained. And as events as such mount, my impatience would show. In this situation, if I had no right to take the lead and monitor every task they're undertaking, I wouldn't personally feel right about it. And although I've never wanted the power (so to speak), I simply think it's the easiest and safest way to make sure that everything is under control and the quality of our work won't be compromised in any way- and then people simply think that I'm aggressive and domineering. But at the same time, although we share the same thinking process and probably feel the same way facing the same situation, other ESTJs might not do exactly the same thing I often do. Does that make them non-ESTJ? Absolutely not.
So if you think you've got all these functions checked and in right order, you're most likely an ESTJ. Don't worry about it."
352,estj,"I actually don't think ESTJ = natural leader. 
I was in a relationship with one and know a few ESTJs, who definitely are committed to work, are great at what they do, and rise up the ranks in their respective fields.
However, ESTJs are more efficient than effective from my observations. They are efficient in that they get things done in a timely manner, don't waste resources, and are very reliable with whatever they commit themselves with. If these qualities are what makes a role a leadership role, I think ESTJ would make a great leader. Mostly, though, it's more managerial tasks that ESTJs are really good at.
Effectiveness would involve more long-term future-thinking. An effective person might not be as good at getting things done efficiently and speedily, but may be thinking about how to make a process sustainable. 
When I think about ESTJs, they are more efficient than effective. I actually wrote about this a while back if you're interested!"
353,estj,"I wouldn't say that all ESTJs are natural leaders, but I do think they tend to make excellent leaders. 
My boyfriend is an ESTJ and he doesn't want to be in a leadership position at all. But he's fair, logical, follows rules, works hard and diligently, is consistent and straightforward. These characteristics cause his employers to put him in leadership positions. 
Also, it would make sense for you to have more Te than Si because Te is your dominant function, Si is auxiliary (if you're an ESTJ)."
354,estj,"That makes sense. I can relate to your point about becoming impatient when team members make mistakes, and when they still don't understand what I've already explained to them. Thanks for the explanation. 
Do you know any good ways to figure out whether Te or Si is my dominant function?"
355,estj,"If we're talking efficiency, speed, and productivity then I have those down for sure. I actually agree with you though and if this is the case, I think it's much more likely that I might be an ESTJ. 
And sure I wouldn't mind! Thanks for the info"
356,estj,"HI! 
me, an ENFP Male tend to disagree with ESTJ leadership as a good thing. I hope to be able to get to understand or, make it go to a nice thing through me posting here. 
Back in the day I got put into a leadership role as well on most projects. Mostly because I inspire people and I come up with amazing Ideas, I was hungry to make it happen. Not because I am good at managing a group of people, I ain't and that is not my role. 
I find that an ESTJ who does not know his group of people or personalities clashes with leadership as they mostly try to push their agenda onto everyone else. The wiggle room is small and it can lead to a lot of friction within a team.
I think this is a knowledge thing that might have to be overcome. So far all ESTJs that have been in leadership roles with me I have clashed with mostly because they have no idea where to use my Ne powers. 
I think you are amazingly hard workers that make sure stuff gets done regardless and respect you and your assertiveness for that and I hope to see some ESTJ leaders that can respect my idea side and my problem-solving capabilities even though they are not always within your defined timeframe.
Do any of you know any golden tips on how to make this clear to my superiors or ESTJs in leader roles that I am going to work with in the future? I kind of know what you value but I struggle with getting a 50/50 mutual understanding of what I value and how I can work efficiently."
357,estj,"Look closely at the way you think, and not in the ""I think I want to talk to this person peacefully instead of throwing my drink in his face, am I being nonstereotypical?"" Kind of way.
For example in a conversation, a Te Dom could often immediately grasp the gist and intention behind the words of each person involved, as we have the least problem using that function. for example when I read your comment I understood immediately that you were not asking for me to recite the basics of the two functions you could easily find covered on almost every mbti site, and the second I realised that I was able to collect what I had in mind quickly and respond- Now, you could probably tell that before this point where I actively started to use my Si, it had been my Te functioning almost on its own. Call your dom function an ""instinct"" if you wish. 
Tldr: the major tell-tale sign would always be in your thinking process, you dom function should always be the function you have least trouble using, sometimes it does it's job almost automatically while you often need to activate your aux function intentionally. "
358,estj,"Haha yes, I hate when people always just cite the basics of the two functions or give me some website I've already looked at before. That's a good example. I'm probably going to have to take some more time figuring out which of the two comes instinctively to me. Thanks for the explanations! "
359,estj,"I posted this in r/INTP too if anyone asks. ESTJs have practical views so I ask here as well.
I saw one affrimation that went like this:
""I always have the power to choose to let go of any emotion.""
And I'm like ""lul I already do dat bruh"".
Anyone here have their one positive or rational sayings that help direct your mindset and mentality? Logic is objective but thoughts are subjective so I'm working to make them, at least, more rational and as objective as possible."
360,estj,"This might sound more negative, but hear me out. My soothing affirmation is: I‚Äôm a fuck up and I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing.  
I feel like it takes the pressure off, reminds me that I don‚Äôt have to get everything right all the time. It allows me to focus on doing my best in the context of being a fallible human instead of constantly kicking myself for not being better. I don‚Äôt have to do everything perfectly; I can just do things and it will be what it is.
And it reminds me that I don‚Äôt actually know all the answers, so I don‚Äôt have to be a raging bossy pants. Plus it‚Äôs kinda dark, so it makes me laugh."
361,estj,"I've been married to my ESTJ husband for 23 years. I love him but we have a tremendously difficult time communicating. I understand that emotions/feelings make him uncomfortable but as an INFJ I perceive the world through emotions/feelings. We're going through a particularly rough spot right now because we're both finding it difficult to connect with each other. 
When my oldest went away to college three years ago, he actually got angry at me for grieving. It didn't make any sense to him because we were going to be seeing her in a few months over fall break when she came back home. But for me, I was grieving the loss of her childhood, of not being needed like I used to be, the end of homeschooling her, the loss of the daily connection we had with each other, the role change of being mom to an adult, suddenly being ""unemployed"" after 18 years etc....
Next year my youngest will be going to college and I know I'm going to grieve again. It's natural. I want to talk to my husband about supporting me this time and let him know what I'm going to need from him during that difficult period. He is NOT a communicator and definitely shuts down when I talk about my feelings. What is realistic to ask him to do to help me through this process? 
I try not to talk about my feelings around him because I know it makes him uncomfortable. But I feel like in this instance, I'm going to need all the support I can get."
362,estj,ESTJ are effectiveness focused. Maybe tell him you need to process this change and that his support will help you process quicker and more effectively. Also maybe consider sharing the emotions with another friend who can be a better emotional support. Each type is good at different things and no type can be all we need all the time. You already know this but I just want to try to help. Sorry you're going through this. 
363,estj,"He is a man and an ESTJ he is wired to solve real problems rationally. Pandering to emotions and leaving the problem unsolved is not how HE would solve a problem for himself, it makes no sense to him.
When you come to him complaining and he gives practical advice, you likely say that he's not listening to you (you want emotional comfort instead of a practical solution). 
You need to make it clear to him that when you have an issue you need emotional comfort, not a solution and this is the way you like your problems solved. Give him this analogy to work over.
""I am a woman, when I say I'm thirsty I don't want you to get me a glass of water. I want you to sympathise with how thirsty I am.""
He will think you're insane but now that you have given him a rational (ish) method of solving your problems, he will quickly realize that providing you practical solutions instead of cuddling you is a waste of his efforts."
364,estj,"Hi. First of all, I am sorry you'll be going through such a big transition! We love moms like yourself. Moms who take in the responsibility of a mom as dearly as you do. Your children are very lucky!
I'm an INFJ woman, and I'm probably at least 15+ years younger than you are... I've had an ESTJ boyfriend who was very efficiency-oriented and didn't connect/communicate very well emotionally. 
But I think what ESTJs actually feel, when their loved ones are sad, is a sense of weakness. Like, they take it onto themselves when their significant other is sad/mad, and they don't like that they feel that way, so they'll tell you to stop. 
Of course I can't speak for your husband, but I wonder if he doesn't want to be freely with you because it feels like a responsibility/duty of his to get it over with. Just a thought. 
Anyhow, I do love ESTJ's in general despite their differences. I hope you feel better soon to give us (or me) some insight into INFJ-ESTJ pairings!"
365,estj,"Hi there! Sorry to hear about your empty nest/communication woes. That's no fun. I'm an ESTJ gal with an ENFJ husband (and lots of other very emotionally driven family), so, slightly different dynamic but I thought I'd throw in my two cents anyway in case it's helpful.
First of all, let me just say that as I was reading about the things you were grieving, I started feeling SUPER uncomfortable, so while I don't condone your husbands lack of support, I do understand some of the impetus behind it! xD
One thing I think it's good to keep in mind is how mentally and emotionally taxing it can be for ESTJs to be supportive in the way you're hoping. You said in one of the comments you want him to ""just listen,"" but let me tell you from personal experience, that is one of the most exhausting things you can ask for (I know that seems strange but bear with me here!). When I'm asked to ""just listen,"" I feel counter-productive, tired, frustrated, confused, and like I'm watching a problem spin out of control instead of doing something about it.
I know the last thing you want is a ""solution"" from your husband, but something that helps ME when someone wants me to ""just listen"" to them is to, in my head, make it my goal to get to the root of the problem. Not how you feel, but why. I'll ask lots of probing questions, and then privately come to my own conclusions. That way, the person needing me to listen gets to express themselves, but I feel like I'm learning and proactively reaching the cause, which I can then try to fix without the other person knowing. I pretend I'm a therapist and it's my job to get to the bottom of this thing. x'D
I hope that doesn't sound manipulative! But honestly that's the only way I can tune in to someone else's problems without getting exhausted."
366,estj,"Thank you for your response! I spoke with him last night and did tell him the reasoning behind the need for emotional support and gave him some ideas of how to help me. I usually don't involve him with my emotional needs and either self sooth or talk to friends but because I this is a major life transition, I'm trying to line up as much support as I can. Thank you again for your response!"
367,estj,"Yes, thank you! I do tell him what I need from the beginning. Like, ""I just need you to listen to me."" but sometimes I don't know what I need. Sometimes I don't know what will make me feel better. 
Also, telling someone how I feel isn't complaining. Complaining is when you verbally focus on an issue over and over and over again and refuse to do anything to change the situation. They're two different things.
Good analogy!
Thank you for answering me back!"
368,estj,"Thank you so much for your response and your ideas!
I think, at least with my husband, is that he's afraid to feel his feelings. Feelings can be scary and can leave one feeling vulnerable and especially in American society, boys aren't brought up to ""feel"".
My husband told me that although he has feelings, they're in the background, like a minor nuisance such as a fly. Whereas INFJ's emotions are front and center and it's nearly impossible to ignore them much like a young child waving their hand in front of your face trying to get your attention. And of course, sometimes our feelings are so intense nothing will get done until we tend to the cause.
Also, ESTJ's are action oriented and to them, feelings aren't productive. My husband becomes frustrated because he can't fix it for me and he doesn't know what to do. It makes him feel helpless and that helplessness makes him feel uncomfortable. But a lot of the time (INFJ's) just need to be heard because we process our feelings out loud in order to understand them and release the intensity of them. 
Thank you so much for taking the time to answer me!"
369,estj,"I appreciate your input, thank you so much!
I totally understand what you're saying. ESTJ's are so fix-it oriented, it's what makes you good bosses and leaders. 
I also understand how someone can wear you out emotionally, it happens to me all the time. 
So as a woman, how do you handle grief or loss? Or if you haven't experienced those, something that's emotionally taxing but needs to be processed.
Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it!!"
370,estj,"How do I handle deep emotional distress than can't be ""fixed""? The short answer is, Not well. xD
Because I usually deal with my emotions in an ""analyze it, compartmentalize it, fix it or deal with it,"" sort of way, really overwhelming issues basically cripple me. When I don't understand what I'm feeling or how to analyze or fix it, I have meltdowns. Lots of crying, lots of existential, what's the point of my life?-type introspection.
But in the end, what has to be done is I have to talk about it out loud. When my problems are swirling in my head, they seem overwhelming and inescapable. But as I speak about them out loud, my thoughts start to make more sense and my emotions start to feel more ""familiar"" and less overwhelming. It helps when someone is asking me all those probing questions to help me figure out the ""why.""
Maybe that's part of why I do it to others? Wow I never thought about it that way. See, I'm talking out loud and figuring stuff out! Ha! :)"
371,estj,"Good work on your epiphany! I actually LOL! 
See, I do the same thing for the very same reason! Once I talk out loud to someone then things start making sense (or not) but I can then recognize it. I do a lot of journaling for the same reason. :) 
Who do you talk to about these kinds of things? Is it only one or two people you open up to or can you open up to acquaintances as well? What do you do when no ones around to talk to?
I keep the majority of things to myself and don't open up to anyone except people who are in my very small circle. And sometimes not even then because we all have our own lives with junk going on and if I feel like it would be too much for them at that time, I don't say anything.
Hmmm....I wonder if I talked to the dog if it would help me process things faster. ;)"
372,estj,"Well I used to talk mostly to my Mom (ENFP), and I still do, but now that I'm married I talk mostly to my husband (ENFJ). I don't usually open up to anyone else but occasionally if people see I'm distressed and are persistent enough in offering help I will. When no one's around I curl up in my misery and watch Star Trek: The Next Generation (Hahaha that sounds so pathetic but it's true!!!).
I think pretty much everyone can benefit from talking about their problems out loud! But maybe what everyone wants people to respond with is different?
For example, I don't want to hear, ""I'm so sorry you feel that way."" In fact, when my husband says that, I usually retort with something like ""I don't want you to be sorry! I need help figuring this out!"" XD What I want to hear is, ""Ok, let's figure out why you feel that way and how you can cope."" But I know there are some people who are totally the opposite!
We're a funny bunch, us Humans! xD"
373,estj,"Your comment totally reminded me of my ex-boyfriend, who was an ESTJ and would curl up into a ball in the corner of his room when he is super stressed/sad. Now that I'm thinking back to it, it's actually quite cute because feelings seemed to have paralyzed him. We feelers feel a whole lot but we are really aware of them and have had so much practice dealing with them all our lives that it doesn't get to that point... But again, you guys are superb at fixing those problems, and because I have no doubt things will get fixed well that I find those moments cute. Haha
Anyhow, thank you for your articulate reply! I love that you shared your insight into your mind; an ESTJ who writes is a rare gem!"
374,estj,"I will chime in, although INFP.  The biggest difference I notice is while ESTJs might utilize logical fallacy to half ass easily ""win"" a discussion, they respect being shown the error of their logic.  Usually.  Also they are more likely to try to cheaply pursuade (if manipulate too strong in sentiment) by appealing to their emotions.  I do mean ""their emotions"" literally.  It is uncanny as an INFP naturally trying to put myself into a lonely tree's shoes and understand how it feels...for a boss or someone to not give a crap about how I feel.....but I supposed to have same emotion as they.  I assume it works most of the time.  
ENTJ live, breathe, bathe, utilize as makeup, wipe their butts, sprinkle in lieu of garlic while cooking...  LOGICAL FALLACY.
I heart my ENTJ friend we argue all the damn time but holy shit, he makes epic gish gallops and can smoothly revise on the fly.  He will blindly argue in bad faith right?  But his heart is pure - he honestly is trying to figure out the right answer and through his ridiculously inane attempt at using logic, he proves ""logic"" is meaningless.  He proves that sheer human ingenuity as it pertains to force of will/character/ignorance/blind earnestness is all that really matters.
Also he mostly uses his inferior Fi to torture me cleverly.  Not to pursuade.  For example he drives down from Cleveland every summer and usually stays in my spare bedroom if I have one.  So he shows up, I happy my friend is here?  He is like ""HAY I FOUND THIS HILLARIOUS VIDEO U GONNA LAUGH SO HARD.""  I am like... okay... whatever... cool.  So he puts his tablet right in front of me.  I see a swirling vortex of grain
...  then at center... as he is cracking up.... I notice helpless birds getting sucked in and I want to throw up.  But he laughing his ass off.  (This not inten tonal..he just warped and twisted and I love that about his sense of humor.)   I say ""ok  Okay  it is alright Ive seen enough.""   NOPE ""just watch it¬´ and he is so happy laughing his ass  off that I just shut my eyes to cease my nausea and he is behind me so I play along.
<3 all u guysI"
375,estj,"ENTJs are quick thinkers, often communicate through arguing, can‚Äôt help but want to be in charge, seem abrasive but good at the core, often lack sense of humor. 
ESTJs come in two basic types - types that seek authority (usually Enneagram 8) and types that are focused on productivity (usually Enneagram 3). The authoritative types will seem the most like an ENTJ but will be more focused on following existing rules and when relaxed, they‚Äôll be super silly/funny."
376,estj,"As a genuine former ENTJ who turned out to be a ESTJ after psychedelic trip, I think it's because ESTJ is more chilled and has empathy toward people and creating bonds between their friends even more than ENTJ (for my experiences). I was  holding my guard much stronger before and it was taking longer to be considered as ""fun person"" from an outsider."
377,estj,"Yes, there are many things on the internet about that. I wasn't easy to satisfy with anything, really really into Machiavelli thinking the same way. Its interesting that I still have very focused and motivated life, but this was very stressfull and lone-wolf style before. I barely liked to listen and more me-oriented. Another difference as an ESTJ now is I am really into teaming up people I care and more action orientated. It was impossible to empathy with people's feelings before and hanging around like ""straight to their face"" mode.   This ENTJ instinct of thinking about future and powerfulness was replaced by practicality and success (in meaning of social environment & relations and status at the same time). What I miss is;  super-super challenging and focused characteristics that you achieve all alone, and you are tough and charismatic af.  Now, I'm feeling like I'm very good at networking my friends, I'm always checking on them to keep the network steady and I'm looking for efficient relationships which we contribute to each other. With the help of this feeling, I'm more open and caring to my friends and teaming up all together to seek for better.

378,estj,"as an infp i have inferor te.so i want to better myself by tapping into it so i can be more focused on my goals.....anyways what is extroverted thinking from a te dom like yourselfs.is te dropping away personal feelings and emotions to get the jov done?,is it getting to the outcome as fast as possible,is it,accomplishing goals,is it logical or more seeing the best steps to accomplish a goa......how would you describe te as a te dom?"
379,estj,"The easiest part to explain is that it's about understanding what other people are thinking. For LSEs, this means that I am constantly processing what other people say for proper grammar, coherent logic, ambiguity, and potential jokes. If they break one of those rules, I probably need to have them clarify.
In contrast, I often need to talk to someone else to figure out what I think about something. Without that, I don't know what things I know are important enough to talk about and they mix together."
380,estj,"Te is, at its most basic, making decisions on the currently available data. The background of reddit is either white or some dark gray, doesn't matter how I or anyone feels about it or whether it needs changing. It is very result oriented almost always asking ""does this fulfill its desired goal?"". In this way they can manipulate rules and such, but they are really averse to breaking them outright. ""I want x and y will get me to x ; I use y ; as long as its legal"" would be the way of thinking for Te types.
‚Äã
At least that's what Socionics told me. :) "
381,estj,"Girlfriend who got results as an ESTJ, but sometimes I feel like she is an ESFJ.
Anyways, while dating her, she has this common saying where she says:
""I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it.""
1)Are ESTJs girls normally like this?
2) Is this unhealthy for me?/ Is this tolerable action? 
In addition, throughout this relationship, I've never really set boundaries with her and she is clingy. 
3) What is an effective method to keep my stand and set my boundaries as I need to focus on my life?
I wouldn't say this relationship has been the most healthiest relationships. Need an outsider's opinion. Thanks
Edit: Not talking about submissivness is bed but in terms of my emotions. She enjoys being able to control my emotions."
382,estj,"""I have so much power over you(my feelings, my actions), I like it.""

That's super duper fucked up and unhealthy. If she's serious when she says that and that's legitimately what she's saying, you need to get out of there, that's a huge red flag if I've ever seen one. It's not normal in any sense of the word, she sounds like she's emotionally abusive. It's very common for the power dynamics to be a bit out of whack in  abusive relationships/relationships which may become abusive. Do you think it's possible to get out of there?"
383,estj,"Hi, I‚Äôm ESTJ and sexually Dominant - that is to say that I absolutely get off on power exchange. There‚Äôs a possibility that your gf is like me and hasn‚Äôt quite figured it out yet. That happens and is, frankly, not your problem. 
So, here‚Äôs the deal. Crystal clear boundaries and consent are where it‚Äôs at. It is absolutely not healthy for you gf to wield power over you for sexual kicks if you are not fully informed and completely okay with that, it is abuse (abuse does not have to be physical, it can be verbal, emotional, social, fiscal) and if you‚Äôre wondering out loud ‚Äúis this really okay?‚Äù the odds are good that it‚Äôs not. 
1) Nah, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an ESTJ thing and as a kink we‚Äôre fairly unusual. I mean, she might just be an asshole. Assholes are ubiquitous. 
2) Consent should be continuous, informed and enthusiastic. If you‚Äôre not all ‚ÄúFUCK YEAH SIT ON MY FACE AND MAKE ME YOUR GOOD BOY‚Äù the answer is probably no. Sometimes, we respond to fear and hurt with confusion - because it‚Äôs easier for us to process, and when you‚Äôre in survival mode, that can be the safest  option. It‚Äôs also very common for people in situations that are in violation of their consent to ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù and mentally remove themselves from the situation. 
3) ESTJs respect directness, so be forthright with her. If you think it‚Äôs true that she does have too much power over you, then tell her - and tell her that you‚Äôre not down with it. Make time for yourself and your friends, go do what you like doing. Have fun. A healthy response to that is ‚Äúsure thing, babe! Have fun and I‚Äôll see you next time‚Äù. Unhealthy responses include ‚Äúoh sure, fine, go be with your friends and try not to cheat on me‚Äù/‚ÄúIf you spend time with your friends I‚Äôll hurt myself or someone else‚Äù/ ‚Äúyou‚Äôre overreacting‚Äù etc.  
As an aside, again because you‚Äôve asked a really basic question, I suspect you are very uncomfortable asking for space - which is another sign that you‚Äôre in a toxic relationship. In healthy relationships, it‚Äôs always okay to ask for space and you‚Äôll always get it - no questions asked. "
384,estj,ESTJs are definitely like that. Being alpha & domineering to the point of being manipulative assholes. But as I have said in the past we need assholes like these in our societies. We mostly got rid of them nowadays then a real asshole like Trump showed up and no one knew how to handle him. It got so bad the system sent over reeling granny Billary to teach him manners and we all saw what happened. This is what society gets when it lacks balance.
385,estj,"So how good is it really? Do you agree si makes you really good with memory? Of course everyone will say they don‚Äôt have bad memory but just wondering. I know a few of us seem to have it. Here‚Äôs a question.
remember back to your school days or if you‚Äôre in school it‚Äôs the question for you. Do you have to study? Or do you just pass tests and don‚Äôt study? Even if you‚Äôre in university?
Is it just me or is it a stj thing or an sj thing, so si, that we have superb or near photographic memory.
For instance I am at a university and I an studying political science it‚Äôs my 8th year in school, and I have really never needed to study, really. I just remember stuff. I don‚Äôt study and the lowest grade I usually get on tests are b grades. If not even a. I get a grades often enough.
I am not trying to brag I just want to know if it‚Äôs all of us, if it‚Äôs si. Or maybe it could be si te.
Also if someone tells you a password or a number can you remember it? My sister gave me her password last summer I think. I haven‚Äôt forgot it. I went to the apple store to basically trade in her phone so I could get a new one because I gave mine to her. And I was able to remember her password, not the exact one but the letters not how it was capitalized. But she was shocked. My father told me what his gas numbers were for his car and I am sure I still know the number. I should make a way to forget it because it‚Äôs useless information. Sometimes I feel like a walking textbook because I know too much and remember everything. 
Anybody else?"
386,estj,"Yup-I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not only the memory for test recall (classic non-studier A student here) but also for pattern building‚ÄîI work with severe persistent mental illness and I will recognize behavior patterns very quickly in new clients or even acquaintances that remind me of an extreme case. In a way that might easily be mistaken for intuition. And I still go back and verify, like I would never cite my Si as a reliable credible source but I will say that it allows me to bypass a lot of analytical or learning processes, as long as I‚Äôve analyzed or learned them at some point before! When I first found out about the MBTI I assumed that pattern building was because of N and was very confused that I had a preference, however slight, for S??? 
Anyhow my brother is an ISTJ who also middles pretty hard on N vs S but the slight difference between us (me leading with Te followed by Si and he leads with Si followed by Te) plays a huge role in the career fields we‚Äôve chosen‚ÄîI like to help develop larger scale interventions and in school for public health, he‚Äôs in medical school and happy as a clam to memorize facts and figures all day! "
387,estj,"My memory is amazing. I remember everything, but the ability to remember everything can kinda suck when you have traumatic events happen, or we're a victim of a bully. I can recall almost every single insult anyone has ever said to me, and where I was when they said it. 
I don't have a planner because it's not necessary. I just remember dates and times and my schedule after looking at it once. 
Give me a list? I'll remember it all in the exact order it was given to me. 
I love my memory, but there's a lot of stuff I wish I could forget as well, and sometimes I tend to relive certain situations over and over again. 
I do really well academically too, but sometimes I can get a better grade and still feel dumber than everyone else around me. Remembering things doesn't necessarily mean I understand it. "
388,estj,"I'll remember discussions that I've had, especially other people's positions on issues and arguments, often years later and better than they do.
For tests, if I can really absorb a concept, I'll remember it. My understanding might fade if I don't use the concept though."
389,estj,"Yeah, what you said seems right. I am the same way. Never used to do lists or callendars. I occasionally forget something but it‚Äôs rare very rare.
Also hahahaha! I know what you mean. I could recite what cognitive functions are, how they work and all the stacks I steped away from MBTI for a few months and got no worse. Hahaha! But yeah, I had to run around here to find out what they meant. I knew what they were and what the definition said but what it actually meant. Um.... no. So I ran around here and was like what is it like to have this function or that one, how does that work in your life/ blah blah blah. And typing others really helps too. But yeah, knowing knowledge but never applying it is a thing for sure for me too. It‚Äôs sort of funny."
390,estj,"Hi, I'm an INFJ woman who's now dated 2 ESTJ men. I kinda get the gist of you guys! 
Recently I met another ESTJ man, with whom I had an instant romantic connection with. It was obvious he was attracted as well since he was really engaged in the convo, went for a kiss several times during our first date, etc. He's 32, I'm 31.
We met twice more after the first date. He was equally very caring and expressive in his interest. Unless I'm fooling myself, I'm pretty sure our interest is mutual. 
The problem is that he's kind of a... ""out of sight, out of mind"" type. While our dates are REALLY good, he never texts or calls first after these dates!
I initiated texting twice now and already getting sick of it. When I text him first, he does reply relatively promptly. He asks to hang out, too. But again, after we hang out, texts drop. He doesn't intiate, basically.
ESTJ men - does this mean he's just not that into me?
Need a reality check."
391,estj,"He's replying promptly, so he's likely interested in you. Keep after him. Two things:


I know that I tend to get busy with whatever's in front of me while I'm at work, and intend to call/text ""as soon as I have a few minutes"".. but then suddenly it's bedtime and I realize I didn't call/text. ""Dammit! Okay, tomorrow for sure!""


Also, I'm kinda shitty at small talk so I tend to not initiate conversation unless I have a specific question / announcement.


Good luck."
392,estj,"Thanks for this input.
By ""keep after him,"" do you mean I should keep texting him first?
Not that I'm the most conventional person in the world or anything, but I'm used to men initiating most talks, at least in the beginning stages... I don't want to come off overwhelming to him by texting first all the time :(
I do really like him."
393,estj,"As an estj myself I‚Äôm pretty damn bad about replying to texts in general and thinking about sending a text after a date just isn‚Äôt always something that crosses my mind. If he shows interest, trust that he actually is interested"
394,estj,"INFP here, I find ESTJs are way too blunt. ESTJ coworkers I've had were particularly hard to deal with. They don't respect the fact I'm quiet. They repeatedly offend me and they never apologize. I respect how they view work and want to earn their keep, but I feel like they don't respect my individuality or the deep layer of my thoughts and ideas. In fact if anything they see me as weird. I understand that maybe I could have just had bad experiences, but the both of us would have to be mature and leave the judgement at the door. For me the reasoning is purely logical, thinking maybe we could balance each other out. It just isn't practical in the real world."
395,estj,"INFPs and ESTJs usually won't seem like the best of friends as soon as they meet each other, as they're very different and immature ones will likely never give the other a chance. However, once they do get to know each other beyond a coworker-relationship, that's when they become the ideal pairing. We share a cognitive function stack, just in a different order, so we understand each other's internal motivations, but because our stacks are in the inverse order we can still provide a unique perspective on situations that the partner will understand. This can also lead to significant personality growth for both parties, as we'll help develop your tertiary Si and inferior Te, whereas you'll help develop our tertiary Ne and inferior Fi. I personally know and am very close to a couple of INFPs, and we often come to each other for help and advice. The ESTJs you know sound underdeveloped, a normal ESTJ wouldn't try to offend you, and if they did on accident would likely apologise. Or maybe they're not ESTJs and you just typed them that way based on stereotypes."
396,estj,"MrMoodle is kinda right. You can't trust the information given on the internet about which type is right for ISTP. You just have to experience and see for yourself as there are unhealthy types in every type.
Example: I have an ESTJ teacher who has a very unhealthy Te. Everyone hates her. Her husband divorced her. She has got very less friends. And she thinks she's on top of the world. I could never in my life imagine being in a relationship with an ESTJ like that.
But I had also met another ESTJ girl whom I had a crush on. She was actually pretty nice and, I'll say, 'tolerable'.
Now, too much Te just exhausts me."
397,estj,"http://www.socionics.com/rel/rel.htm
Note that although Socionics is very different to MBTI, you can roughly convert most people's types into Socionics by flipping the P/J dichotomy for introverts. So:
ENFJ will become ENFj
ISTP will become ISTj
ESTJ will become ESTj
ISTJ will become ISTp
This is because MBTI states that you're a P if your first extraverted function is a perceiving function (Ni, Ne, Si, Se) and J if your first extraverted function is a judging function (Fi, Fe, Ti, Te), whereas Socionics says you're a j or a p based on whether your leading function is judging or perceiving."
398,estj,"I am am also an ESTJ married to an INTP. It can be difficult at times because I like the to be certain rules for things, and by his nature, rules are made to be broken. 
Otherwise I think we help to bring out the recessive traits in each other. He'll suggest we stay in for the night because we have had a stressful week, and I end up enjoying it more than if I had gone out and stretched myself too thin. I make him go out and visit family and friends, and although he hates the lead up, he genuinely enjoys the time out.
We also have different perspectives. I am more analytical and go over the details of everything before I proceed, whereas he can dive head first into something and stay afloat without being overwhelmed because he can imagine alternative potential outcomes, where I would panic because it isn't going as planned or I can't imagine how it was ""supposed"" to go and that bothers me.
Sometimes it is refreshing and we bring back to earth frequently because of the differing view points."
399,estj,"I've been dating an INTP for three years and while I can't go into detail at the moment, I can say I love him. There are defiantly struggles as he's not as intimate as I want, but his way of thinking challenges mine and keeps me on my toes.
If I can, I'll come back and elaborate."
400,estj,"Ni PoLR, maybe i'm not sure "
401,estj,"I met this guy recently through some campus groups a few weeks ago and we seem to really hit it off. We talk about random things late at night on Facebook mostly and when we do see each other (busy schedules) we spent hours talking by ourselves or hanging in a group. He keeps inviting me to random things or to play badminton with him and his friends and its great. 
So we ended up talking MBTI the other night. He has never heard of it before (he is from India and an electrical engineering major) and was really intrigued by it. The 16personalities.com test put him very solidly as an ES but completely middle for the last two. We both think ESTJ describes him most of the time. 
I really like him and of course I am doing the typical ENFP thing and second guessing and overanalyzing everything. I really like this guy and I want it to be more but I also don't want to lose a potentially good friend by misreading the situation. So my ESTJ comrades, what does it look like when you like someone? Any advice to be had?"
402,estj,"ENFP guy here. My girlfriend of four years is ESTJ. We're decent at reading people, and reading her was like reading large block letters painted on the broad side of a barn. My running joke is that she is as subtle as a car accident. Before dating she was openly flirtatious and started doing things that were very clearly intended to get us either talking or doing something together. This is just a piece of anecdotal evidence and varies from person to person.
My advice is to you from the ENFP-perspective: go with your gut. Overanalysis wastes time and tricks us into inaction. We're great at communicating feelings, so go forth anD communicate your own!"
403,estj,"I dated an ESTJ. The best thing you do with them is speak straight-forwardedly but with sincerity.
Like all TJ's, they love straight-up statements that are clear. Structured.
Like all SJ's, they are tradition-minded; they have no time for insincerity or half-in-half-out.
Good luck!!!!"
404,estj,"I know I'm a little late to the party here, but I'll speak as an ESTJ male.
I am not subtle and I don't beat around the bush when I'm in ""my mode"" of normally doing things. If I like you I will probably tell you first. It is also my hope that I be complimented, flirted with and honestly communicated with. I appreciate directness in speech and actions and am do not have a high tolerance for hinting around. 
My advice? If you like the guy, tell him verbally, clearly and honestly and at a minimum you'll get the same response back."
405,estj,"don't try to criticize her (your Te) or feel like you have to play it cool. The ""cooler"" and detached you come off, the meaner she thinks you are. It's that whole SiFe dynamic she can sense your effort for aloofness and it will probably make her shy away.
As long as you think before you talk, it's pretty great chemistry I think."
406,estj,"INTJ and ENFJ, but only as friends or family members, especially the latter since they tend to be very hurtful when they no longer have an interest in you by simply ignoring you without saying anything and actually thinking it's the kind thing to do. "
407,estj,My opinions on everyone are more or less unformed. I believe every type had good and bad. If I had to pick a type of N I particularly enjoy it would be INTP. I've worked with a few and they are Incredibly complimentary personalities.
408,estj,"Think so? My mom is an ESTJ and we get along as long as she isn't usinf Fi too heavily. She seems to enjoy my company, but the feeling isn't usually reciprocated lol when I was a kid, she and I used to have a lot of Ne driven conversations, and I enjoyed that. It's really hard to get her to talk about anything besides her victimhood any more, though. 
Edit:oh man, compared to r/INTP this sub is a ghost town. Didn't realize the comment I replied to was 4 days old!"
409,estj,"Hello, I am an ENTP guy and I m crushing very hard on an ESTJ guy and... I dont understand many things about him.
‚Äã
While usually giving a real compliment to someone else should make them happier, the guy sometimes answers ""cool, so what?"".
I am quite vocal and touchy-expressive when it comes to my emotions and while he says it doesnt bother him, he also says ""it's just unusual"".
While cuddling, I always ask for a few more minutes of cuddling and at some point, he would get almost angry and just gets away saying that we should get ready.
‚Äã
I could interpret this as a lack of interest but it doesnt seem to be the case either. (his cuddles are the bests)
Likewise, he keeps describing what he is (very unprecisely) and I am supposed to pick up the meanings in terms of likes or dislikes. He doesnt say everything, seeing many things as ""obviously"" true while I never assume so...
‚Äã
Truth be told, I really dont know how to view it. Whether he seems interested, what kind of behaviour he is expecting?
Also, what should I do specifically in order to make him happy?
He is one of the first non female ESTJ I ve met so there's plenty of things I dont know.
‚Äã
‚Äã
‚Äã"
410,estj,"1) Be yourself. (We sense and respect authenticity.)
2) Set and adhere to personal boundaries, and do nothing just to ""make him happy"". (We don't typically respect people who don't respect themselves.)
3) An inordinate amount of physical touch may feel clingy or suffocating to him early on in a relationship. Give him time and space to feel that comfortable with you.  If this doesn't evolve to your liking over time, he may not be for you. "
411,estj,"I just want to make it clear I‚Äôm not a guy, so this may not resonate and these are just my opinions 
Ok, so, compliments are nice, however actions mean more to us. Compliments are simply empty words if you say them all the time-it sounds harsh, but I‚Äôm saying it the way I see it. If we‚Äôre talking love languages, I‚Äôd say quality time and acts of service are more important.
I don‚Äôt like hugs or much physical affection, unless it‚Äôs from a few very specific people. It makes me uncomfortable and irritates me, it feels somewhat clingy and like my personal space is being invaded. 
Um, he probably views cuddling as wasting time, as he could be using it for other things. It gets in the way of his ‚Äòplan‚Äô for the day.
What was different about dating an ESTJ male and ESTJ female? "
412,estj,"I am an ENFP and I told my little brother, ESTJ that I missed him and he said, ""Thanks."" lol. Then again, an ESTJ friend I know loves cuddling with his wife and is very touchy feely, so I don't have a broad answer for you regarding ESTJs. But hope it helps to know some real life examples from my life of ESTJs and that they're not all the same. "
413,estj,"Well estjs we are matter of fact so complements are nice but they have to come naturally don‚Äôt try to go out of your way. I had a friend do this and I was like erm okay. Is that all or are there other motives? What‚Äôs up with this guy?
Er. Be direct. Also the matter of factness is a thing and not wasting time.
Otherwise it‚Äôs been pretty well covered. Also estjs have a few variants. I am a estj 3 some are estj 1 or 8 so it all depends."
414,estj,"I think you re spot on. Indeed he seemed concerned about his plans for the day.
In that case, that's great, now I know how to show my appreciation. 
I didn't date any ESTJ female but I befriended one and never got what she liked or disliked."
415,estj,"I would find it very tiring to be so anxious and I often see the two of them very anxious.
When he got off the hug he seemed anxious about completing his plans for the day.
I made a project with my ESTJ female friend and she always worried about many many details when it came to her job. Time etc...
In the end, it often prevented her from being focused on the right things and made her waste tons of time which further increased her anxiety.
That being said, I do respect the way she can deal with tedious work. "
416,estj,"This is me haha, I‚Äôm not quite sure how to explain it, but I kind of like having a bit of stress to drive me to be productive. In my head, I‚Äôm telling myself, you have to finish it on say Friday, one week before the deadline so you have time to edit it. It makes me more focused when I plan :)"
417,estj,"Yes always this logic of making sure he/she has time for this and that is how I guessed they were STJs. 
I think it's a great quality tbh ! 
With my ESTJ friend, we did a great job as I would tell our group how exactly we can do things efficiently and she would always make sure I am focused on what we re doing .
That being said, how do ESTJ people react when you give them a guideline on how to do things?
Also, the guy seems to be very worried about status.
And when I tell him : dw, although they have a higher status, considering your potential it's worth it for those people to invest on you,
He appears to disagree. He thinks that unless he is equal in status to someone, he can't ask for any help. "
418,estj,"Guidelines? Well at work, we just follow what our boss tells us. As for group projects/tasks, generally everyone is indecisive, so I call the shots.
I always think reputation is important, status, not so much. Reputation, because jobs are mostly found my networking and if someone in your industry doesn‚Äôt like you-you‚Äôre somewhat screwed. Status in a workplace isn‚Äôt that important to me, but when it comes to competing, like for placement, which I will be doing this year - I‚Äôve tried to make sure that my qualifications are a step above most 
I feel somewhat embarrassed (it‚Äôs a pride thing haha) if I ask someone above me for help, unless they‚Äôre job is to help me-like supervisors, teachers-you get the idea"
419,estj,"My ESTJ boyfriend is an amazing person who is loyal, good to his family, responsible, fun, successful etc etc. 
One thing that I don't understand about him though, is that he brags excessively. 
Is this a typical ESTJ thing, insecurity or possibly something else? "
420,estj,"I jokingly brag a lot, I‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄòHD student right here yada yada‚Äô but we all know it‚Äôs a lie haha
I guess it depends, but either he‚Äôs really proud of his achievement (and it comes off as bragging, when really he‚Äôs just excited, I‚Äôm always scared I‚Äôm going to do this-so I only share my achievements with people really close to me), but maybe it‚Äôs just your boyfriend idk "
421,estj,I am an estj 3w2. And I use to do it. It‚Äôs an ego thing. I don‚Äôt do it as much anymore. Haha! You don‚Äôt have many friends if you‚Äôre too brag heavy. I use a lot of it for motivational stuff but otherwise I keep it more humble. But it‚Äôs a ego issue. We are often really proud of our accomplishments though. And we talk about how it works a lot of times to give examples that it does work or to motivate others.
422,estj,"I spent years doubting myself and feeling really down about myself and my abilities. 
I ended up watching a TED talk that honestly just flipped a switch. And the more I said good things about myself the better I started to feel. 
I am so much more confident now and just all around way happier and I have a tendency to brag in ways. 
I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say I do it excessively but if I‚Äôm proud of myself for something I‚Äôll tell someone. I think sharing your success can sometimes come off as insecure but some of us are just proud of our own accomplishments and want to tell others. 
Now doing it in every single conversation would be weird. "
423,estj,"Well there is a couple of reasons for that I can think of, kind of show his wife or others how capable he is.sometime I do it to kind of prove myself if you will or say well this is what I ahave accomplished. For a feeler it may be I helped these people out. But for us ESTJs it‚Äôs all about accomplishments. Or it could be frustration. Like I did better than this person. This person wasn‚Äôt really productive so I picked up the slack for this person. OUr world sort of revolves around doing and what we do and don‚Äôt do. Also,, I would say he brags or tells you more. I would probably tell someone I knew but keep it pretty humble other places. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt keep it humble at home but it‚Äôs like oh welp I did this this week, I did that. That guy wasn‚Äôt that efficient so I just did his job too. It‚Äôs just our conversations. That‚Äôs not necessarily bragging. It‚Äôs just talking about doing which we are really good at. Recounting if you will. It‚Äôs like an isfj or some other type talking about there day and how many people they helped and who they helped and how.
Our te organization keeps us that way.
My family doesn‚Äôt understand it either. It‚Äôs a competition to them, but it‚Äôs more like I have done this and got this and that done. And what have you? It‚Äôs this need of action of doing if you will. And need others to do as well, if in that type of framework. But in your boyfriends it‚Äôs more, this is what I do and Yeah, been pretty productive this week. A lot of conversations either revolve around interests or what we have done because it‚Äôs what we know if that makes any sense?"
424,estj,"This has been really enlightening...man, our brains are wired so different! Really good to know how he might be processing his info. In his mind, he is probably reporting facts tgen, weather than bragging. It really helps to understand. Thank You. "
425,estj,"Our thought processes is different yes. He is probably doing that or recounting events. You can ask but ask politely just like I am wondering but do you like to brag to me? I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a great idea but he‚Äôll probably say something like what I‚Äôve said.
If you need something else, keep in touch, I don‚Äôt mind answering questions. I consider myself fair to very decent at the MBTI. And No I am not bragging. I‚Äôve done a lot of studying researching, typing type of thing."
426,estj,"check that:
Type Four‚ÄîLevels of Development
Healthy Levels
Level 1 (At Their Best): Profoundly creative, expressing the personal and the universal, possibly in a work of art. Inspired, self-renewing and regenerating: able to transform all their experiences into something valuable: self-creative.
Level 2: Self-aware, introspective, on the ""search for self,"" aware of feelings and inner impulses. Sensitive and intuitive both to self and others: gentle, tactful, compassionate.
Level 3: Highly personal, individualistic, ""true to self."" Self-revealing, emotionally honest, humane. Ironic view of self and life: can be serious and funny, vulnerable and emotionally strong.
Average Levels
Level 4: Take an artistic, romantic orientation to life, creating a beautiful, aesthetic environment to cultivate and prolong personal feelings. Heighten reality through fantasy, passionate feelings, and the imagination.
Level 5: To stay in touch with feelings, they interiorize everything, taking everything personally, but become self-absorbed and introverted, moody and hypersensitive, shy and self-conscious, unable to be spontaneous or to ""get out of themselves."" Stay withdrawn to protect their self-image and to buy time to sort out feelings.
Level 6: Gradually think that they are different from others, and feel that they are exempt from living as everyone else does. They become melancholy dreamers, disdainful, decadent, and sensual, living in a fantasy world. Self-pity and envy of others leads to self-indulgence, and to becoming increasingly impractical, unproductive, effete, and precious.
Unhealthy Levels
Level 7: When dreams fail, become self-inhibiting and angry at self, depressed and alienated from self and others, blocked and emotionally paralyzed. Ashamed of self, fatigued and unable to function.
Level 8: Tormented by delusional self-contempt, self-reproaches, self-hatred, and morbid thoughts: everything is a source of torment. Blaming others, they drive away anyone who tries to help them.
Level 9: Despairing, feel hopeless and become self-destructive, possibly abusing alcohol or drugs to escape. In the extreme: emotional breakdown or suicide is likely. Generally corresponds to the Avoidant, Depressive, and Narcissistic personality disorders."
427,estj,"Watership Down, by Richard Adams
The plotting, strategy, and struggle are fantastic.
You won't be able to find them at a library, but The Twelve Kingdoms fantasy series is translated from Japanese and was everything I wanted in terms of character development, world building, and characters. Read it online/ ebook at www.eugenewoodbury.com
The X-wing series in the Star Wars legacy universe were Reddit favorites from that canon. They're hilarious (the Aaron Allston ones), well plotted, and have great characters."
428,estj,"I read 1984 IN 1984‚Äìvery dystopian.
If you like a bleak future, ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù (this is where it‚Äôs from) always watching then read.
I didn‚Äôt, even though I was in 7th grade I still wouldn‚Äôt recommend/like it now."
429,estj,"And what fantasies should this be? Because those books didn't hit any of mine.
In my opinion  a better example of ESTJ pandering  would  be Starship Troopers. A coming of age story about a boy becoming a ~~man~ machine. Growing into his  power armor and fighting the horrors of the universe.
In fact I would argue, that the entire Armored Knight archetype is an ESTJ fantasy. "
430,estj,"I‚Äôll try looking for Watership Down at the library! I would like a physical book, rather than an ebook, and I don‚Äôt know much about Star Wars (never been a fan, I guess). Thank you for the suggestions! "
431,estj,"It certainly does. I didn't draw the parallel but you're right. Not only did the main character relive his life over, changing to become more efficient and eliminate mistakes he thought he had made but it reinforces this idea that all ESTJs need to remember - control is an illusion. In the end, things generally turn out the same regardless of the extent we go to to control any given situation. 
I also agree with the post below that recommends Watership Down.  You can't go wrong with that one either. For the record I'm not completely ignoring your Orwell question, I just don't want to write a book responding to it"
432,estj,"If you have to ask or I have to explain then one of us doesn't get it and I have neither the time nor interest in figuring out which. Let's move on and yes, Starship Troopers is bomb. If op hasn't read it he should as well as Stranger in a Strange Land. "
433,estj,"I‚Äôm an INFP and my bf is ESTJ. We operate completely differently, but our core beliefs and ideals are very similar. It takes a lot of maturity and communication to make the relationship work, but we end up complementing each other‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses like a dream. I‚Äôve gotten more productive and assertive, and he‚Äôs learned to be more emotionally aware and sensitive."
434,estj,"The last time I dated an INFP I was waiting in line at a MacDonald's ""Restaurant"". I actually wanted to go to a real restaurant but she wanted something fast and easy.
So we were standing 40 minutes in line. 40 minutes. Then we came to the cashier. I told my order fast and determined. The cashier looked at my date, and she said: ""Umm... I want... maybe...""
She just started to think about what she was going to eat. After 40 minutes of waiting.
Never again."
435,estj,"I've sorta categorized each type based on my experiences with them and what I look for regarding certain relationships. 
That being said I have 3 best friends from 3 different areas in my life who are INFPs. One I met in class last semester and we got super close super fast. Another is a roommate from 2013, it took us longer to get close but now we're practically sisters and another I met at work. It was the worst job I've ever had in my life but she made it worth showing up. I also have a recent roommate who is also an INFP, we're not as close but I still love going to her for advice and just hanging out. 
So INFPs make amazing friends, we just click in a way I don't click with others. I really don't have other friends I consider close. 
But I'm dating an INTJ. "
436,estj,"My bf is IN*P and I am ESTJ and I must say it goes really good. Our personalities are completely different, however, he is happy that I am the ""talking person"", while I am happy that he is the ""planning person"" in our relationship."
437,estj,"I pretend to be ESTJ at times because sometimes I am like severely illogical and kinda....inferior Te is awesome.
I am INFP and my Dad is ESTJ.   He has kept his belief I am developmentally disabled in most ways for 30 years, and the sentiment is very shared.  I can not be my honest self around him or he just drops the facade and goes full assclown.
He is unable to consider things with any degree of empathy.  His inferior Fi is turned 80% on himself, 15% on family.  He expects to be obeyed in any context, really.  I get sick of him invalidating and poo pooing any damn thing I say so I stop talking to him.  But he requires fake ass concern meetings where I will like just kinda stand there as a formality as he makes up what he now knows I did that dayor this and that.
He tries to be emotionally manipulative.  But he tries to convince me like I am 100% disinterested in any thing at all in my life, as if he was trying to conceive himself to care only for him, fewvtimes he says my emotions have no relevance.  Only his.  Ya, well MBTI is invalid and I am a dumb s.o.b. so like it can be a bitch but I am retarded, not Fi lead.  I just am retarded, lol.  His Fi is stunted.  But passionate.  And loyal.
It's fucking awesome trying to discuss an important issue when this grown ass ""supervisor""  gets all flustered as soon as he realizes I am wasting his time by like trying to discuss anything....seriously no shit.  Like I found a way to save 90 bucks....""omfg theres all thiese issues I know you arent considering and throwing hands up flustered I DONT WANT ANY PART OF IT.  IF YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME SO BE IT.""   He demands to be obeyed on the most petty ass shit, even if extremely embarrasing to explain.  ""Ya, my Dad threw a bitch fit and threw all the air mattresses away.  HA HA HA HE IS COOL.  NOPE DONT LOOK AT ME.""
I am trying to explain why you are going to have to mutually adore and respect each other.
I love my Dad more than any other person on this planet.
But respect him?   He is fucking retarded.  Is only way I can explain it.
And he feels EXACTLY the same regarding my retardation.  But he is a loyal and hard working man and he probably shortened his life expectancy a little trying to fix me and make me logiccal too.  In this way I do feel respect and he will loosen up sometimes too.  Relaxed, our Ne can sometimes get synched and it is a lot of fun.
But I think it needs to be a sort of relatiobship where you date long enough to know you can deal with the severely at odds opposite align of the two respectivec types strengths and weaknesses.  In a huge fallout kinda bitchfit ""argument"" we come out starting strongly strengthwise, it awkward and painful as both of us clubbing each other in nuts.  He ashamed of my wishy washy concern for poppy cock, me embarressed at how shitty his logic is holy shit.
Good luck   Have fun.  Breathe, and stay calm :)   You are brave for for considering this."
438,estj,"Honestly, this has nothing to do with Infp and more about how the person is raised most likely. 
I will have my order ready before I walk into a restaurant or pull up to the drive thru and get thoroughly impatient with people that don't have their orders figured out in their minds and make me wait.
My best friend is an Infp and I nick named him mozy because he's just so slow. So slow it annoys me. He was raised in a very relaxed atmosphere with a isfp dad and istj mother. I on the other hand was raised by an entj father and enfp mother. 
So there you go. I'm still infp but I am an efficient one. "
439,estj,"I will back your sentiment as INFP.  U guys have given me severe emotional trauma hounds under your supervision at jobs and such over the years?   But NO ONE knows how to party like ESTJ, in my viewpoint.  <3"
440,estj,"Bro from a fellow infp, this is my advise. Use your NE, creativity, big picture, high intelligence powers and mix that with the discipline and E*TJ no nonsense methods he taught you and make more money than your estj dad ever dreamed of. 
I did this to my entj dad and now that I'm in my mid 30s there is a bit of air to my superiority over him. It's great and he can just finally shut up.
He's kind of jealous even though he's proud. Muahahahah"
441,estj,"hey. 
Im new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded. Like he will often talk about our future, having children, etc. Basically planning ahead for the future including meeting his mum in nyc and i've just spent xmas with his family who have never met a previous gf before as he has been single 10 years. However, on the other hand, was very weird at the start about even holding hands in public, going to his place, going on dates, etc although he spends like 3-4 days of the week at my house.  
‚Äã
Anyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.
I feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries. I was just wondering if there where any ESTJs that have experienced similar issues with their ENTP, should i be concerned, and if you have any advice for me?
I really don't want to end up in a situation where I have invested in further to this relationship to find out a few years down the line i've been messed around. 
‚Äã"
442,estj,"Aight I'm an ESTJ too who'd pretty much never cheat who's loyal and honest and blabla. 
You're dating an ENTP, aka a person with superego Fi, the ENTP will unlikely care that what they're doing is wrong since they often do not have any values or rules thanks to NeFe, their dominant and tertiary function.
NeFe: There's so much to do in this world! Everyone could do anything they want! As long as I'm seen nicely, that's all what matters!
But what the ENTP forgets is that they have inferior Si, aka a poor focus to details, they could get so caught up in their ideas and world of possibilities that they forget what they once were saying, they don't notice how inconsistent their lies get. And as long as the person they're talking to doesn't notice or doesn't call them out, the ENTP feels confident in what they're saying.
In order to avoid these types of moments, the ENTP might just try to make everything they say sound super vague. This way when they're stuck, they say that at least they didn't lie. This is a bubble easy to pop, just keep asking questions and force them to be as clear as possible. Then they got the chance to either own up or may end up lying like pussies.

Superego Fi is pretty damn annoying, you could read more about if here https://www.instagram.com/p/BlNWasng7vh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14qrtb5x8mlfx
Force the ENTP to be more honest before the relationship gets meh, don't leave them space to be wishy washy, make them open up to you and learn more about their insecurities. Maybe if he opens up to you, he may be more honest. So yeah. Good luck."
443,estj,"Consider myself a healthy ESTJ but my biggest struggle by far is dealing with other types that aren't very resilient or motivated. They go through struggles and don't recover, or they get jealous of other people's accomplishments and never consider how they could do the same. 
Had a friend tell me once that they wouldn't survive the things I have, but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. Seems to me we're all capable of growing, learning, and accomplishing things, but maybe not. 
Any tips on gaining a better understanding of people that don't bounce back or aren't as motivated?
‚Äã"
444,estj,"ESTJ seems to be a type likely to still perform despite difficult circumstances, or even considering the challenges and adversity as exciting and thrilling.
I think ESTJ can be exceptional among the types in that kind of resilience, and that can be a model by which the others learn how to perform better.
Still, the things that motivate the types are likely to vary. Accurately noticing what the motivating factors are would be very important if you want to motivate people.
My observations: A lot of the time our motivation and reward systems in our brains are hijacked by things like drugs, food, etc. Helping people with those things first is pretty standard in trying to pull people out of their funks.
Another aspect of it is that sometimes people just value significantly differing things. One wants a lot of money, and another mainly just wants donuts. Which one is right? Both maybe? That kind of thing gets complicated."
445,estj,"My ESTJ boyfriend grew up in an abusive household, and he responded as you would expect. ESTJs never let anything affect them, and I‚Äôm in awe of his resilience every day. 
His sister, a more emotional type, didn‚Äôt turn out as well. It completely broke her, and she has been a hot mess for her entire life. 
Boyfriend has serious resentment towards his sister because she can‚Äôt seem to get over it and get her act together. I mean they don‚Äôt speak at all, it‚Äôs pretty bad. 
I tried to tell my boyfriend that his response to abuse is really extraordinary and that he is an extraordinary person. His sister is an ordinary person, responding to childhood trauma the way an ordinary person would. She‚Äôs not a bad person, she‚Äôs just a regular person. Not a moron, just not an ESTJ. She has a different operating system and doesn‚Äôt measure her life by efficiency. 
We‚Äôre still working on this together. I think the best thing to do is shift your mindset from ‚Äúother people are not resilient‚Äù to ‚ÄúI have much more resilience than the average person.‚Äù"
446,estj,"I've learned that resilience has to do with your locus of control.  This is the degree to which you believe you are, or are not, in control of your own life.  Those with an internal locus of control can be quite resilient because we believe that we are able to change things.  Those with an external locus believe they are powerless or their efforts will be futile.  ESTJ's are basically the poster child for internal locus of control.  So when you are dealing with someone not as resilient as yourself, just remind yourself that their inborn temperament + their experiences have taught them that they aren't in control of their life to a large degree.  If you have influence over that person, you could help them to have a more internal locus of control.  Read pages like this one for ideas: https://themotivationmindset.com/internal-locus-of-control/"
447,estj,"Well not everyone is for what we are for and not everyone‚Äôs big thing is achievement and work. I don‚Äôt usually have issues unless they are really just usually unmotivated and throws themselves a huge pity party.
I am a blind ESTJ. And I‚Äôve accomplished quite a bit in life, more than a lot of blind people. In fact I was a representative at this organization because I was the model of achievement what blind people can be. I‚Äôve done everything from navigate a new city, to campaigning and running fliers for a congressman‚Äôs campaigns, being a journalist, attending a regular college. I am basically not blind. I am a normal person and more haha! So in the blind community I am often as seen as amazing and kind of a role model. I want to be like that, but no one really tries. My problem is when people just sit at home and throw themselves a pity party. I don‚Äôt usuallly bother to say too much unless it gets extreme. OH well they can do something sit at home and argue with each other. Hahaha! It‚Äôs really sad. But yeah, I know what you mean, but for most people I just see it as not their goal. I am the busy body blind person. I am also very well liked in my community and involved in it. But yeah,I can get the frustration, but at the same time I tell myself that‚Äôs just not the aim of most others who are not the estj or xstj types."
448,estj,"I‚Äôm the same, I find it challenging to empathise in these situations, because I struggle with different things and therefore can‚Äôt understand why others find it so difficult. What I do, if someone says they have anxiety (just an example), I think of it like getting nervous but multiplied by 1000 and uncontrollable. Then I‚Äôm like oh shit, if you need me to do anything, I‚Äôm here. Obviously anxiety and nerves aren‚Äôt the same, but that‚Äôs the only way I can kind of understand what they‚Äôre going through."
449,estj,"I have no tips. I don‚Äôt actually believe ‚Äòless resilient‚Äô is a good excuse. Everyone goes through crap, everyone breaks and falls apart. Everyone makes choices. Owning your choices, good or bad,and recognizing your own power is what makes a person capable of striving to pull their shit back together. "
450,estj,"Okay so you have to ask these questions
A: Do you care about this person
B: Dose this persons failure make your life worse.
If the awnser  to both of these questions is no, then why do you care? If the awnser to
A is yes: Then take them aside and explain how this is hurting you. If they don‚Äôt want to get better this is now there problem. 
B is yes: Explain to the person how there hurting you. Offer to help them. If they refuse to get better, try getting other people you think they‚Äôll listen to involved. If they still don‚Äôt listen move on with your life and due the best you can."
451,estj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbti] Dealing with types that aren't very resilient

¬†^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
452,estj,"ENFP -
Is the question about stagnation caused by emotion? Surely since you're not an emotional type, you could think that maybe you don't understand what it's like to have emotion running through your brain 24/7? For me, if something is not quite right emotionally, that shit needs to be sorted out, and as fully as possible if I plan to move on with my life most successfully. The stuff that I don't resolve stays with me, eating away at me when I'm alone.
Looking at rational reasons to null introverted feeling isn't possible since it's my auxiliary function to feel what I'm feeling and find where the problem lies and then deal with it."
453,estj,"Thats really rude. If they went through childhood trauma, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there were some after-effects of an unhealthy relationship. 
Just because you could handle it doesn‚Äôt give you an excuse to exploit or judge seemingly mentally weak people, thats called being an asshole. We will never know their whole life story.
If you‚Äôre an ESTJ, I want to let you know this is the reason why I dislike your type. Treating people that are ‚Äòinferior‚Äô to you is arrogance at it‚Äôs finest and it shows that you can‚Äôt be relied upon to help people."
454,estj,"Nah, it‚Äôs fine. I went through something shitty when I was little, so now I compare when I think of how bad something is, it‚Äôs never as bad as what I‚Äôve been through. Therefore, nothing really bothers me - hopefully that makes sense :)"
455,estj,"Person a gets through same trauma easy. Person b gets through same trauma hard.
It can be:
a) person a is a tough person, person b is normal
b) person a is normal, person b is weakling.
Which one of these it is depends on which is the ""standard"" or ""average"" way to go through such trauma.
Basic illustrative example. If average/standard time to get over of something is  50 days than someone who gets over it in 50 days is normal/average, someone who gets over it in 10 days is though, someone who gets over it in 150 days is weak.
Since we do not know the benchmark of how would an average person deal with such trauma I simply explained that it can be either a), or b) as from my statement.
This has nothing to do with being an asshole, it is just very basic/neutral reasoning."
456,estj,"Hm I can understand assigning reasoning to this, but I think that humans cannot be decided simply by logic and probability. 
You can do that in business and marketing and decide to market an object to them with reliable info, but emotional turmoil in humans (such as abuse) can vary wildly between people, based on the degree of abuse and how the person themselves perceived it to happen. 
I think emotions are a very grey area to tread on, breakups/deaths can all vary in intensity based on how each person viewed the relationship.
I get that you‚Äôre simplifying it, but this isn‚Äôt an area where it should be broken down into black and white, because rarely is it ever clear-cut and logical in the first place."
457,estj,"I agree that there is no black and white. But that does not mean psychologically weak people do not exist.
And it does not mean claiming a fact that weak people exist is being an asshole, because that is just a neutral fact.
I guess talking about physical strength may seem less ""un PC"":
Lets say an average man can bench 50kg. 
That means if you bench 20kg you are physically weakling.
If you bench 50 kg you are physically average.
If you bench 100kg you are physically strong.
Same principles can be applied to psychological strength - there are weaklings, their are averages, there are strong.
It is just much more difficult to benchmark. "
458,estj,"Ah now I understand what you mean. I didn‚Äôt take your comment as neutral just because... I don‚Äôt really know if other people would take it neutrally either. So I took it a bit personally.
But yeah, I‚Äôm getting the benchmark analogy. There are definitely weak people around, that have little resolve to do anything. I was trying to say that if the weak people are willing to learn then we should help them and keep an open mind to help them become strong.
Strength is a better way to put it, and yeah, its not generally seen as ‚Äònice‚Äô to judge how resilient a person is, even if it might be true."
459,estj,"We receive a lot of hate, but I think I am surrounded by an amazing family and awesome friends. If people hate me, I am oblivious to it. 
My dad is ESTJ and he is the one person I hold the most respect for. He has always been a good dad. Worked extremely hard for the family, and did what needed to be done. But no matter how hard he was working, he made it to all 4 kids sporting events. He made a point to show up. He even helped and worked as coaches or volunteered for any events. He wanted to be as involved as possible and now he has 4 kids who might struggle at times, but they know they can count on their dad for anything. 
We lived in the country and any time it snowed he would take his tractor and plow our driveway and every single neighbor within a half a mile.  Every weekend he was helping his dad or siblings with any help they needed. He is someone who gives his time an never complained, it's just what he loved doing. 
People just don't dislike my dad, and if they do, they still know how good of a man he is so their hate doesn't really last or they keep their mouths shut.  He works extremely hard at every job he has, if there's one person who could get a good recommendation from any previous job, it's my dad. 
My dad worked as a garbage man for a family business and their son was awful. He would scream and yell and make mistakes and refused to take the blame. My dad loved the job but he knew it was time to go. He planned it out and he told them if your son lashes out one more time I'm leaving. And the son went bonkers so my dad left. My dad put so much energy and time into that job and was always getting them business. He helped them so much that when he quit everyone else cut ties with the business too. They figured if my dad of all people quit, there was a good reason and they weren't going to support the business anymore. And the business went under shortly after. 
My dad has spent his entire life building his reputation, which is exactly what his father did, who I think was XSTJ as well. So he saw the example and followed it. And that's what I want to do. 
ESTJs are amazing people, so fuck what anyone says. 
Unhealthy types exist in every kind, and if you want to judge an entire group it says more about you than them anyways. "
460,estj,"I think (mostly) everyone on this subreddit is pretty cool, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve met another ESTJ is real life tho. I can‚Äôt really make a judgement, but I think I could be friends with another ESTJ, but not live with or date one :) 
There‚Äôs always going to be unhealthy ESTJs, just like every in every type-so I understand if people have a bias against ESTJ due to past experiences. If you don‚Äôt want to be friends with me, why would I want to be friends with you? "
461,estj,"She recognized me even before I was familiar to the MBTI. My 7th grade teacher would always tell me that I am very similar to her. Many years later --after I took the MBTI test, studied the cognitive functions and concluded I was an ESTJ-- I asked her what her type was, and she said she's an ESTJ! LOL
I love her and respect her. I still contact her to this day. She's very down-to-earth and extremely organized (which I LOVE). I remember when we'd have class trips, she would give everybody a task (a detailed one) and the plans would come together really well. She was really caring too, made us write down our birthdays on the class calendar and would write a note for each of us on everyone's birthdays. When I consult her of personal issues/problems, she'd always speak the truth, very honest & direct. 
She's an healthy ESTJ, and I'd consider myself as a healthy one too. We got along well :-) "
462,estj,"I don‚Äôt have issues with most of the people here. I know another eSTJ in real life. We‚Äôre both really political and we both love each other. I like the guy a lot. I mean if you push his boundaries. Obviously. Yeah. He‚Äôs probably not going to be likable but most people like him, most people don‚Äôt push his boundaries. They are very reasonable.
He‚Äôs my professor and serve as a city counselman. He was the mayor at one point.
So I think both of us are wildly loved in our communities. Just the opposite of the descriptions. We both know everyone and lots of people."
463,estj,".

He said he is ESTJ but I don't know him well. we are dating for about one week. He said I was his crush for 6 months! My ESTJ is very caring about me and his family but to others... A bit Less than I expect. He loves me, I love him And I see the low potential to be the harsh person that people saying about ESTJs . Are you change during long-term relationships? What's your opinion about volunteering in critical fields? Since you guys are T do u prefer F or T-girl for relationships? Because I have a great feeling about him but I'm not comfortable to reveal entire my love for him. "
464,estj,"INTJ here. Just thought to drop by and comment on this particular aspect:
ESTJs either men or women are natural born leaders. And you'd better get used to it because you are going to stumble upon this aspect of theirs A.L.O.T.
I'm saying this based on the way you phrase his lack of empathy for anyone outside his ""team"" and/or his ""territory"".
ESTJs might be bullies indeed but believe it or not I've come to the realisation that this is not necessarily bad. In the words of Chris Rock:
""We need bullies. This is how Trump came to power. We got rid of bullies ... Then a REAL bully showed up AND NOBODY KNEW HOW TO HANDLE HIM!""
ESTJs have the ability to be the bullies you like in situations such as the above. They are survivors that are tough AF - you have to give them that. They know how to get their hands dirty and come off clean while staying on top of things in the end too.
If I were you I would promptly state all of the above to that guy, recognise him for what he is and appreciate his psyche with all its pros and cons, hoping he's going to turn on the light side of the force.
Just my 2c."
465,estj,"Like what the other INTJ said here, ESTJs are the worst when it comes them evaluating your work. That's as bad as it gets. As long as you protect the structure they create and what they value, you can pretty much do anything else and it won't get on their nerves.
Personally, I find ESTJs to be pretty sensitive and want acceptance, especially from people on their ""team"". That's why they're so nice to their team and so able to be harsh on everyone else. They get their support from where they need it or where they can get it so they don't need it in other situations. These other situations tend to be the ones they have to be tough in and what they consider to be productive (Te-dom), like work. It's pretty cute."
466,estj,"As an ESTJ I personally think most of those are stereotypes. I can't speak for all, but I'm genuinely nice, caring person and value personal relationships a lot more than I do being successful.
However, when it cost to empathy I do lack in that department. It's not that I don't care, I just don't know how to express it and when it comes to being honest or sparing someones feelings I'm more likely to he honest and straightforward with that person."
467,estj,"ESTJ are assholes with hearts of stone. Also they say really mean things and they don't give a shit about your feelings. Actually to them your feelings don't even exist and should never be considered. But they care about their own feelings and want you to care about their feelings. ESTJ are quasi-psychopaths. And they don't like people in their family to spend any money or time on their own hobbies and interests or having any fun. To them it's just a waste of time and money and they don't care about your mental health. Basically they are shitty people you should stay away from. And yes they are bullies. They can never admit they did anything wrong or were wrong about anything. And they don't give a shit about the quality of their work. They just want to get things done quickly, with the minimum effort. You can't get any emotional nurturing from an ESTJ, just as you can't squeeze blood from a stone. Like EVERRRRRRR. You can know an ESTJ your whole life and they will never give you one tiny drop of  nurturing and kindness. If all you want is someone who works hard and takes care of responsibilities but is a mentally abusive asshole that will make you depressed and miserable, then choose ESTJ. And the same goes for ISTJ's. They are the two worst & most hated types as parents. They  will be mean, cold, and abusive to your future children. And they will also deny toys, games, and hobby supplies and basically anything fun to their kids. Another thing I hate about ESTJ's is that they are ignorant people who think they are always right. They think they are right about everything without ever having done the slightest bit of research. They frequently have the wrong idea about something and then they are stubborn jackasses about it and you can't change their mind. This is because (1) stupid people don't like to learn, and (2) stupid people think they know a lot more than they actually do. They're too stupid to realize that they lack knowledge about something. Extroverted Sensors are the 4 most stupid & ignorant personality types. ESTJ's only learn the absolute bare minimum that they need to do their job and get through life. ESTJ's are a constant pain in the ass. 
‚Äã"
468,estj,"Really? Let‚Äôs say I have a friend that sick but won‚Äôt see a doctor even though they cannot recover from this illness. I will start out nice and suggest going, then it will go to dark foreshadowing of how much worse it will become, then if they‚Äôre far away it will become guilt tripping about how poor everyone will be without them, then it becomes straight up I will come over and straight up drag you to a doctor kicking and screaming.  "
469,estj,"My first thought was that OP should NOT say any of those things since it comes off a bit extreme, but what do I know? Maybe he'll be into it?
‚Äã
I'm an ESTJ and am not a bully. I happen to know a handful of ESTJs and none would I consider a bully either. "
470,estj,"I used to think all of that too. I was married to an abusive one for many years. Many moons later, I find myself dating one. He is pretty bad at sharing emotion, but is a wonderful, thoughtful, kind person. 
Sorry you've been burned so bad. They aren't all bad though.."
471,estj,"I oppose, to get done what needs to be done I can whatever is necessary and sometimes that‚Äôs being a bully. Not all the time but it does come up. I like the way INTJ phrased everything and would consider them complimentary "
472,estj,Would I say I‚Äôm a bully 100% of the time no. But let me tell you our firm can come off quite harsh to soft ones or so my people have told me. I‚Äôm also quite guilty of being mercilessly mean to anyone that has hurt any of my people which can fall into the bully category as these individuals have never harmed me directly.  I‚Äôm pretty hard edged though. 
473,estj,"Hi, ENFJ female here... Dating an ESTJ male. I have read a lot about ESTJs trying to understand my boyfriend a little better. He isn't very verbal when it comes to emotions, yet he was very verbal in the beginning and expressive. His actions definitely speak louder than words. I can feel the love, but I wonder if this type says it at all because I read they show it more than anything. Also, I can't tell if everything he said in the beginning was because it was the honeymoon phase and just high on emotions or its true with what he said and still feels that way. 
What are some stages you guys go through when falling in love? I heard its a slow practical love ...and then how long in telling your SO you love them? What do you consider romantic from your SO?"
474,estj,"I tend to fall hard fast and then realize we aren‚Äôt on the same page and back off. 
It happens a lot and it happened with my current SO who is an INTJ. We got passed it but it was really hard feeling like I cared more than he did. 
And I am not expressive with my feelings and emotions. I would much rather show it through actions. 
But it‚Äôs been 8 months and it‚Äôs so much better now. Communication is extremely important to keep us on the same page. "
475,estj,"yet he was very verbal in the beginning and expressive = Because at the beginning he was trying to bang you.
We have trouble articulating our thoughts into words so action takes pride of place.... 
Personally I have fallen in love fast and I have said ilo first.......Expect when in a relationship to not have your emotional needs and moods fully understood, we will just logically attempt to tell you why your emotions make no 'logical' sense and therefore you shouldn't be feeling them...... ummm, sorry that's a really quick run down anyway :-)..... sincerely ESTJ Male :-) 
Edit: Feel free to msg me, i can explain more when i have a little more time :-)"
476,estj,"I‚Äôm an INFP and have been with my ESTJ bf for 7 years. The first year of us dating, he was very verbal with his emotions and feelings about me and much more affectionate. But as years went by, he didn‚Äôt like showing too much affection whereas I have always been the type who loved giving and receiving it. It did put a strain on our relationship for a little while until I really got into learning about personality types as well as astrology (he‚Äôs a Virgo and they are known for being more reserved and not affectionate). That‚Äôs when I took a step back and realized that even though he doesn‚Äôt use words to show me he loves me, it really shows through his actions. They‚Äôre little things like making sure I have lunch or the money for lunch when I‚Äôm at work or school. Making sure I‚Äôm not over-working myself. When my car broke down, he told me not to worry because he wanted to buy me a new one. He mostly likes to buy me things that I need without me even asking because he just wants to make sure I‚Äôm taken care of. I do believe that in the beginning, we were just in the ‚Äúhoneymoon‚Äù stage but we still have our occasional moments of us being ‚Äúfeely‚Äù and emotional."
477,estj,"I am an INFJ female and I had the same struggle. I think ESTJs just get in the routine of caring for their significant other in their way, and they forget to see the needs from the significant other's point of view.
You know what I did? I told him it would be nice for him to say 'I love you.'
And he said it three days later."
478,estj,"ESTJs are known for their high level of commitment, do you view hard times in your relationship as a speed bump / a natural thing and keep going forward? Or do they make you think twice about the relationship?"
479,estj,"My sister is married and my parents have a really strong marriage so I went to them to talk about it and they reassured me that it was completely normal for there to be misunderstanding. 
With my INTJ I‚Äôve noticed that I have to be blunt and very clear about what I want or how I feel. If there is a problem I can‚Äôt just tell him the problem I have to give him a solution. 
He was just unaware and didn‚Äôt realize I wanted more from him emotionally. And once I told him he changed immediately. 
That‚Äôs why communication is important and telling your partner exactly what you want. Giving hints isn‚Äôt going to be enough. "
480,estj,"Yes, I meant everything I said from the very beginning, then I as got more familiar with them I started to feel less inclined to open up more, because for me it‚Äôs like, we‚Äôll I did that now she knows me & I don‚Äôt wanna get into this mushy stuff all the time. 
For me I said it and it felt comfortable, I said it a lot at first and then it also dropped off after a while. But I was still in love, I just showed it more by actions instead of words. "
481,estj,"Ah, very much like my boyfriend.... He told me in the beginning he was feeling like a mush, but now he hardly says anything gushy! Like I said though (and what you said) he definitely shows it, rather than verbalizing it. What did you consider really romantic if emotions are not really comfortable thing? I find him very romantic, but I also express how much it means to me. I've done some stuff for him (trying to keep him on his toes) and he will just smile, brush my hair to the side and kisses me on the forehead as he gives me a long hug."
482,estj,"After I stopped verbalizing it so much I would mostly just do nice things for her and buy her rad stuff. I (later after the relationship) discovered that my love language was receiving gifts, meaning that I felt most loved when I got things. Therefore I made the rookie error of giving them everything I needed in order to feel loved but not what they needed to feel loved. So look out for that."
483,estj,"Interesting, my boyfriend seems to do the same thing. I wondered about that... He showers me with gifts and acts of service (he's woken up early just to put gas in my car so I wouldn't have to). My love language is acts of service and words of affirmation. With words of affirmation I am mindfully aware of since he isn't vocal. 
....we're in a long distance relationship btw. He is adamant about waiting until I am able to move. 
Would extravagant gifts matter or just receiving gifts in general something that makes you feel loved? There is no way I can afford the same type of gifts he gives. I am always doing acts of service, which does entail some gift giving."
484,estj,"We like all types of gifts. My fav where the letters she'd pre write for me, she'd label them as ""Read this after we have a fight""...""read this when you're feeling down"" etc etc.. I thought those were really awesome (but we'd never fully express how much they actualy mean to us and how much they make us feel loved).......... Perfect, i've done the long distance thing, yeah i bought iphones and stuff in the first month lol..... I'd say look out because sometimes we can be manipulative without even realizing it. We think like ""If i get this persons needs met then obviously in return i should be getting my needs met"", simple logic right? But as you know it doesn't always work like that because we'll be gift giving while accidently starving you of emotional sources of love.
'"
485,estj,"Ah, I see... During your long distance relationship, did you miss your SO a lot (since its not vocalized)? My boyfriend works long hours, but always makes sure to call in the evening/night and text throughout the day. He tells me if I ever just miss him, to let him know and I'll be able to see him. At times I feel like he can handle the long distance more than I can."
486,estj,"Oh yeah I missed her like crazy but would always try and put out a strong masculine frame, since being a guy I was raised to act as the rock/stability in the relationship for exactly during those times when you go through feeling you can do long distance. This we are then able to convery that confident strong reassurance that you need when you lean on us for support. "
487,estj,"Well, they don‚Äôt. I guess my question was more do ESTJs notice certain quiet people and then later realize they‚Äôre probably INFP (provided the ESTJ is aware of MBTI)? If an INFP is otherwise ‚Äúattractive‚Äù, can they attract an ESTJ just by being themselves or do they have to do something extra to stand out?"
488,estj,"My gut reaction is no, I don‚Äôt like to debate because it tends to get heated and I don‚Äôt like myself when things get heated. But I also debate constantly, with other people and with myself. I can‚Äôt help it. I think aloud so if I disagree with something, it just happens. Give me a theoretical debate and the answer is definitely yes.
I‚Äôve never been particularly satisfied by descriptions of Te Ne loops. They‚Äôre usually described as being kind of ‚Äòdoing without thinking‚Äô, leaving things incomplete or not taking a moment to factor in things you already know. Alternatively I‚Äôve heard it described as trying to find short cuts, hopping from thing to thing hoping one will be the magic answer when the real answer is to pick a thing and keep at it. 
Personally, I find myself attempting to satisfy Te with Ne, so I‚Äôll brainstorm possibilities and tell myself I‚Äôve made progress on a thing, when really all I‚Äôve done is dick around on the Internet. It probably happens because I know what I need to do but I don‚Äôt want to do it so Ne kicks in to look for alternatives.
I think ESTJ gets shafted a bit on these descriptions because it‚Äôs not one of the popular types and people don‚Äôt bother exploring it very much. "

I would tend to say that yes, I enjoy debating, but most of the arguments I get into with people are just that.  Arguments and not debating.  I find the biggest difficulty with healthy debating is that, especially in this day and age and especially with my generation, people aren‚Äôt open minded enough to hear other points of view.  Bigotry in certain circles is on the rise.  So while I might mention it offhand I at the very least try to avoid anything political or that might be construed as controversial in the company of people I don‚Äôt know or know aren‚Äôt mature enough/stable enough to handle those ideas/such discussion in a healthy manner.  


I burn out.  When I‚Äôm in the Te-Ne loop I can get somewhat paranoid and haphazard in my methodology.  I know I need to do something but I can‚Äôt force myself to do it so I end up getting sidetracked.  I feel the subconscious need to batten down the hatches and micromanage my environment to ensure success and a reduction in vulnerability, volatility, and lack of control.  Usually I‚Äôm healthy enough to realize when I‚Äôm in this loop but it‚Äôs a shed habit to break.

"
490,estj,"I don't particularly enjoy debates, especially political ones, because I get unnecessarily angry.  I dont believe we ever convince people to change their minds in these scenarios, so I've wasted my energy. I look at it as a boundary issue akin to: ""I get my vote. You get yours.""
I will, however, debate work-related or personal-related topics at home (more so argue) because I feel like I can and should have influence on those outcomes. 
On the flip side, if someone really comes at me in an aggressive way, I will use my anger to fuel my laser-focused argument and hopeful takedown. I try not to go there though. 
Tl;dr  I dislike debates, but am generally good at arguing."
491,estj,"okay like what? I can‚Äôt see that. I am actually totally blind so you‚Äôll have to just explain it. Hahaha!
Er. Okay. Trying to understand this. So what if you‚Äôre wrong? Do you like losing a debate? And do you go in to it because you know if you‚Äôre right?"
492,estj,"It‚Äôs all theory until it happens, right? All plans are just theories.  As for theoretical debates, I think everyone has seen those ‚Äòwhich mbti types would you want to be stranded on an island with‚Äô questions. Debating the strengths and weaknesses of these theoretical people in a theoretical situation is fun. The closer it gets to real life, the more likely I am to get hard nosed about. I enjoy Ne. People usually feel like their tertiary is a fun function. It‚Äôs when Ne has real ramifications that my Si jumps in and closes it down."
493,estj,"Interesting concept of theory.
How about stuff like the conceptual notions of political leadership, of society and it‚Äôs formation, theoretical principles of history, and so fourth, do you enjoy that type of academic type of theoretical debates?"
494,estj,"This dude thinks that he‚Äôs changed types numerous times throughout his life, and he says this without knowing anything about type shit because he says to me that I‚Äôm trying to label him and that it‚Äôs meaningless. I‚Äôm sure you all have met a guy like this. He has an issue accepting that I‚Äôm smarter than him (when really it‚Äôs just INFP being better at ‚Äúreading people‚Äù than him, but he wouldn‚Äôt accept this because he would see this as me being smarter than him, though he‚Äôd never say this, he‚Äôd just reiterate that this ‚Äútype stuff‚Äù is bullshit.)
I hope I‚Äôve given enough detail that someone knows exactly the type of guy I‚Äôm talking about. Yes I‚Äôm saying that was the point of the previous  paragraph."
495,estj,"It‚Äôs common to be unsure of ones type/mirror other types at certian points in your life.  I consistently test as either an INFP/INTP for the entire time I‚Äôve been in MBTI and a lot of that has to do with peacocking.
Typology is a system of labeling people whether you believe in its validity or accuracy or not.  So yes, you are labeling people when you use it.  As for it being meaningless or not, I think that is a subjective issue that changes from person to person.
Tbh the information you‚Äôve provided is so vague that it‚Äôs hard to tell if he‚Äôs truly an ESTJ or whether that‚Äôs your personal perception of him.  I do believe you when you say he‚Äôs an ESTJ, but I‚Äôm not really sure what specific behaviors you‚Äôre upset about, because the ones you mentioned that I answered above are pretty valid feelings tbh.
Certian ESTJs can be extremely adept at reading people even if they don‚Äôt let on.  That being said, if I were to assume he was an ESTJ this would likely be his opposing Ti.  Though intellectual insecurity is not something specific to ESTJ, it‚Äôs jusr I feel that we may be prone to that more due to said placement of Ti."
496,estj,"I have a friend who I typed as ESTJ. He was so offended that I somehow had the ability to type him without him taking the test. 
He thinks mbti is a load a shit and people can‚Äôt be categorized like that. 
Honestly just let it go. Some people don‚Äôt care for mbti and find being typed an insult. 
I can‚Äôt read any description of an ESTJ because it makes me feel awful. There really isn‚Äôt a solid description of us out there. Not that I‚Äôve seen. So imagine him looking it up and finding out he‚Äôs just a bossy controlling person who most people can‚Äôt stand. 
I grew up with an abusive Infp parent and one thing she did that I literally hate to this day is making assumptions about me and then telling everyone else.  She thinks she‚Äôs knows me so well but actually doesn‚Äôt know me at all. She would share my problems on Facebook as if she‚Äôs doing me a favor but it just caused me to start lying and hiding the truth from her. I haven‚Äôt shared some thing personal with my mom in years because she gets so damn judge mental. She victimizes herself and then tells everyone. 
ESTJs can be unhealthy but sometimes we‚Äôre not as bad as everyone thinks. 
Idk sounds unhealthy from both perspectives. You do sound like you think you‚Äôre better. "
497,estj,"I believe you, but I‚Äôm talking about ‚ÄúThis Is How Each Myers-Briggs Type Ruins Their Own Life Without Even Trying To‚Äù:
ESTJ
You have a hard time empathizing. You are very efficient and logical minded, which has you consistently searching for the most rational and and direct way to do things. While your logical and structure is extremely important, you tend to have an issue with seeing things from others points of view. You ruin your life without meaning to by not empathizing with others and their perspectives- causing you to become frustrated by behaviors that you deem ‚Äúillogical‚Äù simply because they don‚Äôt line up with what you would do. When it comes to the world, perspective is important, and alienating everyone you come in contact with because they don‚Äôt think like you is a quick way to leave you alone.
Not attempting to make you angry, but chances are your mom was correct. What probably happened what that her Ne communication and your Si communication were making things impossible to understand from each other‚Äôs point of view."
498,estj,"I told my mom I was suicidal and she played the victim saying she was such a bad mom. Making me feel like shit for opening up about one of the most personal things in my entire life. Then she went on Facebook and told 900 friends. 
But yes. She was right and I‚Äôm just an un-empathetic ESTJ who thinks I‚Äôm better than everyone else. 
I don‚Äôt need to see it from her point of view. What she did was wrong. 
I hate when people try to justify shitty actions by making it about what drove them to do what they did. 
I shared your most personal information because I wanted my friends to pray for you because God works miracles. Especially when everyone knows. "
499,estj,"Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way but it kind of seems like your dad might have had a point, even if he was a dick about it.  It really does seem like you‚Äôre trying to fit the ESTJs into a certain mold based on your experiences/perceptions and whatever information/stereotypes you‚Äôve come across online.  Which is a dangerous game to play because I honestly feel ESTJs are probably one of the most misunderstood types in MBTI and irl meaning much of that information/many of those stereotypes is/are incorrect.
In terms of showing affection and being comfortable with handling touchy feely situations I‚Äôd agree.  I‚Äôll admit to having a tough love approach to things and I can definitely be unintentionally gruff and intimidating at times.  However, I 100% get where people are coming from in most situations (don‚Äôt underestimate the power of Te in social situations), it‚Äôs just I tend to approach them from a more practical and diplomatic position.  If you‚Äôre looking for a shoulder to lean on that seeming neutrality can seem unsympathetic but it comes from a place of honest assistance rather than maliciousness.
This is a stereotype that‚Äôs just not true.  As an ESTJ I‚Äôve actually run into more issues with others getting irritated at a view I hold/not being able to see things from my perspective.  The issue I have is that while I can see other people‚Äôs perspectives, I am not always convinced of their correctness.  So at times I can be slightly stubborn/less accommodating if I think someone is doing something stupid, but I will still try and maintain the balance of the situation so to speak.  I think the thing that irritates most people though is that I am 100% not willing to back down/compromise my core values/truths that I know to be true.  I stick to my guns and that sadly puts a lot of people off.  
Seeing things from other perspectives does not always mean agreeing with them.  I‚Äôd place truth/practicality and actual stability 
This is something true to all types across MBTI, not just ESTJs.  I‚Äôve seen plenty of other people fall into this trap who weren‚Äôt ESTJs.  This isn‚Äôt ESTJ specific, this is human specific."
500,estj,Google ‚Äúdom-tert loops and common personality disorders‚Äù and hit the first link. You need to forfeit any previous understanding of the personality disorders to be able to understand it. I can explain why that is if you refuse to and disagree
501,estj,"This was ok, and I was able to see the first part and was ready to say that was my fault I was wrong, for some reason I didn‚Äôt take into account the abusive part.
Then I saw the sarcasm.
Basically, move on."
502,estj,"I‚Äôm being misunderstood. I figured people with a similar brain would be able to help me work things out. I don‚Äôt understand why so many people here take things from a defensive perspective when it‚Äôs not even something worth talking about. While this may sound bad, this is a problem about me and nobody else."
503,estj,"I‚Äôm not quite sure what you‚Äôre trying to say here?  I was honestly just trying to help provide a better understanding of how ESTJ‚Äôs are operating to give you some perspective to work off of.
I 100% don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going with this."
504,estj,"From an ESTJ perspective your post is just one more person ranting about how awful we can be. 
Are you trying to repair the relationship? Or what is your point. If it‚Äôs just a rant about how much you dislike him then maybe this isn‚Äôt the place for it. 
If you‚Äôre asking for advice you need to one take a step back and read what you wrote. You sound extremely judge mental and are acting as if it‚Äôs all his fault. That you‚Äôve done no wrong. 
I tried sharing my perspective about my abusive infp parent and you literally took her side and said she was right before you had any other information. My mom has always assumed she just knows people and that she has this strong read on others but somehow is always crossing boundaries. 
You are also complaining about being misunderstood while not being the least bit understanding yourself. Everything you write is an accusation about how we are in the wrong. 
Is it possible that you are at fault too? Would you be able to accept that? "
505,estj,"As an entp myself, I'd say don't worry about it too much. You'll get bored and move on to a new job within a year or so. :D
But for real, it'll be rough. They're almost the exact opposite of us and DON'T know how to have a discussion without being emotionally tangled. Try to think through things before you say them since if it can be taken personally, it likely will. You'll say something that you see as a simple truth and your boss will take it as a personal attack on them and everything they stand for. 
Without knowing your job, I'd try to negotiate for as much freedom as possible to do your own thing. They can be controlling personalities so our... unorthodox means of getting things done doesn't fit an estj who like to grind things out methodically. "
506,estj,"You have a good point,  my job enables a significant Amelie to find freedoms to come and go...it's the times he gets involved he doesn't seem to fathom that I don't have a list explaining  how to wipe when I go to the bathroom "
507,estj,"haha I'm currently married to one of them so I feel ya bro. The good thing to remember our ""make it up as we go along"" type of action makes their type go crazy. They tend to like order, lists, schedules, the sorta stuff that drive us mad. Just see how much you can opt out of and hopefully you don't rub the wrong way too often. Just prove your competence and make sure to let your boss know (and see proof of) you can function better doing your own thing."
508,estj,"I ask, ""Hey, where do you want to go eat lunch?"". They give me a blank stare.
I say, ""I want to go eat lunch outside."" and they might ask, ""Why do you want to each lunch outside?""
Once I explain it's because of the breeze and sunlight, they'll almost immediately be like, ""All right, let's go.""
It's like this for everything. Whenever I ask them what they want, they don't seem to have a clue. Once I tell them what I want, they go along with it. What do they really want? Do they actually know? If so, why won't they tell me directly?"
509,estj,"In my case about the blank stare, I am thinking about what have I eaten before, are certain more places better to diet) suggest for you to enjoy, do I want a drink, is it kid friendly, is it expensive, and is that ok?
With the picnic, that is more work, why do you want to make more work. You had a good reason for a picnic so go for it. "
510,estj,"That could mean he does not care where to eat (it is too irrelevant to the quality of his life/day).
Once he has a preference (for example at a certain day he craves pizza, he would answer lets go for a pizza)."
511,estj,"Sometimes I say that but not often, and sometimes I‚Äôll just go with it. So yeah. Sometimes it‚Äôs a group decision. Sometimes the issue is not thought of as important but more than not I have an opinion. Especially where to eat haha!"
512,estj,"So I initially thought I was entj but moved on to entp, thinking I was just suppressing the more annoying parts of being an entp, like constantly wanting to debate. However I relate more to ESTJ, but I really don't value social norms. For example I was reading that ESTJ will want to think about how the person they are with will be long term, and how they would be as a wife/husband but I don't think I even want to get married. Does anyone else experience this? thanks"
513,estj,"Social norms is a vague term. Some social norms are (in my opinion) stupid. Like pre-marriage sex is frowned upon in Christian community. That is a social norm too but I find it blehh.
‚Äã
Wanting to get married depends on your age or how ready you are, a few years ago I would think the same. But it is true that I always evaluate the person if it is worth to make an effort/waste my time. If it is not going to last I will not waste my time or efforts, just go along with it (if I have time which I usually dont :D)"
514,estj,"ESTJs value ""foundations"" which are core theories and ways of thinking that we build everything else around. That said, it is very normal for ESTJs to be very picky and choose unconventional foundations. We do like them to be universal in some sense though.
‚Äã
It doesn't surprise me at all that an ESTJ isn't interested in getting married. I would be interested in hearing about your sense of humor and how your debates are structured.  
For humor, I use a lot of understatement, wit, and self-deprecation. A light touch is better.  
For debates, I favor the Socratic method. To me, it seems more respectful as I'm focusing on asking questions and not stating my own opinion, but some types get upset and angry over it like I'm being evasive."
515,estj,"The part of the ESTJ description that mentions traditions isn't really my thing either. In figuring out your type, it's important to figure out how you think and what your strongest characteristics are, not if a description matches you 100%."
516,estj,"A lot of that ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô stuff really turns me off and I think those descriptions are a product of people misunderstanding Si. I‚Äôm not exactly living a groundbreaking life or anything, but I‚Äôve never been particularly traditional. I‚Äôm more concerned with what works for me than what other people expect me to do."
517,estj,"Being objective, organized, planning a schedule and wanting other people to give concrete answers on socializing so I can have my schedule for the week. 'Desire for organization and closure.' Assertive, honest, give objective advice, good at bringing people together.
I also really relate to most of the traits from ENTP is the thing"
518,estj,"The thing is every single trait you just described also really easily applies to ENTJs. And the fact that you relate to ENTPs is also a strong indicator of an ENTJ, who is arguably more likely to confuse himself for an ENTP"
519,estj,"A lot of ESTJs don't fit the ESTJ model because they are raised by liberals, N's or a combination of both.  ESTJs are famous for being ball busting conservatives. But if an ESTJ is raised in a Liberal household, they will be a product of that environment.  I am an ESTJ girl.  This is also hard to find research on as the type is dominated by men.  I hope this helps other confused ESTJs. Don't let stereotypes give us a bad rap! "
520,estj,"Read this: http://personalitycafe.com/cognitive-functions/24032-intro-function-theory-more-detailed-descriptions-each-function-attitude.html
And then use this: http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm
It will make more sense. I promise. :P"
521,estj,"Yeah, you don't find too many ESTJs on internet communities in general. They're too busy out in the real world needlessly shouting at their employees and beating the shit out of their kids and all that stuff.
However, if you're looking for helpful articles regarding your personality type, there are quite a few here. Also maybe have a look at a list of famous ESTJs, as well as maybe types that are similar to you (ISTJ, ENTJ, etc.) and see if you can relate to any of them and learn anything from them."
522,estj,"I've taken a few and I either come up ENTJ or ESTJ. I think I identify more as an ESTJ but yeah, not may of us around.
This one is fairly comprehensive and this one isn't bad.
Why are you unhappy with the type?"
523,estj,"I love that list. Henry Ford, Judge Judy, Dr. Phil, Chile's fascist leader, Bill O'Reilly and a bunch of Christian evangelists. Oh and on the other one? Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Aristotle, Carl Sagan, and Alexander Hamilton."
524,estj,"I'm an INFP and we come from different worlds. Why should I respect laws that are inherently wrong (looking at you classification of marijuana as a schedule 1 substance), administrators of the law that are corrupt (for profit prisons, incarceration proportion by race, fucking lobbying in politics), and a world order that actively gives benefits to a select few at the expense of the whole? The current world order is ideal for the ESTJ types and I and most of the NF's absolutely loathe the vast majority of you for it. Tirade aside, I individually respect ESTJ's for the love they show to their chosen few. My uncle is an amazing ESTJ dedicated to keeping our extended family close. Spending time with him outside of a work setting makes it hard for me to see the workaholic corporate chain climber he is."
525,estj,"Not all of us fit the stereotypical bullshit that those Type description sites spit out. I'm an ESTJ because of how my thought process works and my beliefs and values aren't dictated just because a site says that I prefer to follow laws and regulations or that I'm loyal to my family.... If these laws and regulations oppose my beliefs and my relatives are retards, then I will work just as hard to oppose them.
As an INFP your cognitive processes are Fi Ne Si Te, and mine are Te Si Ne Fi. We're not that different.... "
526,estj,"I think it's pretty clear that we view life from a completely opposite world. ESTJs rarely use the functions I most use and I rarely use the functions ESTJs frequently use. Seems pretty different to me. For example: contrast an ESFJ with an INTP. ESFJ (Fe Si Ne Ti) vs INTP (Ti Ne Si Fe)
ESFJ-Sarah Palin
 INTP-Tina Fey
INFP-John Lennon 
ESTJ-Bill O'Reilly
Just a little different..."
527,estj,"I'm no expert at this, so someone please do correct me if I'm wrong.
I think you're looking too much into personality types rather than cognitive processes. My understanding is that people have different preferences of cognitive functions they use for perception and judgement. This doesn't mean they completely lack their shadow functions or can't use anything other than their primary/secondary, but as you become an adult you slowly develop your tertiary and retarded function and become a wholesome and balanced individual.
To reinforce, these cognitive functions are just preferences that your brain defaults to using. I'm a medical researcher myself, and solve complex biochemical problems using Ti even though I don't prefer to use it in my day-to-day tasks. As an example, if my internebz breaks down and I can't figure out why - then my Te will kick in and give me Option A: Call up the ISP (but since they are notorious on services, I could spend up to 2hours on the phone, it leaves me with...), Option B: Call up a tech-saavy friend who can help me. Someone with Ti might solve this problem by: ""I'll just check the manual for the modem and see if its working correctly, then troubleshoot from there.""
These cognitive processes determine how we prefer to think but DON'T define who we are, our individual behaviour and what type of person we become. So I don't think defining Tina Fey as a classic INTP allows you to refer all other people with that behaviour as INTP's. After all, cognitive processes just define the way in which you think - not your beliefs, leisure activities and relationships to friends/parents/partners and work.   
As fun as stereotyping friends and popular people can become, stating something like: 
""Oh that Julia Gillard completely cracked down on Tony Abbott on misogyny. She's a red head that's why she's so ferocious and angry. Tony has brown hair, he can never match that temper, as a result he just cowered in fear.""
This statement does not prove that gingers are angrier than normal people. Rather we're finding specific examples for confirmation bias. 
As different as the people are that you've listed above, they're dissimilar because they're people with different views in life, and not necessarily because they're Jungian personality type defines them as different. It would be as inappropriate as saying that Prince William has the same interests and similar behaviour to Sarah Palin because they're both ESFJ's.
I haven't yet read any journal articles or psychology textbooks to grasp all the concepts, but found this place to be helpful and I think the community for this type of discussion there is larger the one here on reddit: http://personalitycafe.com/"
528,estj,"(Warning: A lot of this is meant to make fun of the situation, prepare yourself for the cringe! I actually do have a serious, legit problem, though, so it'd be quite nice if you could help with that, too...)
I believe my relative is one of you. Blech, ew, this sounds way too formal already...
ANYWAYS, so my ESTJ relative...I love them to death, yeah? They can put up with me...most of the time. Hey, it's better than the average Joe on the street, I'll give you that!
So, anyways, I feel as though because we disagree on certain things, our relationship is trash. Not as in I-don't-like-this-relationship, it's as in this-relationship-goes-out-the-window-the-second-we-bring-up-a-touchy-subject kind of trash. 
See, I think that because I don't think the same way as my ESTJ relative, I'm hurting them. 
These are the two primary issues:

Religion. I'm an agnostic, they're Christian. I tell them I don't want to go to Church or get confirmed. They make me do both anyways. AKA: That generic atheist/agnostic experience all atheists/agnostics get. 
The way I'm ""experiencing the high school life."" They want me to go to parties. I am okay with parties because super awesomely cool nerdfriends are there, but not necessarily ecstatic about it. I want to wear a suit to the party because suits are really, really, really cool and I think I'd look really badass wearing one. They don't want me to wear a suit, and refuse to argue with me on the matter. They instead force me to wear a dress. I hate dresses, on a badass scale of noodlearms to ninja grandmother they get a 'single-celled organism.'

So, how can I fix these situations? Do I have to bend my point of view to match theirs? If so, that's really gonna suck...ew...
And does this sound ESTJ to you? My typing may have been off. "
529,estj,"Well I am as well an atheist and if I had family that wanted me to go to church and do what ever I would go asking as its not eating up your life. You don't have to believe what the preach but it will make them feel better if they think you will go to heaven. And for the dressing situation; I have a brother that has one of the worse fashion styles ever(not saying that you do) and her just wears shorts, doesn't do anything to his hair, basically doesn't care if anyone likes him. Even though I tell him what may look good on him he doesn't even want to try it, my recommendation for you is to wear what your cousins say looks nice maybe once out of every 5 times and just ask someone if they think you look good in it. If not try something else, don't worry it won't kill you."
530,estj,"First: Personally, as an ESTJ (and a Christian for that matter, lol, since it seems to be semi-relevant here), I don't think I'd ""force"" you to go to church. You mentioned confirmation so I'm assuming Catholicism, which I am not--but I've noticed that a lot of Catholics seem to ""force"" family members to go to church, so that may just be a combo of their personality and their denomination. 
Second: I too used to hate dresses. However, I like them now, so I can't help you much on this one. Maybe compromise with a dress, a blazer/sport coat like jacket, and menswear inspired shoes? 
I'd recommend trying to find a compromise at least. 
Also, how old are you, OP? You sound pretty young."
531,estj,"I can't sit still in church, though. I physically cannot sit still in church. I have tried, but it's just not possible. I'll be there with my siblings, and then I'll go to hug my siblings because I'll be bored and trying to find a way to not sleep, and my siblings will be annoyed at me, and then they all will get mad at me for being a distraction. I'll try to zone out and daydream, but I can't zone out and daydream without something to daydream about, and to be quite frank here, I hate church music. A lot. So that kind of messes me up, too, because I will be so focused on my hatred toward the church music that I'll be unable to think about anything else.
What your brother does is kind of what I do, to be honest, lol. If I stick a comb in my hair, it's so curly that unless my hair's wet, the comb's going to get stuck in there, and I'll never be able to get it out. I try my best, but in order for me to get myself to look even halfway-human, I would have to spend hours which I don't have on myself. It's just too high-maintenance. I don't think I'm all that good-looking, so I figure that there's no point in my getting dressed up and looking all fancy if I'm just gonna to look in the mirror and be disappointed, yeah? (plus I'm too young to date, so why do I need to look beautiful? I'm going to be bringing my male friend along as a guest, too, and now everyone's going to think we're on a date, and he's going to be like 'wtf happened to my mate what are you wearing what's up with you what is going on what happened to the universe????') I don't really have many people who I can ask for that kind of a thing -- constructive criticism and all -- but I really don't need it. I'm critical enough of myself as-is to know when I look good and when I don't, and wearing a dress is not me 'looking good.' It's not me being myself, either, and that bugs me, too. I know who I am and who I am not, and the one-time-shows-up-at-a-party-all-dolled-up-then-never-does-it-again thing my relative's been having me doing ruins that and makes me feel worse about myself. Real me loves complicated coats, long boots, pants with pockets, goggles, glasses, messenger bags, sneakers, sweatpants, Pokemon t-shirts, suits, and hats."
532,estj,"It's weird because this relative wasn't even raised a Catholic. They converted. It's double weird because in my ""youth group,"" (blech I hated that so much...I'm really glad it stopped after 8th grade because none of the people there were even my friends and I was agnostic and I spent the whole time zoning out) all they ever talked about was accepting others, being respectful, being a good Christian and not shoving things down people's throats, etc.. It's not even like I'm against Christians...
I am pretty young. How did you guess? The minimal levels of maturity? The first-world-problems? The mentioning of the fact that I'm way too young to be dating (although I will perpetually joke about being single since I just love doing that no matter how much it's annoying people)? I'm the physical embodiment of a cringe-worthy 14 year-old. 
The relative wants me to wear open-toed heels. I'm just like 'heck no, I hate these shoes and my feet are gross and why can't I just wear flats? flats are comfy and not annoying' and they're like 'you walk on your toes anyways it'll look weird if you wear flats just wear the diddly-dang heels' and I'm like 'noooooo I'm not that chick from Jurassic World screw off, stop trying to relive your high school dreams through me you had a boyfriend when you were my age you were already better off.'"
533,estj,"For the church part, yeah it's boring and all but how about you tell them twice a month you'll go to church with them that way you only have to suffer 2 days every 30.
Now for the dressing up part. You seem to be person who knows what they want and like and that's awesome that you wear what you want, and I'm pretty sure most guys find that attractive as long as your not to weird. The reason people dress up in a certain way is because it's just social standards and says a lot about what kind of person you are, for example my brother dresses not so good and you would assume he's not that great with social skills just by looking at him and this is the case. But if your not trying to impress anyone then it really doesn't matter. Like you said, you think your to young to date so you don't need to impress anyone. Unfortunately clothing does say a lot about what kind of person you are but if your not to shy and want to meet someone your clothes won't stop you. "
534,estj,"To be totally honest? You kinda remind me of myself when I was younger, lol. It's a little cringe worthy in a weird, big-sister-like way. 
My advice? Ride it out. Open toed heels are not the end of the world, nor will they compromise your individuality. Learn to own what you wear, whether it's what you would personally choose or not. 
Also: being a good Christian DOES mean not shoving it down people's throats. Some Christians would disagree with me, but God gave us free will for a reason, so that's what is right regardless of what people think or say or do. "
535,estj,"It's actually kind of funny, because we usually only go like twice a month anyways. I hate going there regardless of how often. I can't sit still. 
Oh, hey, I might have a chance when I'm older-
CHANCES RUINED! ABANDON SHIP! 
I'm also bringing my male best friend along because he hasn't met the friends I made at my new school, so this is going to be a really awkward not-a-date [I'm not even interested in him romantically, but now everyone's going to think I am, aaaaaaaaa]. My clothes have never stopped me before, but wearing stuff that makes me look ""nice""  will prolly make me crash and burn. I'm not used to it. At all. "
536,estj,"I dunnae, it's my sense of humor, yeah? I've had this same sense of humor since I was like 10, I don't think I'm ever going to grow up. I don't really want to, though. I can be mature if I have to, but otherwise I'll just spew jokes everywhere.
I'm not sure how I'm going to, but I'll try my best to. This is gonna hurt a lot.
I know, but historically most people have seen otherwise, especially today's atheists/agnostics/""indifferents."""
537,estj,It doesn't really matter if people think you guys are going out does it? Unless your looking to meet a new guy. If anything he will help you make more guy friends because guys don't go up to talk to girls rather than guys. Don't worry about the way you dress and when your older most of your childhood won't even matter :) so just have fun.
538,estj,"That's a very uncomfortable situation for me, though. I'm all for trying new things, but not this. I don't think they understand that they are inadvertently disregarding my personality, interests, and thought processes in the act of forcing me to obey them.
Can you please explain how this works with ESTJs? I don't understand any of it. I don't understand why my relative's being such a stick-up-the-rear about me wearing a dress and getting confirmed. I don't get why every time I try to argue with them they don't give me a real argument. They're giving me the impression that they're not happy with who I am -- that they're trying to ""fix"" me. Obviously, that leaves me questioning how healthy our relationship truly is. Is it a good idea to continue talking to a family member who is intolerant of your lifestyle?
I'd much rather them tell me that I'm the biggest disappointment they've ever had the displeasure of being related to than have them pulling this. At least with the former I could do something about it. Right now, this lack of communicating their true intentions is hurting me because it's leaving me with nothing but speculation. "
539,estj,"First of all, let me just say I doubt your they don't like you, if you were truly a burden wouldn't they avoid inviting you to a party? On top of that just because someone tries to change you doesn't mean they don't love you, in fact it can mean the complete opposite but they could be intimidated by what they believe other people may think. People who dress wall are generally better with social interactions and your family might just fear people might think that. If I was going to a party with my brother I would try to get him to wear something nice, because at least for me personally, when I am dressed well it gives me a boost of self esteem and makes it easier to be around people, and like I said people are more likely to approach well dressed people so maybe it could avoid awkward loneliness. If he said no I would think what is the big deal it's just one night your dressing up for an occasion most people dress up for. 
I can see that this is a big deal for you and probably is for my brother as well. I recommend that you explain that you really don't like to dress up and explain that them trying to make you dress up doesn't help you make you feel any better. I'm sure they love you for who you are, but are worried what others may think of who you are. "
540,estj,"I guess you're right in that regard. I'm not unwilling to dress well, though, which is what's annoying me. Wearing a suit is just as well-dressed as wearing a dress, if not even better. 
I live in the most liberal-as-hell state in the bloody country, nobody's going to say boo about me wearing a suit and even if they did I would probably laugh at them."
541,estj,"I think I am an ESTJ.  At work, I always have to have the last word and my way is the only way.  I am well respected and my colleagues always come to me for help or advice.  But I easily get into fights and arguements with clients when they don't see my point of view.  I regularly have dealings with people that end up becoming heated and I really don't like myself for it.  Sometimes, I have discussions with people and I am really assertive about my point of view, and when I walk away, I think ""why on earth did you end up doing that? It was stupid"".
People accuse me of being disrespectful towards them and I am really not, I just don't share their point of view and if I think something is wrong or isn't being done right, I really can't stand it.  I have to correct things if I think they're wrong.
I often drive home from work thinking ""You've done it this time Reg, you're really in trouble as you have really pissed someone off and they will complain"".
I was wondering if anyone else who identifies as an ESTJ can suggest a coping strategy to help me to stop and take a moment to think before I speak to people and deal with them in a way where we can agree to disagree rather than pissing them off? I need to be needed when I am a work and I do like helping my coworkers with my knowledge, but I just can't deal reasonably without people when I don't feel that they share my objectives or methodology."
542,estj,"Your post had a lot of ""musts"" and ""shoulds"" in it (even if just implied). It seems likely that similar thoughts like ""things must be this way"" or ""if things aren't done this way it will be terrible"" come to your mind frequently. Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy are specifically designed to combat such thinking when people find it negatively affecting them. So if you haven't ever considered counseling, you might find it helps you if the counselor uses this approach. They'll teach you to recognize these automatic thoughts, challenge them with some sort of rational argument that you develop in  advance, and then feel more relaxed when things don't go your way. This approach has helped me a lot.
Here is a list of the categories of automatic thoughts many people struggle with. And here is a YouTube video that introduces the process of challenging them. This page has some examples of ways to challenge each category. You don't necessarily need a therapist to teach you to do this. Albert Ellis, the developer of CBT, believed very strongly that people could teach themselves to do this just by reading about it or watching training videos.
If you want to do that yourself, make a sheet of paper with three columns. In the first column, write the sorts of thoughts that you find floating in your head when you start running into trouble. In the second column, label each of them with one of the labels from that category list I linked above. In the third column, write a short, simple statement rationally challenging each of those thoughts. Practice repeating that challenge statement to yourself whenever that thought pops into your mind."
543,estj,"I think it's just a matter of learning to bite your tongue. It's shitty, and I am still working on it but is beneficial sometimes. I work at a restaurant that's open until 2:30am that's next to the largest college campus in the nation and have to deal with drunk people every night and am working on just biting my tongue and not giving people my last thought. I mean we usually regret it in the end if it's over something stupid anyway, right?"
544,estj,"I used to struggle with this as well. My recommendation is to always ask the person WHY they believe what they believe. But don't ask it in an aggressive manner. You can say ""that's interesting... can you give a little more detail about what appeals to you about this solution?"" I picked this up from some of the product managers at my old job.. might be beneficial to do some research about poduct management, which is all about taking people's feedback and breaking it down into business problems and eventually potential solutions. Don't jump into the solution right away - try to understand what problem your colleague or client is trying to solve. People don't always see things the same way you do. "

Description | Sign up for our WellCast newsletter for more of the love, lolz and happy! http://goo.gl/GTLhb  This weeks worksheet: http://goo.gl/Vuucr  Are you plagued by negative thinking? This week on WellCast, we're talking about automatic thoughts‚Äîthose destructive worries that creep into your mind and escalate without reason, like ""I'm not going to graduate,"" or ""I'm going to get evicted."" These thoughts are actually pretty harmful to your health, but never fear! We've got an exercise that will help you ...

546,estj,"Actually, I think I agree. But after biting my tongue, it's EXTREMELY important to share my frustrations with a trusted friend. Someone who can give solid feedback, and affirm your efforts in holding back is needed. "
547,estj,"Thanks for all the useful advice.  Yes, biting my tongue is the way to go I think.  I sometimes think I should avoid all contact with people outside those who know me to avoid an argument.  
I will explore the CBT angle and I have been experimenting with self help videos on youtube.  Watch this space."
548,estj,"Typically I hate them. I find them rude and controlling. 
For example, I work with a fellow ESTJ. Since she has the same position as me, I get highly annoyed when she tells me what to do. It would be much different if she had a higher rank, but she does not. 
I enjoy my more ""free spirited"" friends because they get me to loosen up. A night out with an ESTJ is usually boring compared to my other friends. "
549,estj,"I've met and worked with an ESTJ, to be honest I found working with him taxing and vexing most of the time, and I didn't like the inconvenience he brought to me. I held respect for him, though, I understood where he came from most of the time and enjoyed his efficiency."
550,estj,"I usually hate other ESTJs and their inability to take other people's feelings into consideration, especially when it is pretty clear that the other side will get hurt by their stupid, rash words.
Also the 'I am not even gonna listen to your point because I am right and you are not' mentality is driving me nuts.
I feel like I am not a strong T though, my F has been recently developing more and more."
551,estj,"I think it's healthy to develop F/T regardless of type :) so kudos to you for flexing that cognitive function, hahaha
Out of curiosity, has all your experience with other ESTJS been like that? I.e. you see other ESTJS acting rather tyrannical.  I'm scratching my head because I see on this thread that the sole three answers all seem to be a strong ""No, I can't stand other ESTJs because pushy/stubborn/tactless"" yet all three of you, I've found quite polite and articulate and open for discussion.  Maybe ESTJs irritate each other more??"
552,estj,"Not that I can think of. 
I had extremely strict parents. A lot of things that they did resembled an ESTJ, even though they are not. After I left, I developed a huge problem with authority, that wasn't actually authority. So when I meet a new ESTJ, and they act like themselves, I get really anxious and the friendship never grows. 
Another problem, that I lightly touched on early, is the way I act in public. I don't like to make a scene. I like to look nice, calm and collected. I'm a perfectionist, extremely upright, and constantly stressing about how people perceive me. This can bit a boring at times. That's why I'm drawn to other ""fun"" types. If two ESTJ's hang out and they just sit there, how fun is that? Sometimes I like to ""let loose"", but only if I'm provoked. If that makes sense? 
I'm married to an INTP. My Best Friend is an ISTP. This is beyond perfect to me. They, especially my husband, balances me out. We are complete opposites, and it is so refreshing. Except we both are not the jealous type. Which is perfect since my best friend is a guy. 
Basically I hate anyone that acts too much like me. I wouldn't like to meet myself. 
I will say that if I have too much ""fun"", in theory, it would be nice to hang out with an ESTJ. Sometimes I crave structure in my friends lives. Their lives are chaotic and stressful to me. They make dumb decisions and I can't control it. If I could get past the other traits, the self control and planning would be extremely nice. 
Don't take my experiences and compare them to yours though. I'm VERY ESTJ. Imagine a Blair Waldorf (Gossip Girl is a secret guilty pleasure. I like it because I can relate to Blair, not because I like trash TV) and Dwight Schrute had a love child that embodied their main features, and multiply that by 2. That is how I would describe myself. "
553,estj,"Glad that I am of help. 
We were in different teams then, naturally we had to focus on very different aspects of the same project. Different focus led to conflicts between our principles and of course details and solutions toward the same problems. When such conflicts peaked, one of us was expected to compromise. I won't start rambling and go in irrelevant details, but it wasn't easy for either of us. An issue is only established when an obvious solution is not more ideal or available than the alternatives, in our case, if we chose to protect one end, the other end must suffer. The propositions from my team were always optimal for our focus, and his propositions were often beneficial to his concern. We argued often, we held meetings after meetings discussing trivial issues, we even phoned each other in the after hours trying to establish some sort of agreement. 
It was vexing, but educational nonetheless. Also, neither of us was temperamental, which made our attempt of intermediation much less irritating than it could have been. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say that I appreciate that."
554,estj,"I am an INFJ; I literally am the squishiest ball of confused existential crisis.  Kind of like an INTP but with much better Fe and much worse memory for facts and figures, lol.  I also have no idea who Blair Waldorf or Dwight Schrute are as characters, but I will definitely take your word for it.
That's also why I'm on this thread.  I find ESTJ thinking patterns to be so radically different from my own that sometimes I'm left scratching my head.  I've only ever met one ESTJ in my life and she was really fucked up.  This previous altercation has made me wary of the type.  She was an aunt of a friend who, if I pull from the long list of affronts she's done to me and my friend and strangers on the street... hmm, let's go with the time she called me a pig to my face because I couldn't chew through a piece of ham in one go.  In the one month I knew her, she managed to verbalize a negative opinion of every race that isn't caucasian white (even though she herself is Asian - talk about internalised racism!!).  She also flippantly told a homeless Muslim woman begging in front of the Notre Dame de Paris that ""I work, therefore I eat.  You don't work, therefore, you don't deserve to eat."" The irony of the location and her words was clearly lost on her.  It was so surreal to watch that scene unfold.  I wondered if Victor Hugo himself would rise from the grave to punt her in the chest.
This woman has made me wary of the type, and I don't like having MBTI prejudices like that, so I'm seeking a broader understanding. Yours was a really refreshing answer--thank you kindly."
555,estj,"Does knowing my type make you feel like you have power over me?  Asking out of curiosity! I am an INFJ.  I rank rather high on Ti/Te usage and am often mistaken for male online--I think there's correlation between that.
Oddly enough, I'm surrounded by INFJs in real life situations. I can't say I get along with all of them, but for most, I'm glad to be in their company :)  I've only ever met one ESTJ and she was.... if you'd like to see examples, please see my replies in this thread.
Do you think mbti is quite reliable for compatibility predictions? I like it because it helps me understand perspectives and conclusions outside of my own, even if it doesn't hold too much scientific merit."
556,estj,"I have NEVER spoke to a stranger like that! I'm kinder to strangers than my closest friends. I can be a bit pushy, as I tend to think my plan for their future is better than their plan. Usually I'm right, but I'm working on being so uptight and ""right all of the time"". That woman sounds like a bitch. Not every ESTJ is like that. 
What about the way that we think confuses you? Perhaps I can clarify more? "
557,estj,"Yeah!  I truly believe type does not define the kindness of a person.  It's hard for me to even call her a bitch because she was just... such an unhappy person.  She lives in this idyllic house in the northern French countryside surrounded by nature and beauty and she's just... miserable.  She drove my Fe nuts.  I had to turn off my empathy for her because she was simultaneously being so horrid while also sending out these weird, subtle cries for help.  I'm twenty two; she's fifty seven.  It was surreal to watch a woman so much older than me in that kind of state.
Hmm, I think what confused me was just reading some of the threads.  I came across this gem and watched the show whilst nervous sweating from afar.  I'm curious to know what you think of MBTI in general; do you think it's becoming too cultic?  Do you think it's got quite a bit of merit despite not being upheld in the scientific community?  I've so many questions!  :D"
558,estj,"I have been known to act out when something is bothering me. ESTJ's typically send out ""smoke screens"" because they never learned how to deal with their emotions. My parents always dismissed mine, so I grew up quickly. 
You'll think I'm psycho but here we go - 
I classify all of my friends into a ranking system. My best friends being A's and my socials being D's. Different rankings in between. I also approach new friends with logic. If I'm thinking about becoming close to someone (as close as an ESTJ will get) I make them take the test to see if we are even compatible. This determines a lot of my relationships. I put a lot of trust into the system, I find anyone who dismisses it foolish. I always thought I was a bit of an oddball until I took the test and learned what an ESTJ was. It's hard growing up as a little girl and being different than the other girls, especially in the Deep South of Texas like I. "
559,estj,"By take the test you mean the MBTI yes?  I mean, frankly, as an INFJ, I also rank my friends and family on a scale system of best to meh.  It feels ironic for me because the INFJ overviews always paint INFJS as some sort of sagely benevolent mentor/healer who sees the good in everyone and judges none?? Which I clearly don't fit into.  I'm very clear on which people in my life are where on my list of favourites.  And upon meeting someone, I can tell straight away if they're worthy of entering my psycho-emotional inner circle.  
In particular, girl friends who tote me as their best friend--but for whom I feel complete apathy--can be in for a really inauthentic interaction with me.  I'll play the role til I'm not inclined to do it anymore, then lose touch without remorse.  I also find it relatively easy to determine someone's type when I meet them and also determine how mature they are function-wise when I interact with them.
Out of further curiosity, have you typed the other ESTJs you've mentioned via MBTI test?"
560,estj,"That's interesting. I always try to see the best in people, and underdogs seem to flock to me. (I'm a very protective person)
I have several ""best friends"". 3 of them were in my wedding recently. There are even more people that claim me as their best friend, but my initial response is ""mehhh"". I'm very private. Even they don't know much about me. I have ONE friend that I can go to with anything, and not worried about being judged, or what he would think of me. All of these connections I will keep for life, but they truly don't have the spot secured like they think. 
I've made friends take the test, but never guessed it correctly, except for ESTJ's. I can pinpoint them so quickly. "
561,estj,"Why do you think ISTJ and ESTJ would fight a lot?  You should both value logical conversation that is largely grounded in past practice.  Perhaps that has just become your pattern that you need to break out of.  
I would expect an ESTJ to have a few really strong friends and probably comfortable going to bars and concerts and meeting people.  "
562,estj,"Well, we do value logical conversation. Unfortunately, I'm used to fighting with my dad (who was very demeaning and sarcastic) and my SO has anger issues, so it tends to be very explosive. I used to have a couple friends, but they've moved out of town (or I made friends with people out of town), now we don't keep in touch. I'm not much for small talk ""how ya doin?"" conversation. I do like doing those things, but I prefer watching people interact in those areas. Sometimes I wish people would talk to me though. "
563,estj,"That's sort of usually true.
sharing the last three letters is supposed to be one of your best friend types.  That shouldn't clash much unless you have very different views."
564,estj,"Since learning about being an ESTJ, I've been improving how I work and get things done in my life.
My favourite book is 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective people.' I've made a lot of progress with organizing my week and ""putting first things first.""
Do you guys have any tips for an ESTJ trying to be more productive?
What works for you?"
565,estj,"At work I block off chunks of time devoted to doing one specific thing. Anything outside of those hours is flexible but within those hours I like to do the same thing.
When I get home, I immediately work out.
Some structure, some flexibility"
566,estj,"edit: I need ESTJs the most! Only 5 have taken the test (less than 1% of all participants), meaning that I need 25 more before before I can begin analyzing. Thanks guys!
Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
567,estj,"Best match: ISTP. They‚Äôre willing to go with the flow, a perfect complement to you, and also fiercely independent, which y‚Äôall respect. They‚Äôre also super intellectual, just like you, and have a no-bullshit attitude. 
Worst match: As an ENFP, definitely us. Y‚Äôall make us feel like shit, and we stress/annoy the fuck out of you. Also we don‚Äôt agree on anything. And since we‚Äôre both extraverts, neither of us will listen to each other. "
568,estj,"That's different from person to person, I guess. If prefer someone similar to you, find some who shares your extroverted, sensing, thinking and judging way of living. If you prefer someone to challenge you, find someone who doesn't hold these abilities to the same extend.
Never choose or dismiss anyone based solely on their MBTI type."
569,estj,My wife is an ENFJ and we got along great. She manages to push me to do things that I wouldn't normally be excited about in a way that doesn't piss me off.  She also completely supports any random thing I might want to do even when she herself isn't really keen on it.  It's a good thing we have going on haha.
570,estj,"Yeah I would also say that infp or infj is probably best, because for me I get along with them the best. I would say the worst is either esfp or isfp! Most of the experiences I have had with them are somewhat of a nightmare!"
571,estj,"The ideal match is INFP. The worst match is INFJ: ESTJ relationship type matches 
Best matches are same that share all of the ESTJ's cognitive functions. Sharing functions ensures likelihood of values, emotional understanding, and support. The type that is ideally matches to this is the INFP. Other decent type matches include ENFP and ISTJ (due to shared functions) as well as ESFP, ENTP, and ISFP."
572,estj,"Disagree with ENFP being a bad match. I'm an ENFP and my most recent ex is ESTJ and we worked so well together. I ""challenged her"" (her words) intellectually, and made her see things less black and white. She showed she cared about me with thoughtful gestures and helping me with practical stuff. She loved my open mindedness and kindness, and I admired the hell out of her work ethic and wit. We did not have similar hobbies (she's outdoorsy, I'm musical theatre) but being extroverts we both liked to get out and socialise together. We both liked poetry and pretty views. Our connection was insane. A++ would date an ESTJ again. "
573,estj,"I also disagree with the worst match thing. I am an ENFP and my gf is a ESTJ. We haven't been together long, but I can see my lackadaisical personality being improved by her more structured nature. As long as there is an understanding that both people will probably need to give up some of their feelongs when push comes to shove."
574,estj,Nice. I am an xNFJ and my husband is a ESTJ. I personally think we rock at the relationship thing. He pushes me a little to be more socially acceptable üòÜ and I think push him to be a little more understanding of people. But we always always have each other‚Äôs back. We have been married for almost 14 years. 
575,estj,"Actually, according to Socionics, ESTj's best match is INFj! People think that MBTI INFJ becomes Socionics, but it's actually not true. MBTI INFJ can be either INFj or INFp, and you have to take the test to know. Extroverts stay the same between Socionics and MBTI, but the Introverts j/p may or may not switch. 
http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/363-Duality-Relations-INFj-and-ESTj-by-Stratiyevskaya"
576,estj,"INFJ can become INFj or INFp, but what it's trying to say is that TeSi's dual is FiNe. It's difficult to convert to western branches of typology, but it's easier to say that an ESTJ's dual is INFP.
Most people don't really go back and forth between thinking ""okay, I'm an INFP in MBTI, NiFe in Socionics, ENTP in Kiersey's terms..."" They just have their own personal blob of how they interpret typology drawing information from lots of different resources, which is really the best way to go about it IMO. If you think about it like that, I think most would come to the conclusion that ESTJ and INFP are duals."
577,estj,"If you just want to check out the relationships, this chart is fun to muck around with. Hover your mouse over a type and it'll show you all that type's relationships (obviously it isn't always going to directly parallel real life, it's more grounded in the theory).
If you want to understand why, you'll probably need to go look at the basics of Socionics and build up your knowledge from there, it's not an intuitively grasped system. It's primarily studied in Eastern Europe, so a lot of it is in other languages, and sometimes stuff gets mixed up in translation. It can also get pretty verbose and dense, it took me quite a bit of effort to get a grip on what the hell anyone was talking about. There's not a whole lot of empirical backing either, it's basically all just built up through pure logic and reasoning, so it's best not to take what they're saying too literally.
To start with Socionics, here's a relatively easily digestible explanation that doesn't oversimplify too much (I think). I won't bombard you with links, it may be more effective to just explore and see where it takes you."
578,estj,"Hello! I'm an INFP and I'm looking to develop my Extraverted Thinking function. I'm coming near the end of my first year of college, which I've really enjoyed so far, and exams are starting in just over a month. While I have found some methods that help me to stay on track and get things done, such as using timetables and to-do lists, I sometimes find it difficult to stick to them. Would you have any advice or tips that would help me utilise Te more effectively? Thank you in advance!"
579,estj,"It's hard to see if it's even possible for you to use Te in a way that'll make you stick to timetables and such. I'm INFP too. I don't see Te as being like an ESTJ but weaker, I see it as being INFP. I think we do use Te in a different way. And I'm actually sure there are moments when we care so much we will execute something in a very ESTJ way. I don't know what ESTJs will tell you but I will tell you that you will do something when your Fi allows it. So you have to figure out a way to get your Fi to make you stick to those schedules. But who knows maybe I'm wrong and developing Te is how we will become more organised. "
580,estj,"It‚Äôs a tough one. I know for me to use Fi productively out in the world, I have to be in a pretty hands-off headspace. Otherwise my Te is looking to Fix Everything and fixing things with Fi is how you get that classic delta dictator tantrum. 
Perhaps it might be easiest (safest) to pair it with Si. For example, my day starts with a list of all the things I‚Äôd like to accomplish and then a time table to figure out what I actually can get done and the most efficient order. So, like, if shower and run are on the list, it makes more sense to run first, then shower. "
581,estj,"The best way to develop your Te (rationale) is two things:


Read non-fiction (I am not even kidding, this is how famous people like Gary Vaynerchuk and Tai Lopez developed their Te child as they are both ENFPs)


Don't be afraid of what others think of you.


Watch this vid for reference: https://youtu.be/rZJhg9R1Gag"
582,estj,"I see what you're saying. I have noticed that I'm definitely most productive when I'm fuelled by my Fi and Ne. For example, when I'm studying a topic that I'm particularly passionate or curious about it's incredibly easy to get things done! However, that's not always helpful when I have to do something that I don't care about at all. It takes a lot of willpower for me to do anything that doesn't spark my interest, so I thought that I should try to improve on my shortcomings by becoming a little bit more organised and looking for help here.
I understand that INFPs and ESTJs use Te in very different ways, and I'm perfectly happy with that. But I don't see any harm in trying to improve on my personal weaknesses by asking those who seem to be excelling in that area. At the very least, I'll get some perspective on what it's like to have strong Te.
Thank you for your reply!"
583,estj,"Similarly, things usually get messy whenever I let my Te take the reins for too long. Your point makes sense, I definitely need to make an effort to prioritise certain tasks over others and consider the order I should do them in more often. Thank you for your help!"
584,estj,"Thank you for your reply! Would you have any specific non-fiction works that you would suggest reading? I have exams starting next Monday, but once they're over I'd love to have something new to dive into.
I've found it easier not to care too much about what others think of me when I remind myself that it's impossible to live in accordance to everyone else's expectations, because everybody wants something different. Easier said than done, though, I must admit.
I found that video to be really helpful. It was refreshingly honest and straightforward about an INFP's strengths and weaknesses. It was even accurate about how bad my fashion sense is!"
585,estj,Yeah that's something I really relate to. Actually I need help with that too. Let me know if you learn something that actually helps. If you want. It's crazy how similar we are. I made a similar post in the INFP page earlier. I don't know what I was thinking with that earlier comment. It was never so definite anyway. But thanks again.

587,estj,"[I'm the wife of this guy's account, but I'm an ISFJ. I use sarcasm much, but not in a harmful way. in in a non harmful way; that is a warm way. my girlfriend is an estj and she's pretty warm, even in sarcasm. She's not really into sarcasm that much though.]"
588,estj,"Yes... All my ESTJ friends crack sarcastic jokes from time to time... They're usually dry and to the point. Always some truth in them. I can laugh with them because I always agree, but I would cry if I were the one being joked about."
589,estj,"I took 2 years of ceramics and when I took painting I was awarded as one of the best paintings of the semester. 
I don‚Äôt have a natural creative side. But following directions and steps I actually do really well. 
And now I create websites. 
My mom does mosaics and is really good at it. She‚Äôs an INFP. It‚Äôs her small business and it amazes me what she just creates out of thin air. 
I have to have it planned out. Know what I‚Äôm making. 
If I create as I go it tends to end horribly."
590,estj,"Not at all. I am an ISFP and I am not stereotypically a great artist. I think its great that you have that aspect to yourself! As an ESTJ you do have Fi as your inferior function, Fi is more symbolic and is, as Jung said, ""...continually seeking an image which has no existence in reality"". Do you feel like your exercising your Fi while drawing? Just curious, keep up the art!"
591,estj,"Hey everyone! Hope you are well!!!
This was first posted in an eneagram forum, but I will try it too.
Firstly, I am properly a 1w9 but 3w4 is a second in tritype, and I think it‚Äôs rather high. My third is 6w7. I am also an ESTJ, Te si Ne FI.
I love to work. I do anything  , and everything. I say yes to a lot. I think I can do well on them, It catches my interest. Besides more to do, more to make perfect, get more credit, why not? Someone needs to do it. I am very enthusiastic. It really doesn‚Äôt feel like too much. I just feel busy. Like most 1w9 or 3w4s or eSTJs my schedule is over flowing. I work 3 events a week, and write articles for them. I am a student journalist. I have to interview and run over a ton for them. I am also on other leadership roles throughout my community, help to bridge the gap. I am doing of a lot of work building membership lists, tracking down people online. ETC.... I also take two other classes, have some work from last semester. I usually don‚Äôt burn out, but I think everyone has a limit. Occasionally I feel I do a little and then get back to work. If I get burnt  out I just do something efficient like come on here and help people. Not such a problem, right? Well, until.....
I start to not sleep, and fall asleep randomly. I am also a student, so I dose off at inopportune times like during lecture. It‚Äôs not boring. If I am awake I love debating and engaging. Listening to a lecture is less hands on and energetic then something else, and my body just shuts down then. It‚Äôs unfortunate, because I don‚Äôt really want to doze off! I also crash. Sleep for a long time. I also have to work until work is done. It also has to be to a very high standard. I also notice it, and as ESTJ and maybe it‚Äôs 1w9 and 3w4 it bothers me. when I start getting close to deadlines because I have to do this and that. If you write on at a university level if not a professional paper, you know one or 2 articles is a lot of work.. I also have to go classes, sleep, personal things, breathe, ETC..... I also try to keep up with people in between otherwise I feel kind of lonely just work and no connections. While messaging people may not be super long. So, I miss articles. Initially it doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot. I like working and keeping busy. So, I say yes, and do them. It‚Äôs natural for me to say yes. I feel like they would help my experience and my career. I like to cover those things because I should be the one covering them. I also pick up the leading because no one else wants to do it. Also, I take on tough articles. Some of these stuff fewer really wants to do. That‚Äôs another reason. I am a workaholic and I love work. I also like the perfection and the prestige of doing it. The goals, the success. It usually doesn‚Äôt feel like an issue. You just keep trucking right?
Any advice?"
592,estj,"How much sleep do you get per night on average? I'm personally way more productive when I've had a good night's sleep (not that I do that very often, I guess I just like shooting myself in the foot). If you're drifting off in your lectures, that suggests you're not getting near enough sleep.
I know this is kind of obvious, but if you're asking, that's the solution."
593,estj,"This sounds a bit like a loop. Te wants to accomplish all the things and Ne gives you endless things to potentially accomplish. Probably time to prioritize some Si things in your life. Make sure you‚Äôre scheduling time to tend the crap you know needs doing but in the short term seems less exciting or satisfying. A reliable bedtime routine might help, and good nutrition, since it seems like your physical energy isn‚Äôt keeping up with your mental energy. "
594,estj,"I have no real advice here, just some sympathy. I have been there, too.
What actually ""helped"" was some horrible pneumonia. I was nailed to my bed for months and after it was over I was so weak, that I had to re-prioritize all my obligations. I know take life a little bit more easy.
That said, I am still ""lucky"", because another ESTJ I know was destroyed by breast-cancer, before she took life less serious and became more fun loving.    "
595,estj,"Interesting, I really hate to sleep for more than six hours. If I sleep more, then I get all dizzy and sleepy. If I sleep less than four hours, then I become hyperactive and restless.
I was sleeping in lectures (school too) for years until I started to sleep just 5.5 hours at night. So my solution to sleepiness was to sleep less."
596,estj,"Probably just try doing whatever authorities tell me to do, unless it's spread lighting-quick the situation will probably be dealt with before anything terrible happens. If I can't do that, I'd try to find my family and just see if we could drive out to the countryside or something and wait for it to blow over, presumably fewer zombies there than in the city. Pretty generic answer but realistically it's all I could do (then again, we're talking about a zombie apocalypse, maybe I shouldn't be going for a realistic answer). Honestly, I don't think many people would die if zombies attacked, but I guess ""apocalypse"" implies a bigger event."
597,estj,"In no particular order:


eat a zombie 


find the necronomicon and become the lord of the zombies


go full insane scientist and build beautiful creatures out of the zombie-material (like centaurs)


have sex with a zombie (only after removing the teeth of course; safety first)

A price of freedom? ""Glorious"" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)"
599,estj,"I was reading, listening about that too. I still don't know what to think about it, the whole ""balance"" disruption between the sexes (if we take the majority of people, without counting that sjw gender is a spectrum thing)"
600,estj,"Alright well screw the Infps you guys are being full on invaded (and not with wishy washy emotional introverts) 
Alright well what do you think of entjs and entps who are basically your evil twin or arch enemy (coming from an enfp)"
601,estj,"Don't have a problem with ENTJs, they are tolerable. ENTPs are generally too much but I don't have to deal with them on a daily basis (fortunately) so it's whatever.
ENFPs, on the other hand...
Terrible."
602,estj,"Not my arch nemesis but I always get the feeling that they need convincing and you have to appeal to their emotions to get them inspired to do something. 
That's ridiculous and silly in my opinion. They seem like the type that would need a motivational speaker."
603,estj,"It's less about emotions and more about values and the building blocks of intrinsic motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Too many people, especially ESTJs in my experience, neglect purpose and become cogs in someone else's machine. It may be why ENTJs are the 'Executives' and ESTJs are the 'Managers'. 
Further, to ignore the need for others to align their personal values with a business outcome or initiative is a crucial mistake for a leader. recognizing and appealing to different individual motivations whole putting forth a transcendent rallying cry is a valuable skill and the definition of a visionary leader. "
604,estj,"It didn't take me long before I discovered that their general terribleness is from the inside and it works its way out to bother everyone around them-
Not like that. Not at all. 
I have a few acquaintances who identified as ENFPs. Their exuberance and general way of thinking don't impress me, they become emotional easily and that often happens under strange circumstances- which makes me tense being around them. They are curious, and will go through all means if they have to to gain someone's trust, which I would say makes them appear more untrustworthy than people who simply do not care. However, what I dislike the most is that they enjoy catching people unprepared. Now I cannot be a hundred percent certain as to whether it is an ESTJ quirk or not, but I would personally be annoyed it if I were to be caught unprepared in any given situation."
605,estj,"So I've just written a whole thing in response to this. About how I as an ENFP perceive this and yadda yadda. But then again I might lose your trust in doing so. So ...
... I deleted it ;)
To be honest ENFP's are easy to be around ... but then again. Your driver is Te. I can see how that doesn't really work well with Ne drivers."
606,estj,"But, here's the weird thing. 
We share the exact same function stack (just prioritized in a different way)
And yet out of ALL the types (there is only one type I vibe less with, because I feel emotionally manipulated often, ESFJ) we have a strong disliking towards another... How is that so?
Is it because our tertiary and inferior functions (Ne and Fi for the ESTJ and Te and Si for the ENFP. These are ones we really need to develop to become a more rounded person) are the exact opposite, that we hate the other for how strongly they make us feel bad about not having those developed strongly.
Or perhaps it's because we exhibit the same traits, yet we use them in a different order, causing us to have radically different values. And when presented with different values, conflict is surely due.
Just a bunch of speculations."
607,estj,"Perhaps traits isn't entirely the right word.
However, an ENFP can be very, very productive. A trait you might be familiar with. Yet it will only happen after we explored a bunch of options and the cause feels so good and in alignment with us that it's inevitable to get shit done.
I'm guessing an ESTJ can also really like exploring different options. But when shit needs to get done, you'll rely on proven and factual means to get it done, pronto! You'll explore stuff after things are done. (I might be wrong on this assumption though)
But, to agree with you to a certain extent we hate each-other's auxiliary. Because we all want to ~~kill~~ ruthlessly murder our inferior function .
ESTJ: ""Fuck emotional shit (Fi) I need to get shit done""
ENFP: ""Fuck the proven way (Si) I'll figure out my own way"""
608,estj,"It often takes too long before an ENFP's curiosity is appeased and I find both the ENFPs' half-baked thoughts and dissatisfaction distracting. It can get frustrating quickly when high-efficiency is required.
It is not our auxiliary functions alone though, main+aux. There will always be conflicts between Te + Si and Ne + Fi. "
609,estj,"ENFP with ESTJ wife here. Exactly this comment describes my ability to quickly frustrate my wife. She is a stickler for efficiency in both herself and others. Me, I favour other efficient people yet my own efficiency is only realised after all the faffing about to get a more comprehensive, globally efficient solution - this is seen as inefficient by my wife - the delay in the ""baking"" so to speak."
610,estj,"My mom is an INFP and I've recently realized that I basically mothered myself growing up. I look back on my childhood and can't list one thing that she actively taught me about life. More often than not, I remember occurrences of me helping her when something was upsetting to her -or- us (my ESTP brother and I) having to handle something parental  because she was overwhelmed or unequipped. 
I think it was really hard on me and am bummed to just now realize this. I struggle to get along with her today, especially when she tries to ""mother"" me now. (I'm 37.) Anyone with a similar experience?"
611,estj,INFP here and I'm sorry this happened to you. The amount of stress someone has to take on when the other person is so in their feelings and unequipped for practical real world things must be hard. It makes me think I probably shouldn't have kids because there wouldn't be anything I could do for them when being so selfish. 
612,estj,"I found that to be the case with my dad until I moved out, where he seemed to realize he'd never done that much particularly parental, but after I left we both decided he didn't have to be and we've been much more able to connect since that expectation was lifted. But until then it was a lot like what you're describing."
613,estj,"Was she raising you on her own? Many women who end up raising kids alone say that they feel incredibly overwhelmed, as a result their kids don't get enough guidance and attention. You have to take care of yourself, go to work, take care of both kids, and you're not even allowed to fall sick or take any breaks because there's nobody else who would do all of this in your place."
614,estj,"I think there are a lot of really great things a healthy INFP parent could have taught me, so I wouldn't sell yourself short.  I  think my mom just lacks self-awareness and an ability to prioritize and manage her emotions when required. I was also acutely aware that she was ""swimming in her own feelings/thoughts"" a lot and wish she would have been able to leave her own mind to interact with us when it mattered."
615,estj,"An INFP that isn't self aware sounds scary. I didn't even think it possible. Honestly what that sounds like is that she was aware and didn't interact with you because she thought she would hurt you. It also sounds like one who has a very underdeveloped Ne, and Te and was constantly stuck in an Fi-Si loop. Knowing how that's like I feel for her and how that ended up affecting you. She probably understands that she has affected you that badly and so that is why she is mothering you at 37. You haven't mentioned your father on here, what type is he? Because it sounds like she needed someone to help her. "
616,estj,"He is an ISTJ. Super helpful and supportive with functional things and not terrible with emotional stuff. He is aware that not everyone is like him and registers the differences. She is not. She treats me the way she would want to be treated,  instead of how I want to be treated. She has terrible Te, not sure about her Ne though. What's the Fi-Si loop look and feel like? "
617,estj,"Well Ne would save her from the Fi-Si loop. Which is us going into our thoughts and feelings about things that have happened and staying disconnected from other people. It's us going into our shells. Being alone isn't bad but being stuck on the past and our feelings is scary. We become completely helpless, and someone who is like that would find it almost impossible to focus and help others. Ne is what would save them from that. Being able to think about other perspectives, and get out of this dangerous place to think about the future and hope. So someone in a Fi-Si loop would disregard their extroverted functions which sounds like your mother. 
The reason I asked about your father is because I assumed he didn't have a strong Ne. So an ISTJ made sense. He sounds great and it's good that you had at least one parent to help. "
618,estj,"My motivation, my drive. I must find ways in compelling myself  through difficult times. My everyday revolves around the desire to maintain a level of progression in all aspects including friends, family, studies and career. "
619,estj,"Like the title says, my manager seems very strongly ESTJ. She is a good boss, but as an ESFP myself we are just very different. Accidentally finding her MTBI type makes me feel like I stumbled upon a manual for improving my work performance infinitely.
She is going through some very tough times emotionally, and I am beginning to think she is going to work with the persistence of a freight train regardless of what happens in her personal life. Any advice for how I can make this easier for her? "
620,estj,"Thanks, I appreciate the advice. I have accepted that sitting down and dishing emotionally isn't in the cards. So far I've tried to get my work done more timely and reliably so that she has fewer distractions. "

Eventually a large sum of samples will render the factor insignificant, but I'd suggest that my result being taken out for the time being and be reintroduced into it if and when more samples are available."
628,estj,"Has anybody dated an INFJ? That's me, and my super wonderful other half is an ESTJ. I'm trying and calling at communicating with him, and showing him I'm sincere, and if anybody has any advice on this dynamic I'd greatly appreciate your insight....
EDIT: FIGURED SOMETHING OUT
On the off chance that this might help anybody in a similar situation, we've figured out that verbal communications regarding feelings, love etc just don't work for us. We often don't understand each other because we have different meanings associated with the same words. But, if we both shut up for a second and try and get our points across non-verbally (body language, touch, facial expression) we seem to understand one another.
Now if I can just get myself to shut my damn mouth once in a while.... "
629,estj,"You didn't provide a lot of contextual information so I'll try to help:
Not sure if I'm the best to give advice, but me (ESTJ) dated my GF (INFJ) for three years... and she's now my EX. What worked extremely well for us together was planning trips. Whether it was international or one town over, we really enjoyed the planning process. Also, whenever we did hands on/active stuff like a dance class or painting or a hike that was awesome. With your SO being extroverted, they'll feel most comfortable surrounded by a lot of people. I really struggled when we spent days and nights in with just Netflix and she was the only person I really talked to that day. Communication on how we feel is always hard for the ESTJ because we're typically baffled by emotions, including our own and we have a tough time expressing how we feel since the basis of emotions comes across as irrational. I'd recommend expressing your sincerity with actions over emotional words because we don't pick up on words as easily, nor will we express it as outwardly. Maybe build that emotional connection by doing things over emotional conversation?
Anyhow, here's some practical ways to improve things:
-Plan a trip
-Try a sport together
-Do an activity involving logic and puzzles, like an escape room or scavenger hunt
-Bake them dessert with a cute message (cuz it's direct!)
-Try double dating
-Be vocally direct about what you want since we suck at reading emotions
-Try developing yourself so you're their most logical choice for a partner (ie explore their interests and make their hobbies your hobbies, convey how your plan for the future compliments their plan for the future, try to mesh better with their friends, try to come off as ambitious)

Having meaningful, intelligent conversations will mean more to them than Words of Affirmation 

‚Äã
Yeah that's what I got, maybe the other ESTJs will step in with valuable stuff or correct me "
630,estj,"That was extremely helpful, thank you! I find that my habit of asking if he wants me to cook him breakfast /dinner, or asking what I can do to help him get ready for his day, is ineffective simply because he's my superman and won't cop to wanting any help or wanting anything done, so that it's better if I just do it instead of asking if he'd like it. Does that sound right? I'm just worried I'll do the wrong thing and make things worse instead of easier. Ie, making dinner when what he really needed was his clothes from the dryer folded and put away"
631,estj,"I don't think you should be worried. Although maybe clothes need to be put away, dinner also has to happen. You're still making practical contributions to the household and that's a huge deal. Not because you're ""useful,"" but since you both (I've assumed) feel a sense of duty to each other. Are you better than him at any skills? If so, I'd continue to develop them. Not only will he be impressed and proud, but he'll have something to brag about to his friends.  Back when we were dating, I loved bragging about my ex not only because it was another thing I could be proud of and excited about, but it low-key inflated my ego without outwardly showing it."
632,estj,"Sister in law is estj f and I am ENTP m and am trying to understand the funk between us that‚Äôs been going on for over 13 years.  She‚Äôs very judgmental and controlling, she‚Äôs into Utah Mormon social norms and culture and I‚Äôm from Portland and very artistic and intellectual and confusing to social norm types and am uncontrollable.  I find myself just as confused by her, confused by her sexuality and subtleties....so....do any of you have any ENTP connections?  Wtf??!"
633,estj,"Tell her that her arguments are bullshit, she's not seeing the bigger picture, and she improperly formatted the structure of her everything. She'll freak out, and the problems will be magically resolved."
634,estj,"We've been happily married for almost 2 years now. I've noticed she enjoys when I get a head-start on the chores.
I'm struggling to make decisions on what we should do and the details, especially to surprise her, because I'm too afraid she'll dislike, not so much my initiative, but what we actually do.
Any suggestions? About that or not. Anything will be helpful!"
635,estj,"Oh I relate to that! It's hard to always be the planner. My favorite thing about my best friend is that she'll take the reigns for me on vacations. Really you can't screw this up, you know what she likes by now and the sentiment goes such a long way, just make sure she has no prior obligations the day you want to treat her :)"
636,estj,"Infj dating an ESTJ man for the second time here. First ESTJ was the love of my life but it didn't work out. This second one, I could tell he was ESTJ the moment I met him. I don't know if I like him as much as the first one yet, but we'll seeee.
Sorry, totally not addressing your questions... just glad there are INFJs with ESTJs! Yay for happy marriage!"
637,estj,"ENFJ married to an ESTJ here! And I know planning the details can be so tricky, that's usually his department and he's so good at it. I know my husband's favorite dates are often the more unusual ones like a trip to the museum or going to play laser tag, so I try to surprise him with outings like that when I can. Or my favorite date night regardless of type is to surprise her with dinner then have some kind of interactive dessert like chocolate fondue or something you bake together (with everything pre-measured so it goes quickly) so you have something engaging to get conversation going :)"
638,estj,"INFJ dating an ESTJ and at at least my experience is that he is not shy at all about voicing his opinions about something, even if I disagree. It's a wonderful thing, because at least for me it is paramount that I don't influence anyone to be or do anything they are not on board with, as long as they're not close-minded (which he is not).
I say go ahead and voice your opinions as often as you have them, and then simply follow with the logic behind why you think/feel a certain way. The Te is very receptive to ideas as long as they are argued well.
Also what comes to surprises, trust your intuition and knowledge of her. I bet she would love nothing more than to know that you had the confidence, knowledge, and the will to do something for her that is clearly something only you could've known to do. Even if it ends up not being the exact thing they like, they will likely appreciate the effort and thought and organizing abilities above the actual results."
639,estj,"Honest, direct communication about any issues you have is really important with ESTJs. This type doesn't like to be surprised in that way, by emotional problems you've left undisclosed for too long. Talk and write to each other a lot. Also, don't be late and don't miss a scheduled date. And schedule your dates! "
640,estj,"She wants us to do stuff together, but doesn't seem to want (or take the time) to plan it. She's working a lot, so she doesn't quite have to energy for planning our ""dates"" an such. So that kind of decision"
641,estj,"From my experience, ESTJs actually loves chill time. Especially the ones that work a ton. My ESTJ significant others always liked to just go to a nice relaxing place, maybe a scenic place or a chill bar, and sit and spend time. Good convos were always appreciated. "
642,estj,"I LIKE to accomplish things. Also I like to be on top of the socio-economic hierarchy. 
I am not sure about your friend, but at least in socionics LSE's are (amongst other things) known to be the ""Grinders""."
643,estj,"I‚Äôm good at getting things done and I like the feeling of satisfaction when I check things off the list. I like my coworkers, so work is social for me.
I don‚Äôt like taking vacations, partially because I hate the idea of making someone else‚Äôs week harder so I can sit home in my pajamas. I worry they‚Äôll find the added work overwhelming or screw it up. And I worry that I‚Äôll like doing nothing so much better and it‚Äôll make going back to work massively depressing. 
I‚Äôve taken singular days off throughout the year, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve taken consecutive days off since last October."
644,estj,"I love what I do for work, and the long hours don‚Äôt bother me. I put in 60-70 hours a week because I find my work stimulating, challenging, and exciting... and I‚Äôm good at it. Sales is a competitive line of work and I like putting in more work (and thus achieving better results) than my peers."
645,estj,"I hate working. I would love to stay at home and potter around the house but i work because i have priorities and responsibilities also i get a kick out of knowing that if i didnt go to work, someone else would screw up and it would take me twice as long to get it back to order when i returned. 
I work from 8am to 4pm, and at around 430-5 sometimes 5.30-6 my boss is like ""why are you still here belindaberry!, go home"". I literally cannot leave without finishing what i started. The last holiday i took was sept last year and I always feel guilty when i call in sick."
646,estj,"late to the party but i fucking love my job.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.
i'd rather be working, or prepping something for work. I'm always thinking about work. CONSTANTLY. and i work for myself so there's ""no reason"" to stop except that taxing thing called a social life.  "
647,estj,"Wow, for months! Lol. Do you realize normal person has like 2-3 weeks of vacation tipe depending on a  country and months without a break is nothing extraordinary.
Knowning that months without a break sounds wow to you says a lot about your type (lazy millenial, lol)"
648,estj,Depends on what estj you are I am estj 3w2 and yes I love working on things. Accomplishment is good like other people said. I also like community service type work. The only time I don‚Äôt like work is burnout.
649,estj,"I‚Äôm an ESTJ and work hard because work is such a large chunk of my time that I may as well have a good time with it. This means being competent, valuable and a positive influence on my workplace. If I was to be crap at my job, I‚Äôd honestly have a hard time seeing the purpose of life (unless I tried something else). But ESTJ‚Äôs are long term thinkers, and I want a career. I want momentum and reliability. Also the thought of taking time off, and things changing (someone else learnt your role, social dynamics shift) also gives me a sense of lack of control. I wouldn‚Äôt want to come back and be behind either. 
I think ESTJ‚Äôs work hard because they big-picture care about the amount of time their working life will take up of their lives."
650,estj,"And how many ESTJs for for 90 days straight wothout single weekend (or not) day off? 1%? 2%? You take one example and generalize as a trend.
But of course ESTJs like to work more than other types, because it is effective/adds to the GDp of society and is beneficial in other ways. "
651,estj,"I really enjoy her company she's about 5 years older than me but very cute, smart and great to be around. I just don't know how to go about it because she seems to get so nervous she actually acts up.. I'm confused"
652,estj,"We were on our way to hang out with some new friends and she unintentionally started to drive pretty wreckless and taking corners way to fast xD maybe she was trying to impress me or something? Then at the party she seemed to be trying to impress me dancing lol.. last night I asked if she wanted to come over and hang out with me one of her friends and her friends boyfriend and she never answered then her friend called her and she was being very weird on the phone then just stopped answering.
I feel like either she doesn't like me or she's very nervous xD I don't wanna just be like oh well because if she's just nervous I'd feel bad.   But it she doesn't like me I don't even know her that well and it wouldn't hurt me one bit x)"
653,estj,"She definitely is im sure of it but, eh she's to conservative I don't think we'd work. I feel like she'd hold me back, I need the freedom to explore change. I'm a liberal rebel and she's a conservative teacher."
654,estj,"We don‚Äôt control like that. 
Grew up with a very conservative dad who doesn‚Äôt give too shits what I chose to believe politically. Didn‚Äôt care what we believed in regarding religion either. 
I have plenty of friends across the political spectrum. 
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre just bad to describing people but I‚Äôm still not convinced you‚Äôre dealing with an ESTJ"
655,estj,I kissed her and she said that she just wanted to be friends because I seem like her dad and her mom walks all over her dad. She doesn't want to be like that... I feel like it's a test but I'm kinda having second thoughts about it :/
656,estj,"ESTJs do not like people who don‚Äôt have a backbone and let others walk all over them. 
My ENFP friend of 13 years was always like that and I felt like she just wanted to please everyone and I got so sick and tired of it that I just ended the friendship. 
Not saying all ENFPs are like that but so many of them hate conflict and would rather just keep the peace. And ESTJs are nothing like that. They‚Äôd rather you get angry and hash it out then to just hide from all your problems. 
It‚Äôs doubtful that she‚Äôd change her mind. Or that you could change so much in such a short period of time."
657,estj,nah I'm going to hold it against her now we're still friends and now that I understand that's she's not one of those annoying super sensitive sensors I'm going to tease the fuck out of her and own myself like the selfish tyrant I am xD
658,estj,"I'm split on objective reality, we can't really know, we might never know. I'll default to a belief that there is no objective reality until I find some rational for it to exist beyond subjective perception.
Moral Objectivism I do not follow, but I think it has a certain allure."
659,estj,"Yes and yes. 
Even if reality was an illusion, it's still better to act as if it's a real and measurable thing.
Given the assumption of an objective reality an objective morality can be deduced from that."
660,estj,"I've been following this group for a while now, and it's incredibly quiet here.
Why do you think that is?  Is this a quirk of the ESTJ type that realizes that online interaction isn't all that great, or is there something else?"
661,estj,"Im infj. My dad is estj. I don't know about other estjs but my dad would think its a waste of time to analyse himself and talk about his personality. In his opinion, he is what he is. Done. When he goes online, its to read interesting articles that he can talk about to his multitude of friends and sound knowledgable, or to look at cars/boats/bikes, or to watch funny videos and laugh obnoxiously loud. He is very interesting to analyse for me, though, and i love him. "
662,estj,"I am an ESTJ and am very interested in this stuff. Ive taken the test 4 times over 7 or 8 years and am always ESTJ, I answer honestly, and agree with about 80 percent of the analysis... my question is why does EVERYONE on the relationship page despise ESTJ...? Ive been fortunate with dating, and tend to gravitate towards NFs. my current and last girlfriends were and are INFJ and ENFP.. curious as to why this is"
663,estj,"Personal experience, ESTJs usually hate this stuff. They don't want somebody telling them what they think they already know. Obviously not all of them, but generally speaking. Te/Si makes for a pretty stubborn person."
664,estj,"I can tell you with certainty that I'm not, my dad doesn't even know reddit exists. But if your daughter is infj and you're estj then rest assured she is really lucky to have you to bring her back to reality and as an example of what confidence, hard work, responsibility and standing up for yourself looks like."
665,estj,"my dad is estj too, I am infp. I love my dad too. now that he's almost 60 and less angry haha, loving him is simple. Yea my dad would not be interested in exploring his personality, he has a routine and things that need to be done. He thinks online communication is largely a waste of time."
666,estj,"I've never ghosted, it is a very immature way of avoiding confrontation. 
That being said, I have confronted guys who ghosted me and felt no shame in doing so.  You're an adult, a grown ass adult, and if you can't handle telling someone you aren't interested, I will absolutely confront you about it.
I have a really hard time when I'm not given closure, I just sit and wonder what the hell happened, and I'm aware I was ghosted, but I usually want answers.  And a few of the guys who did ghost me, came back as if nothing had happened, I absolutely gave them a piece of my mind.  "
667,estj,"I've been dating someone for a year (no relationship label but we each aren't seeing anyone else) and besides him always being very busy with full-time work and military commitments, things had been okay. I last saw him/heard from him almost 3 weeks ago when he dropped off a Valentine's Day gift. 
I admitted to him that I was falling for him. A few days later when I asked if he'd like to see me, he said he was busy with work for the next two days. That is the last I've heard from him. Initially, I asked if he wanted to come stay over. Then I asked if he needed space. It's been 3 weeks. He has dropped all communication. Not responding to my calls, no texts-- nothing. If he were caught off guard by my admission, I understand and I'd even be okay if he said it's not going to work out. Something is better than nothing, which is why I always believed they (at least with my ESTJ) were direct. I feel like I've just been ghosted.
I have reached out a couple of times letting him know that he's hurt me by disappearing the way he did and if he were so busy, I'd understand but I just wanted to be sure he was okay. After what appears as intentional ignoring on his part, yesterday I text that this was my final message, it wouldn't work out for me and whatever this was is done. No response.
I understand very much that ESTJs get busy and even avoid  ""emotional"" talks, but I don't understand this behavior. Am I overreacting for feeling so bad?  Thank you. - ISFJ"
668,estj,"The ESTJ I've been getting to know is very upfront about his thoughts on ghosting: he doesn't want others to do it to him, and he won't do it to them. He has told me that if he meets someone he'd prefer to pursue, he will tell me (or whoever else) honestly that he'd like to stay friends but the flirty gestures will have to stop. And that's what he'd want me to do as well. 
He says he does something called ""go dark"" which is not quite as rude as ghosting per se... if he's interested in someone specifically but things aren't official yet, he'll respond to others but not initiate with them. And he's a pretty consistent initiator, at least in the beginning."
669,estj,"Honestly, this is surprising ESTJ behavior. 
I can't see an ESTJ being bothered by you being upfront and honest, they tend to love that, really love that.  
I have a few friends in the military and they sometimes drop off the face of the earth for a while, but I've always been given fair warning.  
We can get caught up with work, because it usually tends to be very important to us, and sometimes we need our space, but ghosting your entirely doesn't seem to make any sense.  
But I'm going to say this, if it's been a year, you should be able to sit down and have a talk about where the relationship is at.  A year is a long time to be talking to someone  or in your words (dating them) and not having any sort of official relationship talk.  "
670,estj,"I've always had the ability to remember very small details about someone, it's usually unintentionally. So I've always used it in a way to show others I care. 
I think Most ESTJs would agree that they show they care by doing, more than any other love language, so an ESTJ is going to remember your favorite drink/food and your birthday, or a favorite activity, and they are going to use that in a way that shows others they care. 
I also really like tradition, and not for dumb shit like religion or politics, but more for little things. 
Every year for xmas my family does the same dinner and then I purchase a game for the whole family to play for that night. It started with my mom doing it for all the kids but one year she stopped buying games and that was always my favorite thing so I brought it back. The rest of the family enjoys it, my mom just didn't realize how much I loved it and wanted to keep doing it. 
I personally like creating little traditions for a lot of things. My roommate and I started doing Karaoke every Thursday night. I also had a tradition with an old roommate where we would make homemade french fries and watch netflix at least once a week. 
Those little things are always my absolute favorite and it has more to do with the other person than actually liking french fries or karaoke.  My day could be shitty but I always have something to look forward too.  
I order the same drinks at the same coffee shops because I like what I drink but I also love seeing the baristas and building relationships with those people. Same with restaurants, ordering the same thing. 
I'm someone who knows that every person I interact with on a regular basis is someone worth getting to know. I'm not just networking for my own advantage, I'm doing it because I like people and if I'm going to want to use you as a recommendation or a way to get a promotion or something else, I want it to feel authentic. So I listen. I listen and I watch. And I pick up on your habits, and when you mention a like or a dislike, I'm going to remember it. I want to make sure I have people to reach out to if I need help, but I also will always help others when they need it. Networking isn't just about making sure I have people, but also making sure these are people I can go to to help others. 
Honestly, the simplest way you could describe Si Fi in my life is that I am a very intentional person. I'm not a random person, 99% of the time there is a reason behind what I am doing. The little details in an ESTJs life, are actually big details, it's just not as obvious.
‚Äã
‚Äã"
671,estj,"with ESTJs, what you see is usually what you get. I think she could've been cold because she was tired or deep in concerns (ESTJs worry a lot and therefore get a lot done to avoid having to worry again). As others advised, I think the best to approach an ESTJ is with direct questions without sounding like you're disrespecting them or accusing them of something. They're very honest!"
672,estj,"I'm an ESTJ female, and from my personal experience I'd say her behavior sounds pretty normal. I enjoy being cuddly and demonstrative, but when I don't feel like it, it just shuts off. It doesn't mean anything is wrong.
She used the term ""poker face"" to describe the demonstrative ""shutting off"" but I think that's a little misleading: a poker face insinuates there's something hiding behind the expressionless exterior, but I doubt that's the case. She's probably just thinking about other stuff.
That's one nice thing about ESTJs, if they're upset with you or have a bone to pick they'll confront you with it. We're not into (or good at) mind-games and nuance. Unless she tells you otherwise, I think you can assume things are ok."
673,estj,"Hello ESTJs nice to meet you all! I have a step-father and suspect he may be an ESTJ. He's well into his retirement and I wondered if any of you on here were retired or might be able to comment on your experiences with other retired ESTJs.
The reason for asking is that primarily he's lazy and I thought ESTJs weren't lazy! I wondered if it was just down to age though. He does contribute and stick his nose into what others are doing almost in the supervisory sense (as I would expect) but generally just sits about and falls asleep in his chair! :P
In addition to this, while I can 'get along' with him, this can apparently only be accomplished by direct effort on my part. He is unable to see the world from my point of view and is very set in his ways. 
He also doesn't ever play the feeling card; is this typical even of an older ESTJ? Does Fi not develop and manifest later in life to the point where  he might be able to reflect sympathetically on a person or situation? Is it just him?"

Did you agree with the description? I just read it, and it seems like a pretty standard online description of ESTJs, but I know personally that I don't usually agree with the generic online description of ESTJs. Thoughts?"
677,estj,"Fits pretty well, I agree with most descriptions of the ESTJ type to an extent. Your inquisitiveness is pretty high for an ESTJ, looks more like the intuitive function opposed to sensing - could be why you don't usually agree with descriptions."
678,estj,"I've considered being an ENTJ in the past, I usually get xNTJ on the dichotomy tests, but I don't relate to Ni at all, Si is far more reflective of my automatic thought process. Ne is a possibility, but I relate far more with Te than any other function, so the only possibility is Si followed by Ne. Cognitive function tests usually give me ESTJ (I've gotten ENTJ once or twice). If I'm any kind of intuitive at all, I'd be an ENFP, but I doubt that. If I were an ENTJ, I would have to completely misunderstand how Ni works.
There are a few ESTJ descriptions I agree with, and it's usually the ones that just don't say anything that would contradict enjoying philosophy and such. "

Come join us today! https://discord.gg/FssPveq
(And I apologize for this being the third server advertisement in a row - but we'll really appreciate your Te presence)."
680,estj,"Why should I join your Discord server over the Discord servers advertised in the previous two posts here? I'm already part of a couple servers, what makes this one stand out?
Sorry for the mini-interrogation, but I swear at least a third of this subreddit is just INJs advertising Discords and INPs complaining that ESTJs (AKA anyone they dislike) have terrorized them their entire life. I'm not kidding, someone actually said that to me. I'm just being salty."
681,estj,"What did 'we' do? Told them, that their parasitic lifestyle is not appropriated?  That they have to do chores too? That they should stop procrastinating in the hope someone else does their obligations?
Usually I would take pride in this, but I don't pad myself for things I haven't done."
682,estj,"Thank you for asking this question - I‚Äôm sorry about what those INxPs had to say, as it was certainly insensitive and based on stereotypes. I also wish this sub could be more active and have more input from ESTJs, but it seems like they‚Äôre all hanging out over at /r/ENTJ.  
With regards to your question, and without deriding the other two servers (that‚Äôs illegal): our server aims to be an area for serious typology discussion and a tight-knit community with fair, effective and community-oriented moderation.   
While most servers share similar goals, we do so by strictly regulating the quality and content of the server - shitposting is frowned upon outside their regulated channels and rules are enforced as fairly as possible.

Stereotyping, type-based discrimination and ‚Äùshittymbti‚Äù (much like those INxPs did earlier) are not tolerated here.  
Finally, we choose to maintain and facilitate a warm server atmosphere through our casual/voice chats, server games and zero-tolerance policy towards harassment and trolling. Our server admins pride ourselves in maintaining the standards elaborated above as opposed to making empty promises.   
Sorry for producing a wall of text, but I hope it addresses your questions."
683,estj,"Don't forget /r/ENTP! For all those ESTJs who are just, like, so totally random! ^^/s
But in all seriousness, thanks for the thoughtful response, I'll check it out."
684,estj,"You're welcome, and honestly your question is an important one that will reveal the quality of the server and its admins. Also, apparently ESTJs most often mistype as ENTP because of tertiary Ne acting out alongside intuitive bias in MBTI communities.
Welcome to the server - sorry if it's a bit quiet during the weekend."
685,estj,"I went on a date with an ESTJ man, whom I liked after our first meeting. He seemed to like me, too, as we chatted often via text. 
The thing is, he'a only asked me to hang out with him in presence of his friends, which I find really bothersome. I like to hang out one-on-one, at least in the beginning stage of getting to know someone. I do sense that he likes me, but I'm wondering if I'm just mistaken. 
Any thoughts, ESTJ men?"
686,estj,"He probably doesn't know you want to be alone. I know I would be eager to show my friends the girl I was dating. He's probably proud of you or wants you to see him in his element with his friends. Personally, one on one interactions make me nervous, and I am way more comfortable in group interaction. Maybe he's worried about how he'll come across one on one."
687,estj,"Thanks for your reply. One question: I've dated an ESTJ before and he was very very direct and forward with himself. Would you say this is the case with you too? And most other ESTJ men?
This guy is definitely a force of nature but not sure romantically..."
688,estj,"Yes. Being direct saves time and effort. Also, its a key part of our personality and therefore it would be something that would continue.
And he might not be because of other factors. But his ""force of nature"" personality will probably come out in other ways in your relationship. "
689,estj,"I'm an INFJ who dated an ESTJ, and he wanted me to tell him what I wanted in the sack.  I don't feel comfortable with being super explicit, so that became a problem despite our chemistry.  I have a hard time predicting what I'm going to enjoy; what I like about take-charge people is their bold creativity, shall we say.
How did it work out with your ESTJ love interest?"
690,estj,"Thanks for posting!
The boyfriend I loved the most and had the most physical attraction to was an ESTJ. We broke up three years ago and I was heartbroken for a long time. The ESTJ in this discussion was someone I went on dates with. Nothing ended up happening but just last week, he started texting again. He probably thinks I'm not direct enough with my romantic interest, but I think it's because I'm not too interested anymore. What threw me off a little is how direct and vocal he is about all his achievements, which I really do admire, but was kind of off-putting. I'm not sure how where it's go but no sparks yet :/"
691,estj,"So I just read your new comments and when I read your sentence about ""take-charge with bold creativity"" bit- I literally said oh my god. 
THAT describes my former INFJ completely. My INFJ was my first sexual relationship and I was her 5+. Yet, she still expected me to take charge and tell her what I wanted. I had no idea what I wanted. I just figured out what sex was. We were happiest in the bedroom as I learned what I liked and told her and then made her do what I wanted. "
692,estj,"Wow, I bet she had fun. :)
I'm among the world's foremost slackers, so no ESTJ would put up with me in a real relationship.  I met mine in an S&M club; we just enjoyed the best things about our chemistry and that's as far as it went. Maybe it would have turned into more, but he was righteously pissed that at the time I was monogamy-challenged (odd given the setting; you can't explain that). Still, he was 10/10 as a Dom. 
It was so weird how hard it was to talk about anything with each other since I'm basically a houseplant (writer/artist/new-age-flake, but it doesn't make money) and he's an international businessman.  It was neat, if daunting, to have a peek into the life of a person who might as well be from another planet as far as our perceptions of reality and values are concerned.  I have a lot of respect for you guys."
693,estj,"I'll be honest. There may be attraction but my ex and I were archetypal of our types. We had chemistry and passion but you can't build a successful relationship/family/future with that (And that is the quintessential ESTJ goal). I think that it would take a very patient, independent, externally stoic INFJ to deal with a strong ESTJ. 
I'll be honest- I would not recommend such a relationship. I think the NF-ST is too large of a gap. "
694,estj,"Thank you for your honest comment! Well noted. And reflecting back on my own relationship with one, I definitely see you points. I still respect and am attracted to a lot of ESTJ qualities... Hahaha
Could you maybe elaborate on a major struggle with your INFJ? For instance mine was his temper strides (from perfectionism) vs. my lack of tactful communication. We were young, but it really was my most valued relationship. "
695,estj,"Thanks! It's been fun exchanging comments with you. Shame the subreddit isnt more active because I have really enjoyed it. 
But I absolutely agree on a few points. We were also young and for me, it was my most valued relationship. 
Major struggles with my INFJ mainly revolved around two spheres of control; home life & our relationship.
ESTJ's value almost nothing more than a stable, clean, functional, logical and well-run home. We have the spreadsheet with amortized home maintenance and never need a shopping list for household needs. I cannot function if I come home to a house that isn't working. 
She also felt that the relationship needed constant work- like a military fighter plane that flies for 2 hours and needs 22 hours of maintenance to get it back in the air. To me, the perfect relationship just works. Much like my house. 
My INFJ was an only child to older parents and while I don't seek to stereotype, she was not really into the whole household needs to work thing. 
It's interesting that you mentioned tactful communication. Tact is something I was always accused of missing with my INFJ. She was very sensitive and I have the bluntness of a rampaging rhino. I don't mince words or have little patience for ignorance/illogical people/processes. I thought that my role as her best friend/boyfriend meant I did not have to be sensitive- my intent was never cruel.
Oh goodness, I could keep going. But I think I will let you respond first."
696,estj,"Aww, I'm also bummed that the ESTJ subreddit isn't as active as the INFJ one. hahaha. I'm guessing you guys are busy running your lives in the real world. 
Man, thanks for sharing the details! It's funny because I really was amazed by my ESTJ ex-boyfriend's ability to run things so efficiently. He valued time and could work a ton without getting tired. He literally felt like a... rock to me. Hahaha. So I get that you prefer the stable, clean, functional home. 
I think the point about INFJs wanting constant work towards a ""better relationship"" is so true. I think a part of it is our natural tendency to see holes or room for improvement in a relationship, so we end up putting a lot of pressure on the significant other. I'm at fault for doing this, too. Got much better, though, after each relationship! Haha.. ESTJs are superb at going up and up in their jobs while INFJs focus a lot more on those relationship nuances and whatnot. 
""Bluntness of a rampaging rhino"" LOL!! I literally laughed out loud because I know exactly what you're describing. It's kind of adorable sometimes because some of the things that my ESTJ ex-boyfriend would become a ""rhino"" for, I wouldn't even catch in my radar. He did hurt me a bit with his words sometimes, but I knew they were never ill-intended. He just tended to be like a frat boy for the most part - it was the culture of his personality.
Do you feel like other ESTJs are very similar to you? How have your other relationships with other types been like?
Thanks again!"
697,estj,"I know this thread is months old, but it was very interesting to read this.  I'm an INFJ who was raised by an ESTJ, and a well-run household was definitely an obsession of hers.  Everything was spotless, and I was in charge of keeping it that way.  I found it oppressive at the time, but now that I'm married to an absolute slob of an ESTP, I appreciate her point of view much more.  Children tend to lack perspective about what things look like when no one's taking care of business.
It's neat to see the way these things play out."
698,estj,"hey. 
Im new to all this but wanted to get some advice really. Im an estj female in my 30s and have been seeing a entp man for just over 6 months. although its fairly new, the relationship grew quickly and we are exclusive. Neither of us tend to just jump into relationships so i hope that helps understand how quickly we bonded. Like he will often talk about our future, having children, etc. Basically planning ahead for the future including meeting his mum in nyc and i've just spent xmas with his family who have never met a previous gf before as he has been single 10 years. However, on the other hand, was very weird at the start about even holding hands in public, going to his place, going on dates, etc although he spends like 3-4 days of the week at my house.  
‚Äã
Anyways, I mentioned to this entp that i really don't like lying and whatever happens always tell me the truth. I felt he was doing this at the very start which was great, then started to feel like he started telling me half-truths or not being fully honest about things. He is pretty secretive about thing too as he considers himself 'private'. I have noticed some holes in some of the stories he would tell me. I also noticed he was flirting and chatting to some girls over FB messenger but lying about it or saying that they have been friends for years (although i know for a fact they haven't). The last convo he has with one girl was asking her 'what her type is' to be her matchmaker but i dont feel he had any intensions of being a matchmaker and just wanted to get some sort of ego boost or know if he was her type.
I feel pretty uncomfortable about all this as i'm very very honest and loyal. I have tried to discuss my boundaries in general and why these are important to me prior to all of this happening so i almost feel hurt by this behaviour as its overstepping my boundaries. I was just wondering if there where any ENTPS do similar things, should i be concerned, and if you have any advice for me?
I really don't want to end up in a situation where I have invested in further to this relationship to find out a few years down the line i've been messed around. "
699,estj,"I'm 27 F ESTJ and this reads NOPE NOPE NOPE.
RED FLAG
Asking if other ENTPs behave like this is just trying to find an excuse to write his behavior off when deep down you don't think it's okay.
Sit this man down and tell him he is either exclusive or he isn't. You are older, you are an adult whose time isn't going to be wasted by someone who isn't looking for the same things as you are. 
I get that there is this period of time where you haven't decided if you're exclusive, but at some point, it needs to be discussed. If someone was spending multiple nights a week at my house but still wanted to flirt with other girls over messenger, I would be pretty ticked off. 
And please don't let people try and convince you that because you didn't talk about exclusivity that it's still somehow okay for him to behave that way. Without having the conversation you knew you reached a point where you were going to be loyal and just talk to him. You chose to be exclusive with him. In my opinion, at 2-3 months of spending multiple nights at each other's places, you have reached that point of exclusiveness where talking to other girls/guys would be questionable behavior. 
He sounds like he's afraid of commitment. So sit down and talk with him and say that his behavior is questionable and you aren't about to have your time wasted so he either needs to be more open with you or it's done. "
700,estj,"Copy and paste this to r/ENTP 
I would like to answer this but im really bad at relationship advice. Being a ENTP myself I have FI trickster which makes me unaware of the good and bad in situations. Also being logical doesn't help to much here. The most I could say is just be truthful and confront him sutley he might be unaware of the situation like me or something else. If you present him with true or false questions he is likely to understand.
https://youtu.be/4gj-khTW2Mg"
701,estj,"Being an ENTP, would suggest you just talk to him about what being exclusive with you means. Let him know what he needs to do if he intends to keep you .  Tell him he needs to be truthful. Obviously you are important to him so he needs to know your limits."
702,estj,"{I saw you posted this twice and felt that if you ever delete the previous one I'd at least have my comment here too, excuse the extra notifications}
Aight I'm an ESTJ too who'd pretty much never cheat who's loyal and honest and blabla. 
You're dating an ENTP, aka a person with superego Fi, the ENTP will unlikely care that what they're doing is wrong since they often do not have any values or rules thanks to NeFe, their dominant and tertiary function.
NeFe: There's so much to do in this world! Everyone could do anything they want! As long as I'm seen nicely, that's all what matters!
But what the ENTP forgets is that they have inferior Si, aka a poor focus to details, they could get so caught up in their ideas and world of possibilities that they forget what they once were saying, they don't notice how inconsistent their lies get. And as long as the person they're talking to doesn't notice or doesn't call them out, the ENTP feels confident in what they're saying.
In order to avoid these types of moments, the ENTP might just try to make everything they say sound super vague. This way when they're stuck, they say that at least they didn't lie. This is a bubble easy to pop, just keep asking questions and force them to be as clear as possible. Then they got the chance to either own up or may end up lying like pussies. (I alwaus saw Fe as a pussy function)
Superego Fi is pretty damn annoying, you could read more about if here https://www.instagram.com/p/BlNWasng7vh/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=14qrtb5x8mlfx
Force the ENTP to be more honest before the relationship gets meh, don't leave them space to be wishy washy, make them open up to you and learn more about their insecurities. Maybe if he opens up to you, he may be more honest. So yeah. Good luck."
703,estj,"I am ENTP and other ENTPs are known for their flexibility with all the other types. Why? Because we live and let live mostly and most of the time. We don‚Äôt have grand schemes or specific plans for specific people in our lives and we do NOT want to manage anyone or plan their days and weeks and months and years for them. ENTPs want to just drift in the river of life having only a destination (pillars in their life like education, job, marriage, kids, house, pool, etc). Other than that, ENTPs don‚Äôt like plans and don‚Äôt like to be controlled by someone else‚Äôs plans. 
ENTPs do NOT flirt with others although it can appear so. They are actually making conversation and trying to be interesting. That‚Äôs it! ENTPs will come off to people who don‚Äôt know them as flirting, but they won‚Äôt even notice that. You can read about that in many articles online. 
I think that you know that about your ENTP already. Also, I think that you came here to the ESTJ forum to look for reassurance from other ESTJs to help give you a push for the decision you already made. 
You and your ENTP will have some problems down the road about plans, management, taking control of your lives, and wanting the ENTP to follow your rules and guidelines. They wouldn‚Äôt. Even if they pretended and promised they would. They still wouldn‚Äôt. 
If you love him enough and if he loves you enough then you two CAN make it work. Try to look the other way when he improvise things as he goes. And tell him to do some important things the way you want him to do it. I think it could work like that. "
704,estj,"As an ENTP, I would say that my primary gripe with ESTJ's is their rigidity and inflexibility.  They can often be oriented toward the black and white type of thinking - ""It either happened or it didn't""...and as someone who can be fragmented and outside the box, I despise being interrogated or judged to be lying because it doesn't all flow in a neat straight line.  I would suggest gaining his trust in the way of being open to the way his mind works and making him not feel like you are going to interrogate and judge every thing he says with a need to make a judgement at the end.  Just as you express wanting to trust him, he needs to trust you.  He also needs to trust that you will be open to ideas and discussions without judgement or needing to do something actionable at the end.  If you can appreciate how his ways will challenge you to think outside the box, he will probably not lie to you.  ENTP's often lie as a means for survival, from childhood we find that coming out and saying everything that is going through our heads typically ends up in being misunderstood.  We don't want to be misunderstood and misjudged."
705,estj,"We had a conversation pretty early on about being exclusive and multiple ones since about what that looks like for, my boundaries etc. Why we each see as flirting is subjective so I tried to be clear about what I saw as acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. This was obviously prior to this issue taking place. 
The conversations have been retry pg tbh and slightly flirty for him I think. But overall it‚Äôs the lying and hiding that I can‚Äôt deal with. If it‚Äôs so innocent why hide or lie about things? To me that‚Äôs when things become shady and that‚Äôs an indication of a bigger problem "
706,estj,"https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/akdl2h/entps_are_not_always_flirting_with_you/?st=JRFCP94A&sh=80277d18
Look here you ESTJs ‚òπÔ∏è! We‚Äôre not flirting with others because we‚Äôre flirting! We‚Äôre just being ourselves. "
707,estj,thanks Lucas and appreciate you trying to help. can i ask if in a relationship would you do similar things? like would you try to keep things 'private' and/or do you intentionally or not flirt with other people knowing it may upset your partner? 
708,estj,"that's the thing. I've just tried to bring it up now as a rational discussion but he is flipping out. he doesnt know I have seen what I have seen but i have mentioned a specific night where something happened that bothered me. He was at mine and i woke up sensing he wasn't asleep and saw he was messaging someone on FB messenger at 2:30am and qucikly came off it when he realised i was awake. I asked how comes he was up and he said he couldnt sleep. i then asked who he was messaging and he said he was asking how the party was that we decided not to go to that evening. He said he was messaging in a group chat but i saw it was to that girl. I thought something shady was happening so investigated. It turns out the party was that girl's and he was asking her how it was going. There was no group chat. He later deleted these messages to her and now there's a new tread up till this monday gone where she stopped replying.So i confronted him today about that night and asked why he said he was messaging in a group chat when i could see it was xxx. At first he said he didn't remember that night properly, then the story changed to he was on the group chat and realised its xxx b day so sent her a message. So i asked to see the message and thats when he flipped out. He agreed to show me later. Then admitted he deleted the messenger texts to the girl from that night but doesn‚Äôt know why, and this group chat has also magically disappeared too as he has a new phone. 
Doesn't this sound a bit shady?
I've actually read most these messages and can tell he is flirting covertly but whats most upsetting is the lies and shady behaviour"
709,estj,"These all sounds like excuses and justification for shitty behaviour. No, if you're a liar, it doesn't mean you're misunderstood. Here she's talking about how her ENTP boyfriend is possibly even flirting with other girls, how do you justify that? Oh wait no, you're complaining that it's just ESTJs who are rigid and inflexible. Don't interrogate the poor ENTP being. 
If he's brave enough to flirt with others while being in a relationship, then he deserves whatever comes to him from anger or frustration.
Also, so you need to trust the ENTP, but he needs to trust you first? How does that justify his behaviour? How does it have anything to do with his love for possibilities? Do you mean possibilities or chances of meeting other girls? 
If truths don't fit perfectly, then parts of it must be false, things either happened or they didn't, even if ""Well at least that tiny part of my story happened"", that doesn't mean anything when the full story you just said was a lie.
Since you were complaining about what you dislike in ESTJs, here's what I can't stand in ENTPs, they tend to be very wishy washy, it often seems like they're not sure of what they're saying, they are dishonest because they fear being disliked aka care so much for their image (or being judged) it hurts. 
In a relationship, one must be truthful whether they like it or not, that's the point of a relationship, otherwise break it off. If you can't be honest, own up to it and don't date anyone. It's embarassing."
710,estj,"Yeah. I totally get that. Being older I'd just cut ties. 
I also think some people just aren't meant for monogamous relationships.  And I think it's a hard thing to accept, especially with how society tends to treat them. If you wanted to you could mention that to him. Just say you really liked him but maybe he just isn't the kind of guy who is into a strictly one-on-one relationship. Tell him you understand and it's okay, but it's not what you are looking for. Sometimes people just need to be told it's okay. That it's normal to not want to settle with one person. "
711,estj,"Yes, I am quite a private person myself the reason being is because I like my independence being able to view different concepts without criticism. I  question to many things being open minded that someone who believes in a certain ideal will find it treasonous to do such a thing. In my past relationships I have broken up with one of my EXs  for unintentionally pressumed as flirting with another Ex-ex. I just happened only because my Ex-ex would call me from different numbers trying to get ahold of me to get back into a relationship with her which I had no intention of doing. I only responded to prevent it from happening more. Persistence usually gets ahold of a ENTP's attention because the NE hero just wants to be wanted just don't over do it to the point of bad manipulation. We eventually catch on then will break off the relationship like it never happened. From experience I noticed that when unintentionally flirt it looks like I am flirting and when I try to flirt I seem like a dork. Ive gotten into alot of relationships just trying to be nice or cool with the person. Mostly it being the females making a move on me. I usually just go along with it to not upset them or gain some respect from friends. Thats a aspect of the FE tertiary function. Just trying to make everyone happy. I would look into checking of he is a healthy ENTP because a healthy ENTP main virtue is Sincerity aka being Truthful and are main Vice is Insincerity  aka Lying. ENTP's are expert liars but only if they are not satisfied with their life. If they are satisfied then they will be truthful. 
I hope that helped. I would watch this youtube video on how to Social engineer a ENTP's. I really will give you insight for better results.
https://youtu.be/hLl3xoorSiI"
712,estj,"Sarah, you are an ESTJ, you know the facts, you saw exactly what happened, make sure to keep this confrontational and to keep him under your nose. At this point, his sensitivities do not matter, he is exploiting you. As soon as something happens, call him out, don't just wait. If he panics, you know he's doing something wrong because he'll try to hide it immediately and get hostile when you ask him to show you. If he ain't hiding anything as he claims, he'll show you without any problems, if not at least a little annoyed that you'd accuse him of such a thing- but well, you already know the truth, but keep this in mind.
He's shady, worthless, and petty. If my partner would ever flirt with others I'd cringe and let them know, if they need any second warnings because they somehow didn't understand what I meant by don't fucking cheat I'd just dumb them. A relationship is a relationship. That's just how it is."
713,estj,"Ok, are you open to the possibility that you just fit the description of exactly what I described in my post?  Can you see how your statements might be seen as very black and white?  Judgmental? Jumping to premature conclusions with an overtly critical and shaming disposition?
I‚Äôve been married for 14 years, my wife is as ISFJ.  I was sharing from my perspective the struggles I‚Äôve had with my relationships with ESTJs.  If he‚Äôs flat out lying or being dishonest that‚Äôs one thing, i don‚Äôt condone that.  But if it‚Äôs a matter of misunderstanding or differences in paradigm and perspective, that‚Äôs where I can help.  
And since you were being more than gratuitous in your swipes towards my type and our ‚Äúwishy washiness‚Äù let me take the opportunity to express my disdain at the estjs fundamental need to control and micro manage others.  Just because we are different in our cognitive behavioral styles doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs inferior to those who are more scheduled and routine oriented.  We kinda see you as robots, and don‚Äôt really mind it, just as long as you don‚Äôt try to superimpose that style on others and look down on those who are more in the moment and with the flow....we kind of both need each other :)"
714,estj,"But this is the thing we have spoken about these things in the past and he has said he has always wanted to have a partner. He wants to do everything with them such as build a business, raise a family, help the community, etc together. We‚Äôve spoken about stuff like what we value in that partnership and what being exclusive means to achieve that. So I‚Äôm not sure if the issue is he doesn‚Äôt want an exclusive relationship "
715,estj,"Hey, lucasmrtz, just a quick heads-up:
alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
716,estj,That‚Äôs the thing I don‚Äôt think he is a healthy entp. Growing up he was in a gang then joined the army to get away form it all. Then his ex best friend of 15 years ruined their joint business and ran away with the money. He was still dealing with the legal side of this all 3 months before I met him so I imagine this all had a massive impact on him
717,estj,"I've just tried as it is eating me up and i really find it hard to move past something unless i have an explanation or can solve it - i basically dont like mysteries and they drive me mad until i can explain them.
i've just tried to have a convo and he is almost trying to flip it on me like i'm being outrageous in even trying to address my concerns.
he doesnt know I have seen what I have seen but i have mentioned a specific night where something happened that bothered me. He was at mine and i woke up sensing he wasn't asleep and saw he was messaging someone on FB messenger at 2:30am and qucikly came off it when he realised i was awake.

It turns out the party was that girl's and he was asking her how it was going. There was no group chat. He later deleted these messages to her and now there's a new tread up till this monday going where she stopped replying.
So i confronted him today about that night and asked why he said he was messaging in a group chat when i could see it was xxx. At first he said he didn't remember that night properly, then the story changed to he was on the group chat and realised its xxx b day so sent her a message. So i asked to see the message and thats when he flipped out. Later went to show me n realised he deleted the fb messenger texts and the group that (that apparently was on WhatsApp now) also seem to have disappeared due to having a new phone. Doesn't this sound a bit shady?
I've actually read most these messages and can tell he is flirting covertly but whats most upsetting is the lies and shady behaviour"
718,estj,"Guys thanks for your support and advice. I do think estj and entp think very differently and this has its ups and downs. I recognise that we can think very black and white, are super organised, and can have the moral ground. I also recognise that these qualities can be things to learn from for an entp if they are willing and visa versa of course. You entps make me think more creatively, view the world from different angles, and be a bit more spontaneous. But both have to want to appreciate and learn from each other‚Äôs differences to become a more rounded person I think. 
However lies are lies at the end of the day. I understand the point about interrogation but he has been caught out. I have copied what I wrote up in another post to show you what I mean below. 
I've just tried to bring it up now as a rational discussion but he is flipping out. he doesnt know I have seen what I have seen but i have mentioned a specific night where something happened that bothered me.

719,estj,"So unlike you, I'ma respond to each point mentioned rather than skim over and insist that her ENTP boyfriend is just misunderstood and maybe she's just too controlling because ""she's an ESTJ"". It's going to be long.
‚Äã
Yes, I'm open to it. So before I criticize you here I'll just properly go over your previous comment.
Rigidity and inflexibility= This is not true for all ESTJs, it also depends on what they are doing. It doesn't mean that they are always this way. I am rigid and inflexible with facts, with what I know is true (and I read and research a lot, I don't just accept information or claim that ""oh that's what I grew up knowing""). An ESTJ's first function is Te, which means purely focused on facts, ""It is what it is"" is a Te quote. We got tertiary Ne, which makes us a lot more open and friendly if we want, depends on our personality. Try comparing us with ISTJs instead, those with inferior Ne, they will see a million of possibilities on what could go wrong if they ever change methods or do things ""The wrong way"". In short: We just believe in facts and that if something happened, it did.
Oh right. So it's her fault. If you were paying attention to the original post, she said that he was cheating on her. But no, he needs to trust her first? In what? In knowing that she would not break up with him if she finds out that he indeed flirted with other girls? And that even after what he did, she needs to protect his feelings by not interrogating him because poor ENTP, he may feel pressured or like she's too controlling? I didn't know ENTPs were THAT weak.
So the ENTP must be sure that Sarah will be open to his ideas without any judgement or having to dump his ass, even after he clearly was flirting with other girls and obviously that is wrong.
So @ Sarah, you gotta appreciate how his ways will challenge you to think outside of the box, he will not probably lie to you!
ESTJ girl: HA! I caught you flirting with other girls!
ENTP boy: I'm not flirting with other girls, I just discovered a method to make them feel great! You gotta think out of the box and escape your boxed mind, sweetie
Yeah right.
If I only highlighted the first sentence to reply before I got to the second part, I would've suggested that was likely a trait of pathological liars. Instead we'll read the full last part this time.
She's talking about a guy that likely is cheating on her, and not on an ENTP's lying habits (which they need to get over because lying is fucking petty and weak)
‚Äã
So what did I get wrong? Anyways now I'll continue with your second reply. And I dare you to respond the same way I did.
So yes, I'm open to it. Are my statements black and white? Yes, it either happened or it didn't, you either said it or you didn't. Am I judgmental? Yes, and so are most rational people who can see and analyse for themselves. Am I jumping to premature conclusions with an overtly critical and shaming disposition? Yes, and I have all the rights to.
First off, props to you for being married and I'm relieved to see a relationship that lasted that long, I hope it never ends. And well your conclusion on ESTJs isn't too far off, but the focus is on an ENTP who may be cheating. He is clearly dishonest from what this woman is saying. I don't see what could possibly be a misunderstanding if he has so much to hide. 
Thank you, but this is only done in projects when we want to make sure everything goes correctly, or when we see things that could be improved. ESTJs don't see a point in being quite when things could be fixed or improved. So it's not even a bad trait you're complaining about. I find that only lazy people complain about this.
No styles are inferior or superior if it's just personal style and leads to similar results. But when one is an utter failure and is lazy for no reason, then yes, their style is inferior. I'm surprisingly not one to follow a routine and the only thing closest to a schedule I'd have is a to-do list to make sure my day will go as efficiently and easily as possible. But routines do bore the hell out of me.
Aww, yeah that's more nice now. I don't think people who knew me would see me as a robot. And I don't really force anything on anyone as long as they're managing with their work, people learn with experience, though I do like sharing input to help others when it comes to work- And um, more fun facts, ESTJs have sixth function Se, which means that they are hella focused and in the moment, we notice almost everything that goes on around us. Not gonna get into explaining that because this  is way too irrelevant to what the post is actually about. But I figured I'd share some knowledge.
Anyways, focus on the context of the post and try to respond everything I said here. I want to be proven wrong. So go ahead."
720,estj,"Maybe he's in denial. Or maybe he needs to be put in a situation where he is forced to grow the fuck up. 
I'm just not the kind of person who trusts shady people like that. I am in a LDR with my bf and he lives 1500 miles away. It would be so easy to cheat on him and get away with it, but because we both understand that, we are 100% open and honest with each other. I always tell him about the friends I make in class and if I'm studying with someone. He tells me when he's out with friends at the bar and if it's just one of his female coworkers. He has a lot of friends who cheat and are scum and try and set him up and push him to cheat and he's always told me about it. And that's why I trust him. I guess he just doesn't make me worry at all. 
But all that being said, I am not someone who has any room for understanding cheaters. If he cheats and I find out, it's over, I'd drop him and never look back. 
He just sounds like a guy who wants to have his cake and eat it too. "
721,estj,"Ya on the surface level I would need to see you as correct. He gree up with gangs then the army. Usually not a good combo for ENTPs because the affiliative nuturing thst goes on strongly between gangs/armys. From experience that has pushed me to form a great lying attitude in order to form a persona that people appreciate. I actually grew up between gangs in Compton, CA and I went to military school as a teen to force a betterment into me that ultimately did not succeed. O had to move out of there to find myself. Then you say his ex best friend in joint business venture. Screwd him over. Ya that really affects us ENTP's with distrust in mankind/ human beings. I learned from my ESTJ father to not join business with friends. He went broke because he presumed it would work out really well then he ended up getting backstabbed. Now he is careful enough to not do handshake deal and is lawyered up with contracts in hand to prevent the worst.
If you heard the youtube video that I gave you a great read/audio for ENTPs is the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. It explains how he got into a very bad situation that caused him to be stranded in England and how he had to work his way back to the colonies. It made him a better perosn because of it but this requires time. It doesnt happen over night. What doesnt kill you makes you stronger. If that doesnt work a mantra that makes betterment in what could be can.
If you find these answers somewhat helpful please let me know. Im always looking to improve myself. "
722,estj,"Disclaimer:
 Im going to try to help you as much as I can but please don't over exaggerate my meaning. 

BREATH 12345 IN 12345 OUT
Relax/Meditate to the point of being able to let go of your situation. 
3.Then add thinking that requires you to see the Pros/cons and presume a bad outcome has a possiblity. 
4.You should accept all those possibilities
Mentally prepare for those options 
Try to find solutions 
Remember to humble your approach 
strategize your plan
Make attainable expectations. Dont raise the bar way to high that it seem hard to attain
Execute/see it thru

This is essential to you being a ESTJ
... why??? because your best trait is having serenity that means that you have a calmness about you and need to pretty much organize thru the chaos. Dont ever come across to the point of disregarding for the worst because you have given up this will cause more chaos because of it.
You ultimately have the answers to your problem it just takes time to dig deep and solve it.
Back to your discussion:
I read a majority of it and would say you would need to figure out the truth of the situation by approaching it by a different angle. You do have reasons to make assumptive measures but dont rush it unless its necessary. The assumptions are whats going to stumble you. 
He is most likely being defensive and him being like that will make his logic arise to prevent any wrong doings. His attitude is really shady for his behavior. If I were you I would lay it out in front of him and have a point to back it up. Dont force it on him. Have him make the decision to voluntarily show you why he might be right or wrong. Trust but verify. Allow wisdom to take place. 
Ask him questions one by one not all at the same time. 
Ask him has he thought about his goals for the future? 
Any ideas he has stored up.? 
Any ENTP thing you can think of that help him grow and give. 
Claim some sort of amazement this will put his guard down. If you make him feel wanted its a bonus to his positivity. You will help that FE child function to make it feel special. That noblity will help then once you got him.  
Present the statement preferably in written form make it systematic if necessary. 
Make those solutions apparent to him. With choices like if he want the relationship to work?. It is necessary to have the respect and admiration. But he need to find it too. Its not coming from nowhere. Make appealment to the inferior function Si and allow aspiration. The stress in his life will ultimately cause the Lying to happen because hes striving for betterment but theres road bumps and detours. The fear in his life will make him unhealthy.
If you need to question the loyalty way to much it sometimes is best to let it be. Even the
 threat/notice of letting it be. Might arise answers that come to you by representation. That is ultimately up to you. 
These above are options filter thru as you please "
723,estj,"Oh absolutely.  The only thing I would say is that it‚Äôs important to clearly establish your boundaries and what is and isn‚Äôt flirting according to your standards.  For me, I‚Äôm very lenient when it comes to this stuff - I do have my boundaries but it‚Äôs more of an intuitive rule that as long as her behavior with other dudes isn‚Äôt separating or causing a wedge between us than I don‚Äôt really care.  If you have talked with him about what you are and are not comfortable with and he crossed that line deliberately, then that‚Äôs a conversation you need to have.  Just remember ENTP‚Äôs are typically skillful in the art of debate and will usually try to talk their way out of something they acted into.  
Feel free to message me anytime - I‚Äôm happy to help"
724,estj,"Also, the reason he could be flipping out is because he feels like you keep pestering him with this kind of stuff (not necessarily with girls but just control stuff).  
ENTP‚Äôs should welcome a rational discussion.  I can see it becoming irrational when they feel pushed into a corner and they feel you are being too controlling and it‚Äôs been one thing after the other.   Could this apply to your sitch ?"
725,estj,"Well shit, I‚Äôm super busy and my time is limited (I‚Äôm a PhD student) but if it‚Äôs just a verbal sparring you are looking for with the intent to have some fun, then I suppose I could work it into my day when I have some leisure time.  :). Because sparring with a fellow ESTJ is always a delight.  
Put your dukes up - I‚Äôll be coming."

727,estj,"This is very true and any type of relationship requires honesty and trust. I only have access to that one conversation thread with that one girl. I am pondering if I consider that cheating or not. I do not know if there have been others but I can‚Äôt assume there have been if I haven‚Äôt got evidence of that. 
However, I do have enough evidence to believe he hid contact with his girl from me and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs created doubts n it‚Äôs the lies that have broken my trust if that makes sense. I honestly believe he doesn‚Äôt think he has done anything wrong which of course is a bigger problem "
728,estj,"that's the thing. I've just tried to bring it up now as a rational discussion but he is flipping out. he doesnt know I have seen what I have seen but i have mentioned a specific night where something happened that bothered me. He was at mine and i woke up sensing he wasn't asleep and saw he was messaging someone on FB messenger at 2:30am and qucikly came off it when he realised i was awake. I asked how comes he was up and he said he couldnt sleep. i then asked who he was messaging and he said he was asking how the party was that we decided not to go to that evening. He said he was messaging in a group chat but i saw it was to that girl. I thought something shady was happening so investigated. It turns out the party was that girl's and he was asking her how it was going. There was no group chat. He later deleted these messages to her and now there's a new tread up till this monday gone where she stopped replying.So i confronted him today about that night and asked why he said he was messaging in a group chat when i could see it was xxx. At first he said he didn't remember that night properly, then the story changed to he was on the group chat and realised its xxx b day so sent her a message. So i asked to see the message and thats when he flipped out. He agreed to show me later. Then admitted he deleted the messenger texts to the girl from that night but doesn‚Äôt know why, and this group chat has also magically disappeared too as he has a new phone.
Doesn't this sound a bit shady? I've actually read most these messages and can tell he is flirting covertly but whats most upsetting is the lies and shady behaviour"
729,estj,"Yes flirting is totally subjective but as you mentioned we did have this convo before this all happened so a line has been crossed. What‚Äôs annoying me is the lying over something so trivial, his reaction and hostility towards me, and trying to essentially gaslight me into thinking I‚Äôm in the wrong when he has clearly been caught out about lying. 
If he was just honest in the first place this wouldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt been an issue"
730,estj,"He does feel I question him a lot. So if he says he doesn‚Äôt like something like standing next to me whilst I order the cinema tickets, or he doesn‚Äôt like cheese or something. I would ask him why to try and understand his reasons and obviously get to know him better as a person. It helps me understand other situations he might not like or food he wouldn‚Äôt eat due to the texture or whatever. I have explained this to him. He often sees me asking as challenging him even though it‚Äôs not. He has said he would rather me just ‚Äòdo‚Äô then ask. But I don‚Äôt really think anyone (including him) would do that "
731,estj,"Sometimes it's subjective to the person and the situation. 
My roommate is best friends with a dude. They've been friends for 15+ years. They do game nights and hang out alone all the time. But anyone that knows them knows they are friends and nothing more. Both of them are dating people too and everyone understands the relationship. But there will always be people that think guys and girls cannot be strictly platonic friends. 
Now I don't go around telling every guy I meet that I'm in a relationship right off the bat. If they make an advance I will, but if they can back off and still be respectful then I'm not going to stop hanging out with them. 
Usually, if someone is secretive about the other person then there are grounds for suspicion. Also meeting them is usually a great way to get an understanding of the relationship. If he doesn't want you to meet her, then you've got your answer, but if you do and she seems chill, then you probably have nothing to worry about. 
If he thinks he did nothing wrong, then he should have nothing to hide. "
732,estj,"How are his morals in general?  I know a lot of ENTP‚Äôs who are actually very moral, like....fiercely moral but their compass is more internal based on their values ‚Äî if they value it, they won‚Äôt transgress it but if it‚Äôs more of a societal value they could care less and therefore be deemed immoral by some.
Is he generally an honest person who values integrity?  "
733,estj,"Lol yeah that sounds weird.  ENTP‚Äôs love that stuff.  I love being asked about things like that so I can have an outlet to explain a theory or grand idea.  I can‚Äôt stand being asked in a critical or judgmental way that is snarky or sarcastic and I will lash out of someone does it enough, but more in a debating way not violent emotional way. 
Do you think you could have been doing this or trying to control him or tell him how to order the tickets or how he must get cheese or something?"
734,estj,"He says he does but I‚Äôm not sure he does really. I‚Äôve said integrity is very important to me (guess that‚Äôs the estj in me) and at the start our values seems to match up. 
But over time I‚Äôve seen contradictions in what he says vs what he does. For example he took shots at me saying that I wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into this business idea we are working on so I created a system on trello to track tasks etc. He hasn‚Äôt done his for over 3 weeks. 
He said he hasn‚Äôt ever taken girls home to his old houseshares but I know he has. He said he ending the relation with the last person he was seeing as she was doing too many drugs, then the story completely changed 3 months later as to who this was and the reasons why. 
When questioned about stuff he says ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt remember really‚Äô or ‚Äòwhy does it matter‚Äô etc. So it‚Äôs almost like I can see a pattern of inconsistency which has led me to ask questions as things don‚Äôt add up really. "
735,estj,"Yeah I don‚Äôt get it really coz we both love debating and talking about stuff so it seems a bit weird to me. 
No I don‚Äôt think so. So take the cinema thing as an example as that was recent. He gets a bit weird about doing orders at places like bars n things for some reason. So when we got there he asked if I could go get the tickets n he would wait away from the counter. I was like yeah sure I was going to order them but how comes you don‚Äôt want to come over. He was like I just don‚Äôt please stop asking me why and challenging me. I was like I‚Äôm not challenging you I‚Äôm just trying to understand why but don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll order them and asked him what he wanted to eat. 
On the way we talked about sweet vs salty popcorn. He was fine talking about his preference in this situation though. It‚Äôs just bizarre really "
736,estj,"So, I have heard this a few times. And stuff but I don‚Äôt know how true it is.
Does ESTJs not talk a lot? I have heard that now from a few people. I had an impression that was not true. I know ISTJs don‚Äôt talk a lot. Do you enjoyy talking?. But the truth is I don‚Äôt think I know many estjs."
737,estj,Absolutely yes! And we have an opinion on every goddamn thing on the planet.  It used to be that if it was in my head then it's out of my mouth with very little filter. I'm old and it has taken me a life time to learn to stfu and focus on what others are saying. To this day I have to be careful with free form conversation and only truly let down my guard when I'm around friends that have experienced my mouth for the last 30 years and are still my friend.
738,estj,"I do. 
But I also have had some negative experiences with people who claim I dominant conversations. And that honestly hurts me to a point where I simply won‚Äôt engage with you again. 
I had a friend who claimed I never asked questions about her personal life. So when we would talk it was mostly me. And I hated feeling like she never shared anything with me not knowing she just wanted me to sit and ask her questions the whole time. That ended up really hurting me because she made me feel like I needed all the attention. 
I love talking but I tend to notice when people make faces or don‚Äôt seem interested and the second I sense that I shut down. 
I‚Äôll sit and talk with you for hours but I need to feel like you are equally sharing and are engaged because otherwise I get self conscious and those horrible thoughts trickle in. "
739,estj,"I always wanted to answer questions in school.
Our questions tend to be very specific. I like using the Socratic Method and playing Devil's Advocate.
I hate interrupting and talking over people, though I'm more willing to than some other types.
If someone disagrees with me and won't cede me any points, I'll just leave the discussion.
On the other hand, if someone listens to me, our conversation can last for hours.
My ideal conversation has each side stating their thoughts clearly and succinctly and returning control to the other person. We usually start talking about a new topic in order to better understand the previous topic and have the intention of eventually returning to it. Our conversations feel like a stack where new topics are added and removed in an attempt to empty it."
740,estj,"I like checking out this sub but it's really quiet. How popular are ESTJs and why are there not many on here unlike r/infp for example. I just want to know. 
Also this may be a weird question but where do you find ESTJ men? I never seem to find them. Ok that last question was weird. But still."
741,estj,I have noticed that my enfp and infp friends and family are a lot more interested in what others from their personality type think/feel. Whereas I(an estj) don't really feel obligated or compelled to relate to other estjs because they are estj. Don't know if that's completely relevant but there is my 2 cents.
742,estj,"I really enjoy talking to others in the MBTI community but more often than not I don't feel like I have much to say.  
ESTJs are far more common than INFJs and INTJs, but they have far more members and a lot more engagement.  I'm not really sure why, but I think it has to do with the fact that ESTJs like hanging out in communities/subs that directly apply to their lives.  
My dad is an ESTJ and he spends hours on wrestling forums.  When my brothers were in high school he would engage with others about who is good, who is going to state, other gossip surrounding the community.  He also spends time in communities talking about tractors, another hobby of his.  
I really like the skincare and makeup subs because I relate to it more.  It's something I like, it's part of my job, and allows me to learn more about something that applies to my actual life.  
ESTJs are common in politics, so I can imagine that's where they would spend there time engaging wither others.  
I think the other user pretty much explained it too.  "
743,estj,"Every ESTJ I know is barely on social media or couldnt careless about MBTI. It's very rare that you find ESTJ on MBTI forums. You can check every ESTJ section of any MBTI  forum on any website, and it is always the least populated. If it has a decent amount, it is probably ISTJs mistyped as ESTJs. "
744,estj,"ESTJ here,
I just come across this thread while I was studying at the library.
For me, I usually spend time studying for a certification in library with a study group or working out at the gym with my friend. 
You might across with the ESTJ type of person in the study group or gymnasium. Hopefully this helps."
745,estj,"That makes sense. Maybe you guys are just confident and contempt enough not to need support from others of your own personality type. Where as me, an INFP needs support and validation for my actions from people like myself."
746,estj,"Now I don't know how reliable this is since all of my test cases are women, but both the enfp and the infp seem to get a lot of satisfaction in relating to others with the same personality type. They get pleasure out of being able to relate their personality traits to the type that they associate with."
747,estj,"Yeah my boyfriend is an ESTJ and I'm an ISTJ. He is pretty anti-social media. Although he has a Facebook he checks but that's it. Not many photos, totally private. We actually just deactivated both of ours recently because it's kinda toxic.. 
I don't know where to find ESTJ men to be honest? He is the only one I know. Definitely not on any astrology or typing forum! He came into Starbucks to visit a friend when I used to work there. He awkwardly stared into the distance eating McDonald's and ocassionally checked his QWERTY phone...in 2016. How ESTJ of him. So maybe go to Starbucks and look for awkwardly charming men eating McDonald's. Lmao "
748,estj,"Well I'm a man and it's the same. The reason is in the real world we can be so rare and also closed off that we barely ever meet each other. Plus the world is pretty much run by the much more assertive types, especially in schools while we are growing up, so we can feel alone. Which is why we have satisfaction in finding others we can relate to."
749,estj,"I think ESTJs would rather relate to someone through a hobby or activity.  My roommate is an INFP and when she has friends over she would rather sit around and talk to them.  I on the other hand would rather play games.  
I think it's really strange and rather boring to sit and just talk to people.  Unless I can give you advice about a problem in your life, I honestly don't know what else I would say.  She thinks playing games is dumb and gets bored really easily.  "
750,estj,"Many of the responses that are received regarding the open discussion of telepathy are not about getting to the truth of what is real or not real regarding ESP, it‚Äôs about who the smartest individual is, and who can control how people think the most. The biggest egos that like CONTROL over others are usually the first to attack and discredit. This is true all across the board with other writers that also embrace psychic phenomena, not just with what I have written in the past. Many individuals that write about ESP and psychic functioning are immediately discredited and attacked by arrogant, closed minded, control freaks. They don‚Äôt like being figured out, they don‚Äôt like losing control, and they don‚Äôt like being seen for who they are deep down. Anyone with a negative attitude towards other human beings ‚Äì those that like authority and control over other people ‚Äì do not like it when highly aware individuals focus on the emotions that they put out to other people. The truth is this: all of us can sense positive-feeling vibrations, which are emotions and thoughts from other individuals, and all of us can sense bad-feeling vibrations. There is no denying this fact. This information exists everywhere in pop culture. It cannot be hidden and swept under a rug any longer.
Big egos like authority and control, and they don‚Äôt much care for individuals that are pushing forward ESP and telepathy, even though it is the truth. We all observe it, and we all experience it. Awareness of ESP empowers the individual that embraces it, and disempowers individuals that seek authority and control over other human beings. Basically it‚Äôs like this: when someone starts talking openly about ESP and psychic awareness, big egos and control freaks get really pissed off. And this post will piss a lot of them off, but that‚Äôs OK ‚Äì they need to be more observant with their thoughts, lighten up a bit, and relinquish control over other human beings and how they think. 
‚ÄúPseudoscience‚Äù is a favorite word of the big ego. It‚Äôs a vague term that is used quite often to discredit the intelligence and intellect of those that want to study ESP openly. Remote viewing, which is psychic functioning based on telepathy and the ascertainment of data outside of the 5 senses, was developed with the scientific method and double-blind experiments. ‚ÄúRemote viewing‚Äù is a science based term that was developed from scientific experiments. This is a fact that cannot be denied. The federal government funded the development and use of remote viewing for intelligence operations, and I have no doubt that it is still being used today. Anyone familiar with quantum mechanics knows about the observer effect, wave/particle duality, and quantum entanglement. Our minds have a DIRECT IMPACT on that of which we observe, and removal of conscious observation of a target or object at a distance collapses the particle into the wave. Our minds perceive in a ‚Äúnon-localized‚Äù fashion, and this means that space/time becomes irrelevant when we focus our minds on an object. This is not ‚Äúpseudoscience‚Äù. These are scientific facts. 
I want to take this a step further and say that when other individuals think about us, all of us can sense this focus of thought. This is an observation of mine, but it has also been proven scientifically as well. Dr. Dean Radin has studied this phenomenon specifically in a scientific lab setting. It‚Äôs real. We don‚Äôt really need scientific studies to tell us this is so, however. We have emotional connectivity and personal observation, which lead us to direct experience ‚Äì something much more powerful. 
When I write these posts based on telepathy and ESP and post them online, I can immediately sense, via my feelings, when other individuals are reading them. I can FEEL the anger and arrogance and disagreement and the need to discredit what I am writing about. It‚Äôs all about control, and many individuals feel intellectually inferior to those that embrace ESP openly and without any doubt. And this is WHY these lower feeling thoughts/emotions are being expressed. Our feelings tell us what kinds of emotions are being directed towards us by other individuals, and because our emotions and thoughts are intrinsically linked, we can tell if other individuals are thinking either positively or negatively about us when they are thinking about us. None of us need the scientific method to know this. We all experience it. When another person is actively thinking about us, we become ‚Äúemotionally entangled‚Äù with that individual, and we can feel what the attitude this individual is expressing towards us. There is no denying this fact of reality. Individuals that are controlling and have poor (authoritative) attitudes towards other individuals do not like it when feelings and emotions are openly discussed. This means they are being figured out for who they are deep down and how they think. Most of the time, their thoughts are not very kind or humble. No one likes it when they are being exposed for who they are deep down, especially when they are mean-spirited, arrogant, and unrefined. All of us can sense good vibes and bad vibes ‚Äì and these are not just ‚Äúvibes‚Äù (an incredibly vague term used to discredit the perceptions of other individuals) ‚Äì they are thoughts. Our thoughts determine what kind of ‚Äúvibes‚Äù we are sending out to other people, do you not agree?
All of us, including myself, have big egos that need refinement in some way. This is humility. When we refuse to judge, and we see each other as growing individuals. I choose to refine my thoughts, and I spend a lot of my free time, asking for no compensation from other people, teaching what I know is true about reality. It takes a lot of time to write posts such as these. Most of the responses are harsh criticisms based out of ego, and not out of honesty and humility. These individuals feel threatened by what I am writing, and they should be if they are unkind and refuse to refine their own egos (the expression of truth and humility). A higher awareness of ESP and telepathy is incredibly threatening to the authoritative control freak that seeks power over other individuals. These behaviors and attitudes are rooted in low self-esteem (the need to be better than other individuals). Most of the responses are harsh criticisms, but I get the sense that there are many more that are thankful for what I am writing, because it puts them into a higher awareness immediately and empowers them. These writings are for those individuals that care about other people, are kind, and do not seek power, control and authority over others.
I expect that, after I post this essay, many will begin to criticize it unfairly and be angry about it. They will most likely express that this post does not belong here, has no relation to MBTI, is off topic, is pseudoscience, has no intellectual bearing on reality itself, or any other putdowns or criticisms they can think of for the purposes of DISCREDITING what I have written. Many will attempt to use sarcasm as a hidden effort to discredit as well. Some individuals may even contact a moderator to block me from posting in the future, because they do not like what I am writing about. These are common reactions from individuals that want to control how other people think and what is being openly expressed. If there is one topic ‚Äì and one topic only ‚Äì that stirs the hornet nest the most, it is telepathy and ESP. This is because we are changing reality for what it is, and many individuals are just not ready to grow. They want to keep how they really think towards other people hidden, and remain controlling, judgmental Individuals that are bossy only care about power and authority, the do not care about refining the self. There is a direct correlation between higher intellectual functioning, and kindness, humility and honesty.
I am not writing this to outsmart anyone, but to expose reality for what it is. If you don‚Äôt like this essay, NO HARD FEELINGS, OK?
A few points I wanted to make:
1.  The emotional states of individuals do not traverse space/time. Emotional synchronization between individuals (feelings) is non-localized in nature. All of us can feel love (high emotion thoughts ‚Äì kindness, honestly, humility), and all of us can feel hate (authority, fear, control, pessimism). We are emotionally connected, and it does not matter how far our bodies are separated. If another person has a negative attitude towards us and is holding us in their thoughts, or if that person is actively thinking about us to communicate, we can feel the direction of their thoughts. Our thoughts are either loving, kind and gentle, or they are not.
2.  Skepticism regarding ESP does not mean to criticize unendedly. It means that we are also open to the possibility that it is real. If we constantly look for reasons that ESP is not real and put down people that are curious about it, this is not skepticism, this is control. Control can be in the form of derogatory comments, sarcasm, put downs, etc. Skepticism requires us to ask for CLARIFICATION, it does not mean that we detract over and over and over without any sort of objectivity.
3.  We can sense not only direct thinking (telepathy), but also attitude (our vibe) of other individuals. Our attitude is determined by the habitual thoughts that we have about other people. If we habitually think unkind thoughts, have big egos, and look down on other people, we transmit a low vibe towards other people. We may not be actively thinking about another individual, but that individual will be able to pick up our attitude and current emotional state via feelings quite easily. 
4.  Telepathy is obvious when we stop actively thinking within and start watching the mind. When we stop actively thinking, we will see that the inner conversations and thoughts within our minds still continue. All of us hear these voices. There is no schizophrenia. There is only telepathy. We can all communicate with each other telepathically, and we can also communicate telepathically with the deceased. There is no death.

753,estj,"Hello everyone. I'm going to keep this short, sweet, and to the point. 
What do you all make of introverted intuition, and how, if at all, have you utilized it in your life? 
This question to me seems like an interesting one, since we all have PoLR Ni. 
I'm on a quest to figure out how it works, and thus far, I cannot understand in depth. "
754,estj,Aren‚Äôt we just blind to it? I‚Äôve been chasing this idea for a while. We just don‚Äôt use it and we don‚Äôt really know what it is. I do now just by observing but it‚Äôs still a little bizarre to me. I don‚Äôt think we use that function or anyone use their 7th function or am I wrong? I know that my INtJ friend for instance don‚Äôt know and dont really like fe that much. And probably doesn‚Äôt like it too well.
755,estj,"I like to think of Ni as intuition of time. 
I often find Ni acts as a stressor for me, and it manifests when I have a sense or have a gut feeling of how something may unfold. I am vulnerable to uncertainties ‚Äî This vulnerability, I believe, acts as a stressor that causes me to get started on things early (or be proactive rather than reactive) so that I can somehow exert some degree of control over the unknown future.
My conscious use of it is poor and without confidence, but subconsciously I think this uncertainty nudges me to act on my goals if that makes any sense..."
756,estj,"Hello! My BFF and I cohost a podcast about Myers Briggs that we produce on our own in our house. I‚Äôm ENTP and she‚Äôs ESFP. Lately we‚Äôve been interviewing people as a way to catalog types so others can get to know and identify that type.
Ilyssa Russ, known online as @ohilyssa, is a popular fitness personality (shoutout to powerlifting and bodybuilding) as well as a college English professor who focuses on feminism, racism and classism, and - get this - she's a total ESTJ. ENTP Kaila and ESFP Meredith talk with Ilyssa about problematic issues in the fitness world, reconciling her strong sense of duty and tradition with her progressive worldview, and the dynamics with her ENFP boyfriend.

757,estj,"Herasy of the highest order. 
One cannot be ESTJ and champion for the critical theory construct that is progressive identity politics, it's an oxymoron.
Usurpers and degenerates are building a fifth column."
758,estj,"Politics is relevant, did OP not discuss how the interviewee reconciles various political philosophies with her mbti personally type? 
Furthermore, critical theory formed out of the Frankfurt School and feminism and other identify politics out of critical theory, did it not? "
759,estj,"Yeah. I took life really seriously and it made me a bit judgemental. Luckily I had a really judgemental group of friends who'd I'd spend time ripping on other people with. I still think I take life seriously, but now with a purpose."
760,estj,"Yes. I always felt like I fit in better with the adults than my peers, so it was hard to make friends my age.
Edit: Added thought-I am the oldest and lived on a farm, so adults was who I hung out with a great deal of the time anyways, so is it because of that or me being an ESTJ that made me prefer the company of adults?"
761,estj,"Just curious. I'm learning more about MBTI, and am curious how Extraverted Thinking manifests itself in ENTJ-ESTJ interactions. I want to understand the Te and realized I don't have any ESTJ friends. Who can share some experiences with me? 
Thank you!"
762,estj,"what would you like to know? :P unfortunately i might not be the best for you because i am a strong ETJ but waffle between N and S. in general i can tell i'm interacting with one vs. the other based on how frustrated i become with what they talk about. if i'm talking to an N, i can tell i'm very S when they start talking about these glorious ideas and i just am like whoa honey, lets come back down to earth and deal with what's happening now. and then if i'm talking to an S, i become very N when they are obsessing over even the slightest imperfections of something.
overall, i love being an extraverted thinker though! WE'RE THE BEST ;D"
763,estj,"I would correct: I don't agree that ENTJs are mysterious or secretive. I blab plans all over the place. INTJs might hold their cards close, but that is not a strong suit for ENTJs - certainly not for me.
I also wish I had more ENTJ friends. But not because 'they are the ""right"" answers', but because they are rational thinkers, they generally vocalize their goals and they are direct in their feedback."

4) Is the frequency of communication ever an issue in your relationships?
a. Yes
b. No

Thank you!"
765,estj,"E) Combination of above (texting and phone calls)
I'd prefer texting but I do like the idea of hearing my SO voice once in awhile, if we live apart that is (just dont call everyday I won't pick up) 
A) Daily (but not every hour or minute) but daily is a good minimum.
A) I do but Id liked for my SO to initiate it more often.
A) yess other person never initiates conversation as much.
I am a female ESTJ, people ive date before ENFP, ESFP etc.
Also I dont know if my answers will be valid (since I'm not in a relationship right now) but thought Id give it a shot."
766,estj,"I'm ESTJ female, hubby is ENFJ.

D (Married)
A (Communication is knowledge, knowledge is power, etc)
A (Power hungry, apparently)
B (Used to be, my husband is Japanese and they tend to not express themselves but I've trained it out of him. :D)
"
767,estj,"Female ESTJ. I'm pretty sure he's ISTP, though he hasn't taken the test yet.
 1. C - I'd love to live together but we're not at that stage yet
 2. A - I love constant attention & communication even if we're just talking shit
 3. A - Never believed in those 'girls have to be passive' nonesense
 4. B - It needs effort from both of us though, he tries to be more open and I try not to push him too much lol"
768,estj,"I really like an ESTJ (51% extrovert, 49% introvert), but I‚Äôm not good (at all) at picking up social cues. I just wanted to have some pointers to look out for, and perhaps help indicate whether or not I should just move on. Thank you! "
769,estj,"Typically, I take my time to get to know them and figure out what their relationship status is so I can decide if they‚Äôre a good candidate for me or not. Then when I‚Äôve decided, I either ask them out on a date or just stay mates. 
Doesn‚Äôt everyone do this?"
770,estj,"If I‚Äôm interested in someone, I make no bones about it and will make the first move. If I‚Äôm not interested, I will tolerate a person but actively be closed off to them so as not to lead them on. It‚Äôs very obvious when I like/don‚Äôt like being around someone. "
771,estj,"As someone mentioned below, I make an effort to get to know them and sort of suss out the good/bad/potential partner quality or comparability. Therefore, in true ESTJ fashion I tend to value traditional dating habits and planned dates that allow for conversation. I also am a traditionalist and do not tend to make the first move when it comes to things such as defining what's going on, but I will drop hints. I work a fair amount and keep a busy schedule, but if I am interested in a guy I will make a concerted effort to text back in a timely way, if I have to cancel plans I always offer an alternate date, etc. "
772,estj,"If you can have a conversation with them, especially 1-on-1, and the conversation is easy and natural, that's really good.
ESTJ's will respond to your criticism about yourself with support.
As a male ESTJ, I'll ask questions about your interests and try to get you to talk about something that you care about deeply. It doesn't matter too much what it is."
773,estj,"I see, thanks so much!
I guess my other question is how long are you guys usually willing to wait? If you‚Äôve figured out the qualities and compatibilities, do you continue to talk to them quite a bit? Thanks! "
774,estj,"Willing to wait in what sense? Wait to define and enter a relationship? I think as a human, throwing out MBTI personalities for a moment, it varies on how we feel around the person. I can't speak for all ESTJs but I think we are not the type who want to rush into a relationship, but we also value defining what's going on and being on the same page. Personally I've found about a month of regular dates/seeing each other (2x a week maybe) gives me enough to figure out quality and comparability. Meeting his friends also helps after a few weeks to help gauge as well"
775,estj,"I took the test numerous times in high school and college and was always ISTJ, though barely an introvert as I got older (closer to E each time). When I took the test a few years ago, I came up as an ESTJ. Curious to know if anyone else here has shifted."
776,estj,"""Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!"" 
On the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right? Anyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)"
777,estj,"My favorite book of all time is the Riddle-Master of Hed trilogy by Patricia McKillip. It's fantasy. I also loved The Forgotten Beasts of Eld by the same author.
The Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy, by Douglas Adams, is hilarious.
If you're looking for nonfiction the Narative of Fredrick Douglas is another favorite of mine."
778,estj,"Well I'm not an ESTJ, but I am dating one as an INFP. We just passed the 1 year mark. He's a supervisor/manager at work, but not the business type of ESTJ (Te-subtype), more like the sporty/hands-on/craft & technology-oriented ESTJ (Si-subtype). 
We're very happy together. There were definitely some bumpy times and things I seriously questioned, but we managed to resolve most of them without much conflict. 
I don't really know why he likes me, but he seems to think I'm ""an amazing part of"" his life. He recently said he loved me for the first time. I do know that when we are together, things are often mutually understood and peaceful. From the moment we met, he's felt familiar to me and safe. I know that we will never have deep-flowing intuitive type conversations, but I appreciate all his other qualities and capabilities. I find him deeply trustworthy at a gut level. When he speaks to me, I can't ever stay angry at him... I just seem to understand where he's coming from. It's hard to explain.     "
779,estj,"I have an INFP sister and I love her very much. I just have to remember how sensitive she is, and to not trample on her feelings with reality. I'm often the one who cannot wait to get on to the next thing in life, such as driving, getting a job, ect. I want the same for my sister, and want to teach her the practical skills I have learned over time. This stresses her out, like I'm rushing her into the world when she's not ready. It can be hard for me to realize that she isn't so excited and ready to get out into the world like I am."
780,estj,"My dad is ESTJ, I'm INFP. I love and admire him and his personality. He loves me too but doesn't ""get"" me. If we weren't related he most certainly wouldn't hang out with me. We're just too different. I'd love to hear what some ESTJs have to say."
781,estj,"Most of my very best girlfriends are INFPs! I'm of the opinion that if you can't get along with an INFP, you have a problem, cuz they're super easy to get along with.
That having been said, there are circumstances surrounding those friendships that automatically make me highly esteem them (they're older and more experienced than I am, so I look up to them, etc), and if it were a SIBLING things might be different because I'm more demanding of my family than I am with my friends, and I'd probably trample an INFP sibling with my ""cold hard facts"" mentality.
Sisters tend to fight a lot anyway, right? I have a sister that I couldn't get along with at all (don't know her type), but as we grew older and wiser things got better and once I turned 20 (and she was 31) we finally started getting along. :D Give it some time (and spend time getting to know more about each other's types!) and I'm sure things will improve! :)"
782,estj,"One of my best friends is an ESTJ (I am INFP), and I see that as I am becoming more comfortable with being who I am, the more she seems to suffocate me. Through the eight years that we have known each other, I have very much molded to who she is so that there wouldn't be any conflict. Now that I am becoming more outspoken about my views, being okay with being something different than her singular mindset, we butt heads a lot. It seems that our differences are pushing us apart because she cannot tolerate those who are different from her. I still love and appreciate her friendship, but it becomes more suffocating by the day. 
I don't know if you two live together or not, but the key could just be some time apart from each other so that you are able to disconnect, see each other differently, and then reconnect.  "
783,estj,"That's a good question, and I never really thought about it before so I don't have a definite, good answer for you.
It might have to do with the fact that I try to save face when it comes to my friends, I don't get into emotional arguments with friends (just friendly debates), and I generally try not to show a lot of negative emotion in general with friends (I hate crying in front of friends, that's the worst!). But family sees you at your worst, when you're crabbiest, when you're sick; they see your tantrums, they know all your flaws and they love you anyway.
So I guess a better way of putting it might be that I'm more comfortable being myself and saying things without a filter rather than me being more demanding. To a friend I might say, ""Hey, I know you probably forgot, but I was hoping I could get my movie back from you this week..."" whereas with a relative I'd say ""Hey I asked you three times for my movie back and I'm coming to get it whether you like it or not!!!"", which is what I'd LIKE to say to the friend, but societal conventions call that being rude so I rein myself in. :P
Technically I suppose I could reach that level of comfort and brutal honesty with a friend too, but that happens infrequently for me. I could probably count on one hand."
784,estj,"I absolutely admit that I'm terrible about adapting to any type of change--even good change or smaller scale change--and it's potentially my worst character flaw because it's the reason behind multiple maladaptive behavioral patterns. I'm resistant and it takes me forever to get with the changes. 
If you also have this problem and have managed to negate it, what practical things do you suggest doing to speed up the process of accepting a change and moving onto more useful positive behaviors? "
785,estj,"And if so, how did it impact you?
Personally, my mom is an ENFJ, my sister is an INFJ, and my dad is an ENFP. Somehow, I turned out ESTJ, and I know I think completely differently than the rest. However, I also think that this has softened my ST, and I think I feel pretty strongly for an ST type, but I don't let those feelings dictate the choices I make. 
Has anyone else experienced this? How did you cope with the differences day in and day out when you were younger?"
786,estj,"My mom is INFP and dad is ESTJ. Seriously I cannot even begin to tell you how much of a blessing it was being raised by an ESTJ. 
Mom and I fought for almost 20 years. She just didn‚Äôt get me the way dad did. We‚Äôre much better now but it took a lot of work. 
ESTP brother who bullied me growing up and really just sucks as a person. I finally got sick of it and cut him out and stopped putting up with all his bullshit. 
INTP brother and I were the closest as kids. Love him. 
ESFJ sister and I also fought a lot and are better now but I‚Äôm still not that close with her. I‚Äôve tried but she can be too judgmental at times and I don‚Äôt have the patience for it. 
Honestly I was a fucking mess from 17-23 years old. And I had a family who looked down on me and I left for all those years and struggled on my own until I finally got to a better place. And because I was alone during those years I just don‚Äôt have the patience and empathy that others do. I never got it so it‚Äôs hard to give it to others. 
All my best friends are INFPs which is funny since my mom and I had such a bad relationship. Not sure how I managed to snatch up 3 INFPs as friends but I did. 
ENFPs are not my friends though. Literally cannot stand them. Never had good experiences with them. They aren‚Äôt like INFPs where they strongly believe in something and have a backbone. They just do whatever pleases the most people or whoever they are with currently. It‚Äôs pathetic. INFPs will stand alone and fight and an ENFP will run and hide. I obviously want INFPs. 
ENFJs are cool and i know one INFJ so I can‚Äôt really say much about them."
787,estj,"Yes, I grew up with an INFJ mother, and I'm an ESTJ female. It was just the two of us growing up. My mom is the quintessential nurturer, so it drew that side out from me, more so than the average ESTJ. As an INFJ, she's adept at picking up at signals and vibes from people, which doesn't come naturally to me, so I maybe learned some from her. Her strong beliefs in doing good in the world definitely positively enhanced my ESTJ moral compass.
Growing up, and to this day, it really frustrates her I don't talk about my feelings. The thing is, I do tell her about day to day stuff (work, friends I'm seeing, a little about dating). But she called me out recently saying I never express specific feelings, like if I'm angry or upset, etc. It's not that I don't have feelings (lol) but if something is bothering me I take a practical approach and fix the problem and that's that. I don't need to talk it out with 15 people. I don't think she gets not everyone is always in tune with how they feel all the time. I told her my ENFP friend shared he goes through 30 emotions a day, wakes up and assesses how he feels, etc. and she said she's exactly this way. I'm not that way at all and going through all these emotions sounds exhausting an ESTJ!
Despite being an NF, she is an introvert and sometimes growing up I wish she had been more involved and engaged with my friend's parents and created that social network, whether at the PTA, in the church etc. As an extrovert, and young adult, I put in effort to maintain friendships and lifelong bonds because I can see the effect of what happens when you don't.
I only recently consciously figured out I tend to be drawn more towards men who are NFs. My mom and I are close (despite our sometimes frustrating differences) so I probably feel comfortable around the NF personality and I think it helps me to be a bit more flexible, consider other people's feelings vs. the rational problem solving approach."
788,estj,"Hi, visitor. I'm curious about your thoughts towards majoring in psychology and what career paths you've chosen for those that have studied it.
Are there any of you that chose career in counseling/mentorship roles or leadership roles? how did it help/hinder your progress and role in your job?"
789,estj,"It seems like ESTJ's would be inclined to be good life coaches.  The thought process involves looking at problems and quickly determining solutions based on data for what has and hasn't worked in the past.  This could be used to help people solve their problems, establish and work towards goals, and approach things from a fresh perspective."
790,estj,"ESTJ girl married to ENTP boy. It can totally work, but you have to have a lot of self-awareness and respect for your partner, even when they do something that seems counter-intuitive.  
It's been good for both of us, honestly.  I have learned to loosen up a lot and just... let some things happen (had to white knuckle my way through that at first.) He appreciates the structure that I bring to life and the fact that he has a no-bullshit, call-it-like-I-see-it person who is in his corner no matter what. 
If you can't trust that the person you're with will handle their business at the end of the day, even if it's in a way that doesn't make sense to you, it won't work, no matter what your mbtis are. But if you can, it can be magic. "
791,estj,"ESTJ girl here who dated an ENTP guy for a year. I loved the hell out of him, but eventually found him to be too smothering and needy. The qualities of his that I fell in love with (his knack for excellence, brilliant mind, quick wit, planning, etc.) diminished once we were official, and I asserted my ability to walk all over him because I could. My initial interest in him was due to a combination of adoration and admiration, but he seemed to lose sight of who he was while in pursuit of me, and I lost respect for him. I‚Äôll always have a soft spot for him and wonder if I should‚Äôve tried harder, but breaking up was the right move."
792,estj,"And? Speaking of stereotypes, aren't ENTP(s) supposed to be into weird things?
Do something original and nouvelle and date an ESTJ! You can even write a book: ""Cats and Dogs. Eternal Enemies, Furious Lovers."""

794,estj,"I'm not an ESTJ, but I'm dating one. From my perspective, I think it's ESTJs' intimidating personality in general that makes dating difficult. It's not just your honesty, it's the competitiveness, the need to always be right, the perceived lack of warmth, etc. I'm not saying these are bad things, but introverts and intuitive types in particular tend to shy away from these characteristics."
795,estj,"Used to have that problem, not anymore. Some people find it awkward talking to me because I'm too straightforward for their liking but I would say that's their problem. Its been long since I've realised that there are people out there who would prefer me being blunt."
796,estj,"I had trouble dating because I can't respect people who won't respect my time.  Don't make vague plans and then refuse to confirm them.  Don't tell me ""I'm sorry, I'm running 5 minutes late"" for half an hour.  And do not stand me up."
797,estj,"Try other thinker types, I'm a male entp with a female estj and I couldn't be happier with my cold little song bird. We both value honesty and efficiency and our blunt communication style matches up so we don't spend all of our time over thinking things, we just say what we want or feel and no one gets butt hurt. Also the sex is mind blowing with two thinker types.  I will warn you, that you need to go for older xntp types if you are going for young or Immature ones they will just torture you with needless troll behavior.  Good luck!   "
798,estj,"I recently met an ESTJ. We have gone on two dates, both of which were good. He was very warm and sweet. He does work very long hours, and the last two times we had planned to meet again, he had to cancel the night before due to increased workload. I was a bit disappointed because I had cleared my schedule for the dates.
If it were anybody else, I'd think ""work"" is just an excuse to get out of a date. But given that he's an ESTJ and I know you guys work a ton, I thought he really is just soooo busy.
But wouldn't you ESTJs prioritize dating if it.were someone you were really interested in? I myself am a busybee, so I get it but don't get it. Haha
Any feedback please?"
799,estj,"I'm an ESTJ woman. For me, if a work thing comes up it will take priority. However, if I am interested in the person I will indicate it by offering another time I am free. If I am not interested, I will just keep pushing it back due to work till the hint is received."
800,estj,"Did he suggest rescheduling, or otherwise act enthusiastic about seeing you again? If so, then it's just garden-variety ESTJ workaholism. 
I'm better about taking personal time than I used to be, but I'm still not tryna slip up at work, no matter how much I like someone. "
801,estj,"Make the ESTJ comfy, always ask them what they feel. Always share your thoughts (not your feelings) and always state what you want so there is nothing left to interpretation. Do not ask ESTjs what they want. Use this vid for reference: https://youtu.be/rKEbXXbsb7k"
802,estj,"Great question, he did reschedule after the first cancelled date. This last one he did not. In terms of enthusiasm, I am not sure. He did call me the night after he can cancelled the first time, also busy even during the call."
803,estj,"Go for it. INFPs are dope. 
But we usually have it decided whether we like someone or not. So if she sees you as a friend she might not see you as more. 
But she probably wouldn‚Äôt end the relationship if you made a move. She would just say no and move on from it. Which can be weird to some people. "
804,estj,"ENFP dating an ESTJ. I don't claim to have any expertise in this, but I would suggest you be direct and provide logical suggestions as to how you could initiate a relationship together. 
ESTJ's value logic and things that ""make sense"". They don't like anything that prevents them from reaching their personal goals, so if she feels like you will threaten her personal goals she won't want to start anything. They don't like to show their feelings, and sometimes have a hard time accepting personal feelings as a motive for anything.
Good news for you is, my ESTJ really likes INFP personalities, so you may have a decent chance. Just be yourself, be honest, and be realistic.
Also, don't let her run over you, because she can, and she won't feel safe in your relationship if she thinks she can control you."
805,estj,"ESTJ female here-- I would say the opposite, it's a good idea to tell her how you feel and where you're at. ESTJs like myself greatly appreciate straightforwardness and knowing where we stand. We also appreciate people opening up and making the first step in showing these kind of emotions. I don't mind discussing feelings, but I would never be the one to initiate, and be prepared to have kind of a practical ""so what are we"" or ""where do you see this going"" follow up question. It's not that us ESTJs aren't romantic, but we're also realists at heart. I recently had a guy straight up tell me he liked me and I appreciated the honesty/directness so much. Hell, I appreciate directness even if it's the other way too (tell me you don't like me, don't drag things on) haha!"
806,estj,"Uhhhh, for me personally, it depends on your relationship. Are you friends? Acquaintances? 
If someone straight up tells me that they like me and I haven‚Äôt had time to form on opinion on the person, the answer would be no. But it depends"
807,estj,"ENFP dating ESTJ here as well, (whaddup /u/jdevmiller/ !)   
My experience, be clear with her, in a not too soppy way.
Show her you appreciate her. Accept her direct answer to that on face value as well.
And agree, give some fire back to the passionate drive an ESTJ can have,... it's boring for her if she can just steam wall you with her intensity. Dodge, dip, duck, dive & dodge, but do not let her go unchallenged. She will love that. 
The mystery and fantasy you can bring to a relationship is something that can fascinate her.
(disclaimer: talking from experiencing, generalization may apply)"
808,estj,"I'm INFP, he's ESTP/J. Leaning more towards ESTJ, but he could be either one. As you can tell, we're basically polar opposites. I'm super conflict avoidant, he's extremely confrontational and loves picking fights with people. He genuinely enjoys pushing people's buttons and trying to get under their skin. To him, he says what he feels and views it as ""telling it like it is."" He views this blunt directness as a positive trait, and to him people who aren't like this need to change. Problem is, he genuinely doesn't care if what he says is hurtful, and it often is. Yesterday he thought it was funny to say ""wouldn't it be funny if I could give you an eating disorder"" then spent the rest of the day calling me fat. I'm actually super thin and not remotely fat. He doesn't know this, but I've actually had some issues with disordered eating. That's just one in a million examples of him being super mean & confrontational. I'm sure I'm on the more sensitive side, but in the majority of these conflicts it's just him starting crap for no reason. He seems to want me to change my personality to be ""less weird"" and more like him, but why can't he just accept me for how I am? INFPs normally feel like weird outsiders anyway, but combined with an ESTJ/P who frequently says I'm weird, I'm really feeling frustrated and hurt.
I never pick fights with anyone, I always try to diffuse these conflicts ASAP. I'm sure my fellow INFPs are the same way. I've told him I hate when he starts fights & intentionally starts drama/conflicts, but to him he thinks it's funny and genuinely gets a sadistic kick out of it. He's said I'm super quiet (I am) and the only way to get me to talk to him is if he picks fights & tries to get me riled up. Idk why tf he thinks this, cuz I'm happy to talk if he's nice. But a lot of the time I just want to be left alone, and we don't even have any common interests to talk about. We literally have nothing in common, and our personalities are polar opposites. I really do want a good relationship with him, but he makes it so difficult even though I've told him countless times that I'm always happy to talk to him as long as he's nice and doesn't start fights or deliberately tries to be mean/annoy me. 
How do I (an INFP) improve my relationship with him (ESTJ/P)?"
809,estj,"Wow, there's a lot to unpack here.
First off, just because ESTJs look at things from a logical perspective, doesn't mean that we're assholes about it. Frankly, it sounds like he's an asshole. Especially if you've talked with him about it before, he should really be able to see the errors in his ways if he really cares about you.
I'll admit, there was a time in my life when I was a lot like that. I enjoyed challenging people's beliefs and getting under people's skin. It took a girlfriends breaking up with me over my ""exhausting"" personality before I realized how intolerable I could be.
Secondly, he wants you to change to be ""less weird""? You don't have similar personalities or common interests? He isn't nice to you? These are basic fundamentals of a relationship, and honestly, it sounds like he might be taking advantage of your passive personality. I hate to be so cold, but you might want to seriously consider your future with him. No one who gets a kick out of hurting someone else's feelings, much less their SO, should be in a serious relationship imo."
810,estj,"You‚Äôre not ‚Äúweird‚Äù, you‚Äôre not like him and that‚Äôs a good thing. He sounds like such a prick. Why would you want to improve your relationship with this absolute cumstain of a person? 
It is entirely possible to be honest and forthright with grace and tact. Our directness and honesty comes from a place of valuing integrity very highly. It‚Äôs not an excuse to bully or harass - and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on here. 
I doubt that he is behaving in the same way to people who are more at ease with calling out his bullshit, he targets you and other less confrontational people because he knows he can get away with it. 
You absolutely do not owe it to this fuckwit to entertain his nonsense. If every interaction with him is a roll of the dice as to whether he‚Äôs going to behave with a modicum of decency and respect, then it‚Äôs not a relationship - it‚Äôs a social mine field. No one has time for that. You have confronted his antics by telling him you‚Äôre happy to chat if he‚Äôs respectful and he‚Äôs repeatedly elected to ignore that. So, fuck it. No need to make any more effort on his behalf. 
We become like our friends, OP. Surround yourself with people who value who you are and who raise you up - not this repellent fuckstick. "
811,estj,"Um yeah hi, I would never treat a stranger much less anyone I cared about in the manner you are describing. You cannot improve a relationship by yourself it takes two and it doesn‚Äôt seem he‚Äôs mature enough to care for another person. "
812,estj,"He is being emotionally abusive. You are not being too sensitive. You are reacting completely appropriately to someone being mean to you. The ""getting a sadistic kick"" out of starting fights and finding them funny is a sign of narcissism. Narcissists are not going to change without therapy and most narcissists will never accept that they have a problem - like your partner they think their ways are positive and better than others - so don't count on him going to therapy to be a better person. If anything he'll act as thought you are the one with the problem who needs to change: ""Stop being so sensitive! I'm just telling it like it is and you need to handle that! Get a thicker skin! You need to be less quiet, then I won't have to treat you like this! It's for your own good!"" VOMIT. 
If you have told your partner their behaviour upsets you, and they refuse to change they are making it very clear they don't care about you or your happiness. What do you think is going to happen? You've brought up the issues and he doesn't give a shit about you enough to work on them. He is showing you his true colours and it is a red flag for sure - it's only going to get worse, not better. If he does show kindness this will only be for a while to get you to stay, then the cycle will continue and he will go back to being an asshole. 
In a healthy relationship both partners care about each other's happiness and make an effort to listen to each other and stop any hurtful behaviours and work on unhealthy ones. 
In a healthy relationship your partner will not see you as ""weird"" and want to change the core of who you are. They will love and appreciate your quirks. 
Trust me when I tell you there is someone 100% better for you out there.
This is not an ESTJ thing. I am an ENFP (definitely a bit ""weird"" myself) and my most recent relationship was with an ESTJ who loved me and admired me exactly as I am and treated me with kindness and respect always. 
DUMP THIS FUCKER. You can and will do better. "
813,estj,"I'm an ENFJ married to a wonderful ESTJ who got laid off when oil prices dropped (every job in Houston is related to oil somehow even if not directly) and he's had an incredibly hard time finding a job again. I make enough money at my job that we can still pay the bills and keep food on the table, but every time he's reminded of how tight we have to budget nowadays he gets really hard on himself and shuts down. I'm personally fine with him not working and I support him taking time to find a job he enjoys instead of just the first one to come up, but the more applications go unanswered and the more interviews go nowhere the more stressed out he gets and I'm not sure how best to help him. I can tell he feels like he's letting me down and not living up to his own expectations of himself, but I also know it's the one subject he really doesn't like talking about. Any advice on how to be supportive without being overbearing? "
814,estj,"This is a tough one for us. Our jobs mean more than a paycheck. It's can be how we show love to our family, fulfill that SJ duty, and ultimately prove our own self-worth. An ESTJ without a job is like an ENFJ without a cause to defend. But I'm probably not telling you something you don't already know. 
Environmental acts of service are a huge help during dark times for me. Things like a clean house, clothes, etc. (No sexist intentions there, male or female.) Reminding him of the big picture like you're doing is important; even when he doesn't seem to hear it."
815,estj,"I think compliments go a long way. Especially because ESTJs are very critical of themselves, it is rare that they receive words of encouragement or compliments. 
Also, I think ST's in general thrive when you asked them to do some tasks. Instead of just leaving him alone to do the job search and spend the rest of the day not doing much, you could create projects for him. We NF's are really good at being creative! So, maybe, ask him to change some things in the house, improve looks of things, or you can even let go of some of your own duties at home for him to take over. 
And showing words of appreciation would hopefully make him feel better!
Good luck to you and your wonderful husband :)  You yourself seem like a wonderful wife!"
816,estj,"I couldn't find a job for a long time and got frustrated, and when I did find a job (part time retail) I was so relieved. For an opportunity more than anything else.
Helping them search is probably not going to go well, nor would offering suggestions, if they are like me. Rather, a calm demeanor and encouragement when times are tough is helpful. And once they do find a job, it will likely seem like a huge relief. THAT is when you two should celebrate! If you have the means now, maybe put away $5 or $10 a paycheck and keep it secret, so when they get a job, you can celebrate without breaking your current budget, when both of you are happy and relieved.
May you both be well, here's hoping soon for a good job to land :)"
817,estj,"Thanks so much for your response. Don't worry I didn't take it as being sexist, I totally need to work on doing more around the house. When we were both working we split it pretty evenly but now that he's home and I'm working a bit extra I think it's easy for me to get a little lazy in that regard. Thanks for the reminder "
818,estj,"Another big bonus to that would be that - depending on how long and how much you save - he will recognize that commitment and dedication and self sacrifice for something for you two to share at the best moment. Actions speak a lot, and an action that has been in the works for months leading to one special moment - even if it's just a simple sit down dinner at a new local restaurant - would mean so much to me. 
Obviously there's more that goes into people than MBTI. And if it's not dinner, or even money that's fine ... but he is likely putting in a lot of time and energy and effort into looking for a job, which is why he's getting frustrated - all that work, for what? 
And when he does get a job, all that work has ""paid off."" He can put his energy into something else now. And your gift of time and energy to him, congratulating him on succeeding after putting in all that time and energy - that's the important part. 
You got this! :D good luck to you two!"
819,estj,"Could be a nitpicky coworker, an overly critical partner...how do you typically respond? Has anyone ever ""outcontrolled"" you?
Let's you think their concerns are legitimate, they're just being a little too over-the-top, even for your tastes."
820,estj,"There is a difference between being given direction, and being controlled. If it‚Äôs genuine and I understand why it needs to be done I have no problem being told what to do. I‚Äôll even go above and beyond if I can think of ways to improve it. On the other hand, if it‚Äôs power tripping bull shit with no purpose I will either openly disagree or agree and find ways to get out of doing it/improve it so it‚Äôs worth my time. 
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being stubborn. Just realistic. "
821,estj,"I had a job once and had someone who wasn‚Äôt a manager but had extra duties and would go on massive power trips. 
She started micromanaging me to extremes. Get on me for things while practically ignoring it when others did it. Would follow me around constantly asking me what I was doing and then say I should be doing something else. 
I wasn‚Äôt sleeping and every thought of working with her  made me sick. 
I also got her in trouble before it got worse for texting others behind my back and encouraging others to boss me around. No one had that kind of authority over me. 
It was at a Starbucks in a Target and I basically pointed out to them that they made drinks wrong. I was trained in a real Starbucks. They were making huge mistakes and I just pointed it out. They didn‚Äôt like that. That‚Äôs what led her to micromanaging me. 
I fought back a little bit. Sometimes I would just walk off the floor since she made me feel like I was in the way. And honestly I just worked as hard as I could. 
I didn‚Äôt really do anything though and it just led up to me quitting. When my boss went on vacation I miraculously got an approved LOA for the same time. I knew it would be hell on earth with her there as the manager when he was gone. 
I don‚Äôt really care about being controlled. As long as I‚Äôm still given freedom. When my freedom is taken away that‚Äôs when I realize I need to either find a new job or find a way to fight back. 
Unrelated to work. I do NOT respond well to being controlled in relationships. 
When I was 18 my parents said I had to go to a certain school and do what they wanted or they would take my car keys and stop paying for me. I handed everything over. It lasted less than 24 hours before my dad (ESTJ) changed his mind. The more you try to control me the harder I push back. 
I just don‚Äôt like the thought of others making decisions for me. Let me fuck up on my own. Let me just learn on my own without you trying to decide what is best for me. 
Even if you are right I still just wanna do it on my own. "
822,estj,"If I get the sense that my spouse is trying to ""control"" me (this could just be having a really strong opinion on what they think I should do about something - my spouse doesn't ACTUALLY control me), I immediately want to do what I want to do even more than before. 
‚Äã
If it's at work, depending on the person's hierarchy in the company, I react in different ways. Above me: I'll do as I'm told and do it even better than they were asking. My equal (or possibly below me): fuck off. I'll take the time to hear them out but if I ultimately end up disagreeing then I'm doing what I want. "
823,estj,"ESTJ married for 15 years with the last 10 almost sexless. We have sex once every 6 weeks in the morning. We have 2 children 12 and 10 who are thriving. Therapy many times, wife not interested in sex any longer. Accepted she just doesn‚Äôt like sex and this is who she is. I love my wife and do not want to leave the marriage. I believe in our commitment and we complete each other in all other ways. Made the choice to keep my marriage in tact, outsource the sex. I no longer feel guilty for this as I have been faithful in our marriage and have tried over a decade to fix any issues. 
ESTJ‚Äôs have any of you experienced this situation? "
824,estj,"IMO, there are two reasons a woman's libido goes from average to nil. (I'm a woman.)  
1) Illness. Women's motivation for sex is heavily driven by hormones. Hormonal imbalance is a huge problem and often undiagnosed.  Depression, grief, thyroid, and other health  issues should be examined.  This was my first instinct until I read some of your comments.
2) You've hurt her emotionally.  She no longer wants any foreplay or affection ever. In my experience,  that only happens when I am emotionally hurt or just plain over it. I would suspect that she's not as into your marriage (emotionally) as you think she is.
Have you considered the thought that she may be seeking affection/sex elsewhere too? üôÅ"
825,estj,"Y'all are fucked up. You should have at least told her that that's where it was going. She should know the options, that's how solving a problem works. By having knowledge. 
You don't seem to understand what 'faithful' means. Nice job convincing yourself you're just 'outsourcing' sex when you're just doing this out of spite and resentment. Congrats for cheating on your wife, your kids are better off with you guys divorcing. You didn't try to solve the problem, you just acted on your selfish feelings."
826,estj,"Mostly I wonder what you‚Äôre teaching your kids through this. Are they learning what a healthy marriage looks like? Are they learning what self respect looks like? Is this the kind of marriage you would want them to have? 
Also, your wife sounds depressed, like she‚Äôs given up on herself and her own happiness. Or she‚Äôs stepping out on you too. Would that change how you feel about the situation? Would you be relieved or upset?
People are quick to judge, but these situations can be very gray. And I think Si and Fi both have a habit of staying the course long after the turning point."
827,estj,"I'm not a woman, and don't claim to be an expert on women, but I do have a relationship with an ESTJ. Maybe your natural tendencies to do what is functional and efficient are keeping you from actions that make you sexually attractive to her? Some personality types are more likely to need a deeper motive for sexual attraction then ESTJ's naturally provide. Read ""the way of the superior man"" by David Deida.
Also, you pretty obviously don't know that it is basically impossible to truly hide the fact that you're cheating from a woman. Even if she has no proof, she will still feel a little bit leery. Women are defonitely not sexually attracted to someone who makes them feel betrayed or unloved."
828,estj,"How does she not expect you to go elsewhere for sex? If she isn‚Äôt going to give you it. 
She can‚Äôt be that stupid. 
I personally would at least share with her and be like, you either allow me to have sex with other people or we separate/divorce. 
Sex isn‚Äôt something you just take out of a relationship and expect the other party to be cool with it. 
I‚Äôd honesty just end it. I don‚Äôt want someone to stay and have sex because I need it. I want you to at least enjoy it and want it. If you say we either have sex or we get divorced she might just have sex just so she doesn‚Äôt have to end the marriage but that‚Äôs even worse imo. 
I‚Äôm female btw. And sexual compatibility is a must. "
829,estj,"Also, this is a huge warning sign for you! Women start to withdraw long before they're at the point of leaving a relationship, often hoping that the act of drawing away from you will elicit a response of pursuit that they are secretly hoping to get. "
830,estj,"No. She is traditional and would not take kind to this idea. 
Our life revolves around our children. Once they become you teenagers and move on, I‚Äôm wondering what the dynamics will look like. 
What would circumstances would move you to divorce?"
831,estj,"Honestly ten years is almost too weird. How long did you go without sex before you got it elsewhere? 
You think you value your family, but going behind their backs like that will destroy any trust they have. If you get divorced you‚Äôll probably get nothing, if it‚Äôs found that you‚Äôve cheated. 
Your kids won‚Äôt understand your perspective because they would almost have wanted you to just divorce her instead of just cheating all these years. 
You fucked up. Sexuality compatibility is important but you can‚Äôt justify what you are doing, not for 10 years. Once you felt the need to seek sex elsewhere was when  it was over. Your aren‚Äôt putting your family values first, you‚Äôre putting yourself first. 
I get that you need sex but you should have just divorced her years ago. 
Also, how long did you date before getting married? Did you at one point have a lot of sex? Did it change suddenly? Cause that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm curious about. "
832,estj,Have you tried to make sex more pleasurable for her? Show her and work with her to make sex something she actually wants. Getting to the root of that issue might help. Very few people are actually opposed to sex. Good luck.
833,estj,"Married 16 years with 10 of those with zero affection and rare duty sex. She doesn‚Äôt even touch me want to have any type of touch between us. Otherwise everything is great.
Active sex life for the first 3 or 4 years with a slow decline. "
834,estj,"Idk man. If she wanted to play ping pong, my guess is you probably would. And would even find a way to enjoy it.
However, ping pong isn't one of the fundamental elements that define a romantic relationship, at least by my definition. And sex is. Again, by my definition. I couldn't be in a relationship without it, as it would cause resentment that would seep into other areas.
This is all my perspective, however, and I'm just 30 and unmarried with no children. But waiting around hopefully for a decade, while cheating on the side, just doesn't sound at all healthy to me. "
835,estj,"I'm a huge gamer nerd, and especially fond of Nintendo. Favorites include the Legend of Zelda series, Metroid, Shadow of the Colossus, etc. Also love the multiplayer classics like Mario Kart and Smash. Recently obsessed with Splatoon."
836,estj,"ESTJs are stereotyped big time. I'm definitely ESTJ but I'm really not hard to deal with and have a ton of friends and acquaintances. 
Stereotypes -
Bossy - I'm not bossy, but I do lead by example. I'll either make suggestions and/or use facts to prove I'm right about something. If that doesn't go over well then I'm really not all about anyone's weird emotional reaction to truth so I'll just leave you alone (but I may think you're irrational). 
Hard to deal with - I make a point of being friendly with everyone. The ESTJ in me sees that as a tactic to success. No one can get anywhere having a ton of enemies. 
Controlling - I think I want to control things, but again, obviously trying to control everything is always very apparent and usually rejected. I think I control things with charisma and being friendly/trustworthy. I also try to come from a place of facts and in my experience it's worked well for me because it's indisputable. 
Malicious - No. I may think of 1001 ways to get revenge, but I'll never do it. Maybe that's a really unhealthy ESTJ?
Heartless - I don't want anyone to be screwed and I actually have a problem with making people's problems MY problems - as in problem-solving for them. This has not gone well quite often. When someone has a problem I usually see a solution to it and try to help. I've learned that some people don't want a solution, which is extremely hard for me to relate to but I recognize it.
By the book, rule follower - No no no. I do stick with my tried and true methods of getting things done because it always works for me, and I know that it's not efficient to rewrite the playbook. With that said, I'm very innovative in the sense that I build upon the rules and in many ways that breaks the rules. 
Uptight/no fun - No way. I'm always the first to do things and the last to leave.
Bully - Nah. When has being a bully actually brought you real success? The kind of success that you're proud of?
ESTJ WORST NIGHTMARE - 
^ Yeah, that part is me.
Do you think that ESTJs are just easily identifiable when they're unhealthy?"
837,estj,"Here's my feedback and observations on my ESTJ friends and past SO's.
Bossy - ESTJs do lead by example. I think the bossy aura comes from ESTJs often knowing and expressing what they think should happen in a situation. So they're vocal and actually a bit steadfast in what they think is right. So that could come off to some as bossy.
Hard to deal with - Friendly yes. Very friendly, even to strangers. My ESTJ friends and SO's always make an effort to say hi to even strangers, like your not-so-close neighbors you come across in the midst of your morning routine. ESTJs are hard to deal with during friendly arguments, though. In my experience, it's actually pretty easy to offend ESTJs, so I try not to bring up my opinions on things that I know they feel completely different about.
Controlling - They're chronic planners. Plan A, B, and C. Reliable. Not sure about controlling. ESTJs do freak out when things don't go as planned, but I appreciate their internal need to be prepared at all times. 
Malicious - No.
Heartless - Nope. Babies at heart.
By the book, rule follower - Uh... I think ESTJs are by the book because they value structure, respect authority and status. Rule-follower, not so sure...
Uptight/no fun - Not really.
Bully - Hmm.. I do think ESTJs have very strong opinions on people, and when they don't like someone, they really dislike him/her. But I can't imagine ESTJs actually bullying someone or intentionally make their life inconvenient. Being a bully isn't an MBTI thing; it's just a bad person thing.
I do think ESTJ women and ESTJ men are very different, though. Which one are you?"
838,estj,"I'm definitely an ESTJ woman and I suck at being a stereotypical ESTJ. For example, most people would describe me as ""really warm and friendly"". I care about others, just to an extent and not a gushy way - I'm interested in other people's thoughts and social energy, their wellbeing etc. I think it's all about being balanced. 
I have a lot of N friends, too, but ultimately seem to get along more with 1) ISFJs, 2) ESTPs or ISTPs, 3) ISFPs, 4) ESFJs. INTPs, ENTPs and ENFPs just flock to me for some reason and we get along well. I'm not a corporate person: I can be artistic, like exploring and discovering new stuff, and I'm in a STEM field. However, I'm also most definitely an S: quite rigid, very traditional, athletic, notice the little details, focussed on fashion/superficial things, dose off when N-s go on long tangents about some theory I'm not exactly interested in, but I can and will engage in the discussions for momentary fun, I'm just not taking it seriously."
839,estj,"I think it's because corporate culture tends to reward the less pro social aspects of ones personality, and the past-oriented Si over relies upon this as a solution. Over time, ESTJs can become a stereotype without  properly developed Ne. "
840,estj,"What I was saying is we're battling our ""inner"" selves. So when you say we're all the same on the inside, I was agreeing with you because yes, we are all the same on the inside. We're battling our inner selves and so when we're ""cool and chill"" on the outside, we're all likely struggling on the inside. I then was saying that the only problem is that some of us act with our ""bad"" selves and so that's when the stereotypes are real. 
Do you get what I'm saying now?"
841,estj,I was broken up with in December of 2016 and I'm still dealing with it. I'm fiercely loyal in my relationships and still think about my ex too much. Just do things for yourself and give it time. It'll slowly get better. Hope that helps.
842,estj,"Yeah, my last serious break up took me about 11 months to get over, mostly because we would still get together occasionally and it would open old wounds. Looking back now, I think the reason it hurt so much is because I take break ups way too personally and see it as my affection not being reciprocated, even if I know it was for the best.
I would suggest finding someone to talk to about it that isn't going to get too annoyed with you but will also call you out on your shit. Talking about it helped me process it and I don't think I could truly get over the breakup until I fully understood it."
843,estj,"I broke up with my girlfriend on January 15th, 2017. Felt really down the first day, then started analyzing how she really would be a liability and wasn't right for me. 
Was 100% okay on the 3rd day. "
844,estj,"I'm an ENTP/ENFP. I work as an engineer designing, building and commissioning systems for customers.
At the site of my biggest project, the foreman I have to work with is an ESTJ with an unhealthy bullying tendency, and he has identified me as the greatest threat to order and righteousness in his universe.
The problem is, he isnt wrong. He doesn't have much expertise in the fields I work in, and the stuff I work with is all very complicated. Everything I'm implementing in the field threatens his control over his sphere of influence.
During the process, he has also given me bad information multiple times that has caused setbacks on the commissioning of the system. Each time, he has insisted that the problems are my fault, only to be proven wrong every time. 
Worst of all (and where I realize in hindsight that I screwed this up) I'm not the most developed EN-P myself. I get butt-hurt like and ENFP when I feel like I'm being bullied, and sarcastic like an ENTP when I'm right about something in an argument. I'm basically a firestorm of all the stuff you guys hate when I'm being bullied by someone who doesn't know what they're talking about. It's not just that we butt heads, it's that we bring out the absolute worst in one another because his bullying brings out my problems with being dominated, and my smart-ass arrogance brings out his righteous ass-kicking mode.
It's a shitty situation because I know that I want this system to work as much as he does. I just can't work with him trying to control everything without the necessary information, and I know he can't handle giving control of his realm to some smart-ass that's throwing a bunch of chaotic shit into his world that he doesn't have control over.
We are at the point now that our company is sending a technician to the field instead of me to gather the information, then I provide the fix and the tech implements it. It's a frustration for everyone involved.
First answer I need, is there a fix for this situation? This guy is a really strongly judging ESTJ who takes pride in dominating and diminishing people he sees as beneath him. I'm pretty sure he has made up his mind about me, but I'd like any input on what it would take to change his mind if possible, because it would help a lot of people, including him and me.
Second, how do I adjust my mindset to handle any future customers (or anyone else I can't ignore, avoid or fight) with this personality type? What's the best way to show you guys that finding the answers is part of the process, and not a sign of incompetence? How can I give you the control you need in a situation where I'm the one with information and ability that's outside of your direct control? How can I show you that there's a method to my madness that is guided by the same values and principles that guide you? And how do I avoid becoming the target of bullying from an unhealthy ESTJ?
Be brutal. I'm trying to approach this with the objectivity of my ENTP half, and my ENFP half needs to grow a pair, so don't worry about sparing my feelings (as if I have to ask LOL)."
845,estj,"Well I'll take a whack at it! :)
First of all, like you mentioned, if he's a bully then he's definitely an under-developed ESTJ, but here's some stuff that helps me out when dealing with people that I don't see eye to eye with.
Number one, and I mean NUMBER ONE, if he is a strong SJ like I am, we do NOT do well dealing with concepts/theory/abstract. I need solid, tested examples of why your suggestion will work. I want data, I want graphs, I want to be able to see proof in front of me that this is worth implementing and not ""a bunch of empty philosophizing that doesn't accomplish anything"" (that's what it'll sound like to us otherwise lol). Some people hear an idea and can automatically picture how it will all work in the big scheme of things. ESTJs are not those people (even just writing that sentence I feel like it's unclear and doesn't make sense because it's too conceptual lol).
There's a lot of things that your ESTJ bully could do on his end to make things better, but since we can't change him right now let's focus on what you can do.
One thing that stood out to me is that you said he ""takes pride in dominating and diminishing people he sees as beneath him."" I can understand why it feels that way, but maybe a better understanding of what he thinks he's doing will help: It actually isn't as much about power/control with ESTJs as people think. It's about helping keep the universe secure, efficient, and orderly (that reads, Peaceful, Happy, and Healthy to an ESTJ). When we see something that doesn't make sense to us and someone pushing it as a superior alternative, until we can be convinced otherwise with lots of data, concrete examples, and logical analysis, we see that someone an a threat to efficiency, and we are happy to squish them -- not because we think they're beneath us, but because we have successfully policed a situation that could disturb the security, harmony, and efficiency of our environment. Nothing makes us happier and more fulfilled than accomplishment, and something that we perceive as getting in the way of accomplishment is the bane of our existence.
So what YOU have to do is convince this guy that your way is more efficient. This won't be easy. ESTJs are notoriously stubborn. ESTJs don't mind conflict though -- it's a natural, objective process for us -- but the second you get emotionally involved in an argument ESTJs will shut down on you. You have to treat the conflict as a means to exchange data and information quickly, logically, and efficiently, and remember that anything concept/abstract will sound like white noise to an ESTJ, and any emotional input makes us uncomfortable, tired, and we mentally check out.
People say ESTJs can't be convinced but that's not really true. We aren't EASILY convinced, but if you put the effort into presenting your data the way we understand it and leaving emotions out of it, it can be done! :) And I'm a girl, so I'm an emotional creature, so when I say leave the emotions out of it, that's saying something, right? :D
Also I thought you expressed yourself well when you said ""How can I show you that there's a method to my madness that is guided by the same values and principles that guide you?"" Have you thought of asking your problem ESTJ this exact question? That might give him pause and might give you answers. Never hurts to try.
Well that was a big ramble but I really hope it helps you figure out something to make your life easier! Feel free to ask anything else."
846,estj,"Tell him he's doing a good job but it would be even better and efficient if he would listen to your proposal, and then you insert hard data and evidence for your claims and argument them in the most logical way possible. For example telling him your procedure gives more insight since it means more than just meets the eye (and you detail). Something along those lines. "
847,estj,"The two challenges here that have to do with the process of exchanging the information in question.
First, I'm a really strong intuitive perceiver. It literally took me an hour to filter my OP to the point that it's no longer identifiable as stoner wank by your average SJ. Keeping it facts based without theory takes so much concentration for me, that doing it in real time isn't something I can manage consistently, despite my best efforts.
Second, and far worse, is the fact that the systems I design are all one-off custom creations. They use established technologies, but those technologies have to be programmed by hand for every individual job, and that programming is so complex that ""getting it right the first time"" requires absolute perfect information flow and execution that literally never, ever happens in the real world. Every single system has to be commissioned on site, and the bugs worked out for weeks, and sometimes months, before it is 100%.
It's actually why I chose my career path in the first place. Few people can handle the sheer amount of creative problem solving and intuitive theory craft it takes to implement these systems, but I'm perfect for it because there is no random quirk the equipment can exhibit that I can't figure out and correct.
But it's a total nightmare for this super. The process of implementing these systems is  basically organized professional Calvinball. The systems are worth millions of dollars in increased productivity for the processes we install them in, but the chaos involved in implementing it is just unacceptable for this guy, and I don't know how to convince him that I'm on his team.
On the other hand, I can definitely handle clearing out the emotion. I'm pretty balanced between ENFP and ENTP, and ENTP's are some of the best at looking at things without emotion."
848,estj,"I'm sorry you had a bad experience. She sounds like she had major problems. But I would only say that I'd warn against cutting out an entire ""type"" because of that. The MBTI is cool and everything, but everyone is an individual and you can't really group people's entire self into four letters, only their preferences.
For example, I'm a REALLY strong ESTJ on all four letters, but my Mom is an ENFP, my Dad is an INTP, my Husband is an ENFJ and most of my really good friends are either NFPs or NFJs. I don't understand them sometimes, and I'm sure they feel that way about me, but having spent so much time with people whose preferences are drastically different than mine has broadened my horizons and made me a more balanced person."
849,estj,"Well I certainly sympathize with you. It sounds like your ESTJ buddy is working outside his skill set whether he realizes it or not, and I can only imagine how crabby that makes him.
I can't really think of any solutions for that work situation since I don't have any experience with it, BUT I will say that I think zeroing in on the fact that you're both guided by the same values and principles could help. My Dad is a really strong NP (and also a programmer), and when we talk, I can hardly understand him half the time since, like you, he prefers to speak in conceptual terms and my poor little boxed in brain can't process it. But because we trust one another and have strong, similar values and function on the same principles, we work together well (usually in separate corners lol).
Ideally both of you would work together to achieve this, both coming 50-50 in building your mutual trust and respect of the way the other functions and understanding them and then meeting in the middle. Though it might feel vulnerable, taking a good whack at honest communication might help the situation a lot.
But if this guy really is just an unhealthy bully, you might be on your own, which means twice the work for you. = If only you guys had a mediator who could referee. Maybe couple's counseling? =D"
850,estj,"Yes, I hear you. Sorry if I came off as too generalizing. You're right that everyone is an individual, but I think I am worried of going through that experience again. I know I don't like being misunderstood or constantly criticized/controlled.  I also know my extreme people-pleasing allowed her to trample on me, so I'm working on that. It's my responsibility to set boundaries.   
There very well could be great ESTJ's that I haven't met yet.  If someone had a horrible experience with an Infj, I could empathize with why they would be weary of me. "
851,estj,"It's good for me to meet more people with the healthy for of the personality type. I'm not a judger by nature anyway, but it helps to talk to a broader range of folks to give me more perspective overall."
852,estj,"I agree with most of the ESTJ values in theory, but in person I go blank when I try to talk to them.  I can be very articulate when given some encouragement, but I work by mirroring (INFJ) and trying to vibe with one is like being dumped in an ice bath.  I get depressed when people conclude that I'm stupid and inferior, so I just avoid the type.
I envy their air of command.  It irritates me that the one type whose assets I really covet I can't even approach.  But, I suppose dealing with what amount to space aliens from my perspective is good for seeing what I usually don't look at.  So, hmm.  It's just that I can see them rationally concluding that what's good for society is a bullet in my head.  Maybe I'm too paranoid."
853,estj,"So what this question is implying is that if my kid is kind they‚Äôll be stupid or if my kid is smart they‚Äôll be an asshole. And I have to pick one or the other. And if I pick kind I‚Äôm more inclined to test as a feeler and if I pick smart I‚Äôll be a thinker. 
This is why 16 personalities is the worst test, which is where this question came from. And why most people think mbti is a joke. "
854,estj,"Smart, although a trade off between the two traits can potentially yield disturbing extremes. Smart + totally unkind can yield an intelligent sociopath; a kind + totally not smart person will likely fall for a lot of scams, etc. Then, you'd have smart + neutral in kindness, and kind + average intelligence... hmm. Maybe kind but of average intelligence isn't so bad, but being smart and just not an asshole isn't really bad, either."
855,estj,That‚Äôs what we need- more people taking advantage of the world (intense sarcasm). Smart and unkind people cannot see the wrongdoing they commit in the world but kind and ‚Äúnot smart‚Äù people can still sense they are being taken advantage of and they can do something about it. You don‚Äôt have to be smart to stand up for yourself. Also the fact that you‚Äôd rather see your child take advantage of others is highly disturbing- a child can learn to shield themselves from being taken advantage of but a child that grows up having that bullying behavior supported will grow into a monster. 
856,estj,"How I use Si.
{I'm ESTJ so I guess it makes sense I posted this in r/ESTJ }
By Nora herself
To me, introverted sensing is focusing on inconsistencies, what that means is always focusing on minor details and comparing it to what you know that this object or the thing happening, for example: Lets say I was talking to a person, I'm already making a pattern and memorizing how they are talking, and when I learn more about this person, I sort of have a map in mind, so sooner or later, I start noticing any inconsistencies or changed in this person's behaviour or look, in how they talk, move, or etc (Especialy since these are traits or factors I generally pay attention to).
So so far you gathered that it's about looking for inconsistencies and constantly noticing minor details, but what about my memory? Well I'd say memory is not that relelvant to Si, but it's very common they have a good memory. I can still remember many of my dreams of many years ago in great details, I can still recall the feeling of foods on my tongue that I've tried years ago, I can recall lots of moments and feelings that I perish and loved within that moment, which is why I'd be happy to experience many types of moments and can often live in the past because I can suffer certain nostalgia for certain sensations or emotions.
I'm pretty stubborn and kind of hate change too, mainly the political or sociological one, for example how the word nigga (at least in MY AREA) suddenly became offensive. I strongly state that I don't care what you suddenly find offensive (disclaimer I don't swear much anyways though), you loser were using this word all your life and I will not change just because you suddenly became a pussy. Same goes to most SJW related topics.
Something that I do not find relatable about most Si users that they're really good or useful for is how they care about wisdom, or learning from past mistakes, I'm too impulsive and don't really care to ""analyse"" or ""think about"" my past, like yeah I know shit happened, but who cares, I want to experience and do this thing right now, and whatever happens happens, I can fix it anyways and it won't probably be my fault anyways.
Oh and I easily notice it when people look different too, even if it's a minor change.
 Written with much love and greatness,
   Nora
"
857,estj,"This post was good and informative till the 3rd paragraph, at that point you sound very idiotic and uneducated.
The word nigga is offensive due to history of whites saying it on racist terms and implications to blacks. Get over your self and off your high horse, not everyone is pussy people just have respect."
858,estj,HAA GAY!!!! üòÇ ü§î
859,estj,"Most people ""guard their words"" in some way or another to avoid offending people, it's not exclusive to this word. And why would you want to use it anyway? Some black people call each other that because they share the experience of being ""black"", it's the same thing as calling one of your parents an idiot behind their backs, you and your siblings can get away with it, but if someone else was to do that you would probably not like it"
860,estj,"No need to replace it. Just erase it from your vocabulary. If it's that important to you, or if you think it would mess with the flow of a song, say ""person/people"". If you hear the word being used by other non-black people, consider calling them out by telling them its history, too.
Everyone's stubborn about something. It would help you to reflect why you've chosen to stop using the n-word simply because everyone else has stopped. Why not change? Imagine if you changed for the better and no one accepted it."
861,estj,"If nobody picked up your ""obvious joke"", you fucked up, don't accuse others.
Everything else about you and your profile seem to confirm you're cringy and full of yourself. This isn't instagram or twitter."
862,estj,Yeah but if people within the community who it would be disrespectful to use such a phrase against are using it within their circles without any offense it seems that it‚Äôs not that offensive when it‚Äôs used within their own group. Look at popular rap and it‚Äôs usage of the phrase. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs okay to say it but I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre being offended in general does not mean people are as sensitive about it as you. 
863,estj,"If nobody picked up a joke it‚Äôs not always because of the person delivering it, although for practical reasons everyone should be careful with their words BECAUSE people can misinterpret things due to either being too stupid, jumping to conclusions, triggering an association that angers them, offending someone who is sensitive (or for a more ‚Äújustified‚Äù reason) or any other reason. Not alway but sometimes you gotta watch your words because some people are stupid and they‚Äôll misinterpret you and it‚Äôll take away from the main point you‚Äôre making. You see how everyone is stuck on this? Instead of the Si stuff."
864,estj,"This was only a person, the other part or comment hadn't to do with what that person commented on, and the other one is clearly my bad which I have admitted to. But if you wanna act morally superior or woke, then perhaps this isn't the place for you either. "
865,estj,"My view would be more like we don't care if people get offended, because people will be offended no matter what, they will find a way to be. However if you have as a goal to communicate something and nobody picks it up, that's in your interest to adapt. Here this isn't just a failed joke, but more someone trying to back pedal."
866,estj,"""Hell-yeahing""? Sure he's not flying to save the world from a giant space monster getting ready to eat fucking New York City? The person he is riding is actually a highly intellectual space horse, sent from a parallel universe to find a larger supply of apples and carrots before all horses in his dimension die of starvation. 
The monster accidentally fell through the inter-dimensional portal when he came and now the only way to save earth, and all apples and carrots, is to work together with said human to establish peace over our world once more, so he can finally return to his horse-overlords. 
Can we get a physics major in here to correct me on the logistics of this? "
867,estj,"What are some ways you use Ne? 
Some ways I've observed in my ESTJ friend:

Vivid sensory descriptions
Humor, puns, wit
Playful flirting, innuendos
Sexual - Roleplay, D/s heavy sexting :P

So far, mostly when he's in a relaxed mood. "
868,estj,"When I'm working on a project, it's primarily used to serve Te. I'll come up with a bunch of ideas, and Te will say ""yes, that could work"" or ""no, that's unrealistic"". It also helps find possible ways that things could go wrong, so I can make sure to plan for all possibilities (seriously, I'm like the ultimate contingency planner).
Around my NP friends, particularly NFP friends, is when it's most developed. I really like exploring different conceptual possibilities and ideas for recreational purposes, just following a trail of thought and see where it goes. However, I become stressed if I have something practical that needs to get done, so this is limited to recreation.
I really like learning new things and just educating myself, but I think it's in a more Te and Si way than a Ne way. That being said, lately, I've become a little obsessed with this Youtube channel, which just has a bunch of different math problems to work through with often very creative and elegant solutions (ignore their most popular videos, however, they're mostly clickbait and cash-grabs). Although I've always done well at math in school and such, I've never really been forced to try thinking of creative, novel solutions to problems, and I think it's really challenging and pushing my Ne. Also, if you go down the rabbit hole of math problems like I did, ignore the narcissistic twelve-year-olds in the comment sections.
I think that's about it. Obviously, I use Ne more than that in my life, but I think those are the most common uses."
869,estj,"Well, since it's our tertiary function, ESTJs are sort of tardy to the party on Ne because we don't typically start developing it until we're adults. So, as an ESTJ who knows some Ns, I'm well aware that their intuitive abilities are way ahead of mine. 
That being said. based on personal observations, Ne works with our Si, because we are pretty good at logging concrete facts and experiences, and when you notice multiple instances of similar things occurring, Ne connects them and helps you see the patterns in play and figure out the commonalities and why these things occur. 
For example, Ne makes me pretty good at learning languages, because I can pick up on common root words and grammatic similarities between them. 
On a more abstract level, I believe it helps us ESTJs develop people skills and empathy. We're not known for picking up people's emotional energy or understanding motivations that don't fall in line with our way of thinking. But when we see patterns of behavior, Ne can help us connect those to possible motivations in play beyond the ESTJ factory default of ""This person just doesn't know what the Right Thing to do is. I shall tell them."" (This goes about as well as you would think.)
Also, I'm funny as hell. Thanks, Ne! "
870,estj,"Yeah, I am an ESTJ and I can be pretty relaxed too. I can joke around a lot, usually off work or school, type of thing. Sometimes in school, the moment just when I am not trying to learn. I am currently in school and one my professor I think he‚Äôs ENTP think I am generally am pretty fun to be around. When he points out something I am good at making a joke sort of mocking it or making light of it. Usually when he‚Äôs not teaching or giving an opinion.
Professor: Well, I see the desks are really pushed back today.
Me: Perhaps it‚Äôs like a stage. Maybe you could jump some hoops or dance for us? Hahahaha! Or something like, Yeah, good idea, pack us like sardines, maybe you can do something impressive up there Professor Savoie.
Or professor Savoie: tells us something funny. I think someone was asking him something about if we need to tell him when we need to go to the bathroom and he shared with us a story where in elementary school they needed to tell the teacher publically whether they were going number 1 or number 2. And I started laughing.
Me: hey, professor Savoie, don‚Äôt make me die laughing, now. I think I can do that. I think I am going to die of laughter here. You know my journalism class wouldn‚Äôt be very pleased with you.
Professor Savoie: Well, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone die laughing yet, You‚Äôd be the first.
Hahahahaha!
I have to know you well though. There‚Äôs little examples like that.
Oh I am disabilied and we were talking and I reached over for the bell.
Jenny: You always come in here and find the bell and you have to mess with it.
Me: yep, that‚Äôs right. I must.
There may have been more said, but victoria comes out.
Victoria: Oh, I‚Äôve just come to see if you guys need help I heard the bell.
Me: oh is that Victoria, hey!
Jenny: Oh it‚Äôs just Rachel ringing the bell she always finds it.
Victoria: so is it just we have to hide the bell from Rachel. Is that it, is it that simple?
Me: yep, that‚Äôs right, until I find it again. Hahahaha!
Or I sometimes go in there and ask Sandra something like
Oh sandra have you have your dose of salt and pepper pork chops yet?
Sandra: Well, no not yet, 
Sometimes it would be yes but pretend she said no
Me: Oh, well, I think it‚Äôs about time isn‚Äôt it?? You‚Äôre addicted to that thing. I mean. You order it everytime you call that place and order it.
Or It‚Äôs like
Me: Hey sandra, I am going to the salt and pepper pork chop place, have you had your fill yet? Jealous yet?
Sandra: You have a way of tempting me. Hahaha!
So it depends."
871,estj,"It‚Äôs definitely more pragmatic Ne but I use it a lot, I have a bit of a TE-Ne loop.
Firstly more expressly Ne, I write, journalism stuff and fanfiction, and creative writing, I am good at creative nonfiction. The journalism stuff the articles not so much the rest more so, especially fanfictions.
Also, possibilities is a bit one, as said by the other, thinking of all those ideas and trying to execute all of them. I am also a big person on going to make sure everything is working right, all the possibilities.
I am also fairly good at coming up with different articles to write, topics to discuss on a podcast type of thing."
872,estj,"I'm bonding with an ESTJ. I asked if we could read a book together, and he said yes! He asked me to pick the book, and I asked if we could pick together instead. So, we are each suggesting two. Ideas?"
873,estj,"My husband and I just took the tests, and supposedly he is an ESTJ and I am an INFJ. We both really enjoyed Way of Kings from the Stormlight Archives, by Brandon Sanderson. I think that is the one we have both most liked. Its fantasy genre. First couple chapters are difficult because the world is very unique, but after you adjust it is fantastic."
874,estj,"If he are a non-fiction science kind of guy, highly recommend the Martian, A Short History of Nearly Everything, The Science of Interstellar, The Sixth Extinction or Guns, Germs and Steel. 
Politics/Law/Economics nerd? How about America's Constitition by Akhil Reed Amar? Or The Supreme Court by J. Rehnquist? Or if you have a whole year to spend- Thomas Piketty's Capital is incredible.
General well-being- Marcus Aurelius' Meditations."
875,estj,"Not speaking about professional environments, as I think that people you can ""work with"" and people you can have fun with and get along at the same time might be different.
I'm an ESTJ, but personally I have no clue how to answer my own question."
876,estj,"I've found that despite our differences, I tend to attract a lot of female ENFP's (I'm a male ESTJ). My closest male friend is an INTJ and I think the reason we get along alc well is  because I'm intrigued with his method of thinking and I help him with being more productive on a day-to-day basis."
877,estj,"Best friend (m) is ENFP. So are two of my other male friends. They are witty, quick in their thinking and respectful. And honest, they will not spare me for the sake of the relationship when I ask their opinion in whatever matter. I appreciate that, it pretty much is what friendship means to me. 
My best female friend is INFJ, very very sensitive. She could easily manipulate me but knows she would loose me - and well where's the fun in orchestrating another person (my ex bf INTJ surely loved that though... ) She is my door to the touchy feely sensitive persons I'm having no patience with. I am the neutral person who can tell her how to react, to practise on me, to guard herself against incoming feelings of other people. She loves to think about revenge when being mistreated and I am happy to think up hilarious scenario's that will have her crying with laughter. 
My longest friendship is with an ENTJ. We are very neutral and business like in our conversations, she talks a lot about people I don't know and will probably never meet but hey, whatever. Futhermore she is a very closed person. But I know she knows she can always count on me. And I can always count on her, no questions asked. "
878,estj,"That's kind of surprising. My experience with INTJs is that they tend to think they have the best method, and tend to let efficiency suffer for what they consider to be superior strategy. At least in my own experience."
879,estj,"I don't know any ENFPs, but they sound interesting. My brother is an INTJ, and I know all about the orchestrating people stuff. He's really big into body language and psychology and such. Actually, he's the one who got me into the MBTI.
I also know some INFJs. They're very sweet, so long as you don't step on their toes too hard. But they tend to be pretty forgiving if you're good at making apologies, lol. I've also known an ENTJ for ages. We get along pretty well.
As far as my experience goes, I get along best with an ENTP that I've known for a long time, although we're not close, but we're polar opposites on everything, yet we can still talk and debate and get along pretty well."
880,estj,"ENFP's are interesting! Especially the adhd-version ;-) I am one of the few people who can follow his fast and unlogical 'logic'. And I admire the judgement of human nature of all three of them. They make sense, if you know what I mean. Where as I see every human being as a whole, as one system with a manual; they can sense what a specific person is like when asked, and back it up with theory and advice. How I love them for it..!"
881,estj,"Does this ENFP tend to jump from topic to topic to topic really fast. Because I know a guy that talks a mile a minute, and we're into a lot of the same stuff, but he moves so fast I can't keep up! Although I wouldn't say he seems to fit into this unlogical logic you're speaking. Maybe that's the adhd talking, lol.
Yeah, I know what you mean. I think each type sees the world in its own way and has very interesting insights. INFJs have killer intuition when it comes to people. I've been really surprised by them a few times. I'm really interested in INFPs since they have all the same functions as us ESTJs but in reverse, but damn if I can actually get them to talk! They never initiate, and that stereotype seems to be accurate!"
882,estj,"Haha just post your question on an INFP thread. Most people tend to talk about themselves, so maybe a question about how in hell they got to be at this gathering/party/whatever? 
(And yes it's more the adhd component that makes this ENFP fast jumping from topic to topic.)"
883,estj,"Eyes you askance. I'm not so sure that your experience is just you... 
Sorry you've had that sort of bf experience though. That sucks. I often tease my brother about INTJs being a ""problem personality."" But the worst type is the INTP. At least for my ESTJ-ness."
884,estj,"Just hung up the phone with my INFP friend (f)! She reminded me she was INFP so i asked what would be a triggering question for her. She answered: ""everything relating to a passion, like what is your passion. Or about dreams."" So you can start a conversation about 'this strange dream you had and that you are searching for a good book or site to help you explain your dream'. 
Well that could be a question later in the convo, but there you have it. "
885,estj,"Oh, I've made a post on the INFP board here on reddit. I've also been looking at archived forums posts and such on them. I suppose this fellow I know that I described as jumping from topic to topic that really wears me out might not be an ENFP. He does seem like more of a T than an F. It's funny, our convos are so blunt a more sensitive person might think we were insulting each other."
886,estj,"I have one INFP friend. I haven't stepped on her toes. Yet... But we haven't really gotten into any deep conversations, so I guess that's why? As an ESTJ, I feel like I have to watch my step around certain types - the more emotionally sensitive types. I've been trying to work on that. I think being friends with them can actually help build our Fi function. INFP might be really good, since Fi is their dominant function, and Te their inferior. We're reverse, and so I would thing INFP and ESTJ would be a good match for growth. I made a post about that on the INFP subreddit. A lot of INFPs agreed with me.
Do you get along well with your INFP?"
887,estj,"I get along great with my INFP :-) I just have to remind myself that she is too romantic, believes in LOVE (instead of sometimes see a manipulator). She is quiet yet funny, and is a stunning beauty who isn't the least arrogant. She's into esotherical things, all kind of vague stuff like astrology - but knows a lot about it so it seems to make some sense :-)
I can be blunt and outspoken with her. I have to be careful around the sensitive types though, just like you. Haven't found the right way to do so, but an open and loving approach seems to work."
888,estj,"Yeah... I don't know any INTP's but I do know my ex worked long and hard to develop his social skills. I can wholehartedly state he is wearing a mask. Though he loves cats. 
Ah well I could go on and on about the negative side of him, but that stems probably more from his autism and anxious binding (or what is it the exact description) with his parents, and the co-dependancy he used to be in with his ex-wife üòê"
889,estj,"Well, I have a huge soft spot for romantic stuff, admittedly. Though I don't show it! They would be the type to get themselves into trouble, over looking what is obviously a bad match for them in favor of romance. I can get frustrated with that sort of thing, then again, not necessarily. It all just depends.
It's kind of funny. We have to practice not stepping on toes, and they have to practice (or at least they should!) being more logical/rational. For the love of the gods, please! lol"
890,estj,"He likes cats? Exactly. He fits the scheming archtype perfectly. Just picture it. Hand in a black leader glove stroking the cat. Mmmhm!
You would thing that the simply replacing of a J with a P would be easy, but the cognitive stack is completely changed when you do that, resulting in a very different personality."
891,estj,"I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ESTJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there?"
892,estj,"I‚Äôm no expert on the matter, but I believe that ESTJ‚Äôs are commonly mistaken as rigid due to our auxiliary Si. It‚Äôs viewed as something that clings to ‚Äútraditional views.‚Äù Having said that, I personally believe that most other types are overlooking the way ESTJ‚Äôs use it.
From what I know about myself, I‚Äôm by no means Conservative or Right-Wing on most issues, with the exception of guns and balancing the budget. I believe my Si is more a tool that says ‚ÄúHey, this works and it‚Äôs proven. So, why change it? 
The flip side of that: I see things that don‚Äôt work, for example, privatized healthcare and see that single-payer and multi-payer systems in other developed nations works in reducing costs, covering more people and increasing access across the board. 
I don‚Äôt cling to tradition for the sake of thing not changing. Instead, I cling to proven solutions and struggle to change if I believe it to be unnecessary. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask me any questions.
Sorry if that was long-winded."
893,estj,"That's a very broad question. However as for me I am very conservative by my country's standards. And I definitely connect that with my SJ-personality. I am pretty earth bound and find most left wing policies to be rooted in utopianism. I also trust my own judgement very much, which I guess count's for the ""very"" part. I like hierarchies, strong morals and authority and would like to see more of that, not less.  "
894,estj,"Personally, I see myself as a moderate. 
That said, I actually sympathize with the philosophical aspect of conservatism, as in ""don't fix what is not broken"", ""reformation instead of revolution"", ""change? yes, but just one step after another"", ""Power should be decentralized and decisions need to be constitutional"", etc.
I can't stand most right wingers though. From my point of view, they want to experiment with the system just as much as the left wingers do. Forcing their unworldly ideologies upon everyone of us."
895,estj,"I wouldn't consider myself right wing or conservative. I consider myself moderate and somewhat traditional, especially within my own party (registered Democrat). I'm not against change, but I do place value on how things have traditionally worked and advocate for moderate reforms vs. radical change.
For example, I'm not into overhauling things such as the electoral college, a complete ban on the 2A, or handing out ""free"" things like college education. To the latter, I'm over this pro-socialism wave (and I am a Democrat millennial) which ties back to my ESTJ personality of believing that hard work will get you far and you should work for what you earn.
I think there's definitely validity in tradition but I also think progress can be good, in moderate steps with attainable goals. I don't believe in overhauling the system that's worked since inception, but I believe there's lots of areas to be better in. I should add that I work in lobbying so I work a lot with both Ds and Rs which definitely contributes to my ""moderate"" views and willingness to be bipartisan on things."
896,estj,"ESTJ values tradition, things that should be that way because of tradition etc. So they would rarely be ""progressive"".
Also they value logic, facts more than average (as some left wing policies are objectively anti logic)."
897,estj,"Okay yes it‚Äôs the si part si is not actually rigid but it‚Äôs seen as that way because no one really knows or understand si. I am far from rigid just common sensical and pragmatic. I may go for the old or something I am familiar at first but I can change. If I change I can become scattered but I will do it. I will answer your question, but I‚Äôll give you a real life example.
I was going downtown today and I assumed it was opened. I was going to go there because I‚Äôve ordered from there and it was good. So the familiar. I was half way there and took a look. They were no longer in business. Okay now what? I was taking buses. So I looked up lunch spots. And then thought about it, hmmm. I don‚Äôt really want mexican today. I wasn‚Äôt opposed to it. I was going to go to a vegan place at first so I looked up another one. And how to get there. On the process I got off and on a total of 4 buses. Three changes. Because si no longer works I have to use nae. I am okay but not the best at it. I got off and on really quickly at consecutive stops all of the buses stopped at all three stops so I was good actually. But i ended up going to a vegan place. Not a big deal I didn‚Äôt go to my first choice of restaurant. I am often like that there is a default but if that default does not work I am okay and sometimes I will try other stuff if recommended when I feel up to it. Some times more some times less. I get use to new environments really quickly. After I tell you what I am going to tell you maybe you‚Äôll be surprised by my lunch option.
I also don‚Äôt want you to generalize. STJs are widely distributed I don‚Äôt think all of us are one party or another. I also know a conservative ENTJ and she knows ENTJs who are on all sorts of stances. So yeah. Also s types doesn‚Äôt mean conservative and neither does the for si aux or dom types. I‚Äôve actually seen more liberal xstjs on here or xsfjs and it‚Äôs not uniform. I‚Äôve also seen all types of religions for xstj and xsfjs.
Personally though. I am super conservativve, very much so yes. I am an american conservative. I am closer to tea party though. I am a conservative Christian too. Some people would call me a fundamentalist. I subscribe to right winged ideals in the government. I think for one that prayer should be still in schools. We do it in congress. I support trump. My candidate of choice was CRuz who‚Äôs actually NOT ESTJ he‚Äôs ENTJ. I liked him for his ideas though and I hope he‚Äôd run again. I am a political science major. I am now in contact with the trump campaign in Los Angeles county where I live. Yes a really blue area. I hope to volunteer with them. I am working with a conservative woman who‚Äôs running for senate seat here. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs ESTJ. Hahaha! I am an extremely outspoken conservative.
Please remember it‚Äôs only some of us."

- Moving

Here is the form.
I really appreciate your help. And if you are really interested in statistics, here is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from ""INFP"" in cell A3, to ""ESTJ"" if you want to see your statistics. ESTJ Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs."
902,estj,"Im married to my husband since 28 years. Our only daughter is 18 (soon 19). She didn‚Äôt started to date until recently as she is very introverted and pretty shy. My husband and I both agreed that we would have allowed her to date far earlier, but she never had any interest in dating. My daughter is great and I am really proud of her. She is not only very smart and conscientious but also really sweet and nice to everyone. I just sometimes wish she would be less shy. 
Four months ago our daughter started to date a guy whom I will call Noah. He is really kind and caring and also very understanding of her insecurities. He is exactly what she needs. He is very extroverted and a bit careless but in my opinion he is good for her and totally unthreatening as he has clearly a good heart. Noah is very polite towards my husband and me. And I think he really wants us to like him. 
My daughter is clearly in love with him and he loves her as much as she loves him. They are really cute together.
But my husband hates Noah. In theory he is comfortable with her dating, but in practice he just doesn‚Äôt wants her to date at all. He is really mean to Noah and basically bullies him. He also often jokes that he could hurt/kill Noah. Noah stays respectful, but its clear that Noah is not too sad when my husband is away.
Our daughter is really offended by my husbands behaviour. She thinks that he should trust her more. And I feel that my husbands behaviour pushes her away from us. (Noahs Parents are both really nice to her.) 
‚Äã
What should I do?
‚Äã
TL;DR My husband bullies our daughters nice and caring boyfriend.

903,estj,"Oh dear! This sounds like a frustrating situation for all people involved. Hopefully I can provide some insight, as my mom is an ESTJ and I am an INFJ. It seems that the issue involves loss of control. Your husband is used to being the predominant male figure in your daughter‚Äôs life, so the thought of your daughter placing her trust into another male might be daunting to him. This might be the root of his unreasonable contempt for what you describe as a kind and caring boyfriend. I know that my mom perceives most young people as irresponsible and is highly critical of the people my sister and I have dated. She truly believes she knows best when it comes to dating, even if her assessment of our partners isn‚Äôt actually correct. I think it would be worth having a conversation with him. Let him know that you understand that letting your daughter date someone for the first time might seem like letting go and losing control, but your daughter must be granted a certain degree of autonomy as she grows older. Explain that while her boyfriend is young and lacks the maturity that will come with age, he is still a caring person and has brought out the best in your daughter. Perhaps you should let him know that his comments make her boyfriend feel unwelcome and might alienate your daughter. Although I don‚Äôt know the perfect solution, I empathize with your situation and wish you the best. "
904,estj,"Have you tried explaining why it is both practical and efficient for him to show politeness and respect to the boyfriend?  Analyze it as if all players were robots, and certain inputs (death threats) will have certain results (need to choose between dad and boyfriend).  When I have had ESTJ relationship problems I word it like that and stress the efficiency of cooperation.  Also, since he's a guy, if you can make it seem like his idea it'll always go over better.  I love my ESTJ's but sometimes they need to remember that going around feelings is more efficient in the long run than going through them.  Going through feelings of family members means you'll have to deal with tears and emotions later and it's SUCH a pain."
905,estj,"INTP here.
So, I have a young relative who I am fairly close too, who I am think is an ESTJ.
The person in question:

Is outgoing
Is responsive to firm, commanding handling
Is insensitive
Has a good memory
Is bossy/manipulative
Naturally has formed their own routine

I would especially like to know:

How do you learn most effectively (by ""learn"" I mean skills, knowledge, etc.)
How, if possible, should one go about getting ESTJ children to be more sensitive?
What should I avoid, that would only make their life worse? 

But feel free to add any other comments you think would be useful.
Cheers"
906,estj,"Get him engaged in structured activities especially ones that involve tradition and order. A military style summer camp would be nice as a one off - it will teach duty, order, discipline and comradeship. Martial art and physical based sports I.e. boxing, fencing, rugby, wrestling and jousting. 
Get him involved in your cultures traditions (fairs, dances) teach him your culture and cultural superiority.
Most importantly get him and his friends to form testudo and phalanx formations and remove immigrant kids. "
907,estj,"Hello everyone, 
I am (an ENFP) fairly new to this personality-type-world, but I find it very interesting and useful. 
One of my closest friends through the last 8 years is ESTJ (she hasn't taken the test yet but I'm pretty confident in this and so far I have been quite good at 'guessing' people). 
We are very different in many ways but that has always been both a blessing and a curse for our relationship. 
However, the way she acts towards other people (especially when she is having a harsh day/week herself) is very hard for me to come to terms with. I find that it is very difficult to 'criticize' her without severely hurting her. So I have only gently 'hinted' at it by telling her that ""maybe you should consider how xx felt, when you said that"", or I try to make jokes with it, or when I'm in the same room when it happens I try to soften it out. 
We have some common friends and there have been a few incidents lately where she did and said things to our common friends which were way out of line (because she has a tendency to forget other people's feelings). She is at the same time one of the most loving and loyal persons, so when she does it to me I have mostly been able to ignore it by focusing on the nice things instead.  But I can no longer ignore the way she acts towards other people.
Combine this with the fact that she has withdrawn a lot from our relationship since she got a boyfriend who she directs most her time, energy and love towards now.
I am starting to feel more and more like we're strangers and that we are drifting apart. So I've come to the conclusion that I want to talk to her about this. I need to somehow tell her that some of the things she does are not okay (in my point of view). 
Which is where you guys come in: 
Can you help me with advice on how to best talk to her and tell her about it? I know it will hurt her so something inside me wants to sugar-coat it, but on the other hand I'm not sure if the message will really come though then. 
Any advice is appreciated! 
TL;DR: one of my best friends (very probable ESTJ) is acting hurtful towards other people. I (ENFP) have a hard time coping with this and I feel we are getting more and more like strangers. How do I best talk to her about it, in order to save our relationship?  "
908,estj,"They are usually good at talking through the situation. Ask her if she wants to hear truth from you even though it may not feel very well. If she does, gently tell her and stay with the conversation and work through the sensitivity. ESTZs tend to be pretty rational ."
909,estj,"We can be absolutely terrible at being self aware. A good ENFP friend can help a lot.
Many criticisms and hurt feelings will blow over our heads. We need to understand how their hurt feelings were connected to our actions and that we actually did something wrong. In particular, we can have trouble understanding problems with tone or the way we say things.
Criticisms need to be tied to actual situations. If you can't say, ""remember that time so and so left the party early? It was because you used this insensitive term about..."" She's just going to get confused like you were making something up.
If you are scared about losing your friendship, by the way, keep in contact through social media or text / phone. Just message her once a week or so with something from your life and catch up.
Even better, try and claim some regular time together, like every two weeks or something you go out to eat, with maybe other friends joining in at your discretion. Make sure that it's regular, same place, same time, same day, and she'll remember it like it's sacred."
910,estj,"Be sure to bring enough ammo.  Be prepared also with a compelling argument with many examples to shut down their doubt.  Show no fear.  Do NOT let emotion enter any of your process, unless it is favorable emotion and it is pleasant regarding only them personally, praising them personally.  If it is legal in your state put on your fancy holster but never refer to your pew pew.  Try to spend at least 4 times sucking up to them as you would anyone else.  If despitec all this they refuse to acknowledge your criticism, again, plan for this.  Grab the heavy blunt object convieniently concealed within arms range, whack them in the nuts as hard as you humanly can, and  know the fastest most efficient rouyte out of the state.  When you come back the next week your ESTJ wil probably not acknowledge  you or your idea, but he willc respect it now and now understamds what you were getting at.  You can do it.  I have faith in you.  As INFP at age 42, I still would carefully consider my options before attempting your trial with my Dad.  He is awesome :)
edit:  ok the kneecap.  just a fleesh wound"
911,estj,"There isn‚Äôt going to be a right or wrong way of doing it. Because any one of us is gonna tell you that she won‚Äôt respond well to it. She will put up walls and get defensive. 
But just because it doesn‚Äôt go well doesn‚Äôt mean she still won‚Äôt process what has been said. 
Sometimes ESTJs just need to walk away and think about what was said to us. We need to work through it on our own first. So if she walks away don‚Äôt take it as she is refusing to accept what you said. Just let her walk because she most likely will come back. "
912,estj,"Hey ESTJ female here.  
The most effective way to help your friend would be to ""counsel"" them.  Almost like an intervention. 

Plan to get together one on one. ESTJ are very critical of themselves and would be very embarrassed if you do this in a public/group setting.
Write out what you need to say. Examples of incidences, the implications they have caused and give them an alternative approach. How could they have approached the situation better and accomplished a better result.
When you sit down to speak with them, open up with something like ""Hey____, I want you to know that I love and care about our friendship. I wanted to meet with you today because something has been bothering me for a while now. Know that what I am going to tell you might hurt you, but I value you as a person and want the best for you. I want you to be of a growth mindset. okay?  

‚Äã
This is what my best friends have done to help me. Hope this helps.
‚Äã
‚Äã"
913,estj,"Thank you very much for your reply. I appreciate it a lot üòä 
What you are saying makes a lot of sense and I think it is how I usually (try to) handle situations with her. But this one is an extra difficult one so it is very nice to read your explanation.  
Also it is scarily appropriate what you suggest with SoMe üòÖ 
Thanks again! I will think the whole how-to carefully through and definitely use your advice!"
914,estj,"Thank you for sharing your insights üòä 
Definitely fits well with my experience with her. 
I will definitely remember this and try to hold on to this point üòä it will make it easier for me to have the talk and stick to my plan. "
915,estj,"Yessss! Another female ESTJ here and this is exactly the best growth-inducing conversations my friends have had with me were. I will also say, try to bring some humor into it. Like idk if this is true of super unhealthy ESTJs, but I have an ENFP bestie too and the place where I am just so on vibe with her is that Ne/Si nest! Like be direct and directive, but we really deep down want to know that your love for us is not contingent on our performance (even if we don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what we really want). So I would remind her of the ways that her idiosyncrasies and irritating personality traits are still endearing TO YOU. Really emphasize that familial or buddy-buddy loyalty and I think you‚Äôll get good results"
916,estj,"Thank you so much! 
This is incredible helpful and I think this is more or less how I will do it.  
A follow-up question: you write examples of incidences in plural. Is this on purpose? 
What I mean is, do you think it will be okay to bring up several examples/situations? 
I am afraid she will feel sort of overwhelmed and attacked and that maybe she will 'shut down' for it? 
Also, how do you think I can expect her to react? My experience is that she is does not seem very open to criticism in the moment, but after she has had a bit of time to think about it it will settle in with her. "
917,estj,"Healthy ESTJs can take criticism. In fact, they would prefer it. 
Unhealthy ESTJs suck at being criticized but sometimes they just have to walk away and process the information before anything happens. "
918,estj,"I had an ENFP friend who I sorta gave up on because I was so sick and tired of her never standing up for herself or seemed to have the ability to fight at all. 
So I commend you for being willing to stand up to her. I know I can sometimes scare people or make it difficult for people to confront me. But I love when they do. My ESFJ roommate in college was one of the first people in my life who called me out on my shit. I honestly was shocked and sorta just froze because no one had ever done that before. I maybe wish I wasn‚Äôt called out in front of others but she was right and we‚Äôre still close to this day because she earned all my respect that day.  And that was when I was a mess and pretty unhealthy for an ESTJ. "
919,estj,"To me, time is relative. To my son, time is respected. To me, decisions are based on being authentic and harmonious. To him, decisions are based on realities and gathered data. How do we get along? Any ESTJs with this frustrating parent/child experience? How did you find a balance, if any?"
920,estj,"My mom is an ENFP and my dad is an INTP, and I'm their ESTJ daughter. Very strong emphasis on the J! :)
The advice I would give to an NFP parent of an STJ child is this: while lots of organization and structure may feel restrictive to you, organization and structure mean security to your child. ESTJs feel safer and happier when there is a hierarchy and predictability around them.
I find that finding a ""balance"" with clashing personality preferences has more to do with understanding why another person has the preferences they do rather than how you're supposed to react. Structure and facts help ESTJs understand (and find our place in) the universe. Lack of organization and moral gray areas make us feel lost and frustrated. And when we feel that way, we don't want compassion, we want our structure and facts back lol!!! :)
So I guess what I'm saying is, trying to get an ESTJ to see things in an NFP way is going to be frustrating for both of you (ESTJs may understand, intellectually, why you feel the way you do, but we'll never really get it and we'll NEVER think you're right lol). Instead, try to respect each other's needs, and provide, in some form, what the ESTJ needs to feel safe and fulfilled. And try to explain in a logical manner what you would like from your ESTJ son in return!"
921,estj,"Thank you for your thoughtful response! You are right about being more structured and logical. He responds better when I make the effort! 
Two questions: Is there anything you look back and wish you parents handled differently? Are you still close to them?"
922,estj,"You're so welcome! I hope it was helpful. :)
Looking back, I do wish that my parents had known about my strengths and helped me nurture them more. ESTJs are very driven to accomplish goals, are good organizers, and are adventurous! We get lots of satisfaction from tangible achievement. But these are things I didn't learn about myself until pretty recently. My parents are more ""path of least resistance"" type people, and since that's all I really ever knew, I assumed I was too. I guess I wish I had pushed myself harder when I was young, so that I'd have learned sooner how much I enjoyed it, and that my mom encouraged me to push hard (I think her instinctual reaction was to coddle me :D).
The other thing is I tend to be very analytical and get easily tired out when dealing with emotional people for too long, whereas my mom and sister are excellent at comforting people and enjoy it. But instead of just accepting that everyone has different gifts (and mine was not to be an emotional support), I grew up thinking that I was less likable for it and not a nice person. I don't blame my upbringing for that, but I think if my mom had assured me that I didn't have to enjoy or be good at comforting people in order to be a good (and likable) person, I might not have had to come to terms with that on my own later. But that probably also has to do with the fact that I'm a woman (and people expect women to be more emotionally supportive), so maybe your son won't feel that way.
And finally, YES, we're still very close. :) I'm married and out of the house now but we live in the same area so I visit them regularly. ESTJs are VERY stubborn (as you likely know) and I'm sure are very difficult to raise! And they chafe at having to submit themselves to an idea or an authority that doesn't make sense to them -- in my case, I chafed at having to obey a mom that didn't hold in esteem the things I thought were important (facts, logic, schedules, etc lol). But once that parent/child dynamic is less about obedience, those feelings go away and you can just enjoy having fun together, because NFPs are excellent at having fun, and ESTJs love to have fun. :D"
923,estj,"I will definitely take your suggestions to heart. Especially your comments about challenging him more and not being so hard on him for lacking an emotional response. Thank you so much! I lol forward to when, as you said, it's less about ""obedience,"" and we can just have fun together!"
924,estj,"Im an ENFJ who fell for a ESTJ last summer.  Didn't tell her how I felt cause I thought sharing my emotions would make her uncomfortable.  Also we would have had to do a long distance relationships because we were both going back to college.  
My friends always joke that I live the plot to Grease lolz  
The real question is, how do I express my emotions/interests without making her uncomfortable, etc.
This conversation is finally happening a year later, which is obviously not ideal but I was really worried that she would be put-off by me verbalizing what I felt.
I thank you in advance for any input into how non-Fs deal with emotional discussions such as these!"
925,estj,"I don't have the best perspective on this, since I am a man. But I can say as an ESTJ, I appreciate direct and to the point emotional conversations. Something simple but earnest and from the heart like: ""hey X, I just want to say I really like you and feel like you're a great person. Would you like to go out sometime?"" Obviously I don't know the entirety of your situation but if you speak open and honestly an ESTJ would likely appreciate the directness."
926,estj,"im just here to say this. what makes you different from people around you that you've noticed. like major key points.
are you really aware of other people's physical presence, random strangers in a library for example without even trying to be? 
im especially curious about the guys' perspective, but ladies you are welcome :]"
927,estj,"I am a female ESTJ. It is a tricky personality type, especially for females. I'm highly aware of physical presences around me, but what I'm really aware of is the competence of others.
I'm an operational director for a retail store, and I CANNOT STAND employees who do not follow the procedures I've set in place. I can't stand employees who start projects and don't finish them. Competence is #1 for me. If I deem you competent, honest, and intelligent, I am extremely loyal and supportive. 
If I deem you incompetent, watch the f*** out. I will cut you with my words and do whatever is necessary to remove the incompetent individual from my environment, whether it be at work or in other relationships. 
But those who are capable of following instructions, offer creative ideas and solutions and demonstrate intelligence are treasured and respected by me. I also really value detail-oriented people, because I'm a big-picture person. 
The essence of an ESTJ: we are doers. We cannot stand inefficiency. We are also quite blunt. We do not, and cannot, change how we are, though I am attempting to mitigate my bluntness when dealing with feeling types. 
Hope this is helpful. "
928,estj,"Totally true. I‚Äôm an ESTJ guy, and the best way I relate is with girls. If a girl I‚Äôm interested in is anywhere near, I can‚Äôt help but be very aware of it. Like if we‚Äôre at a 100+ person event, I somehow locate her immediately. I honestly creep myself out a lot, it‚Äôs like I can have a radar on somebody that I can‚Äôt turn off. It can also be quite stressful, I wish I could just not notice but I can‚Äôt and I end up either feeling obsessed or like a stalker even though I can‚Äôt help it. "
929,estj,"I tend to catalogue a room when I walk into it, noticing people placement and activity now that I think on it. I've noticed quite a lot of emotional people around me, who have no barrier to expressing it loud and proud. Doesn't really bode well with me, but they do them. Seen some really motivated and successful people, which earns a nod of appreciation."
930,estj,"I am also a female ESTJ. It is deafly interesting, and I do like it but sometimes it isn‚Äôt the easiest. I am not what most females should be, because I‚Äôm very confident and knowledgeable. Yes, I tend to notice people around me, a lot and as somebody says I noticed there competency. I am in the business of media, I am a journalist at the moment a student journalist. I think the people either are too biased, not honest enough, or don‚Äôt go after the facts aggressively enough. I think people tend to like doing that easy, or fun, job, but not the very necessary one. Often in the news room there is a lot of back-and-forth gossiping and really sometimes dishonesty, even some passive aggressiveness, when the point is to get out the truth and to be truthful. I view journalism as serving the public, and informing people of what is the real truth, and that is simply not the focus of a lot of media people. It is either about them, what they think is really cool, some type of attention seeking, or something else. I‚Äôm deafly really task oriented where others don‚Äôt seem to be, and I seem to be working that much harder, and that much more on truth, honesty, and following what theoretically journalism is supposed to be about. Online, I seem to be helping a lot more, and care a lot more about the communities I belong to and work a lot more on actualising goals rather than just talking about them. I am on the site where there was 1 million ideas about getting together and everybody would talk about this, then drop the idea. I actually made it happened and started the trend with sitewide local meet ups. My area was the 1st to have a meet up, it seems so cool to everybody that slowly there were others. Back to journalism for moment, I am currently serving as the schools political correspondent to the ASB. I wasn‚Äôt sure how popular the job was, but apparently because the meetings are boring, political innature, not very fast and exciting, does not usually generate a lot of gossip, more business and administrative, ETC... nobody else wants to do this job, because it‚Äôs not exactly easy either. I know a lot of people want to cover sports, media, fun events, and likes but when it comes to more administrative tasks it certainly isn‚Äôt so interesting anymore. I also noticed I tend to be practically helpful where as some people are more emotionally helpful, or are not helpful at all. I‚Äôve also been told that I don‚Äôt do what is easy I do what is right or necessary. It‚Äôs kind of interesting because while some of the other types may be popular popular as in the momentary fame, I am usually very well respected and appreciated and quite well known throughout my community. I think in a lot of ways I am also very much loud and PR a lot of these communities and groups, which I do not think a lot of people do. I am also extremely aggressive about these efforts.  "
931,estj,"Yeah this is really interesting. I recognize and admire that bluntness, because it's actually supported by a good reason rather than just bad feelings.
Yeah I definitely expected that irritation from ESTJs. And it's good to know you appreciate a bit of creativity even though that's only when it's matched up with efficiency and ability to finish projects, haha. Very cool, thanks."
932,estj,"It‚Äôs so hot for an ISTP/INTP girl. üòÑ do you do that more than like twice a week? 
I like it but not too much pursue, like once a week. By the way they (ISTP/INTP) need to know that have their separate space sometimes that there is no penetration. "
933,estj,"very admirable!! I'm becoming mindful of their importance in society, especially as ordinary people in family units."
934,estj,"I can't even know for sure I am fully ESTJ cause I might also be an ISTJ but that may also be from lack of self-awareness but I wouldn't even be able to guess what other people are, so how can you know that girl you have a crush on is ENFP or INTJ or whatevs? Not a native english speaker so excuse any mistakes."
935,estj,"I usually compare people. If I know my friend is an INFP then it‚Äôs easier to pick out other INFPs. The more I know the easier it is. 
I‚Äôm honestly not that good at typing people though. Some are easier than others but even if I know someone really well I still sometimes struggle to figure it out. 
I‚Äôve tried guessing and sometimes I‚Äôve been way off. 
It took 4 years to learn I was ESTJ and that‚Äôs because the descriptions of us are just bad.  
What I find kinda funny though is that I‚Äôve always known my dad is ESTJ. And I‚Äôve always had a close relationship with him, even being a girl. And my mom has always said we had similar minds. He is the one person whose always understood me. 
Now that I‚Äôm older and know I‚Äôm ESTJ I can see how we are exactly the same. And I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt see it before. "
936,estj,"Introvert vs extrovert is usually pretty easy to see. Either they‚Äôre really energetic, and think out loud, or they‚Äôre more withdrawn and keep to themselves more/are slightly more quiet. Sensory vs intuitive is the hardest one... I find intuitive tend to be more like hippies... sensors tend to be more like businessmen. Thinker vs feeler is harder for me. I tend to generalize most men as thinkers, and most women as feelers, which may be the most prevalent, however, I‚Äôm not as good at picking up on male feelers and female thinkers. Usually, they‚Äôre just more feminine men and masculine women. As per Judgers vs percievers, this is the easiest for me. Percievers are usually kind of chaotic, disorganized, are late a lot etc... and aren‚Äôt good with deadlines. Judgers are very organized, are good at planning, like structure and are pretty tidy, usually. "
937,estj,"Does it matter what type they are if you like them? I met a dude online whose written profile was so appealing I decided that I'd expand my MBTI romantic preferences to whatever he ended up testing as. He tested twice as INTJ, a type I was iffy about as a romantic prospect. Now I'd totally give it a chance especially since his goals are 100% in sync with mine. "
938,estj,"Interested in hearing the ESTJ perspective. Do people who are in touch with their emotional side make you uncomfortable or does it balance you out? (not to say only feelers are)
Optional question: does it make a difference if they use Fi or Fe?"
939,estj,"I like high Fi-users generally. In my friendship group, despite most of them being Fe-users, the ones I get along with best are an ENFP, INFP, ISFP and ESFP. My best friend who I grew up with is an ISFJ, but he has some strong T-traits, probably because a lot of people he hung out with when he was growing up were dominant-Thinkers. However, a lot of our relationship hinges on our past, I don't know if I'd become friends with him again if I forgot who he was. 
Generally, I find communication with FPs quite easy, I just keep heavy decisions away from them. FJs I can become frustrated with. ENFJs, and particularly ESFJs, I can often connect with on the grounds that we're both often Type-A, assertive people, but I don't feel energised hanging out with them, I feel like the conversation is forced and there isn't the same level of openness I find with FPs. I feel like I'm monitoring what I say around FJs, but FPs I can say what's on my mind.
But yeah, I can absolutely feel comfortable with Feeler friends, FPs more so than FJs, I just might get frustrated with their decision-making and such."
940,estj,"If they can explain why they feel that way, open to my questions, and able to have a discussion about it, then nope, no issues. 
It's the ones that yell that it's how they feel that I don't like dealing with. "
941,estj,"I have so many feeler friends and I love them all. 
My best friend is INFP and I‚Äôve never met someone more kind than her. When I was going through a rough patch she was the best friend someone could ask for. She understands people in a way I just can‚Äôt. 
My dad is ESTJ and my mom is INFP. They are going on 30 years strong. My mom is a really strong feeler and is dramatic at times and my dad handles it really well. 
I‚Äôm dating an INTP but I feel like he‚Äôs way more in touch with his feelings than I am. 
I‚Äôm not really affectionate but with my INTP i really am. I love physical touch which probably surprises people because if it‚Äôs not him I don‚Äôt want anyone touching me. 
I have no problem with feelers. They usually see things from a different perspective and I think everyone needs that. "
942,estj,"As an INFP, I don't think my feeleriness makes my ESTJ friend uncomfortable. He personally wants someone who enjoys cuddling (not that Ts don't, since he's a T himself), who's passionate both in bed and out of bed about something, who understands people and is better at reading them than he is, and is better at making Fi-based decisions (i.e. someone who has a strong sense of personal taste as his is all over the place, then his job is to execute it)."
943,estj,"I have a close friend that is Fe, often we don‚Äôt understand each other‚Äôs motivation but we‚Äôre still close despite that. I believe we‚Äôre only close because I‚Äôve reached a point in my life where I‚Äôm ok revealing my vulnerability, it wouldn‚Äôt not have been possible earlier in my life. 
As for coworkers, I‚Äôm management at my job and it‚Äôs a small independent business, only one above me is the manager who is Te so we get along fine. I‚Äôve never bothered to type the underlings. 
I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd deal with a feeler for a lover. "
944,estj,"I like them as friends and co-workers.  I appreciate their interpersonal skills.  My first husband was a pretty toxic INFP (not that all INFPs are toxic, but this guy sure is), so I don't know if I'd date a Feeler again, but anything's possible, I guess. "
945,estj,"That's not exactly what being a Feeler is about. It's more about preferring to be effusive and affectionate over impersonal in the case of Fe. Or in the case of Fi, ""speaking from the heart"". I've seen xSTJs run the other way when I go into Fi-mode lol"
946,estj,"Out of xxTPs and xxFJs, I've preferred xxTJs the most! For me its definitely because of sharing the Fi. That includes xxFPs as well but later in life you look more to develop your opposite Judging function, so in conclusion I really like and highly prefer Thinking types with Fi. I'm glad the sentiment is mutual.
We're very sorry v _v"
947,estj,"That sounds interesting. I'm an INFP and alot of the time I feel like when I'm explaining my emotions, and as long as I'm comfortable with the person, I explain my feeling in a logical way. Giving examples of the past, who I am and why all of that's led to me feeling this way in a somewhat calm way. Honestly I don't think an INFJ would work out with you guys. Maybe Fe in general because in that circumstance they expect you to talk about your feelings, and when they get emotional or feel a certain way they usually find it hard to explain their feelings, get frustrated and burst."
948,estj,"Interesting! I can't relate at all to that INFP but I know others can be like that. Self-development makes a big difference (duh, but that's a big reason why people categorically hate certain types). My mom's almost a completely undeveloped INFJ and I'm still struggling to build a healthy relationship with her. Her mood is erratic and she can be crazy AF when one second before she was normal. She also has a completely uncompromising worldview. Well I hated all INFJs for a while but thankfully I woke up from that before encountering others. 
Is there a general summary you can give of this if at all possible? I'm trying to understand a couple ESTJs I know at the moment.
edit: I see you're a Enneagram Type 6 like me. I relate way more to E6s regardless of MBTI than other INFPs and I feel like it could be the same for others E6s."
949,estj,"Does any expression of emotion frustrate you or only when someone's being irrational? Because irrational people (reckless, thoughtless, impulsive, etc.) frustrate me too. For example...someone confiding in you that they feel a lot of shame and regret over their past vs. being overly offended at a harmless comment you made"
950,estj,"Very true, normally I would think discussing it would bring better understanding but I lack the patience to deal with their outburst. I typically just walk away or mentally wonder off if I'm not physically able to leave. "
951,estj,"I think people have one bad experience, and go on to judge every other person of that type, without ever giving them a chance, and that alone is probably why the percentage of ESTJs in this community is so small.  It's something that doesn't make any sense at all so we would rather spend our time elsewhere.  
I enjoy MBTI, but I can only handle it in small doses.  "
952,estj,"I would say most emotion frustrates me whether it‚Äôs rational or irrational. I happen to see it as if it doesn‚Äôt impact you now, there‚Äôs no reason to dwell. But I especially can‚Äôt stand people who are overly offended as well. "
953,estj,"Okay maybe I should clarify. It's not that I feel nothing, it's just that I work in a very high stress job in healthcare and work with people who are at their very worst. I can care for them and be empathetic, but I have to separate myself from my own personal emotions or else I wouldn't make it through one day. It has made me more desensitized I'm sure. However, I've never been able to handle feelers in relationships or most friendships. I guess when you see the worst every day, you hate hearing about what I view as minor setbacks. "
954,estj,"Sure thing. (Apologies for the delay, btw.)  He tended to be pretty self-absorbed (Fi) and manipulative (Ne). Having the time and space to reflect upon our relationship, I think that he was a pretty immature INFP, and I did not react particularly well, and we likely brought out the worst in each other. I have no doubt that from his perspective, he could list a million ways that I was a toxic ESTJ. 
I'm not sure this is a particularly helpful answer, but I guess I would say that it's important to develop your tertiary and inferior functions, as they lead you to be a well-rounded and mature human being. And also that you should notice when someone brings out the worst, or the best, in you, and act accordingly. "
955,estj,"Don't worry, I know you guys are always busy (probably with things other than responding to internet strangers) ! And yeah that does sound like an unhealthy INFP. The only thing I would say is those are particularly negative expressions of Fi and Ne. Someone could not have their lower functions developed and still be healthy, they just wouldn't be well-rounded. "
956,estj,"This is so true!!! One ESTJ I know associates with some HORRIBLE people because he can't tell they're lying pieces of shit who only act nice but are far from innocent. I actually doubted his character based on those friendships until I realized he is actually that dense. And when I try to explain why I think those individuals are the snakes that they are, he doesn't believe me because I can't provide real concrete evidence. We have to wait and see until they inevitably disappoint and/or break his trust. And I'm always right...
ESTJ are naive and innocent."
957,estj,"Hi everyone, I posted this on the ENTJ forum and some come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãESTJ and I would like your opinion
My test results are ENTJ, in some ENTJ with Loop (Te/Se).
We know that the tests are not completely reliable so I have studied the various functions, I have made my own idea and now I write here to get some confirmation.
I am 23 years old, I did Scientific High School because as a child I wanted to be a doctor, but after seeing that the hospital is not my environment, probably lack of empathy, I opted for Business Studies.
I have made this choice because I am interested in the ""position of control and power"", have more knowledge because I am mainly interested in starting my own business, or, if it goes wrong, being hired to play a senior role (if you have thought of the CEO congratulations you‚Äôre right). 
Always aim to have a main role in a group, organize, say what to do and I can‚Äôt stand that others are too relaxed, slow or don‚Äôt take things seriously, but at the same time I also know how to be humorous to ingratiate them.
I tend to be among the most organized and I want things to be done with principle.
Principle that often turns out to be my point of view in fact I tend to do things ‚Äúon my way‚Äù.
Yes, I‚Äòve been defined arrogant or as a ""I do everything"" or ""what I say is law"", and I don‚Äôt like others told me what to do.
Despite this I like to discuss ideas and theories, but I always tend to the pragmatic side of the thing and hardly change my mind if I'm not totally convinced.
A black or white situation.
I am quite ""future oriented "", but at the same time I‚Äôm interested in the present moment and act for what I want.
I make decisions quickly, but if it‚Äôs very important, I prefer to have as much information as possible.
I‚Äôve been called selfish, unable to put myself in others shoes, I'm not good with my emotions or those of others, but I'm ready to help when you really need, even without being asked.
What makes me doubt I really am an ENTJ?
The procrastination in the study: I ‚Äã‚Äãhave always done and I continue to do it at the University."
958,estj,"ESTJ or EXTJ isn't just about control and power. Honestly, that's not really connected to us at all. 
The only thing I might get from your post is that you are Enneagram 8. But you could be ESTP for that matter. 
Wanting a controlled environment is not the same as wanting control over every single person in our lives. 
ESTJs aren't really the type of people who want to rise to the top and be in control. We like being in charge because we often times see ourselves as strong problem solvers. We are good at planning ahead and calculating different outcomes and how to respond to each of them. 
ESTJs are commonly found in middle management. We don't want to oversee people, we want to work in the middle with them. It's not that an ESTJ wouldn't end up as a CEO, it's just not likely. A lot of ESTJs are okay with being somewhere in the middle. They work really well on teams, they just might prefer a management position so they have some control and say in how things are done. 
You came to us describing yourself and the only thing any of us are getting from what was written is that you're someone who likes to be in control and have power. That's all you seem to want in life. There is so much more to ESTJs, and all personalities for that matter.
There are people who want control and power, and people who want to be leaders. One of them is respected and the other isn't. One of them is earned and the other is often times taken. "
959,estj,"In my experience, ENTJ have a common style of conversation where they will have difficulty balancing conversation with other people. If an ENTJ starts talking, it's very normal for me as an ESTJ to only get in an ok when appropriate, but not my own thoughts. They'll often change topics multiple times and we won't return to the original discussion too.
If I need to leave, I'll have to interrupt. They'll acknowledge but if they start talking again, they'll keep going until I leave.
I think that the actual problem is that they have trouble closing off their thoughts. This is especially annoying to ESTJs as we want other people to listen to our views too and are very conscious about using time efficiently and stating our thoughts clearly and succinctly.
Overall, they are still good friends and I just realize that it's a personality conflict and not something personal between us."
960,estj,"Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.  
ESTJ by Gulenko | ESTJ by Stratiyevskaya | ESTJ subtypes 
ENTJ by Gulenko | ENTJ by Stratiyevskaya | ENTJ subtypes "
961,estj,"Yes, in the Enneagram my results are 8w7. In the other forum they said that the interest in Status Quo is more from ESTJ, and it's interesting to hear that you don‚Äôt agree with this.
Right, in this post only highlights the desire for ""command"" because it‚Äôs easier to describe for me.
A brief summary could be:
I like being organized, I can‚Äôt stand improvised things, even by other people, and I prefer to have a plan.
I'm more interested in the destination and not the journey.
The prolonged routine bores me and I need to change or try something new.
A stereotype of ESTJ is that they refer to the past. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true, but I‚Äôm one who thinks ""the past is the past"" and I rarely thought how it could have been if I had done something differently.
I'd rather prefer to look forward, think 5/10 years ahead.
On the side of relationships I'm not the type of guy that give you a shoulder to cry, but I admit that if you really need help, I'm here."
962,estj,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.
My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.
I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.
Cheers!

963,estj,"I'm an INTP, but the guy I am seeing is ESTJ. He wouldn't take it but he definitely has avoidance issues (I've been reading about it and I probably have the anxious issue myself.) Good luck on your thesis!"
964,estj,"Hey there! The avoidance questionnaire I used was the General and Specific Avoidance Questionnaire (Stemmet, Roger, Kuntz, & Borrill, 2015) - if he is ever in a mood for self-exploration he can give it a whirl and score himself. It is a very personal decision, however. We've all got insecurities! :) Thank you for your interest!"

966,estj,Strong correlation with introversion and intuition. That's too be expected. An interest in the self and a tendency to explore theories would lend one to find MBTI interesting and also to use the Internet to discuss it. The weaker correlation with perceiving I find more interesting. I wonder what motivation along the judging-perceiving axis might cause that to be the case.
967,estj,"By asking them out. There is no science to this, you like her you will try to get her.
By telling her. Touching, kissing and licking her got the point across also (I hope).
Being open and upfront about desires helps a lot in this case."
968,estj,A ESTJ guy at my work likes me and he just let me know. He usually chooses to text his feelings rather than say it in life (at work) but he's always extremely upfront. At first he was more asking me how I felt and being a little more timid but now he'll just consistently remind me of his intentions.
969,estj,"In my experience, people have limited experience with ESTJs and think anybody they don't like and tries to control them is one. I was shocked to find out a guy I know was an ESTJ after he took the test. He is very friendly, likes to joke around, minds his own business. Then again, I'm neither a coworker nor employee of his, and he works almost nonstop."
970,estj,"My ESTJ isn't ""manipulative""...she is just constantly optimizing the current and future events for maximum gain for herself and immediate circle, while simultaneously retroactively re-describing the past."

Hi gang,
I  just created Discord server called MBTI Penpals for any type of  personality to be able to communicate with others of any type of  personality. Check it out here:
https://discord.gg/pRRGnTd
Come  find more people of your type, or seek for others of compatible (or not  compatible) types! Talk with each other in real-time, either via text  chat or voice chat. Enjoy!"
972,estj,"I'm always extremely frustrated with people when we agree on a time to meet and then they show up 15mins-2 hours late. It really bothers me like nothing else. Is this everyone or a majority estjs? None of my friends or family seem to be phased by people being late, just me."
973,estj,"INFP here. It really depends on the situation. If it's work related, or there are time constraints on the activity, it's  frustrating. However, on a social call, I give a lot more leeway. A friend was 30 mins late to meet me yesterday and I just took the time to listen to music and catch up on the news. NBD. Sometimes shit happens and I'd like to be extended the same flexibility if I was running late for whatever reason. "
974,estj,"I'm an INFJ and I definitely feel frustrated when people are late without letting me know in advance. It's more the breaking of etiquette than ""my time is important"" type of frustration, though. 
One thing I've come to realize is that some people do not perceive time as fixed digits. For them, it's more fluid, and they underestimate the available time. It's like when I might underestimate the weather when there's a clear number for it (degrees). This perspective helps with the frustration!"
975,estj,"Is it an ESTJ thing? Not saying I'm not punctual or being punctual is bad but I was mildly surprised when I asked this girl out for a date the other day and she texted me exactly 2 minutes before the promised time asking, ""I'm ready, where are you?"" I thought it was just her (she also had something else to do later that day) but now that I'm seeing this post I'm thinking.. hmm..."
976,estj,Eh I think tjs tend to not feel sympathy unless something really really bad happened. The chance that people are late because something really bad happened is pretty slim. So I don't really feel sympathy for people if they're late no matter the situation
977,estj,"It's Saturday night and I can't be at home cause I travel for work, constantly.  Ergo, I don't have my normal entertainments with me and am going to reach out to everyone here.  What are some interests we might share?  The easiest place to start might be subreddits.  I don't mean /r/Dentistry because you're studying to be a Dentist, nor /r/dankmemes because.. well, who doesn't like dank memes?
I want to know what the filler subreddits are for you.  The ones you subscribe to because you're interested in them and now they kinda fill the void between the subreddits you mainline, like pocket change you find every time you pull your wallet out.
Me?  I'm a big fan of /r/MovieDetails because I'm constantly analyzing a movie 'universe' throughout films and I like seeing what they point out and/or I have seen/missed personally.  I like to peruse /r/mechanical_gifs because they're fun to watch and I like learning about new types of gears and how things actually work (turns out, it's not all magic...).  I check up on /r/explainlikeimfive cause, frankly, I like learning and understanding new things and lastly (for this post) /r/PictureGame because I'm fascinated with the whole game and, while I don't think I'm clever enough to win a round, I like to see how people decipher and solve each one.
What are some of yours?  What are some we all might be interested in checking out?"
978,estj,"Wut
lol, between those guys and [these turds]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/weekendgunnit/comments/70cyrm/meanwhile_at_the_bestgunnit_meetup/) I can't stop laughing and lines are starting to blur.
Edit: There it is.  I found the one I was cracking ribs over."
979,estj,"I definitely get it, that's why I had described them more as 'pocket change' subreddits.
I think it's neat we share some of the same subreddits (like /r/AccidentalRenaissance) but I've always browsed /r/Entrepreneur  rather than /r/Entrepreneurs. Between r/science and r/telescopes, you may consider r/Futurology for their weekly poster-style flash reports of new science, breakthroughs, politics affecting science, discoveries, etc.  It's a quick read in poster format and if anything piques my interest, I can delve into that more individually."
980,estj,"How do we convince an ESTJ of 100% trusting you? I am an ENTP and need to convince an ESTJ business owner that I am right and am the right person for the subject. But I am always full of ideas and all over the place and I certainly don't follow many rules. I'm afraid that the way I am make him hesitant. There are also a lot of nuances in what I have to present and it could play against me that nothing is black or white.
edit : I posted this in r/mbti also."
981,estj,"I tend to only believe what I see. So if I see you acting shady or being unclear I will not trust you. I already dont really trust anyone but if they burn me, that's it. I feel we all show who and what we are. So my thing is, show me. Once you've shown me, ok now I see. Estjs can be judgy but are also as fair as they can be usually. Just be real and then the realness will show. They are already skeptical so dont give a reason to be and you'll be fine. "
982,estj,"I‚Äôm not good at showing my emotions. Whenever someone does something for me, my only response is ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù If it came to a point that someone would offer their kidney for me, the best thing I can respond with is ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù and I‚Äôll just leave it at that. 
I like to do grand gestures, and I suppose if someone tops those, I would express my gratitude more openly. But until then, a simple thank you will suffice. "
983,estj,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt know if I can remember. There are probably a lot of them. But nothing stands out.
Sometimes it‚Äôs other ESTJs. Like one of my favorite professor he‚Äôs EXTJ I think I think ESTJ was like are you taking another one of my classes? It‚Äôs like please tell me yes. Haha! I was like yes, I need to anyway. I am quite popular so many things. Honestly. There was a teacher in high school I think he‚Äôs estj or istj. But I didn‚Äôt have much friends in high school there are a number of reasons, but this teacher was like what are you doing out there? I told him waiting for my class. He was across the hall and he said well come in here, why don‚Äôt you, and I hung out ever since in his class. There are a lot."
984,estj,"Same... Like, I know I can be sweet, that people have been sweet, but it's really hard to say something stands out. There was this one girl (yellow/ yellow/blue?, Not sure what MBTI would be) anyhow, we had a great vacation together over a weekend and she wrote me a surprise note I later found talking about how much fun she had, what I meant to her, etc. I thought that sweet. In the moment it's easy, outside the moment... Not really my strong suit haha "
985,estj,"Hello! I‚Äôm curious, what are some Fi problems that you folks have sometimes? Lately I want to strengthen my Te, so I‚Äôm curious, is there anyone out there who would want to talk about your Te and my Fi? I think we could learn a lot from each other! It would be especially cool if this turned into having an accountability parter for our Fi & Te goals! "
986,estj,"I'm an ENTJ so my relevant functions in this conversation are the same.  I find myself best able to access my deeper functions when my mind is ""quiet"".  It's almost as if each function has a voice of its own.  I can hear my Fi when I have all others shut up."
987,estj,"Since this sub is mostly people trying to understand an ESTJ in their life, let‚Äôs talk about feelings for a second.
I will preface this: I have had a really shitty day.
Due to the ESTJ generally maintaining a neutral composure, people tend to be more open about how they feel. ESTJs are however not, but just because we choose to keep how we feel to ourselves, does not mean we don‚Äôt have feelings. Typically an ESTJ feels very intensely. They love you with with everything they have or they hate you with everything they have.
We tend to be seen as emotionless and uncaring. It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt care about your feelings, we just don‚Äôt let your feelings change our mood.
With all of this being said: we still have feelings. We are not emotionless jerks who don‚Äôt care about other people.
We do care about your feelings.
But you should care about ours too.
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
Edit: Thank you very much kind stranger for the gold!"
988,estj,"I don't like talking about or acting on emotions because they are volatile. Even if they aren't for me, they are for other people, and it bothers me. I like consistency.  
I like showing my emotions through my body language and actions. I like acting consistently and my emotions add flavor to my actions rather than driving them."
989,estj,"Awww, I hope you have a better day tomorrow 
I have the whole tough exterior ESTJ thing going, but my friends see right through it haha. But I have my moments, most of the time, I‚Äôll give you a huge dose of tough love and rarely, but sometimes, I‚Äôll say something generically sweet lmao"
990,estj,"Agreed. 
I find that people can be exceptionally hurtful to me because I don't appear to be visibly hurt. I've recently cut out a few friends, because the sensitivity and care they demanded from me wasn't reciprocated."
991,estj,"Congratulations!
You have just selected your very own ESTJ Executive unit! As our most popularly selected unit available you are sure to be pleased. In fact, satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are unsatisfied with your unit simply submit a complaint directly to your unit itself.
Your ESTJ will come with the following accessories:

One (1) Professionally Tailored Power Suit‚Ñ¢
One (1) Set of lounge clothes
One (1) formal outfit for religious and formal events
One (1) Laptop
Two (2) Cell phones
One (1) Gym Membership
One (1) Pair of smart gloves for texting
One (1) Bluetooth headset (for talking to people while talking to people)

Software
Your ESTJ comes pre-programmed with the following traits;
Te: As the dominant function, this provides your ESTJ unit with unmatched efficiency and a keen understanding of what works in a practical setting. This function provides your unit with high levels of organization and practicality as well as a blunt clarity in communication style that other units may find abrasive.
Si: This function provides your unit with a mental database of previously established effective methods of handing situations it has encountered before that can be recalled quickly when needed.
Ne:¬†This function provides your unit with a boost to creative problem solving when facing a new situation or when previously established methods are no longer effective.
Fi:¬†This function provides your unit with moral indignation and superiority as well as curiously strong attachment bonds to carefully selected partners. As the inferior function your ESTJ will avoid accessing this software as much as possible as it directly interferes with their default mode.
Getting Started
There is no need for a quick-start procedure. Your ESTJ will be fully functional and activated right out of the box. In fact, there is no box because excess packaging is highly inefficient.
Modes
Get Shit Done Mode (default)- When in this mode your ESTJ will complete any and all necessary tasks required for successful completion of the assigned goals. In order to activate this mode, your ESTJ will require suggestion(s) and/or idea(s) to be presented. If more than one suggestion or idea is presented your ESTJ will automatically select the most effective or efficient one and proceed to get that shit done. This mode can be intermittently active for however long is necessary to complete the project.
Do Absolutely Nothing Mode - Automatically activated after completion of a major project deadline. Your ESTJ unit will cease all productive function and instead do absolutely nothing until it is sufficiently recharged.
Oh Hell No Mode - Activated whenever someone assumes your ESTJ unit will get shit done but neither asks nor directly informs your unit. When activated your ESTJ unit will express noticeable aggravation towards the assuming person and refuse to complete the task as a matter of principle.
You‚Äôre Doing It Wrong Mode - When activated this mode has two possible outcomes; 50% chance of activating the¬†‚Äúfine, give it to me‚Äù response. In such cases your ESTJ will assume responsibility for a task which they no longer can observe another unit fail to satisfactorily complete. If this response does not activate your ESTJ will simply watch in smug amusement considering it a fitting lesson. This mode will deactivate after your unit says¬†‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù
Touchy-Feely Mode (locked) - Randomly activated by what is assumed to be fluctuating levels of hormones and emotions within your ESTJ unit. Also can usually be unlocked and activated by having your ESTJ unit watch an action movie with a strong emotional component (i.e. Big Hero 6)
Relationships with Other Units
NF: Finds them confusing but likable. Good project partners that provide good energy to a group.
NT: Generally very confused by them. Sometimes Infuriating, but your ESTJ is unable to walk away from what it perceives to be a mess. Often surprised that NTs do not walk away first. Confused by their seeming inability to accept statements at face value and instead to analyze everything.
SJ: These units make sense to your ESTJ, who considers them to be good people provided they are willing to try something new when the old methods do not work.
SP: Frequently cause eye rolling in your ESTJ. Finds them fun to have around but hard to take seriously or respect. When SP units feed your ESTJ it will probably like them, but may still not respect them.
Feeding
For optimal performance, provide your ESTJ with food on a regular basis. While it will cook for itself, cooking is seen as an interruption to getting shit done. Cooking is inefficient because you have to cook again at the next meal.
Grooming
Your ESTJ will groom itself. No need to concern yourself there.
Sleeping
Your ESTJ will automatically enter sleep mode when the body shuts down. Any attempt to induce sleep prior to shut down will be met with hostile resistance.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is my ESTJ thinking?
Whatever the last thing your ESTJ said was.
What is my ESTJ feeling?
Neutral unless otherwise stated
How do I plan a date for my ESTJ?
Come up with a detailed plan and submit it to your ESTJ. Wait for notes providing suggestions for improvement. Follow the notes.
Why does my ESTJ have so much criticism?
Your ESTJ is not criticizing you - just your plans and ideas. Your ESTJ is simply trying to help you improve your ideas and plans as much as possible.
But have you considered‚Ä¶.
Yes. Your ESTJ unit has already considered that. Thank you for your input.
Again, Congratulations of your new ESTJ unit! Now go be productive!"
992,estj,"ESTJ dad and INFP mom. old ESTP brother, younger INTP brother, younger ESFJ sister. 
So I usually kept my circle small. I had one best friend from early on and we pretty much spent every moment together. Until sometime in middle school when another girl came around and kinda fucked it up. Then I ended up meeting a new girl who I sorta latched onto and we became best friends shortly after. 
With my siblings it was alright. It's a lot better now that we are adults though. My ESTP brother was a bully, he loved being the center of attention and getting a reaction out of people. He often times bullied me in front of people which really hurt me. Honestly, he was nothing but a jerk and even to this day he is still an asshole. But I'm much more successful and in doing way better than he is and that's what eventually made his words towards me meaningless. 
But while all this happened I also had a cousin who was my exact age and bullied me to extremes. It was rough and got to the point where my parents helped me transfer to a new school. Growing up in a small town I felt like people who didn't know me were judging me and I felt like my life would be defined by this small town that I grew up in. 
I wasn't popular, I was actually pretty awkward. I liked my small group of friends and spent a lot of time by myself. I was very independent and happy. 
For me, one of the struggles I dealt with was trying to be my own person while feeling constantly judged. I was definitely weird and by trying to be myself I had some pretty awkward moments but I did eventually figure it all out. I guess I'm glad I was able to be independent and not end up letting the expectations of everyone around me define who I became as a person. 
Was I bossy and controlling? I'm not exactly sure, but I was a take charge type of person. I volunteered to lead and had no problem being in charge, and honestly, a lot of other students weren't comfortable, so I sorta think I was doing everyone a favor. 
But I got in trouble A LOT. I was a good kid and really didn't like getting in trouble so I was a teacher's pet. But when I felt like my friendships were being threatened I got mean. I once wrote a letter to a girl who ""stole"" my best friend. It was bad and I got into a lot of trouble. I think they knew I was just 12 and didn't know any better and the visit to the office scared the living shit out of me. 
Learning to control Te is rough. I was quite outspoken from an early age, and it took a few fuck ups before I learned to chill out. I was fired at 16 for sending what was classified as a harassment text. Honestly, this was 11 years ago and texting was brand new and I don't think the company had the right to fire me over a text like that. But regardless I was fired for it. And then at 19, I had a job where I also ""spoke my mind"" and got into some trouble too. Honestly, looking back I really struggled with learning when to speak and when to shut the hell up. 
My mom said I was the hardest kid, and thank god I had an ESTJ dad who knew how to handle me. He honestly was a huge help for me growing up. He understood my crazy mind and he knew how to deal with it. "
993,estj,"Well I can definitely relate to some of it. Yeah, haha! Interesting childhood. I definitely know about the te stuff. 
Well yeah, I am physically disabled I am blind, so yeah, I know how the bullying works haha! Never had friends and they treated me like the squeaky wheel. And then I had no friends really for a long time. I thought for a long time I was an introvert because of all of that and I didn‚Äôt like people all that much, but in another sense I craved it.
And yeah, I was pretty awkward too. I sometimes described myself as a young voldemort at least the way he acted not so much his motives. Really much of a jerk but really polite and manipulative haha!"
994,estj,"Hello fellow ESTJ's, I'd like to know your opinion on which is the hardest mbti type to deal with for us, either friendships or relationships,  based on your personal experience. Personally, it's INFJ."
995,estj,"I don't know if you've checked out socionics before, but they say INFJ-ESTJ, INFP-ESTP pairings are ideal in terms of balance. In my personal experience, I had the best connection with my ESTJ ex-boyfriend, and I am an INFJ. 
But i always come to the conclusion that while MBTI is great for seeing how we're wired in our heads, it doesn't take into consideration all the experiences/nurture portion of our personalities. I've also met ESTJ men that I didn't get along with. I think a big part of it is also how many Ns and Ss you grew up with in your family. "
996,estj,"I know an INFJ who has an ESTJ parent and they have a very difficult time dealing with each other/connecting with one another, so that's another point to validate your experience.
I actually believe there is some sort of pattern where if someone is the opposite type of you with the exception of your judging/perception preference, it usually guarantees a lot of misunderstanding and difficulty to automatically get along. e.g. ISFP-ENTP, INFJ-ESTJ, ESFP-INTP, ENTJ-ISFJ.
For example, I'm an INFP and I have an extremely hard time connecting with ESTPs in general. (note that the first three letters are inverted but the P is the same). I also know of a couple that is an INTJ-ESFJ and they have had many misunderstandings with one another throughout the years. I know I only have three examples of this, but I'd be interested to see if this applies to other pairings with the same pattern.
I don't ever believe it's impossible for two types to get along/for things to work out even if they're couples, but I think there are certain combinations where it requires a lot of conscious/deliberate effort to gel with one another. There are opposites that attract, and there are opposites that repel."
997,estj,I find that the best way to deal with ESTJs is to ask for forgiveness... never permission.  Once you show them that something works they integrate it into their list of shit that works.  Before that... forget it.  
998,estj,"I'd definitely agree with that. One of my best friends is an ESTP (I'm an INFP) and our friendship definitely took a lot of patience and open-mindness at certain points. If it wasn't for MBTI I don't know if I ever would have understood where she's coming from most of the time. Our lines of thinking just don't line up. But once you reach that understanding, having a friendship with an starkly different type is really intriguing and rewarding.
Kind of goes to show that socionics can predict understanding, but not necessarily compatibility as long as you're willing to put in the work."
999,estj,"I'm an INFP who once was in a 3 year relationship with an ISTP, and I had a hard time keeping up with him or even communicating with him. I can't even imagine how much harder it would have been with an ESTP. Although technically INFP's full (8) cognitive function order opposite is ISTP, not ESTP. 
Now I'm in a relationship with an ESTJ (Si-subtype). Huge difference. He and I come from different backgrounds and have very different abilities, but psychologically things are very comfortable and mutually understood in a way I can't explain without the cognitive function theory. And it was that way from the first time we spoke. "
1000,estj,"I am an INFJ and my mother is an ESTJ. We don't get along very well. She always asks me, for example, to wash the dishes (which I have planned to do so in an hour or so) when I am reading something that entertains my idealism. It is absolutely annoying and, if pushed further, we go into a hot, irrational (to each of our understandings of what is rational) debate, in which I want to inflict emotional harm as much as possible. I oftentimes think my mother is a repressive tyrant - a leviathan.
On the other hand, my mother thinks I am a Romantic in a very bad, ESTJ sense.
So, living alone, far away, is a great solution for me."
1001,estj,"I completely agree.
and about relationships, personally it was extremely hard for me to approach an INFJ girl, and there were a lot of misunderstandings, that I overcame by being a bit flexible for the sake of peace and progress. eventually I was blocked for a ridiculous reason.
Although I read some posts about INFJ-ESTJ couples saying they're a perfect match and happily married. "
1002,estj,"That's awesome! There's such a long list of bad cases between INFJs and ESTJs that I find cases like yours refreshing!
What was the dynamic like? I love ESTJ's steadfastness, respect for tradition/authority, and protective nature. I think they aren't too sure of themselves a lot of the times (never show externally though; they're rock solid on the outside), but that was where I was able to bring some anchor internally. I'd say the balance was great!
How is/was your experience?"
1003,estj,"That's good. One of my best friends that I have known for over half of my life since middle school is an ISTP, and our friendship has really been because of our mutual sense of humor and interest in leisurely things (e.g. video games, movies, TV shows, etc.). Although I wouldn't say I feel connected in some ""deep"" way, they at least gave me the courtesy of listening whenever I went on emotional vents throughout the years and has always been generous with their attention. We've never had any quarrels of any sorts in all of this time, and we have a plethora of memories together."
1004,estj,"Well, for one he was very empathetic towards others, and thought about the feelings of others in ways I wouldn't have normally. On the other hand he was very concerned about offending others. I'm the type to just say screw them, they can think whatever they want.
The only thing that has driven us apart, to the point where we are hardly friends anymore, is that we want very different things out of life, and opposing viewpoints on how to obtain them. For one, my friend is very platonic when it comes to girls. He has girls all over him but shows no interest in them. He wants to wait as long as he can to get married, because he believes he will miss out on traveling and doing a lot if he were to get married. Me on the other hand, I want to get married as soon as possible. I want a loving wife, kids, white picket fence, the whole shebang.
The problem arose when I started dating his sister. He was very mad and said I was stifling her, and that she would miss out on so much to be married to me. Me, being the ESTJ I am, basically told him I'm going to do what I want and he can't stop me. He got pretty mad at his ENFP sister as well. Anyways we ended breaking up for many reasons, one of which being her psycho family.
Anyways, me and INFJ are good now, although we still may have just a little beef about the whole situation. What I learned was that INFJ's are very protective of whom they view to be one of their own, and have a very strict internal code which applies to them, as well as to everyone else around them."
1005,estj,"Same. Not me personally, but I'm close friend with an INFJ who, himself, is good friends with an ESTJ. He's told me that they work together very well, for the reasons that /u/Secretaccount2134 outlined. 
Personally, I can't stand that same ESTJ. (INTJ)"
1006,estj,"Thank you for sharing! That sounds like quite a journey. And I'm glad you guys are good... I'm sure he missed you as a friend. 
I think INFJs who grew up with Sensors are really lucky. Exactly half of my family are sensors, so I actually have adopted a lot of what sensors would typically strive for and stand for (more traditional family things, status, etc.)
I think your friend INFJ's wishes to delay marriage as much as possible is unique to him and not necessarily an INFJ thing... All INFJs I've ever known dream to have families, hahaha. 
Anyhow, thanks again for sharing. I wish I knew more ESTJs around!"
1007,estj,"I am not even sure what you want from us. An introduction?
I think this calls for some field research. Find some young ESTJ(s) and observe them in their natural habitat. Talking to them shouldn‚Äôt hurt too much either."
1008,estj,"Here's an anecdotal description of one for you as someone who's been dating a Gen Y ESTJ for years:  


Happy to be a cog in the machine, but aims for a place high-up in the machine through a mix of hard work, being more intelligent than most people, and being affable enough that nobody notices when he's slacking. loudest person in the office. Picks up mentors like flypaper. 


traditional, but somewhat progressive in views. is however a kool-aid drinker and does not want to rock the boat at all costs. would rather convince himself he agrees with something against his principles than burn a bridge until it reaches a breaking point or he witnesses several people he respects jumping ship.  


less traditional in that he doesn't want kids, is athiest-agnostic, borderline liberal


family comes first 100% of the time    


all or nothing on everything, see example below:


by day: gym bro, eating broccoli, counting calories, sharp dresser, white collar golden-boy with a collection of middle aged women who wish their sons were like him, and every bro-type guy has a man-crush on him.    
by night: smokes weed for hours every night after work - nobody would ever suspect it. consumes around 5000 calories in two nights over the weekend, and is back to his routine by Monday. rinse and repeat. would have the physique of a superhero if it weren't for the weed. when not able to consume weed for days due to travel, becomes the high-strung micromanager he would probably be if he wasn't a stoner - pretty sure smoking weed helps him maintain an enviable level of low stress 24/7 (his coworkers don't know how he does it). he's delightful when stoned, is willing to entertain more theoretical discussions. "
1009,estj,"Here's what I don't understand about SJs: Why be loyal to some jackass who doesn't give a crud about your existence? Why be loyal to some selfish jerk who's just using you? Do you think Jeff Bezos gives a crud about his employees?
Why attach one's ego to a title, medal, trophy, etc.? Take the Oscars. It's all promotion. Take medals and titles in the military. They're just incentives with no practical purpose other than to try to get people to work harder, but what's the work? Killing millions to save millions? Killing some to save others? Look at the numbers. All to serve some greedy, unhealthy, self-absorbed, extremely selfish jerk at the top who doesn't care about you. Take college titles and professional titles. They're artificial constructs that are nothing but buzzwords and promotion due to an extremely outdated, incredibly corrupt education model. Sanitation officer vs. Garbage man. It's the same thing, yet they could very well be smarter and better informed than a millionaire or person with a PhD on a topic.
Why take the orthodox way when people don't become highly successful using orthodox methods? Do you think the 1% is successful because they did what the 99% are/were doing? No. They did what the 99% weren't doing."
1010,estj,"That sounds more like either an extremely shallow version of an SJ or a caricature built from stereotypes.
My loyalty in that case would only be the bare minimum required out of professional and social courtesy and any other perceived/demonstrated loyalty would most likely be me either doing the things needed to maintain my own position or to better my circumstances.  Chances are if I‚Äôm under a shitty boss who‚Äôs using me I‚Äôd be trying to maneuver myself out of that area and using/working around them just as much as they‚Äôd be using/working around me.  Shitty bossses suck for everyone involved, and they tend to wreck things with their inefficiency and pass the bill for their mistakes onto those underneath them.
I don‚Äôt care about any of those things tbh.  For me my sense of accomplishment is attached to my works/products and their effect on the world.  Who cares about some guy with a fancy title when the guy next door over has been starting movements that are changing society as we speak?
I 100% agree.
I am definitely not orthodox and would consider myself to be innovative/an innovator.  I don‚Äôt take the orthodox route.  I take the route of practically and the methods that I perceive to have worked in the past.  If some of those methods happen to be considered orthodox then so be it.  Some traditions exist for a reason after all."
1011,estj,"It's based on what I've seen..Welcome to Texas!
Interesting by the way. Thanks for clearing that up."
1012,estj,"The guy who was talking about it mentioned Se-critical parent (ESTJ want to look as close to perfection as possible). 
Not that all ESTJ females are gym babes, but that a lot of gym babes are ESTJs, also given the amount of hard work and dedication it takes to bodybuild"
1013,estj,"I think because ESTJs are competitive and hard-working that they are often involved in sports/fitness in general. I don‚Äôt have a ton of reference because I don‚Äôt know my friends‚Äô MBTI types, but it makes sense."
1014,estj,"Hi, I'm doing a little research on personality types and conspiracy theories and if different personalities are drawn more towards certain conspiracy theories or if its just a completely individual thing to follow certain conspiracy theories. It would be great if you in the ESTJ community could respond to me about if you follow any conspiracy theories and if you dont. Thanks!!"
1015,estj,"It's fun to ridicule conspiracy theorists, and they're oftentimes very harmful towards progress in society, but in some ways, I almost admire their tenacity. Being so set on a belief and creating elaborate theories to support it for seemingly no reason requires a lot of confidence, and I find the lengths they go to simply to win an internet argument fascinating. Of course, many likely just suffer from mental illness which may predispose them to paranoia, but their persistence is frankly very impressive to me.
That being said, I find it ironic that many believe they're the only people left willing to question society's narrative while simultaneously refusing to critically evaluate the reasoning behind their own ideas. They often have plausible sounding theories for how everything is a lie, but they rarely stop to question why they should believe it. But who knows, maybe they'll hit the jackpot one day and save us all :P"
1016,estj,"I'm asking this to test a theory CelebrityTypes has that people often use their main function in place of their inferior function when faced with matters which would require the engagement of said function. For example, if a Fe-dom was asked if socialism was logically valid, the Fe-dom may respond ""Well socialism has objectively good goals, so on that basis, yes it is logically valid."""
1017,estj,"I don't think you're going to get a whole lot of responses to this question until people here are confident they can give you a reliable and educated answer.  Understanding that my formal education in psychology/psychoanalysis and familiarity with CelebrityTypes is limited to non-existent, I'll shoot from the hip on this one.
I do not agree with using the word 'compensate' in this question, but that may be a personal preference rather than valid semantic argument.  While it may be true that the ESTJ model does not tend to associate inter-personally through emotional display, I don't think that is grounds to discredit the effects of emotion on judgement.  Rather than compensate for a lack of sentimental judgement, it is more appropriate to say that an ESTJ would value or rely on their analytical judgement despite their sentimental judgement.
I have found in my life that my first check on the validity of something is my gut feeling and emotional response.
Someone suggests doing something I know is wrong:  how do I feel about that?

Scared (of getting in trouble)
Angry (that they would even suggest breaking the rules)
Helpless (that others seem to agree with the suggestion)
Betrayed (that they would be willing to get the rest of us in trouble as well)

Now we move to analytical.  Why do I feel that way?  Cause I was raised that way?  Cause I was taught that way?  Cause my last boss mentored me to trust my instincts?  Why are they suggesting this thing despite it being wrong?  Am I incorrect?  In what way could I be incorrect?  Can't figure out how I am wrong, develop counter-arguments.  Present counter-arguments.  Process responses.  Repeat process (starting with emotional response, depending on the type of response).
Sentimental judgement as a decision or reality making process is an inferior process to this type, not a non-existent one.  Dealing with my daughters is a constant rollercoaster of sentimental judgement, augmented and solidified with analytical judgment. I believe the most common response you've gotten to these types of questions is that the dominant does not replace the inferior, but rather overtakes the inferior once the inferior has been taxed, threatened, or simply cannot keep up with the demands of the situation.  
If I, as a response, feel a certain way about something and attempt to use that to develop judgement, that method is quickly taxed (for me in particular) and I will revert to supporting my judgement with further analytical judgement.  Only in the extremes of this, in which cases I cannot find reason in why I feel a way about something, will I cease to feel at all and disassociate my sympathetic response with my analytical judgement."
1018,estj,"Thanks?  It's hard to judge people's legitimate responses via text; it takes out too much of the human-factor sometimes.  Normally I take text at face value (thank god for the introduction of the /s), and so here I want to say thanks!
I think it's pretty safe to say that if I'm going to do something, I want to do it right, even in replying to something I don't agree with, per se."
1019,estj,"I meant it. Really thorough and interesting/well thought out analysis of the difference between analytical and sentimental judgement.
I find I have an ongoing ""argument"" with T-doms about feelings, and the idea that as a ""thinker"" I still have emotions, they just aren't what I prefer to rely on in decision making. But this is one of the more articulate explanations I've seen of exactly what I've been trying to express..."
1020,estj,"One of the common complaints I've seen against unhealthy ESTJs is that they want everyone else to be like them. 
That got me curious enough to ask this question. I do, however, admit that there is another reason. My own mother remarried a few years ago to an ESTJ, and her personality has changed so much, to being like he is which to me is weird, but as long as she's happy, I'm supportive.
As an ESTJ, if someone did start acting just like you, what would your personal take be? 
As this is an opinion question, there is no wrong answer here."
1021,estj,"I really enjoy being around people who are like me, but not if they're acting like me, just existing like me. I don't find too many people similar to myself. In many ways, I can be quite eccentric to observers, but I really enjoy being around others who think similarly to me. But if someone out of the blue started behaving like me, I'd probably be slightly creeped out while simultaneously being slightly flattered. 
I've never heard of that complaint against unhealthy ESTJs. I've heard of ESTJs who want everyone else to live up to their standards, but not necessarily behave like them."
1022,estj,"I have an ESTJ friend who does it very often. He analyzes my lifestyle and ""finds a solution"" that would only work if I was him... I mean can only see the world through his own eyes and values... I usually have zero tolerance for such a thing but he is the kind of person that wouldn't mind harshest criticism on his own lifestyle so we get along and express our real thoughts without any feel hurt. I'm an INTJ by the way."
1023,estj,"When people tell me their troubles, I kind of leap to the conclusion that they want my advice. I figure that if they want emotional support, they'll likely just go to someone else. I'll give emotional support when something bad has happened to someone  (I probably will try to start brainstorming ways in which they can help themselves, however), not if it's a problem that they've created in their own mind (""I think this person hates me"", ""I feel like people are drifting away from me"", ""I'm worried about the future""), in which case I try to give practical solutions.
Two people that often go to me for support are an INFP and an ISFP. They both have a LOT of feelings. When I try to give the ISFP my advice, she gets frustrated that I'm trying to give her advice when I don't know her situation, but then I feel frustrated because I don't why she came to me in the first place. The INFP comes to me for advice and actually takes my advice. I like helping him out, as he wants another unique perspective on the situation, and though he is a gentle soul, he appreciates the advice I give him and tries to implement it.
Generally, I could try harder to be more emotionally supportive, but I just get confused as to why I need to be. I'm consciously aware of this issue. However, deep down, I have my issues and struggles and feelings too, I just don't feel the need to take them out on other people, I make solutions. It pisses me off when I get told that I just can't understand, because most of the time, I have similar feelings, I just don't want to bother other people with them. Because of this, they think I'm some emotionless robot and it kind of stings. I'm aware of this flaw in my character, but it still frustrates me."
1024,estj,"Always. It's difficult for me not to when my friends or family members present a problem. My instinct is to find ways to solve it or tell them what I would do if I was in the situation...not necessarily a good thing, but it's usually my instinct. I'm not a robot, but it's certainly easier for me to propose logical solutions than it is to say ""There, there! Cry it all out. Let's all cry."" I prefer ""Okay, what he did was terrible. You can either do this or this. You didn't do anything wrong, if you look at everything you said, it was right..."" it's easier to logically analyze situations and provide advice, even when not asked. For me, at least, that is. "
1025,estj,"When I was younger, someone actually did tell me I was the emotional equivalent of an ice-cold, powered-down robot.  I just kinda shrugged it off.
I'm 100% with you on when people talk to me about their problems.  I do it with my ENFP girlfriend constantly when she just wants emotional support and it pisses her off to no end.  She typically gets over it really quickly when her emotions ebb and she realizes I'm trying to help her for exactly what she asked (without asking).  I'm also getting better at dealing with her specifically in regards to emotional support, but it's still difficult.
More in line with what OP was saying though, I do find myself to be a minor deity of unsolicited advice from time to time.  Normally, it starts with someone getting my attention in some way and then I realize they're either doing something wrong, the hard way, or not doing it at all.  I almost always fight myself over telling them (we're all A-type personalities at my work and some people don't take that kind of thing well) but I find a quick explanation or question smooths over the unsolicited intro.  ""Hey man, can I show you something that helps me real quick,"" or ""This might be annoying, but I feel like I can help you with this,"" are a couple of examples.  Or just asking them if they need help, and explaining why I'm asking.  I realize when my work friend, an INTP who sits near to me, sighs out loud, that's my cue to ask him ""What do you need help with man,"" because he does need help, but either doesn't realize it or doesn't want to ask.  If I'm unsure, I just ask him, ""Would you like to hear an example/another way of how to do this,"" or ""Do you mind if I bounce a piece of advice off you?""  Satisfaction comes from when my unsolicited advice is used or praised, validating my habit."
1026,estj,"Probably start charging at their chosen mate with words and (interrogative) questions as cool as possible, and if s/he can stand it, they remember to do whatever activity their partner enjoys just so they can report back to them and tell them how they felt about it, which is an effort to charm their partner (it kinda always works).
This is of course the calmest, subtle, most romantic version of ESTJs, usually they're just all up in your face with questions and a direct invitation either to their bed or their bank account as a life partner."
1027,estj,"My husband is an estj. We first met at a party and I wasn't sure if he liked me. We didn't exchange numbers and we went our separate ways. A week later he found me on Myspace (this was 2006, we were 19) and says ""don't I know you?"" We hit it off and he asked me out to dinner. We were both not willing to take the first leap and express our true feelings, but I knew he really liked me because he would reach out to me consistently, At least once a day to check in and make future plans. He always wanted me around and he made that very clear. "
1028,estj,"The way I have flirted I guess is by showing a general interest or by having joking challenges, but I guess overall, my biggest subconscious go to is just showing a lot of interests in their own interest like hobbies etc. "
1029,estj,"Usually I flirt like a sledgehammer. I am told, that I should try to be more subtle and romantic. But to be honest, I lack the patience for both. Actually I was told, that I lack any sort of discretion.
Also, I should stop SHOUTING my lines, as in: ""OMG, speak a little bit loader and my husband might hear us.""-""Why, is he at this party?""- ""No, he is dead!""
But to give some examples:
""You know what would be better than a cat-story? A lap-dance.""
<she takes off her top
""Isn't it boring to stand here all alone smoking. Lets make things exciting!""
""You stared at me for the last 15 minutes. Would you either come to the point or stop starring."""
1030,estj,"I am a little bit confused. How does showing interest in a hobby advances the excitement?
Maybe I lack creativity here, but I can't imagine many scenarios in which this would play a role. The only hobby I can think of is sex itself.
Based on past experience the best route is to show a fit body and a quick wit.  "
1031,estj,"ENFP here I SO AGREE. 
My ESTJ hit on me by putting her arm around me, coming out to me as bi (I am too), and when I expressed surprise she said, ""Didn't you notice me trying not to look at your boobs?"" she then asked if I found her hot. 
Straightforward as fuuuuck. I enjoyed it. "
1032,estj,"Asking because when my ESTJ friend does Te things like send me a long bullet-pointed list of what he learned at a meeting/class via text, it makes me chuckle and shake my head. So it got me wondering if there are things I do as an INFP that make him react the same way. He's already told me I make him smile often, but at what I'm not sure (since we've only communicated by text/phone so far)."
1033,estj,"Honestly, I just love how true INFPs are to themselves.  They are weird and do things that don't really make a lot of sense, but I love it, I absolutely love it.
My favorite kinds of people are people who know who they are and make no apologies for it. An INFP is almost always just that.  
My INFP is a vegan and animal lover. It's a passion of hers, and sometimes she does things that make me roll my eyes and I might make fun of her for it, but she continues being herself.  You rarely find people who are like that, they either get aggressive because you don't agree with them, or they change a part of who they are to try and please you.  
A lot of people might think ESTJ and INFP is a poor match, but I love everything about INFPs.  They are weird and a bit strange and I don't want to be like them, but I want people like that in my life.  I want people who are different from me.  
You also have huge hearts and your feels are the best.  
I went through a really rough patch a few years back.  It was the worst year of my life, and my INFP was amazing through all of it.  She would go to the coffee shop with me and we would get Mochas and then go watch the sunset at the beach. She would stay up super late and watch TV with me and we would make french fries together.  All of those things are just small simple acts of kindness, but it meant the world to me.  She never once made me feel like crap, not the way everyone else in my life did.  She wasn't trying to help me, she was just being a friend, just being there for me, and it meant the world to me.  
I have a hard time expressing how I feel about people, especially when it's directly to them, and every time I do she makes sure to rub it in my face and make me feel all awkward, but I'm okay with it.  I know I'm awkward when it comes to showing affection.  "
1034,estj,"I love Fi child and Fi inferior! They so cute!

1035,estj,"INFP passing by out of curiosity
Wow... I would've thought INFPs would be boring for an ESTJ and maybe even annoying... That there is... quite eye-opening.
Makes me happy to keep doing me :) thank you for this"
1036,estj,"I used to think that, but I think it only applies to immature/unhealthy ESTJs/INFPs or ones who don't share similar goals in life. The Fi values have to match, more or less, so Te can make things happen. Otherwise, it'll fall apart. My ESTJ's ex-wife with whom he shares a kid is also supposedly INFP, but they divorced when he found out she was a secret painkiller addict. I'm sure they had the same chemistry we have, but her being ok with lying to him and betraying his trust was a dealbreaker.
That's pretty much how I feel. We're so different but we get along so well. I like to say that he says things that I didn't know I wanted to hear. But hearing his opinions, beliefs, range of knowledge, the way he says things, all make me feel like I'm home, in a different package -- the ESTJ version of INFP. 
Thanks for sharing what you appreciate about your INFP friend! It helps me understand what I have to offer my ESTJ :)."
1037,estj,"I found mine on an online dating site where he conveniently labeled himself an ESTJ-A. Apparently he had taken the MBTI test several times for work and also knew that mentioning it on his profile would attract certain personality types that seemed compatible with him (although he says I am only his 2nd INFP ‚Äî his first was his ex-wife, eek!) 
There are lots of ESTJs in the business and technology sectors. Of the 3 I know, one (Te-subtype) is a CEO of an alarm monitoring company, another was a mechanical engineering student/rock climber/3d printing enthusiast/beard competition contestant (Si-subtype) and the 3rd (my current friend) is a nuclear engineer (Si-subtype). Probably pure coincidence but all of them are tall and physically imposing for some reason. And the latter two of those three are really into motorcycles and other outdoorsy stuff."
1038,estj,"I have a roommate that is also an INFP and I have been hanging on to this manipulative and abusive INTP friend ish kinda person.  She spoke solid truth to me and explained the situation to me in a way where I could finally let go of him. 
I struggle so much trying to figure out how I am feeling and I need strong feeling types in my life because they always seem to say what I can't figure out myself.  It's like I understand what's going on but until someone can help make sense of it for me then I can do something about it."
1039,estj,"Yup. I used to find the idea of ESTJs a big ‚ÄúNope!‚Äù until I experienced an ISTJ and realized our complementary balance was very attractive and could even be better with an ESTJ. And it is! One of the things I really love about my ESTJ is how positive he is. He can keep up with what I talk about without getting bored or boring me. I find everything he says interesting and agreeable. I do think for some reason the ISTJ inspired me to be more independent and go-getter though... as if I was trying to be more Ne-Te and I kinda miss that version of me. 
You might have different interests to some ESTJs but the key is to find one with overlapping interests. Sometimes that‚Äôs more a matter of cultural environment than type... I‚Äôm a city girl who‚Äôs always dreamed of eventually having a homestead and luckily the ESTJ I‚Äôm interested in is a southern country boy who likes building, hunting and fishing. On his part, he‚Äôs always dreamed of being with an artistic, creative, giving person who could help him with aesthetic decisions and the duties of life in general. And the things I do and say seem to naturally surprise and impress him? Anyway, don‚Äôt give up on finding ESTJs, they are worth it!!"
1040,estj,"I am an INFP.
Going through some turmoil with the SO right about now. Can't see eye to eye. I want to talk about feelings, he wants to talk about the concrete facts and logistics of things. Looking for answers here too, haha.
We're going to have to compromise. Both feeling as if the other isn't hearing what the other is saying: feelings turned into misrepresented, cold logistics, and logical facts being  interpreted into biased feelings.
It sucks balls. It really sucks. I don't know, there's a silver lining. I feel that we're able to be better after overcoming this obstacle together-better people, better relationship, and have a stronger understanding with one another. I feel like we're halfway out of our current storm.
We'll see how it goes.
Update:
For anyone who cares to know, we got over it.
In my case, I had to explain how I felt and what my true intentions were. I let my SO know what was going in my mind exactly without dusting off the grit of it and tried to calm my emotions, speaking calmly, whilst doing it (if not, you'll probably scare off the other person lol). Honestly, in this case you can't fight fire with fire. I guess what I learned through this is that you should always try to understand and hear out the true feelings of your SO and to present your feelings in a way they'd understand. Help them overcome this fear of showing an extravagant amount of emotions and try to get that break through heart to heart."
1041,estj,My current SO is INFP and it's definitely difficult at times but I'm extremely forthright so I usually just blatantly tell him what I need. He does not do this often enough but he's trying... so far I love his dreamer and spontaneous personality because I need more of that in my life!
1042,estj,"INFPs and ENFPs are generally very strong with empathy. They form strong emotional connections with a partner, and sex should be solid as long as the emotional component is strong.
I recently ended a long-term relationship with an INFP, and it was tough not seeing eye to eye on some things. INFPs are known as dreamers, and sometimes they'll be lost in the clouds when you want to get things done/fix something concrete.
They've got some decent potential for spontaneity which is a good balance for strong Js."
1043,estj,"Hey! I've been smoking pot for the past 1 and half, and recently started smoking ciggartes which I don't take pride in..
I've been smoking 1-4 cigs for the 3 months, and I can feel myself become more and more addicted. 
I smoke for these reasons:


It's nice to have to roll a cig, it's really fun to roll a fine ciggarte, I like to also grind my tobbacco so it fits really nice!


It's a nice addition to my routine, I like to prepare myself breakfast, and before eating and watching an episode of a show, I smoke and drink my tea while listening to music and observing nature outside my apartment. CHILL AS FUCK!


Friends, a nice addition to a conversation


Relax.. My life is very stressful at times...

"
1044,estj,"I think i have met an ESTJ in my university. He talk but sometimes someone break his logical, he changed to the completely opposite sentence that he just said. For example, yesterday he said about love without money, his real love. Today he said about he is fuck whore money is a majority of love. He likes to approach the people he considers as inferior to him, tell them to improve themselves as the way that he suggests, most of them ignore him, some of them respond with a little bit tense, he lowered his voice:"" I try to help you, i want you to become better."" When i lost my stuff, he asked very specific about my stuff. Then in the night, i laughed for something else, he asked i am happy because i have my wallet back. I responded with some tense and joke:""Oh yeah, so what?"" He just lowered his voice:"" I just ask"". When he said something, and i interrupted, he said:"" shut up!"", sounded like an elementary kid screaming. Is there anyone, is a pathetic estj?"
1045,estj,"Walked on the train
Saw abandoned corner seats
As walking toward it, saw some cash on the seat
Picked it up and turned around to see if someone was coming for it
Only a girl behind me, which had also just got on the train
She gave me a peculiar look and smile
She knew I had just found the money
I'm thinking about the money, as I hold it in my hands
My first reaction was to share the money with her
But I held on
My second reaction was to look away from her direction because I felt awkward
I'm looking down at the money in my hands 
I observe and observe and observe
I think and I think and I think
Should I give it to a homeless person
Should I buy some homeless persons food
Should I save it for myself
Suppose I want to eat or need train fare
14 dollars could come in handy
The ten dollar bill began to speak to me
It said I'm in hell 
5 stops later
I'm still agonizing over what to do with the money
I began to think what if I had just flicked the money over so I could sit down
Maybe I would of had peace
Then I think maybe this is why humanity is in hell 
Money funds hell
I walk off the train
I have proposed an act for myself
I will throw the money away in the trash can in the subway
I get off the train
I'm a bit anxious
I don't why I'm anxious but I am
I lift my hand over the trash can
I drop the money in the trash can as if it was trash
I don't know if anyone behind me noticed
There were about 20 people walking behind me
I leave the station
I'm walking as if I had done something selfless
But maybe it was actually the most selfish thing possible
Who knows
Could all of humanity be compassionate enough to throw away our money and dedicate our thinking and efforts to compassion and compassion alone."
1046,estj,"Hey asshole, you did not throw away your money. You threw away someone else‚Äôs money. 
Compassion would have been to think, well shit, this could well be someone‚Äôs only remaining $14 and promptly handing it in to Lost and Found. 
You picked it up, dithered for 5 stops and then performed a fucking breathtaking act of cowardice. The only profundity in this incident and your response to it, is how stupid it was. 
Christ. "
1047,estj,"This was really cool to read! It‚Äôs ok to be selfish sometimes, your actions didn‚Äôt directly affect anyone. I think that‚Äôs really really cool and interesting. 
It‚Äôs crazy what people do for money. 
So I‚Äôm so happy that you were able to overcome the invasive thoughts and get rid of the problem in your own way!!! "
1048,estj,"Oh wow! What a waste! Yeah, turning money into lost and found to be futile because that would basically be giving the money to lost and found person to keep. I would‚Äôve either given it to a homeless person who needed it a lot or just of kept it for myself which is probably more likely I just don‚Äôt understand why anybody would throw money in the trashcan! It just seems really foolish and imprudent to do! Maybe is my 3w4 speaking."
1049,estj,"Giving money to a ""lost and found."" There is no lost and found for money found in a subway seat you genius. You obviously don't recognize how much of a hell you are in. You're here torn to shreds because I threw away money. Omg not even that I threw away money, but money that I  found... thank you for demonstrating exactly the paradigm that I rebeled against by throwing away that money. I know now that I did the right thing, maybe you'll be free one day and understand. "
1050,estj,"I've seen people attribute this to ESTJs. Do you agree with it, and if you do, to what extent?
I know an ESTJ who constantly has to physically see things for themselves. This comes in multiple forms:


Whether something would fit inside another thing (even if it looks like it wouldn't fit at all)


Scoping stores for items that, imho, obviously wouldn't be found there just in case it is


Doing something someone else has already done just to verify


I concede that the last one is because the ESTJ probably believes they might know a better way to do something, but the constant verification can be frustrating. At the very least it wastes time and at most I'm constantly being doubted."
1051,estj,"Isn't this contrary to the nature of Te? Te naturally looks for external sources of information, often basing beliefs on secondary information and expert opinion.
Despite my previous points, I personally relate to all three of those dot points.
I actually think it's a Ne thing. Ne realizes that not everything is always going occur in a certain way, and SJs often tend to catastrophize what could go wrong if we're not certain of every possibility. That thing doesn't look like it fits in this thing, but maybe my perspective is wrong. That store probably wouldn't hold that item, but there's always a chance. Maybe that person says they did this thing, but what if they're lying to me? What if they were mistaken? What if they did it incorrectly? 
Ne in SJs often leads to a certain self-doubt, and Si has a need to feel secure, so it makes sense that we'd need to double check everything. I don't think I need to ""experience"" something per se, but I need to be very sure."
1052,estj,I disagree on almost every point. I think it's more about trust. If I hear something from someone I believe is competent I'll believe it unless I have a specific reason to disagree. If I don't think the person is qualified I'll just ignore their input and see for myself. If they were right I'll update what I consider them knowledgeable about unless I think they got lucky.
1053,estj,"I believe that truth can only be understood trough practical means. And while I trust my senses, I don't need to have seen the Roman Empire  to believe it actually existed. On the flip side, this is the reason why I am an atheist.
Not really. Instead of speculating what machine X can do, I rather build it and look up what it actually does. Reality is sometimes stranger than our wildest imaginations.
The opposite actually. I usually don't think that elephant meat can be brought on the fish-market. 
Of course. How else would I know if a claim is true or not? And I usually learn something from it.
The bigger waste would be to built upon false facts and faith. And what has the truth to do with your ego? If it is a true statement it can be verified and if not, then you can be happy, that the error was found."
1054,estj,I think it is true to a large extent but it depends on who tells me what information. I think this is really typical when it comes to religion. I cannot believe it unless I have some sort of physical proof. I love the book of revelations and prophecy fulfilling. 
1055,estj,"Very interesting, the anxiety from Ne makes a lot of sense and I wouldn't have thought of it from my Ne-aux perspective. Thank you! I always thought that it had something to do with PoLR Ni, thus the lack of foresight but that seems more true.
Are there certain situations wherein you can stamp away the ""what ifs"" and the need to be sure?"
1056,estj,"This is why I think it bothers me, because I work myself to be competent and it's that competency that's being questioned (most of the time). 
I suppose it has less to do with me though, considering the person I know is an E1 who thinks they know best. 
Thank you for your take on this! :)"
1057,estj,"Hello, thanks for the response!
I should have specified, the distinction isn't that explicit. Say you're looking for a blouse and you come across a clothes store, but from the external display it seems like all they have are casual clothes. Would you venture in?
I think you're looking at it from a theoretical perspective? Or at least that's how it's coming across to me.
Here's how I experience this:
ESTJ asks me to do something 
In situations wherein there are time constraints, it just comes across as a hassle. 
Also, I see your point, the truth is necessary. I may have exaggerated how much this aggravates me with that comment. This only really bothers me in the situation I presented above."
1058,estj,"If there's a situation where being unable to make a decision in a short period of time will lead to something I don't want, I'll be willing to risk it, but I generally won't take any unnecessary risks, especially those that can be easily avoided. 
I think it's probably Ne in combination with PoLR Ni, sometimes my lack of confidence in how a series of events may develop leads to me planning in advance for many possibilities that will likely never occur."
1059,estj,I think if you offer a good proof or rationalization along with whatever fact or opinion you present that should go a long way to building up that trust quickly. If not it's a problem elsewhere in their personality not you or your skills.
1060,estj,I'm an ESTJ in love with an INTP. The more I think about it the more I realize I am just in love with the person I'm when I'm with the INTP and don't really appreciate any characteristics of the INTP. Do other ESTJ feel the same in their relationship?
1061,estj,"Hey. I'm an ESTJ/ENTJ. My partner is an ISTP. Knowing this helps me understand their needs better. I try not to get too hung up in the labels. My partners ethics/values/morals and behaviours are all ones that I value in a person. We share common opinions on important life choices. If your partner makes you a better person that sounds good to me. I, personally, am not with my partner because I need them but rather because I want them so I may not be able to relate to your exact situation. It sounds like your saying you might love how this person makes you feel more than the person themselves?"
1062,estj,"If you feel the love there is nothing about an INTP that should be a reason not to love them. They must be a good person. And considering the MBTI, you would just make each other better people because you are quite different. Love is love. You wouldn't have felt it if it wasn't something worth going for."
1063,estj,"I‚Äôm an INTP having difficulty with a friendship to an ESTJ. What are some of the things you like best about the relationships dynamic with the INTP? I would like to incorporate that into my approach with them if possible, try new angles of understanding and bonding. "
1064,estj,"Don't care at all. I haven't asked, don't really care to know. Has nothing to do with me or us. We're clean, happy, and sexually fulfilled together. Everything before we got together is a part of the equation that makes us, us. "
1065,estj,"My SO‚Äôs body count isn‚Äôt very high, but I knew/met two of their exes and they were positively revolting. I couldn‚Äôt believe that they‚Äôd been together, and it was definitely strange. However, they‚Äôve matured as a person and obviously began making better decisions (leading to us dating haha) and everyone has done regrettable things in their youth, so I‚Äôm no judge. We never speak about exes or past hookups because they are irrelevant and were just part of high school/college and growing up. "
1066,estj,"I had a conversation with my girlfriend about this recently.
Even though I was her first, anytime she mentions guys that she made out with at parties or stuff similar to that, it really gets to me. I brought it up to her, but I really couldn't get to the source of why it bothers me so much. I have a pretty long sexual history compared to her, and we pretty much started dating right after we met, but it really gets under my skin. 
I've found if they were in a relationship, I'd rather not hear about it, but it doesn't really stick with me. However, thinking about guys hooking up with her really makes me uncomfortable to think about. 
If someone could offer some insight as to why I feel this way, it'd be appreciated.
EDIT: Just realized I hijacked your thread without really answering the question lol. I guess what I'm getting at is that the amount doesn't really bother me as much as the context of the relationships."
1067,estj,"You didn't hijack it at all! I'm interested in responses like yours.
My guess is since you personally perceive those other guys (or a relationship with them) as low standard, then having a relationship with your girlfriend would possibly reflect the same upon you?
My other guess is you ""having"" to commit to your girlfriend for sex when other guys haven't needed to in the past. There are evolutionary reasons for being upset, like subconsciously believing you're in competition with other men to produce offspring with her and being the one ""saddled"" with responsibility of investing in a child that might not be yours. Obviously this a very crude way of putting it but humans are animals after all. We are driven by ancient instincts more than we realize."
1068,estj,"Interesting. The ESTJ I know says he likes experts at sex and doesn't ""see the appeal of sleeping with a virgin"". Either way there seems to be downside.
Less experienced partner = less insecurity on his part, but less sexual satisfaction 
More experienced partner = more insecurity on his part, but more sexual satisfaction 
Obviously high partner count /=/ good at sex, I'm just generalizing the thought process about this sort of thing "
1069,estj,"Insecure about what exactly? I'm very happy in my relationship, as is my partner. I think you may have a legitimate point but I can't think of much relationship wise that I don't have confidence in, for me or my girlfriend."
1070,estj,"I'm not really one to be competitive about my relationships with other guys, but your response  definitely got me thinking.
The theory I'm sticking to most right now is that it's a product of my own expectations. I have a bad habit of over romanticising my relationships and creating an idea for who my partner is before I really, fully get to know them. 
In this fantasy, obviously prior guys aren't considered, I'd much rather convince myself that she was never interested in anyone else before me and was only interested in me once she met me. Obviously that's 100% unrealistic, but I think I subconsciously create that storyline.
So when I hear that she used to go out and hook up with other guys, even if I've done the same thing, it still really hurts to think about. The idea of her just making out with some stranger in a club and never seeing him again absolutely kills me, even though she had no idea I even existed then. I perceive it as her not being the girl that I know, but really, she's just not the girl I created in my mind.
I'm venting quite a bit, but this is sort of helping me work out my thoughts, so I appreciate it. üòä"
1071,estj,"I think that's probably part of it. It just doesn't make a lot of sense because I definitely have my own experience in that area, but I just want better for her I guess? Maybe it's disappointing to me that she would set her standards so low when I know how much she deserves.
Thanks for your input, I think I'm a little closer on getting to the bottom of this."
1072,estj,"Insecure in yourself, probably. This is a symptom of jealousy, and slightly of ownership complex. You're jealous that they got to experience ""your"" SO. You're disappointed that they didn't have to invest what you're investing, that they just got a ""free taste"". Even though it's entirely hypocritical, because you were much more promiscuous than your SO.
This is all due to insecurity. Likely a fear that she compares you to them, or perhaps you're fearful of how you would stack up. Were they better endowed? Made more money? What made her compelled to initiate with them so quickly? Did they have something you don't?
The fact is, none of this matters. Your SO chose you, and chooses to spend their time with you. That's the most flattering gesture a person can ever offer.... Choosing to spend their time with you. Time is the most valuable thing we have. Your SO has a past, as do you. The events in that past made them who they are today. The person you love, who loves you. So embrace it all, and don't ever ask questions that don't matter, especially if you don't really want the answer.
Just my .02  "
1073,estj,"Shit man, it kind of feels like you just cracked an egg open. I've never really considered myself to be insecure, but what you're saying makes a lot of sense. As much as I don't want to know the answers to those questions, I think what I'm looking for is validation that I was better than the guys from her past. But you're right, that shit really does not matter. She's with me now, and I have to teach myself to be happy with that.
This hurt a lot to read, but I'm really glad I did. I have a lot of thinking to do. Thank you."
1074,estj,"Do ESTj‚Äôs regret things they say while angry? Is it built up frustration of honest comments (they meant what was said?)  I‚Äôm talking below the belt comments that were hurtful and unnecessary. I had a recent fallout with an ESTJ. We were friends for 4 years and started dating casually over the last couple of years. The last few weeks he had been busy with work so I gave him his space. This week, I decided to reach out to him and asked him what he thought about our dating situation as I keep getting hot and cold from him and I needed a little clarity because it was overwhelming. He can come across as emotionally unavailable.  
He didn‚Äôt respond so I told him I‚Äôd be stopping by after work to talk to him. All hell broke loose from that. I got the most disrespectful text I have ever received from anyone before. He stated that he had planned to see me but that as soon as I said I was going to get in his space and be intrusive by showing up uninvited, he was done with this. I won‚Äôt explain the rest but it is enough that his ugly comments made me not only confirm I don‚Äôt want to date him, he has successfully destroyed 4 years of friendship. I responded that I would not put up with those sorts of cruel outbursts and below the belt attacks.
Could something like my ‚Äúgetting in his space‚Äù really trigger such a response? Was he caught up in the heat of the moment or did he mean all of those hurtful statements? Will he regret what was said later? I will not be around to deal with it, I am just curious what goes on in the ESTJ mind."
1075,estj,"We ESTJs will get an understanding in our heads of what should be and how it actually is. We'll stress out over it but might not say anything if that is considered off limits. When we get into a bad argument, we'll take that opportunity to get all of the stuff that we've been holding up out. It can be very destructive and we might be especially attuned to making it so without realizing it.
If someone asks, ""did we mean it"", we'll be thinking, ""do I believe that I told the truth."" It's really hard for us to recognize the emotional content of the argument, even when it comes from us. In our heads, its like math or a plan of action. When someone get's upset, we're like, it's just logic. Can't we just agree on that?
Without knowing any more, you might be able to fix this by telling him that you don't know what you did wrong and offering to listen."
1076,estj,"Good for you for ditching this moron. I think he felt disrespected and wanted to make clear, who is the boss.
ESTJ(s) who loose control are the worst. Luckily we are usually good with stress. But I think it is sometimes just too much to handle.
That said, I don't look back at my anger outburst with any sort of guilt. I deluded myself in believing that it was all righteous anger and needed to be done.
He will probably regret destroying the chance of getting in your pants. "
1077,estj,"What does he do for a living that he would need space for several weeks?  I feel like ESTJs make time for people they want to see. You say casually dating over the last few years, how recently were you dating?  Isn't it a bit aggressive to ask someone to clarify a ""hot/cold"" situation that was preceded by several weeks of someone being busy and needing space and then taking a non response as an invitation to go to their home?
Honestly, it sounds like he maybe is in a relationship.  Are you sure he isn't seeing someone else and got upset because he was afraid he might get caught with the other woman?  I typically think ESTJs get angry like that mainly out of fear.  You say ""dating casually"" which I take to mean as having sex?  I wonder if he went cold because he is in a relationship and then got angry because maybe he was afraid you'd show up and cause a scene with the girlfriend.
I find that most ESTJs try to be as efficient as possible with work because they do prioritize meeting social obligations to friends and family so I think the busy with work thing for for weeks is concerning.   Below the belt attacks are never ok but if I was giving off standoffish vibes indicating I was not interested in someone and they told me they were going to show up at my house, I'd be furious because you are somewhat forcing me to aggressively state my peace that I do not want to speak with you or see you."
1078,estj,"‚ÄúWhen we get into a bad argument, we'll take that opportunity to get all of the stuff that we've been holding up out. It can be very destructive and we might be especially attuned to making it so without realizing it.‚Äù
Very well articulated and true. We don‚Äôt mean to come off so harshly; we feel we‚Äôre stating facts and can move forward once everything‚Äôs been aired out."
1079,estj,I agree with the above comment and would like to add that respecting boundaries is a big deal for me and a lot of ESTJs. We are very independent people who put a lot of emphasis on the concept of respect. 
1080,estj,"The only people I care about if they get hurt is my immediate family, aside from that my emotions don't sway along with my friends or strangers. I felt nothing when my friend got dumped, I feel nothing when hearing tragedies on news ..etc"
1081,estj,"I think this is probably fairly typical for the ESTJ. In socionics, both Feeling/Ethical functions are weak in the ESTJ, and I think a case can be made that empathy (as well as sympathy) primarily stems from these functions.
Interestingly, however, there seem to be slight differences between the two two kinds of ""empathy"", namely the type that stems from Fi as opposed to the type that stems from Fe.
Fe's brand of empathy is closer to what people often call ""sympathy"". It is a very direct and visceral ""mirroring"" of another person's experiences in the self. When you witness another person's suffering, you experience a sort of ""shadow"" of it yourself. A variant of the same phenomenon is when a person starts experiencing a visceral discomfort because the collective mood in the immediate surroundings is tense or sour. For the ESTJ, Fe is the role function and therefore rather weak. This suggests that while the average ESTJ can sense and respond to other's emotions in this way, it is going to require conscious effort and is likely to be rather draining. In socionics, Fe is also one of the ESTJs unvalued functions, so the average ESTJ might often not be inclined to bother, because the collective mood might seem like a pointless triviality to them. An exception is when a new acquintance is made, and it is typical that a strong conscious effort is made toward displaying aptitude in one's role function, which happens to be Fe for the ESTJ.
Fi's brand of empathy is more concerned with abstract phenomena like the human condition and suffering in and of itself. Fi empathy is closer to what the Dalai Lama talks about when he speaks about ""unconditional love"". It has a tendency to be directed toward whoever suffers the most, irrespective of how visible their suffering is. Because of this, it kind of has its own built-in sense of justice. Fi can empathize with a person or other creature they have never even met, simply by hearing about something horrible said person or animal was subjected to. Being Fi-dominant, I know from personal experience that this response can be every bit as strong and visceral in a Fi-dom as the Fe-dom's direct empathic response to seeing suffering.
Here's where it gets particularly interesting for the ESTJ, though: according to socionics, Fi is an extremely weak but extremely highly valued function for the ESTJ. This implies that the average ESTJ has virtually no intrinsic negative emotional response to seeing or hearing about injustice, but they value justice itself as a moral ideal as well as people who do demonstrate this emotional attenuation towards it, like the INFP, the ESTJs ""dual"" in socionics.
In summary, I would argue that your experience in this may be fairly typical for the ESTJ. What seems more important to me, though, is that, in the case of Fi-brand empathy, this is a deficit that the average ESTJ may be keenly aware of and not entirely comfortable with, which is supported by the fact that you asked this question to begin with. In short, while you may not feel like a very empathetic person, if you did not value empathy, this would probably not have bothered you enough to ask if it is normal. And I personally think valuing Fi is every bit as important, if not more so, than actually demonstrating aptitude in it, because the valuing of functions is what allows them to spread and flourish on a collective, cultural level."
1082,estj,"Some people were having a roadside memorial. I was irritated that they would put on such a distracting display at a busy intersection that literally just killed someone, increasing the chances of another accident. 
So yeah, I‚Äôm not good at empathizing with strangers. "
1083,estj,"I agree, I care mostly for people close to me like my family, friends, and SO. But people that I don't know don't necessarily get the same empathy, probably because bad things happen and I can't do anything about it. It's hard to project emotions towards something that isn't directly impacting me."

1085,estj,"I have pretty decent Fe and people skills in general, but they go straight out the window when I'm interacting with a) someone who doesn't show me courtesy or respect or b) someone who tries to push, needle, or control me. 
For what it's worth, I am female, and I do think society all but demands that women have developed Fe.  So, I think that plays a huge part of Fe development in female ESTJs."
1086,estj,"Maybe?
I mean, the line between task-orientation and people-orientation can be blurry on the extraverted side. To accomplish a bigger task you need a group of people. And to make this accomplishment as smooth as possible you need to ""care"" for these people.
Motivate them, get rid of their personal problems, help them emotionally, be nice to them, doing some group bonding, etc. I call it ""doing handjobs""."
1087,estj,"Being the 8th function, it's a function they don't care about but still can use, like it's present, but it's just there, unless the ESTJ cares about representation of course.
But consider me an ESTJ with zero Fe, I appear confident but have zero charm, I'm honest and forceful but with no tact, I'm tough and direct but can't soften up. The only thing I can Fe about is play around with my facial expression but even so my eyes don't change or suit my expressions. "
1088,estj,"Hey Reddit,
There is an ESTJ who keep asking me for advice. He is a foreign born and isn't confident in his English, and I helped with his grammar in an essay one time (b/c I felt bad for him). 
But now he keeps on asking me again and again for help, it's now going extreme -everything from essay writing to letter writing to interview advice to even social etiquette. It's way too overwhelming - I spent over 30 hours talking to him about all this! I should seriously be paid for helping this much. I can't reject him because technically we are ""friends"", but it really is too much. 
He isn't very considerate of my time commitments either. I even told him once I can speak to him BRIEFLY about something, but he still ended up discussing with me for 50 minutes. In the middle I kept reiterating ask me later, I can talk to you about this some more after I'm not so busy.  But he STILL didn't get the message, and kept on fixating on his details. 
What do I do? He just doesn't ""get the message"" and is what I would consider insensitive.  "
1089,estj,"I ask for a lot of advice when I'm not confident in something, as I want to make sure I'm doing it correctly.
Don't tell him you'll help out later if you can't help out later, tell him that you don't have time if you feel that you don't have time. We're a very direct bunch, and we don't like it when people give vague answers, so make sure you're explicit and clear in your intentions."
1090,estj,"I'm an ENFP writing a novel, and one of my main characters is an ESTJ. Because I am nearly the complete opposite of his personality type, I'm struggling to understand him and how he would act in certain situations. So, I was wondering if any of you could help me out.
Here's some backstory:

He is a prince, and his duty throughout the story is to get the princess to fall in love with him so that the kingdom will be protected.
The princess is an INFP, so they often butt heads.
Neither of them are actually attracted to each other at all.

Ok, so here are my questions:

Would he be able to tell that the princess is not in love with him, even if she accepted his affection and never said she wasn't?
If he's able to tell, what would he do about it?
If he attempted to change his personality to make her love him, how hard would that be for him to do?
How does he act around his friends?
How does he show affection?

I realize you're not all the same, but there are of course similarities amongst you all. I'm just trying to get some insight, because at the moment, I feel like his personality has been very inconsistent throughout the story.
Thanks."
1091,estj,"My mother is an ESTJ and I'm an ENFP... We argue a lot and I can't stand her personality. The structure and planning is sooo annoying and nevertheless bossing. I think she thinks I have no structure or goals, but I do. Any tips how to make her like me as a person and not just because I'm her daughter?"
1092,estj,"Serious answer, though:


Yeah, absolutely. Something would just seem...off with the relationship.


Nothing, really. It's his duty to protect the kingdom. Sure, the marriage wouldn't be happily ever after or anything and something would definitely be ""off,"" but the kingdom is safe, needs are being met, and that's what matters. There would probably be a discussion between the Prince and the Princess as to why this marriage needs to work for the sake of the kingdom.


Impossible. From personal experience, I've tried to change myself for people before and it doesn't/can't work. I'll never apologize for my fiery, passionate, sometimes explosive character ever again.


He always makes sure everyone's having a good time, tends to hide his own problems from his friends so that they always seem him ""doing well."" He has a few confidants, though.


Affection is displayed through actions and touch rather than words.


How'd I do, other ESTJs? Just tried to see things from the Prince's perspective if I were in his position."
1093,estj,"I'll try to throw my two pence in, but this is going to be brief as I'm using the mobile app ok enough said lets go


Yes


Nothing. He only wants to marry her and keep peace in two realms protecting their land, yes? Any ESTJ would make it clear beforehand that it's not for love it's just politics. If the princess tries something stupid though he'd make an attempt to talk her out of it in the name of the law and politics itself.


A. He wouldn't. We don't change ourselves try to make something happen. We do it our own way. B. And so if he's lost his mind and tries to do it it would be the most difficult thing on earth.


Straightforward, blunt, efficiency-oriented. We can stay out of touch with some of our friends for ages without being bothered and still consider them our friends.


That depends. I'm incredibly awkward in front of my significant other/ family members, and I don't do anything to show my affections, but I feel in my own skin dealing with work based relationships. Others might be different on that.

"
1094,estj,"It's a mediocre match, called ""extinguishment"" or contrary relations in socioncs. Most of attraction comes on the basis of 1) both being rational types i.e. dominant in a judging function, thus both appreciate order to some extent, and 2) being in same ST 'club' which increases the likelihood of having some interests in common. The actual good matches for ISTPs are ENFJ, INFJ, and ESFJ types, while for ESTJ it is INFP, ENFP, and ISFP: ISTP relationship types & ESTJ relationship types."
1095,estj,"Are they? This is the first I'm hearing about ISTPs being a match for ESTJs.
I don't necessarily mind them, but romantically it doesn't work for me.  I tried and after a month I didn't like it. 
The person I felt the strongest connection with was an INTJ.  Or I actually even like feelers.  
My dad is an ESTJ too and he married an INFP, going on 30 years.  "
1096,estj,"Hmm.  That's a strange list.  Any chance it has an explanation for why certain types are compatible and certain types aren't?
What's up with ENFX and INFX not being compatible with any sensors? 
I don't think that's the list I'm going to go to in terms of type compatibility."
1097,estj,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
1098,estj,"I do like small talk mainly because I like talking with everyone at a party or a workplace at least once and it's a good way to do that without talking about something ""deep"" and taking the risk of hearing something painfully stupid. "
1099,estj,"Small talk for me is mostly with co-workers (because it's socially expected) or if it's functional and/or beneficial for me in the future. I am generally not very interested in other people, so it does cost me more energy then I get out of it..."
1100,estj,"A bit of background: ESTJ girl here, studied psychology so I like people in general.
I love small talks though it drains me. I much prefer to-the-point conversations, but I still do it to keep the good vibe around my social circles, while quietly judge them lol. I also like to socialize and meet new people, which requires me to talk about the weather before I can ask questions about their deep darkest fears."

1105,estj,"ESTJ subtypes:
ESTJ-Te - The logical subtype seems impersonal, business-like, dry and correct in interaction. May look strict and unapproachable. Not inclined to make jokes, has a serious and constrained demeanor about him. Usually is not very talkative, but if his temper runs hot it's difficult to stop him. Direct and linear in behavior and conversation. Can be sharp and categorical in his judgments, due to which accumulates many problems of ethical nature. At another end of extreme, he may not say anything, but later build up grudges and hard feelings, and avoid interaction. Uncompromising and stubborn. - Full description
ESTJ-Si - The sensory subtype is characterized by stability and high capacity for work. Usually energetic, he cannot sit without some task or activity, and waste his time in vain. Interested in new technologies within his field of occupation or study, knows how to adapt them to his needs. Impulsive, perseverant, and pushy, knows how to passionately persuade his partner. Demanding and strict, but sometimes gives in to persuasions. Has a sense of humor. His speech is gusty and emotional. Often, one can see a predisposing although a bit strained smile on his face. - Full description"
1106,estj,"Sensory, for sure. I'm a little vain and love beautiful things, and my family laughs at the fact that for all my toughness and bluster, I will cry like a baby over corny things. I tend to act more like the logical type if I'm under pressure or worn down,  though. And I can hold on to a grudge like it's a winning lotto ticket. "
1107,estj,"My boss is a Logical ESTJ. He started his own company decades ago and he's a 1%er now. He collects antiques related to his line of business. He's very formal in attitude/appearance when he's in work mode, but inquisitive and surprisingly personable one-on-one, often with a playful sense of humor. Definitely a micromanager who insists on knowing and directing the minute details, which can be inefficient sometimes. He's the kind of guy who has an employee sit in his office, waiting half an hour when they could be doing other things in that time, while he grammar-nazis a document lol. He physically resembles a hawk or eagle, very intimidating at first glance. 
A guy I'm getting to know right now is Sensory ESTJ. This guy is an engineer, with a background in oil rigs. He looks like he enjoys sensory pleasures, he radiates warm energy whereas the Logical does not. His online profile had a list of requirements and disqualifiers (one of which is a woman who doesn't know or want to learn how to cook), certain sentences were in all caps. He wasn't afraid of saying something ""politically incorrect""; he's traditional. When texting me, he is brash, bold, impulsive, commanding, sympathetic, impassioned (ex. when talking about politics), articulate, not shy, honest/matter-of-fact, and witty. I love that he lists off more descriptive words than necessary to cover all the bases, bc I do the same (Ne). In a pinch, he can match me for vivid sensory descriptions, as if there's a bit of a writer in him. 
He's all about action, not talk. For example, I would say to the ESTJ: ""You're better-looking than me!"" and he would say: ""Bullshit. Send me a pic of you, right now"". I would say, ""No, and that should be answer enough."" And next thing I know, he's sent me a pic of himself saying ""Me, right now. No makeup. On the floor. Putting together a ceiling fan. Now do it."" (Despite my huge reservations, I eventually sent him a no-makeup photo too).      
They're both toweringly tall with deep voices. They're both pushy and demanding. They both work hard like crazy. 
After getting to know the Sensory ESTJ, I can't believe I ever thought ISTJ and ESTJ could be mistaken for each other. My ISTJ ex was like a silent immoveable mountain and let people come to him. The ESTJ approaches me like some kind of tornado and leaves me in a tizzy. ESTJ is the opposite of passive, as an INFP, interaction with him is intense, fast-moving, and totally takes over my space, where I have to really draw my boundaries and protest if need be. Also, compared to my ISTJ ex, the ESTJ isn't as generous with compliments. Where my ISTJ ex would say ""You're so gorgeous!"" this ESTJ will say of the same thing: ""Very nice."" There's a difference!"
1108,estj,"Sensory, for sure. That being said, I can become more like the logical subtype when under extreme pressure. I also wouldn't say I'm impulsive, I honestly think my tagline could be ""not impulsive"", but I agree with the rest.
All of that aside, the logical subtype sounds like a bit of a dickhead, I doubt many people will strongly identify with it."
1109,estj,"Probably logical. I can be somewhat in to talking, I am very high extroversion,. But the end thing is so accurate, I can then be really introverted too or threaten to talk to no one! I can work a lot too... and, I turn more sensory when I am more familiar with people. People are like she has a sense of humor? Hahahahaha!
And to the other poster, Yeah, I think a lot of time, I am seen as a bit of a jerk. Very much so. I have some friends but only a few close ones. I honestly I intimidate too many to really be close. I am not usually emotionall unless you get me to relate to situations at the end of the post. At that I am not too outwardly emotional either.
."
1110,estj,"I suppose you can say that about the logical. I can be a bit of a jerk in many people‚Äôs eyes. Not a very nice person or too serious and intimidating person.
It‚Äôs worse when you‚Äôre female! Heh! Trust me. Not very feminine myself, Probably rather masculine."
1111,estj,"Bad hygiene. Don‚Äôt understand how 24 old guys don‚Äôt realize they smell. 
Being so fucking incompetent that everyone else has to do more work because of you. 
Passive aggressiveness. I can easily tell when people are upset but won‚Äôt tell me why. And if I know what‚Äôs upsetting you because you‚Äôve told everyone but me. Then I will purposely keep doing it until you finally lose it and then laugh and tell you you should have fucking told me 3 weeks ago when you first got upset about it. 
People who make issues out of nothing. They just love being dramatic. "
1112,estj,"I saw a statistic on a personality test website that ESTJ was the #1 most common personality type in men, but no source. For reference, I'm female. (Extra fun fact: my boyfriend is ISFJ, which is apparently, according to the same website, the most common in females)."
1113,estj,"I recently saw some video that 11% of men are ESTJ and 6% of women are, but I don't know if that's really true.
Anyway, I'm an ESTJ female and one of my friends is too. Also, I married an ENFJ. Our marriage has definitely been a voyage of discovery! :D"
1114,estj,"My roommate is infj and she doesn't know any other infjs. Please introduce her to all the infjs! It would cheer her up after finding out Gandhi and Hitler were infjs while we were looking for MBTI memes yesterday.
I'm intj, btw. :)"
1115,estj,"Because INTJ is the ""supervisor"" type of ESTJ, while ESTJ is INTJ's ""supervisee"" according to socionics. Supervisor type is in a psychologically attractive and advantageous position to the supervisee, thus it is easiest for supervisor to seduce the supervisee. So for INTJs it is very easy to attract ESTJs: ESTJ relationships.  
Likewise it is easy for ESTJs to appear in favorable light before ISFJs, who are their supervisee type in turn."
1116,estj,"Australian here, but yeah. I would vote Bernie, he has the right ideas and he has been spot on about everything. He is the kind of person that you could trust in that position. Clinton
Trump is just a fool; he rejects climate change, thinks that vaccines might cause autism, is 'pro-life' and his ideas about China are probably true, but the way he plans to go about changing things just foolish. I don't think many of his supporters know what they are voting for, they want to make America Great Again, but what would trump really do to make the country great? Bring manufacturing jobs to America, even though they probably wont compete with the global market? Sounds more like he will aim to cripple other countries like Donald Rumsfeld and the like did by spreading the Asian Contagion through the east so that they could sweep in and buy off Asian companies real cheap. Doesn't matter which of the two psychopaths get in anyway, Clinton will probably do the same thing."
1117,estj,I am with you on this one. If he is an option I will go this way. It looks like he is not going to be though and I will have to take a serious look at Trumps policy plans. That is if he has any or gets around to mentioning them.

-Tells you that you can't always have everything your own way if you make one suggestion/recommendation. Expects you to follow his/her exact blueprint his/her own way. If you stray from it at all, you're being ""selfish"" and ""think your way is the only way.""
Is this typical ESTJ behavior or is something else going on here?"
1120,estj,"To answer if it is a typical ESTJ thing, I would say maybe.
The function stack is TE, SI, NE, FI.
To start with , their focus is not on being open to others ideas. It can be if they develop NE when growing older, but it is not their natural focus. TE and FI form an axis so unconsciously their main motivation is themselves and how they feel. Their main tool to achieve it is a function that is good at making their own way work. They grab information from the external world to make their own system work. They are not very interested in what goes on within you (or within other people feelings and thoughts). SI makes them a bit nostalgic sometimes (sometimes they idealize the past). SI-NE is the other axis and NE (intuition extroverted) is where you can get some curiosity from them. Mixed with SI, if they remember something positive about you, they will start listening more and being more open to you.
I guess ESTJ is not the easiest type to deal with sometimes. But each person is different and full of nuances."
1121,estj,"Thanks for explaining all that. I'm not sure I understand it all yet, but I'm still learning. I really want to get along with this ESTJ in my life, but I have never had the opportunity before to become close to someone with such a strong personality. We usually are fine. It's just once in a while‚Ä¶these ESTJ qualities come out."
1122,estj,"If they don't get over the argument and take time to think about what you called them on out after a few days, it is them who have a problem and they might never improve. So just protect yourself emotionally from them if you see that they can't deal like adult with being confronted.
Some people (ESTJs or not) will just put you out of their life if they see they can't have power over you or if they see that you will not stop trying to have some respect for yourself or even some self-respect.
That your person is a boss, partner, brother or sister, a trick to stay proud and to not get hurt by all their bullshit is to quit them before they flush you. If you wait that they flush you first, you will keep a feeling of injustice within you and you might repeat the pattern again. That feeling of injustice can start a bad spiral down of letting people take advantage of you.
For most people with a big character though, they will see that they should maybe take in consideration your thoughts, your needs, your person only when you leave. At that moment it's to you to decide if you want to trust them and give another chance or if you don't want to try again."
1123,estj,"I don't know exactly how to convey how to establish boundaries, but I will use an example to try to give you an idea of what a friend explained to me recently.
There is a guy friend I felt was disrespecting me and the guy I see because he kissed me and wanted sex when I hung out with him last weekend. It is clear that his behavior comes from a mix of ignorance, jealousy and misunderstanding of women and sexuality and a complete lack of understanding of my perception of things. My first reflex is to try to educate him on all of this, but he has a big personality and he would not listen anyway and would twist things as he is the victim because he feels rejected. And nice me would feel some compassion,etc... you know, the classic nice guy who plays with the limits of consent/non consent. It would be useless to explain him, but I want to convey the message to him.
I spoke of this to my other friend and he explained me that, with this kind of people, it is all about establishing boundaries. What I could have say is: '' it would be fun if we could watch sports and dance on the music without kissing, touching or having sex``. If that makes the vibe cold and uncomfortable, it is his problem, I don't have to feel bad for that.
With strong personalities (sometimes/often ESTJs), sometimes establishing boundaries is the best way to go. Explaining is for later, once they have developed a curiosity to why you impose these boundaries. They might never get curious about it though. It has to come from them and it may never come from them to try to understand, so just establish your boundaries with whoever that person is in your life.
If you are two guys (two brothers by example) sometimes the only solution is unfortunately to punch him once if he pushes too far in disrespecting you and your needs to be listened to and taken what you say in consideration.
If he/she doesn't respect your boundaries. I'd suggest to start by telling him/her that he doesn't respect you and if it changes nothing, just leave and never look back, they won't try to improve."

1125,estj,"I need a few ideas on things ESTJs like to receive as gifts. I have read they like to receive things they can actually use in their daily life. A little about my ESTJ:
The ESTJ I am gifting for is in his 50s, works in IT, (very long hours) also in the military, and loves football.  His home already looks so well-organized and neat. His vehicles as well. I considered a watch but I know he owns more than 10 of those. Maybe a custom one? I feel like I'm shopping for someone that has everything he needs.
Any ideas for useful gifts would be great! 
Thank you!
- Grateful ISFJ"
1126,estj,"Keep it as practical as possible.  Something they need, something they may have specifically asked for.  
When I tell people I want socks, get me socks.  Don't try and surprise me by buying me something fun because you think me asking for socks is lame.
You are right about ESTJs wanting something they can use in their daily life.  
If you're truly stumped, consider making them food, like cookies or something, or buy them their favorite brand/bottle of alcohol.  Find out a favorite of theirs.  If they are anything like me, they probably have favorites, something they love eating.  If they buy coffee, they probably get the same drink every time, if they drink alcohol they probably drink the same thing.  
I am addicted to Redbulls, those who know me well know it's my favorite treat.  I had a friend who got me a four pack for my birthday, and that was one of my favorite gifts because it showed me he was paying attention to my interests.  
Don't try and impress them either, it won't work."
1127,estj,"Would this type like a sonicare toothbrush? Bc I started using one and I swear by them. Useful and practical.
This is prob more if their love language is not gifts though. And add something more fun too to balance it out."
1128,estj,"Thanks for your ideas! He's so private so I don't know his favorites of much. I do know he doesn't drink alcohol nor likes any sweets. I may just get him something of his favorite football team. I was kind of hoping to switch it up this time, but it's rather difficult. sigh"
1129,estj,"I‚Äôm an INTP that is married to an ESTJ.  Every year she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want anything for Christmas/birthday because she loves all the gifts I give her year round.  So I‚Äôve learned that there is no, once a year, silver bullet, gift that will work.  You have to pepper them year round with little thoughtful gifts to be successful.  And that‚Äôs what I do.  Whenever I see something I think she‚Äôll like, I give it to her. Five dollars here, $3.50 there, and sometimes, like last night, I surprised her with her favorite takeout for dinner.  "
1130,estj,"Cash (but not socially acceptable) :)
Next best thing something that you can use (= you would spend cash on t anyway, so getting it as a gift equals to you getting that cash indirectly by not spending it on buying that thing yourself).
Bottle of alcohol is safe bet if you don't have more insight of what he would need."
1131,estj,"This might explain how the best date I ever went on was the one where I went to an arcade.  I'd never done something like that before.  He was an ENTJ as well so the whole night was us being competitive and flirty.  We ended the night sharing a meat lovers pizza and beers.  I've been on a lot of other dates, but not a single person has matched up to him. 
OP this might be something to consider. 
My mom is an INFP and my dad is an ESTJ and one year on their anniversary, 30th if I'm correct, they went up to Duluth and my mom took him to all the historical sites.  My dad LOVES that stuff.  Even a year later he still goes on about how cool that trip was and all the stuff he learned.
My dad is also big into Tractors and my mom has taken him on trips to different tractor shows."
1132,estj,"He and I have been acquaintances for 4 years. Over the last year, we began to casually date and things are going well. He's quite private so it's hard to get him to open up to his likes and dislikes. In the past, I remember him saying in passing how he's not lacking anything and has everything he needs. Over the years I've known him, he has given me Christmas and birthday gifts every year. He goes all out. Even includes things for each one of my dogs. I've given him gifts as well but I really wanted to do something special this time that I know he'd appreciate."
1133,estj,"I barely even write anymore. I generally just move the pen in a general up and down motion after the first letter of a word. 
I‚Äôm so stuck on typing or TTS that using a pen feels like a serious burden. "
1134,estj,"It's true, I don't hand-write many things, but when I do, it seems to be a toss up. Sometimes it's neat, sometimes it okay. It has never been god-awful, however. As for typing, I use the Dvorak keyboard layout so I can type faster and therefore be more efficient. "
1135,estj,"His dad and him don't talk because his dad is controlling and has some emotional issues.  He's done some things that I don't think you can take back.  Anyway, he's my stepson and he's in a rut.  He plays League Of Legends all day and has kind of stopped growing/taking care of himself for about 18 months now.  Him and I get along with respect however I haven't been able to retain a strong communication line with him as he's continued down this path.  I think that I can help him, so I would love some advice!"
1136,estj,"Is he an ESTJ, or are you? Anyway, it'll take time for him to grow socially. He may not want to, but try to get him to go on a quick hike on a trail somewhere, even overnight backpacking if possible. Spending time outdoors with someone trustworthy is one of the best treatments for depression, and the natural sunlight (especially blue light) will aid in serotonin buildup."
1137,estj,"This is a weird idea maybe but I'd get him a dog...a cool dog...that he can hang out with...then I'd take walks with him and the dog.
Walks are very underrated as mental healing tool--walking and talking is the best thing ever...
So happy you are thinking about him and want to help. Kudos to you!"
1138,estj,"
The INFP would be too worried about how I'm feeling, as a result, I wouldn't date one, because who knows? They could just be saying something to me to make me feel better, which as a result, actually doesn't. I need the blunt truth, not 'you're a great person BS'. I don't know how to describe it, but some INFPs are very airy fairy-but my best friend is an INFP and we get along quite well. INFPs and ESTJs for friendships, but not relationships
I'd say ISTJ, I want someone who is down to earth and stable, that will call me out when I'm being erratic etc.
"
1139,estj,"Female ESTJ dating a female INFP. We've been together for 12 going on 13 years. It's surprising, even though we are like polar opposites, we rarely fight.
The things I'm not so good at, she's great at and vice-versa. I feel like we compliment each other. She has tons of ideas and I have the drive to make them come to life. I keep things super organized, while she does the cooking. I tend to do all the maintaining. 
I have a tendency to get into those ""gotta do all the things"" moods and have a habit of forgetting about taking care of myself in the process. She helps me with that. 
Her support allows me to continue to push myself further and further while keeping me grounded at the same time. And I feel like I provide the support to get her to push herself into elements where she would normally feel uncomfortable. "
1140,estj,"I know a bunch of infp people. I don‚Äôt know if I want to date them for various reasons. I am not sure how long our relationship will last and how much push they can take. I have an older INFP guy telling me he wouldn‚Äôt mind dating me but meh, I don‚Äôt really know. Just not my type of person to date. Be friends with fine. I don‚Äôt know exactly but istj wouldn‚Äôt be bad another ESTJ would probably be fine. Maybe esfp but depends on who. Maybe entj?"
1141,estj,"I‚Äôm an ESTJ and definitely would have dated a INFP when I was in my teens. Two of my closest friends were INFP‚Äôs. But as I‚Äôve grown up and lived a little, I wouldn‚Äôt consider dating that personality type. After dating my current boyfriend who is an INTJ, I‚Äôd be focusing more on finding someone who isn‚Äôt intuitive (makes me feel like I have to control the situation as he doesn‚Äôt rely on fact) and I‚Äôd prefer someone whose also an extrovert. I think most ESTJ‚Äôs want to utilise life to its full potential, and don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòslowed down‚Äô by someone who thinks in a completely different way. I think INFP‚Äôs make great and interesting friends though."
1142,estj,"There's like I can't stand more than ""you're a great person"". I've gotten this so many times from girls I've wanted to date I can't even count them all. It drives me up a wall, across the ceiling, and back down the other side at this point when those words start coming out of someone's mouth. 
Just give it to me straight. What do I do well? What don't I do well? What can I improve? 
I'd rather you just tell me you don't want to date or your real reason why. So much easier that way.
Sorry. Rant over. "
1143,estj,"You got this wrong.  ISTJs will never rock the boat.  They are the most restrained type imaginable, won't complain, will hardly ever even let you know what their needs and wants are.
Generally completely undemonstrative of their emotional states and feelings/needs.
However, you've got to give them credit because they REALLY CARE.  Sometimes their bluntness comes across in that they don't know how to present things vis-a-vis a group.  ""I am here to do my job"" comes out when HR wants to hear, ""Oh, this is such a perfect fit with my career goals (which I elucidate as pure bullshit because I know the corporate handshakes).""  ISTJ won't grok that the real purpose of the meeting is always to give the correct handjobs.
HOWEVER, they aren't going to tell you what they need in a lot of cases.  In a lot of cases, they probably don't even know.  These people can be out of touch with their needs, and mostly withdraw into total noncommunication if stressed.
INFPs, especially if the stakes are high, or they feel pressure, will speak too bluntly -- ""Here are my standards, what I want and like.  Put yours on the table so I know what action to take.""
Otherwise, it's going to come down more to emotional logic, which is Ennagram, not MBTI (how things are perceived and experienced) -- what drives their choices?  An enneagram 4,6, or 8 who is an INFP is going to be talking straight all the time.  The 6 probably doesn't even know how to make small talk or say something unimportant.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU-MsNLe3ms
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5fB8XO2S9s
Those are both unhealthy states, but which one is communicating more about what they need and want?"
1144,estj,"ENFP here. When I say that you're a great person, I'm not being fake. I'm just feeling really loving towards you and wanted to express that. Also, I don't think in specifics, so I'm less likely to say specific things.
That said, I'm not the usual ENFP, I guess, because the last person I was with, I distinctly remember telling him specific things I liked about him. "
1145,estj,"Interesting to hear that your INTJ doesn't rely on fact, since I feel like INTJs are pretty factual, even though they might have their heads in the clouds sometimes. As an ENFP, one of my best friends was an ESTJ but if would have probably butted heads if we tried a deeper relationship because he's pretty bossy and not very emotional."
1146,estj,"I agree. People try to soften the blow, but it doesn‚Äôt work, it makes it worse. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably because-from personal experience-they just don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll get along (in terms of being in a relationship) for whatever reason. "
1147,estj,"Everything 
Erratic in terms of being slightly too spontaneous, nothing major, but it will be something like: let‚Äôs go on a 20km hike tomorrow and we haven‚Äôt planned for it OR suddenly decided I want to work as a barista (not going to happen, but you get the idea)"
1148,estj,"Hmm, maybe I typed wrong. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs implied or once you know them, you can tell when they‚Äôre uncomfortable. But if you ask, I‚Äôm pretty sure they will give you an honest answer, no? I could be wrong. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to say ISTJ ‚Äòwill never‚Äô, because some still may-there are always variations within types.
That‚Äôs me as well, my emotions are basically content (my constant state), happy, angry, guilty and disappointed. I feel like that‚Äôs me as well, if I don‚Äôt know what I need, do I need anything? 
I agree with the INFP thing tho, they will become blunt if there‚Äôs a difficult situation calls for it. Which, I rarely do, because I hate conflict and I get scared lmao. "
1149,estj,"Even more interesting is when you combine all this with Enneagram.
An 8 will HAPPILY suck all the oxygen out of the room in order to ""take the hill"" in front of them.  His speech is quite direct.  (As is a stressed out 2, who is normally concerned about everyonee's comfort)
A 6 will take responsibility for everything and everyone, and generally be very direct in speech.  (As is a stressed out 3, who is often too concerned about never appearing bad to ever say anything honest)
A 4 will despise inauthenticity and speak very clearly and directly about what's on his mind.
All this in interaction with MBTI type.  MBTI tells you which perceptual filters someone uses, basically.
Enneagram is about emotional drives.
And you are right -- I shouldn't say ISTJ ""will never"" do anything in particular....
It's just that they are extremely, consistently, restrained.  In that respect they seem delicate to me.  There is a certain delicate vulnerability to John Wayne's restrained characters like ""The Quiet Man"" is there not?
Meanwhile you could easily write an INFP Klingon (War-like Alien Race from the sci-fi series ""Star Trek""), concerned about his and his Family's honor, determined to do right by the values he cares about, willing to kill and die for the songs that will be written of his exploits in service of the beautiful values he serves."
1150,estj,"I‚Äôm slightly confused, but uhhhh‚Ä¶ I think aimlessly walking around town sounds fine‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with that? Trade show? I don‚Äôt know what that is, but it doesn‚Äôt sound interesting
I don‚Äôt collect anything
Um, ok? I‚Äôm not a guy, but ok"
1151,estj,"Sorry for the late reply
I just took the Similar Minds Enneagram test, so you could possibly understand me better-you know, get an idea of what kind of person I am. I scored equally for 1 and 6, idk how you‚Äôd write that, but apparently that means I‚Äôm a 6.
I thought that would be more ISFJ than ISTJ, in the ‚Äòdelicate‚Äô sense-I could be wrong"
1152,estj,"I am going to butt in with my super late reply. I am an Infp 6w7 and I am brutally honest and straight forward. I had to really work on this because I hurt many people's feelings. People assuming all INFPs are meek and don't want to hurt feelings is BS. 
The only person I know that's equally as honest is my dad who is an Entj but even he says damn son to some of my replies to people.
I had an Estj boss and he drove me crazy with never being upfront with his employees and beating around the bush when their were problem people that needed dealing with. So there is that. "
1153,estj,"Dominant Te (EXTJ): Here is the plan, and the steps needed to accomplish it. I can learn anything complicated. This is your responsibility, and I expect a status report. I measure success by objective means (best-seller lists, stock reports, etc). I have a second plan if the first one fails. Anything can be organized for greater results. This isn‚Äôt working right; let me fix it. Here is how you can accomplish your goals. Controlling one‚Äôs emotions is important. It takes an hour and ten minutes to get there, with 30 minutes allotment for a traffic jam. We can comfortably do this in two weeks, yes. These are the facts, and if something doesn‚Äôt measure the facts, I intend to challenge it.
Auxiliary Si (ESXJ): The last time I tackled this project, using this technique worked, so I feel confident in my ability to succeed using the same technique. This restaurant is laid out different than it was the last time I was here; those tables were on the patio, and they had red curtains, not green. I‚Äôm happy to provide you with the details of why I am making this decision. I recognize this street, so I know where to turn! This holiday is meaningful to me, because it allows me to connect to my family or my culture. I‚Äôm disappointed if we can‚Äôt celebrate it together every year. If we‚Äôre going to do this project, let‚Äôs do research to see how others have done it before we start. I like to reflect on my own past experiences when making decisions in the present, and believe I can learn from others‚Äô mistakes.
Tertiary Ne (ESXJ): Oh, that new idea is interesting! I‚Äôd like to talk about it with you! But I need to be somewhere in twenty minutes, so let‚Äôs keep it on track as much as we can. It feels like you are not tied to reality with this idea; can we pull it back to something tangible? I think I have several ideas as to what really happened back there. This discovery may help me discover my greater purpose in life. I suspected this was going to happen‚Ä¶
Inferior Fi (EXTJ): My beliefs are very strong, but I spend little time thinking about them. Many of them are tied to my feelings, and I‚Äôm not comfortable dwelling on my emotions. It‚Äôs easier to adopt a simple, straightforward moral code and stick to it without deviation. I don‚Äôt see the point in determining which causes are more important than others. I have a tendency to think that my values are right for others. I really want to do something greater than myself, and am fiercely loyal to what I believe in but I would rather donate time, energy, and money than emotional support. It‚Äôs hard for me to be loyal to people whose decisions I profoundly disagree with. I need to respect you before I can emotionally support you in those times. Slowly, I am learning to be more tolerant and not see the world as black and white.

1154,estj,"Same question as asked towards r/ISTJ. The ISTJs seem to tend towards being agnostic, just wondering how ESTJs might see this.
I am quite adamantly atheistic, I think it is far more likely that religion is an associated feeling or a state of mind, moreso than a reality. I think there is enough evidence against the existence of gods to dismiss it entirely. Asking people to have faith appears to me more like asking people to forget reason and rationality, it is crooked in my eyes."
1155,estj,"I think that, true or not, the benefits of religion to humanity are greater than the drawbacks and it is worth keeping around. The objectionable parts are also worth reforming.
Edit: Rereading the question, it seems you want to know our own practice, not just our opinions about religion in general. I believe in God and am a member of the LDS church."
1156,estj,"Christian. For me it's important because it teaches people how to behave to grow spiritually and improve their lives, it also ties the community together and at the very least helps promote the family unit. If you want to look at it in a rational way, atheists and agnostics make the fewest kids in all groups, usually support state tyranny (lefties), offer no values to help the community or combat things like the ""terrorists"" and their ""peaceful ideology""."

1158,estj,"I‚Äôm curious on knowing how ESTJs are in relationships. It would be great if some of you mention in the comments the following:
1) What do you see in an ideal partner
2) The main reason your past relationships didn‚Äôt work out"
1159,estj,"What I look for in a partner: sense of humor, good at stuff (hobbies, sports, etc), independent (not clingy), active (not sedentary). I like to laugh, I don‚Äôt want to be your mom, and I need someone who can match my athleticism. I‚Äôm bi and these things go fo men and women. 
Past relationships: my only serious relationship is the one I‚Äôm currently in; I‚Äôve been happily dating someone for 3 years. A problem that I‚Äôve encountered before this relationship and during is that I expect a lot from people, sometimes impossibly so, without realizing it. Just because I can or would do something doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs feasible for someone else, and I struggle with that sometimes. I also have a low tolerance for fucking up and am generally competitive, which can make me seem like a bitch to people I don‚Äôt know very well. "
1160,estj,"I‚Äôm 26 and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship
I‚Äôm female too. 
For a really long time I just didn‚Äôt feel good enough. And honestly I still feel that way. But I get extremely uncomfortable when other people take care of me so I really want to be successful enough before getting into a serious relationship and I also want a partner who sees me as an equal. Nothing more nothing less. 
I also am very confident and straightforward. Which does rub some the wrong way. 
Honestly it‚Äôs really hard. I would love a partner now but all the guys I talk to just want me as a friend. 
When I get rejected and feel alone I put all of my energy into my success. Going to school and being the top student, honor student involved in multiple clubs. being an athlete that competes and working my way up the corporate ladder currently. 
I suck at relationships but I‚Äôm good at everything else I do. 
I guess my ideal partner is someone who is chill. I don‚Äôt want to be with someone who is more extroverted than I am. I really like inxps. 
Someone who is honest with me. Can say the truth even when it hurts. Someone who knows who they are and makes no apologies for it. Someone who is a hard worker and wants to be successful. Has that drive. 
Someone who is fit and understands the importance of health. I compete in triathlons and would love a partner who also competed in something athletically. Or at least was active. I like tall slim guys or muscular but not too muscular. I hate muscly guys. 
And someone who doesn‚Äôt wanna live in a small town for the rest of their lives. Because that‚Äôs how I grew up and refuse to be like that. I wanna travel and move and explore this world. "
1161,estj,"Someone who is competent. They are well educated, and are able to hold a good conversation, and bring up intriguing points. Someone who isn't overly sensitive, that shit doesn't fly with us. 
As for past relationships, they're usually just too sensitive for my liking/attitude, or they are just not high achievers, which is fine, but as a high achiever myself, it's hard to want to be with someone who doesn't want to do better in life."
1162,estj,"I‚Äôm glad that you get where I‚Äôm coming from, lmao. I think I was half-expecting someone to rant on me about how girls shouldn‚Äôt have to wear makeup and bla bla bla. Ultimately, that wasn‚Äôt why we broke up, but like I said, attraction makes a difference, and it‚Äôs illogical to bring up the fact that we haven‚Äôt had sex for a while, while taking it personally that she doesn‚Äôt want to get dolled up for me. As a guy. I like to think I have a really good fashion-sense. My outfits always match. I cut/color my own hair. I‚Äôm not opposed to wearing a small amount of eyeliner and stuff (I have kind of a Billie-Joe Armstrong look). And I enjoy doing it. Fashion is fun. And to have my girlfriend just dressing kind of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. And yeh, the feminine thing makes sense. I love girls that wear dresses, have gorgeous hair, and take care of themselves. 
Thanks for the input ^^"
1163,estj,"All the other comments are straight up novels so I‚Äôm gonna keep it short and sweet haha. Btw I‚Äôm a straight girl.


Look for someone who is independent, intelligent, funny, and fun. Spontaneous is a plus bc ESTJs like myself struggle doing anything that wasn‚Äôt previously planned haha. Good to get out of the comfort zone sometimes. I also don‚Äôt like guys that are emotional bc I‚Äôm not haha. Ideally i want a guy that will sit there and listen when I finally do open up, but I don‚Äôt want someone who wants to dwell on it or pick my brain about it. I said it, it‚Äôs done, let it go.


Last long relationship ended bc my boyfriend was an egotistical asshole who was emotional and unstable. We also had like hardly anything in common. I also don‚Äôt think he was super intelligent, and when you think your SO is inferior brain-wise it‚Äôs hard to respect them unless you‚Äôre Mother Theresa or something. He cried when he was stressed and that made me uncomfortable bc I‚Äôm terrible at comforting people/empathizing with their pain haha.


Sry that ended up longer than expected hahah."
1164,estj,"
Someone who can lead. Good sense of humor. Mature but can loosen up at times. Somewhat bright, clever. Open minded, chill. Good at communicating, open, loyal, good at taking criticism and learning from it. Someone who loves and respects me the way I am.
INTJ - Nope did not work out. Worked out initially but never realized how very emotional they are about their core beliefs. We have the same hobbies but he would take my advice as some direct form of criticism and think I am cold and unfeeling when I clearly see it as a way to help him improve. INTjs can get very clingy about these core beliefs which they will fight over endlessly unless proven otherwise, and they usually take full offense to anything opposing it. I find INTJs to be somewhat sensitive about certain things such as what their SOs think of them personally even though I'm being honest they will try and steamroll me about the flaws I tell them I can observe. It can work out, but if there are clear guidelines between each other instead of the other person interpreting the other wrongly. I always attract INTJs for some reason like flies to a yellow light and I really do not know why.

ISTJ- Worked out definitely. We tend to have the same exact mindset except I'm a bit more aggressive to opportunities than he is. I generally get along with ISTJs pretty well, but i find most of them close minded, passive, and shy which turns me off. The one ISTJ in particular I went in a relationship with was very bright and open minded about a lot of things, but it didn't work out because my parents didn't approve and it was highschool and I wanted to graduate first before getting into a relationship. We both understood each other though very well. 
ENTP- I really wish it could work out. I love ENTPs and they meet my ideals. It's just that they seem to lose interest in me after a while and find someone else who will provide more feed to their banter which I can't always do which is disappointing. Also it seems like we have some kind of ""wall"" between each other when we communicate. He is somewhat in his own world while I am in mine, and he can get quite emotional about things and lose control of it quite easily. They are very cute though, I hope one day I can marry an ENTP and we can get along."
1165,estj,"Ideal? Super fair skin with raven black, or pastel hair. Fit/petite. Highly intelligent. Her jokes are as good as mine (and she can appreciate my humor/pithy puns, haha). She likes to cook, has lots of tattoos, and is good at art. She loves talking about philosophy. Doesn‚Äôt take things too personally, if I suggest she try something different. If we have kids, she‚Äôs a really, really good mom. She‚Äôs super hard working, but also knows how to have fun.
Past relationships? I‚Äôve dated a lot of INFP‚Äôs that were way too sensitive, and couldn‚Äôt handle criticism. They got super reactive during conflict and was hard to reason with them. The ENFJ I dated refused to wear makeup (NOT that that‚Äôs a big deal), but attraction is important, and she resented me for wishing she would make an effort, in general. The INFP‚Äôs were really insecure, and people like that tend to come with a shit load of problems... one was extremely jealous. Yeah... that‚Äôs about it. "
1166,estj,"I think it‚Äôs perfectly reasonable to dislike the makeup part. 
As a female I cannot stand guys who have no sense of fashion. Which apparently is a very large amount of men. I lived in Texas and California and I miss those guys so much because they knew how to dress and take care of themselves. Here in the Midwest, not so much. Even my brothers are pretty bad. The grunge look was cool in the 90s but I‚Äôm over guys looking like homeless trash. 
Looking put together is attractive to some people. So putting on makeup probably makes a girl look more feminine which is probably what you like. 
People can disagree but we all have our attractions. I mean I have friends who refuse to date guys who don‚Äôt have beards. I have friends who don‚Äôt like shorter guys. Everyone has a picky preference and those who don‚Äôt are liars. 
I just think asking someone to make an effort is pointless. Especially something like makeup. That has to be a decision made outside of the relationship. It has to be personal. I talked to a guy for about a month and his hygiene is why I ended it. I could have told him he needs to dress like the 25 year old man that he is and not like a 12 year old but I‚Äôm not his mom and I want it to be something he does for himself not for me. "
1167,estj,"My mother is an ESTJ and guilty of this. She would occasionally exploit my talents when family came over so she could show me off for entertainment. 
Then when I call her out on it she pleads for me to comply..
‚ÄúHoney, show everyone your amazing piano skills. Do it. Ok now stop. Play this  ___ song now.‚Äù
Does this behavior look familiar? I was curious what her motivations for this might be and if she realizes how disrespectful it is "
1168,estj,"I'm going to preface this by saying that this is common for parents of many types, not just ESTJs. My ENxP parent frequently did this to me, whereas my ESFJ parent was pretty chill on that front.
I quite enjoy having external approval and appreciation of my skills. Perhaps she thinks that you need that external approval as well, and therefore she's giving you an opportunity to show off. I usually enjoyed when my ENxP parent ""showed me off"". I don't think she's doing it out of malicious intent, she's likely doing it because it's the same thing she'd want to be done for her. 
If you really dislike it, I'd recommend just telling her. Us ESTJs prefer it when people are direct about issues they have with us instead of holding it in like you are. If you bring it up with her in a respectful manner and tell her that you appreciate her efforts, but this isn't what you want, she'd likely stop (of course, I don't know her, she might be very stubborn). Of course, you have to figure out whether or not that's her motivation in the first place anyway."
1169,estj,"My brother is an ESTJ and he is also a bit like this, he likes assigning roles to people, so he can be in control. With the family we are usually just laughing how he controls the friends like this (telling people where to sit down, to say hi to the sister, basically everything but a lot of these are just for his own entertainment). But he is an amazing and intelligent person anyway so usually we don't mind, especially when we don't take him seriously. Probably when he is going to have a child it is gonna be the same and then it is gonna cause problems or fights "
1170,estj,"Well, culturally speaking, it's just an asian immigrant thing.  My parents and their friends used to do this crap and I hated it.  I highly doubt that they were all ESTJs.  The worst part is how this would make the other parents in the room jealous.  ""Why can't YOU play violin as good as Nelson???  We sacrificed EVERYTHING (not really) and sent you to lessons (that I didn't want), and you shame us!""  Theme of my childhood.  Same thing can be said about piano, tennis, SAT scores, the college I went to, not being class president at school... etc.."
1171,estj,"Because ESTJ, while a valid MBTI type, are developmentally stunted.  They see everything in the world through their Te and Si.  If your kid isn't just like you, torture them.  It's ""logical"" as fuck.  They hate their own third fuction, Ne, and their 4th and inferior function Fi is a constant catalyst of self loathing.  If your ESTJ parent treats you at all like a valid human being, then you are very lucky."
1172,estj,She's probably proud of you and thinks if she doesn't push you you won't show the world your talents. If you tell her you don't like it then that's understandable. Im an INFP and I wish I had an ESTJ to do this for me.
1173,estj,"Te dominants make the worst parents from my personal experience . 
They treat children in a mechanical way that ruins the childs personal development so badly and creates mental blocks for the child while growing up at a sensitive age . "
1174,estj,"Honestly most of them embrace and love their Ne from my experience. I have trouble with them a lot but I‚Äôve noticed my Ni fueled humor lights them up with happiness and understanding, as I‚Äôm catalyzing their Ne.
I wouldn‚Äôt disagree with you about the 4th function, but I‚Äôve also met many ESTJs that do treat others very well. It‚Äôs almost like a you‚Äôre on their side or against them sort of mentality they carry. "
1175,estj,"I have to agree with you.  As long as it fits in with their distorted Te and Si.  When me and my own ESTJ parental unit are channeling Ne,and he isn't being all judgemental, it is magic.  Sorry for being Debbie Downer tonight."
1176,estj,"Being directed to do something doesn't make you a doormat though. Allowing multiple people to walk all over you while you say silent does. If this is such a big deal and you feel like an animal for some reason, then just say no. Even if she pleads."
1177,estj,"Do they:
A) really just want someone to say Yes and do it without question?
B) want a back and forth discussion until ESTJ convinces other party to do x?
C) want someone to stand up to them and actually do their own thing as long as they have their own reasons?
D) think they're just being playfully bossy?
As the ESTJ gets into a more intimate and involved relationship (ex. cohabitation, marriage), do their expectations of how someone should respond to their orders change?"
1178,estj,"Mostly A., but I'll accept C. if there's solid logic behind it or something I hadn't considered. 
Occasionally D., if you're close friends/family. 
Option B sounds like some NF madness. No thank you. "
1179,estj,"What I want is for the person to see how all of the things are fitting together and playing out in my head so that they understand and can fill in the things I‚Äôve missed or be able to point out potential problems without me having to take the time to explain everything. 
Because that‚Äôs not always possible, I usually try to explain the why of a thing as succinctly as I can so that they can go do A because they get it, B because they can help implement a better process or C because they understand the pitfalls I‚Äôm already trying to avoid and can do it however it works best for them as long as the outcome is the same. I don‚Äôt respect someone for fighting with me just to bash egos. I do respect someone speaking up if they see a better way. As long as that ‚Äòbetter way‚Äô isn‚Äôt about my delivery because damnit, I‚Äôm trying! I have the most respect for people who can see through my abruptness and don‚Äôt hold it against me. "
1180,estj,"I don't like A, it often means they don't know why they're doing it, which means they'll probably be worse at it. I want them to get the thought process. 
B is usually good. Feels satisfying, the other person gets why I'm doing it, no worries. I'll get frustrated under desperate time constraints, however.
C is dodgy as shit, but I'd rather they do their own thing if what I'm suggesting is incorrect. However, I'd rather they convince me of that first, if it's objectively right, I don't see why they couldn't convince me. If I'm literally incapable of understanding something, however, such as if I'm in a field totally out of my expertise, C is fine (I'll probably be pissed off until they prove me wrong though, lol).
I've become more D as of late, but if it's a serious situation that actually matters, I try to avoid D (unless they're complying, in which case it's a morale booster). I like having silly arguments, but I draw the line eventually.
Note that I'm not always bossing people around, this just applies to when I am bossing people around. Okay, I'm bossing people around a lot, but it's mostly all in good fun, lol."
1181,estj,"C. I actually love when people stand up to me.  My ESTJ dad was always the same way, and I think the reason we always were close was that I was one of the only kids who didn't blindly follow every order I was given.  
People who are able to stand up and speak their mind are my favorite kinds of people. It tells me you can probably handle yourself, and I won't have to worry about you.
I don't have a lot of people in my life that I command to do anything.  I usually say what needs to be done, and almost always just do it myself.  I guess for jobs where I was a supervisor, I expected people to know what to do.  I am very clear about what needs to be done and what your job entails so I shouldn't have to remind you every damn day.  If I do make an order, I would expect you to do it.
But in everyday life with friends and other people, I don't make a ton of orders, unless it's an idea about something.  "
1182,estj,"Usually a and C. C if it‚Äôs good can gain my respect. It has to be good and legitimate. It requires of proof. B sounds very ENTP. Hahaha! If there‚Äôs a good reason, maybe a little, but eventually, I will have to say get to it. I hope it‚Äôs in the spirit of C though."
1183,estj,"Read your post before you edited it.
ESTJ woman here dating INFJ man. The thing about dating F types is that you have to be much gentler with how you say things. Doesn‚Äôt sound like that‚Äôs his thing though. Not sure there‚Äôs anything I can say to help fix that if he‚Äôs not self aware enough to realize that on his own."
1184,estj,"Hello! I'm just curious about your thoughts on INFP's. What are some traits you like? Dislike? Would you date them? Etc. Please be detailed. 
Also, how do I know if ESTJ's are interested in me? And disinterested in me?
Thank you. "
1185,estj,"Reminds me of a time where my need for harmony was tested. I had a good friend who I was teaching how to drive, and she was seriously awful. Just because of how high the stakes were, I really needed to drive home the fact that she was a threat behind the wheel. She didn't believe me at all. At one point I got a bit abusive and told her repeatedly that she would kill us both at some point lol She finally learned though, a car accident later."
1186,estj,"Most people can't help being whatever they are. But not everyone is right for everyone else. Some people don't need their partners to be social and are very happy to either spend a lot of time just the two of them being homebodies together, or the extrovert getting their social time with friends but being happy to not have their partner join in often. Those people would be a good match for socially awkward introverts. 
However for other people it is really important for them for their partner to share their love of socialising and join them in that. I am an extrovert who thought that I could be happy dating an introvert. My ex wasn't socially awkward at all but just didn't want to socialise much. At first I thought this was fine because ""he doesn't need to tick every box. I'll just socialise with friends"" but the longer I was with him the more I was unhappy with it. I hated him saying no so often when I wanted to do stuff, or needing a ton of notice to mentally prepare. I didn't like how much he wanted to stay in and how much time we spent apart because I wanted to be out. When we broke up and I reflected I realised how important it was for me to date an extrovert next time. My next ex was an Estj and we were so much more compatible in this way.
Long story short, don't take it personally that some people prefer extroverts. "
1187,estj,"Comment history shows you were with an ISTP...this is one of the worst types to date for xNFPs (awesome friends though). They are super independent people...they will never do anything they don't want to do, unless maybe you are ""the one"". I'm an ultra-introvert but I'll gladly socialize with people on occasion."
1188,estj,"
Can't tell if you're joking but in case you aren't...
Mbti isn't a black and white set if rules. Any type can work well with any other type in a relationship. Some people will prefer exactly what mbti says their type will prefer. But others will not feel that part of the description applies to them. People are more complex than that. I don't care what I am apparently supposed to prefer. I'm a grown woman who through over a decade of dating and relationships has learned what she prefers and what she doesn't. I know from experience what has made me feel satisfied and happy in a relationship and what hasn't. And my relationships with fellow extroverts have been more fulfilling than my relationships with introverts. "
1189,estj,"I met an ESTJ a month or so go and as an ISTJ she was just very hard to deal with. I enjoyed talking to her but she was very stubborn and down right rude and disrespectful. Granted she was much wiser than me in alot of things and in areas she wasnt she just played it off as if it didnt matter (ugh!).
Lol anyway my question to you is who the heck would marry one of u and actually be happy?"
1190,estj,"Hey hey! I'm an INTJ engaged to an ESTJ! We don't fight often, but when we do it is usually because I don't feel like he is processing what I am saying. This only happens when we are talking about emotionally rooted issues. I'll share my perspective and often feel like he heard it but is actively choosing to disregard it because it is different from his and therefore irrelevant. Aside from that, I have never gotten along with someone so well. We are both very direct, process, and logically oriented. We also are able to give each other as much space as necessary for the two of us to remain independent individuals inside of a couple. 
You guys any similar?"
1191,estj,Yea i understand that. And guess what both types are very stubborn. So i think if were both on the same page then its a good thing otherwise we will hate each others guts. And since istj dont speak up well we get the short hand of the stick. And as a guy that just doesnt fly. Lol.
1192,estj,"ESTJ here, married to an ISTP as well! Only been married for two years, but hope to have the same success as you.
I'm really happy with the way you described your relationship, because I feel the same about mine. It's simply just perfect!"
1193,estj,"What kept me going back for more was something different for each girl. Sometimes it was their sense of humour, sometimes their positive energy, sometimes their kindness and thoughtfulness... Or a combination of other things. 
They were all amazing at blowjobs though. INFP are sex bombs. "

1195,estj,"I'm an INFP girl in love with an ESTJ man (he doesn't know it yet though). I will keep this as concise and straightforward as possible. When we met, he wasn't looking for anything serious because he's separated with kids. He's a lot older than me...I don't have children but even though I love his kids, I would like my own. I can see a future with this man and I think he really likes me, if not loves me. He always makes time for me despite his busy work schedule even if we don't have sex that day. So I know it's not just that for him anymore, if it ever was ""just sex"". But I don't know what he thinks about going through marriage and children again, and I don't want to freak him out since we technically aren't in a relationship. I think he was just looking for some fun and I stumbled into his life. We are extremely compatible though and feel really comfortable with one another. Why we aren't in a relationship is complicated but mainly it relates with his home situation as he's still married with young children, although separated. He also has various sexual relationships with other women given his separation and I don't think he's ready to be exclusive. I know this sounds really bad or like I'm not important to him, but that's definitely not the case.
My question is: in light of his past, is it possible he could consider another serious relationship with me, let alone to the point of having children? "
1196,estj,"He is separated. Not the same thing as divorced. There is still a chance he could get back together with his wife, no? You need to ask him if he wants more kids, since he's already got more than one, kids are expensive, and as an ESTJ he has probably already set out a plan for the ones he's got with the finances available. Maybe ask him if he thinks he could afford to have more -- that's not a question he'd be freaked out by if you keep it impersonal. The other troubling thing is, he has other women on rotation? I feel like that's a little disrespectful to you. If he really thinks you're special, he'd have given those other women the boot, and wouldn't have wanted you to know about them for fear of losing you. I've heard of serious relationships starting out as FwB things at first, but he knows you're ok with being one of many casuals, so what makes you think he'll start to see and treat you differently later on? Ok, so you guys are extremely compatible and feel really comfortable with each other. What if he meets someone who he feels the same thing toward but the difference is, she makes it clear she doesn't sleep with nor lose sleep over ""unavailable"" men and that she'll be interested in him after he gets his act together and loses those other women? I guess what I'm alluding to here is neither you nor he seem to have real boundaries, or standards. Is that a good foundation for a healthy relationship? You SAY you want exclusivity, a serious relationship, kids, the works (actually he doesn't know that). Your ACTIONS say you're fine with non-exclusivity, and him wasting your time potentially. Given this, why would he consider doing anything differently?  "
1197,estj,"Few questions I have for you.
Why hasn't he divorced? Is he in the process of divorcing? What's the deal with that? If they are never getting back together why are they just separated for now? 
I personally think this is going to blow up in your face because he probably doesn't really think much of you. You are just someone to pass the time and hang with and fuck occasionally. 
I also don't support people who jump into relationships like this, to begin with.  He isn't divorced yet, so why are you messing around with him? Separation is NOT divorce.  
Definitely is not interested in you.  "
1198,estj,"As an ESTJ, my concerns about relationships are usually uncertainties. Stuff like:

She won't want to compromise on this issue
That thing she said was being polite but also means she probably isn't interested
My life is going to change dramatically in a year and I don't want to force her to go along with that
I'm a Christian and want somebody who will celebrate my Christianity with me
The dating scene is annoying and I don't know if I'm ready to go back yet

These are all examples of what might be going through my head as I think about getting serious with someone. Some of these came from my friends.
You probably have a decent shot at a relationship. There could easily be some deal breakers in there too."
1199,estj,"There's no chance for them to get back together. (long story)
Ok you said something really interesting which bringing up primarily the cost of kids...I handle my own finances so if he felt I would be able to handle the majority of living expenses of our potential children based on my savings and income, would this seriously factor into him deciding to have more children? For me, finances would only impact when to have children, not the decision itself.
We have an emotional attachment so we aren't that casual, but we aren't a couple. We do couple-y things though. But as far as being disrespectful, well I don't feel slighted by him having sex with other women except some jealousy. For him, I think because of work + kids + other commitments, he doesn't have time for a relationship. Or maybe that is an excuse but he is so extremely busy that it may not be. But his reasoning may be ""since I can't be in a relationship anyways, why bother being sexually exclusive?"". And I don't feel comfortable giving him an ultimatum to modify his behavior. But if that's something you think he'd want to hear from me to become exclusive, I would try it out. Only if he wanted though, because the flings don't bother me too too much. I just don't want asking him to backfire and end up hurting my chances instead of improving them. And an important point is, we can't be in a real relationship until some personal stuff relating to his marriage and the wife's family is resolved. 
He told me about them very early on, before any extended contact between us. He was being honest like ""hey just so you know, this is what I'm doing now""
That's the thing, I don't think he feels anything near the level of attraction or connection he has to me, towards anyone else. For example he's introduced me to his kids, whereas no other woman he's seeing has gotten to that point. It just seems serious to me without being an official relationship. 
It's more like I don't like to impose any restrictions on people, let alone someone I'm not technically dating. Yet he enjoys spending the free time he has with me, introduced me to friends, family, and more importantly his children. So it sounds like something but I have no idea what it is. Is it possible he was searching only for casual stuff with women, didn't expect to be meeting a person he felt real feelings towards, but now my presence in his life is confusing him? That's how it appears to me. It's worrying because maybe he had already decided he's done having kids and now it's time to sleep around but now he's met me...he knows I'm young with no children and he would have to make this huge sacrifice to stay with me. I hope this makes sense. 
I'm sorry if this is really rambly or the explanations aren't helping...the main thing I'm trying to understand is if this situation sounds like it could ever lead to anything more than what it is.
edit: Ok I realize what I'm asking can seem unclear or all over the place. So I will just ask this, am I supposed to ask him a ""where are we and where will this go?"" sort of thing? I don't want to make him feel pressured or scare him off if he feels more comfortable at a slower pace...he's already shown signs of seriousness and I think he appreciates me not putting that extra pressure on him. But it's my speculation only so that's why I'd like any advice. Thank you very much for your time. 
edit 2: I wanted to add that the ""other commitments"" are related to his home situation, and they take away his time and attention away from any relationship that carries real expectations, commitments, or sacrifice. He just doesn't have time for that since he's dealing with lingering stuff from his marriage, yet he's showing me through actions he has real feelings and considers me worthy enough to meet his loved ones. But other actions indicate he's trying to let loose and have fun. "
1200,estj,"Mainly for the kids until they're a bit older and because his wife is dependent on him financially and in his culture it's considered bad to just leave especially with young kids. He also has to consider what her family expects from him as well. There are other things but that's the gist of it. But his wife already knows about his relationships...they're ""secretly"" in an open marriage until they officially divorce. He definitely doesn't hide me because his close relatives and children have met me. I can see how it looks but things are more complicated than that. There are extra details in my other comments. 
edit:
I'll just put the extra details here:
looks promising

no chance of them not divorcing 
only introduced me out of everyone else to family/friends
we do couple-y things i.e. kiss outside of sex, hold hands, go on dates
told me about the other people before we had extended interaction (and that was one of the few times he ever mentioned it)

does not look promising

continues seeing other women (doesn't explicitly say, it's implied)
never brings up anything regarding our future
"
1201,estj,"I just want to say that if you find someone who says they want to go along with that and are swearing up and down that they want to, please don't discount it. 
Anyways, thank you for the small dose of optimism. I don't want to give up on this."
1202,estj,"I can see and am really impressed by what a considerate and thoughtful person you are. This is also where INFP‚Äôs can be a disservice to themselves. Everything in your response is about how to cater to his needs ‚Äî what about your needs? Do you have a timeline? He doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to know your timeline or dealbreakers but you need to know what/when they are and you need to love/protect yourself enough to enforce this when it‚Äôs been long enough. 
So I guess that‚Äôs the question: how long are you willing to wait while this guy divorces his wife, drops the other women, gains your full trust, and is himself emotionally ready to give you what you want? You don‚Äôt have to say anything that might pressure him while you wait. He should absolutely go at a pace he‚Äôs comfortable with. But you need to know when it gets too uncomfortable for you and to be strong enough to go when it‚Äôs time to go. 
Meeting his kids is a big deal if that‚Äôs how he interprets it too. Just ask him what his rule is on that: he only introduces SOs to kids under what conditions? Again you can phrase it in a way that‚Äôs impersonal. Hopefully he is honest with you and not leading you on. An ESTJ learns through mistakes what he should and should not do. If he‚Äôs only been separated, maybe he‚Äôs yet to realize the harm he could do if his kids meet his gf too soon only for them to get attached to her and then get hurt when there‚Äôs a breakup for whatever reason. 
Re: the handling your own kid‚Äôs expense... it could convince him but the ESTJ I knew had an established plan on gifting his one daughter enough to pay for 4 years of college and then some, and I would think he‚Äôd hope any subsequent kids would get treated fairly. My ESTJ ex knew that he couldn‚Äôt afford another $125,000 for another kid so having more biokids was not something he really wanted to do. He also said something about how he wouldn‚Äôt want his daughter to get jealous of the new kid given that he only gets 50/50 time with her. You really have to ask him what he thinks on these matters if you say you‚Äôre that emotionally close, it should not be something you can‚Äôt legitimately bring up. At some point, you want a relationship with him where you don‚Äôt have to tiptoe around things right? There‚Äôs no secret to being perfect for him so you get what you want. There‚Äôs just trust and have faith and stay positive, be the person he digs, but also don‚Äôt be a fool, don‚Äôt silence yourself if that‚Äôs what he digs, and find out who you‚Äôre really investing in and know when to jump ship. "
1203,estj,"That's very kind, thank you.
My needs are...for him to be with me? I guess I'm willing to wait as long as necessary as long as something happens. The only thing I know is that I love him and want to be with him, and have a family. Even though we are close, our future is a topic that keeps being skirted around. I will have to just talk to him but he seems confused which is why I try to give him all the time he needs to think about it. I will open up the discussion though. My final question - if he is unsure about marriage/family...what, if anything, could I say or do to influence him in that direction? If you were in his position for example.
And sorry to hear about it not working out with your ex, I hope you found someone with more aligned goals with you
Haha, damn 
edit: by ""influence him in that direction"", I definitely don't mean any sort of manipulation. What I mean is what words/actions would he need to hear/see from me to know that I'm 100% serious about him and would be very responsible and not put the burden of finances or child rearing on him. I want him to know that he wouldn't have to worry about that if that would prevent him from moving forward with me"
1204,estj,"INTJ female here.
WARNING: Really Long! I'm not giving a short version because I actually want good advice. Sorry.
Hey ESTJs, I need some advice on how to calm this situation with my ESTJ father. To start out, I don't blame him for any of this, we are very different in the ways we think, so this completely went over my head until he brought up how much I disrespected him. Of course, being the INTJ that I am, I was just thinking logically as to what I should do or not, and I didn't think about how he would see what I did as disrespectful, even though I suppose it was. My mind was in a totally different thinking process than his was, so I just didn't consider it.
My father (ESTJ) was playing a board game with my friends and siblings. He had just got home after everyone had eaten dinner, so obviously everyone was full and content, except for him of course since he hadn't eaten yet. Everyone was playing the game except one of my friends and myself. 
He requested that I make him some Venison steak and potatoes since that's what we ate. I know, simple request, I should have just made it and not overthought it.
I thought that since it was just my friend and I, she'd be left out from everyone if I spent (roughly) 40 minutes making the venison steak the way he likes it, and it's 10:00pm so it'd be late and I wouldn't be able to entertain our guest. 
So, I decided to give him just potatoes, extra so that he wouldn't still be hungry. This was quick, It was late, I could spend time with my friend so she wouldn't be left out, and I still gave him one of the things he wanted.
My friend brought up the potatoes to him, and then I went up about two minutes later.
I didn't think it was a big deal that I just made him potatoes, but apparently it was. 
He left the game and said he wanted to talk to be for 5 minutes. I got a huge lecture (won't go into detail with everything he said) on how I disrespected and embarrassed him. 
He does a lot for me, so he brought that up, saying that I couldn't do this one simple thing so I must not care about him. I told him that I do care about him and then I explained to him why I didn't do it, he got angry, only saw it as disrespectful, and then told me he was going to make the venison himself. I blocked him and said I'd make it for him, he angrily barged past and told me that he would make it himself and that I could do whatever it was I wanted to do. 
I don't exactly know what to do from here. I ended up telling my friends that he decided not to play, and then I went to bed since my friend took his spot, so I didn't have to worry about her anymore.
Also I realized that I forgot to apologise during our discussion, but I'm not going to right now because I might accidentally cause a scene and probably embarras him more, as well as myself.
To me, this wasn't a big deal until he made it into one, and he ended up embarrassing both of us when I don't think anyone else was even paying attention before. I'm not saying I wasn't in the wrong, but to me this is pretty dumb and I feel childish even having to write this.
Any advice? How would you feel if you were him and how would you want to be apologized to?
We just think so differently, I wasn't expecting him to be so mad. I wish it had, but it didn't even cross my mind that he'd see it that way."
1205,estj,"INTJ (Socionics ILI) is a special case because they are the supervisor relationship to ESTJ (Socionics LSE) in Socionics. It's hard to see how it applies in this situation, but this issue of disrespect might have been building up over time where he feels disrespected through no fault of your own.
I'm kind of similar in that I am an ESTJ with INTJ mother and brother. I don't know what it's like to have that as a child though. The easiest solution to healing these types of relationships is to get some physical or emotional distance. Try to avoid cooperating on things or teaching each other things. Alternatively, get someone else's help in handling a request when you think that there might be an issue.
Respect and control are both important issues for ESTJs, with respect being even more important for guys.

1206,estj,"It sounds like he was hangry and in retrospect should probably realize that he is a grown man capable of feeding himself and the world doesn‚Äôt stop and tend to him just because he walked into the room. And making you feel super lousy about that was pretty lousy on his part. 
I also have an estj father. I‚Äôve spent the better part of my life butting heads with him over stuff like this, so I‚Äôm not sure I can give particularly helpful advice. We are rough on each other and while we don‚Äôt have a horrible relationship, we don‚Äôt have a great one, either. I suspect you have your own unique family dynamic where you don‚Äôt kick him in the pants while he‚Äôs down, which is probably better.
But it will likely just blow over now that presumably he‚Äôs been fed. When I have an ugly toddler tantrum of an Fi moment, I prefer to leave it in the past and hope people forgive me for being a crabby spoiled baby."
1207,estj,"To be honest, I feel resentful when my partner (ENTP) and i (ESTJ) get home from work and he heads straight for the computer or sits on the couch and leaves me with cleaning, getting dinner ready etc. 
We do the same routine every day but he still needs me to ask him to do stuff only because he's not routine orientated. It could of been built up resentment or maybe your dad just had a really hard day.  He sees you having fun with your friends and thinks well i just worked all day, and shes been home with her friends, she can do this 1 thing for me. 
It could be about control, but for me it would be resentment. And when you didnt do as he asked he saw it as being lazy and disrespectful.
I would just let it go, you can apologise in the morning if you want, but he'll get over it. 
As long as the person doesn't do it again, i don't need an apology. Actions speak louder than words.
Thats my opinion anyway."
1208,estj,"Estj 3w2 here.
I think I understand where this is going. I do a lot for others myself. I think it‚Äôs the mentality of I do much for you, can you just do one thing for me? It‚Äôs like that with my infp sister sometimes it‚Äôs slightly different and it‚Äôs more of a lack of appreciation. Maybe you could have invited your friend in to the kitchen to hang out? I would simply say sorry I was wrong and I appreciate what you do for me, I will never do it again and not do it. I would be fine with it if it‚Äôs never done again, but if it‚Äôs done over and over and over again, I‚Äôll get tired of it. I have a friend currently in that situation with me. I usually don‚Äôt get this angry but it‚Äôs pushed through quite a few barriers."
1209,estj,"INTJ Here, I completely understand your situation. My dad is also ESTJ. Although, being in your shoes I would know this was completely my fault. Because I should know what rules my dad imposes and requires. In which case he would always get priority over friends. I would have invited my friend over to the kitchen to make the meal for him together or something. ESTJs on a basic level are easy to deal with, sometimes annoying or frustrating, but easy. They have rules, if you care about them, follow them. Especially if you‚Äôre below them like a case of a parent."
1210,estj,"I'm referring to fields like cognitive psycology or medicine or philosophy. I want to know if any of those fields interest you so much so that you labor to become somewhat of an authority in your peer group or beyond within your topic of interest.
Why am I interested? My father is ESTJ and he seems to not really care to learn about anything academic besides history. His only reading consists of war/mystery/crime fiction. "
1211,estj,"So I have this difficult guy who claims to be ESTJ. He does this kind of shit all of the time. He'll call me and when I pick up he's singing a random song. Or he gives me really vague responses to my very specific questions. Or he just ignores my messages entirely.
This afternoon I messaged him that I was going to speak English when I felt like I needed to be understood. (His English is perfect, my French is not, yet he doesn't like it when I speak in English.) I sent ""walls of text"" to explain myself after he yet again suggested I should speak to him in French.
A few hours later he sends me this message (it was all in French I've translated for you guys)
ESTJ: Do you drink bourbon?
Me: I drink everything.
ESTJ: That wasn't my question :|
So does this sound like an ESTJ and if so what would you most/least like me to respond if you were the ESTJ in question?"
1212,estj,"Uh. What's this about ESTJ's not being straightforward? I certainly thrive on clarity and explicit directions. Also, this is way too little information to decide if this is ESTJ talk. And I'm pretty sure MBTI looks different in various cultures. So, if he's French, it could be hard to tell. "
1213,estj,I don't beat around the bush. But this is not a direct question. I could answer yes (because I have in the past) or no ( because I can't remember the last time I did and I'm not a huge fan). And I would be happy to clarify by responding to a more specific follow-up.
1214,estj,"Oh, trust me, I'm on your side here and I see your point of view much better than his. But based on my experience with my wife (and others, but mostly her), ESTJs think linearly and any response that is not in a direct line with their question (or at least, the question they THINK they asked) can frustrate them to no end.
As an ENFP I tend to do a couple things when answering a question: 1) examine all the angles to try and figure out what they're REALLY asking (as you did); and 2) pick and choose my words for the right impression or emotional effect. Both of these things drive my wife nuts. ¬Ø(„ÉÑ)/¬Ø
Now, as far as the rest of your post goes, I agree with the other commenters. The dude is just being difficult. :)"
1215,estj,"I'm an ESTJ female, so by default I'm not following the traditional norm of how a girl should be lol. I grow up in a religious and collective environment, and let me tell you how I'm sick of all those nonsense rules. They seem so inefficient and petty. Norms follow function, not the other way around."
1216,estj,"Yes, we do exist!!
Friends often say I'm the smartest and most successful of the group. I own my own business and all that go-getter stuff. I could go on, but all you need to know is that I'm a tried and true ESTJ.
Smoking weed has definitely helped balance me out. Before, I couldn't STAND people who were overly emotional. If someone couldn't respond to logic, I'd find the most polite way to call them an idiot and move on. Lol like straight up. The thought of being friends what that kind of person wouldn't even cross my mind.
Now, I can actually stop and understand people's feelings. Sometimes, you have to allow people to feel emotional and you have to connect with them on that level before you can get them to see logic. This sort of statement would have many types saying, ""well duh...you JUST realized that?"". But ESTJ's don't naturally feel like that, it's something they have to learn. And when they do, it's usually because the ESTJ is playing an emotional endgame in order to get results out of someone, so the connection isn't exactly authentic. It's very rare to find an ESTJ who can genuinely relate to someone emotionally. I feel like I'm one of those, though. 
When I took the test high (as in answering questions that pertain to me while I'm stoned) I got INTP. Which made sense because I'd go from super extrovert to major introvert when I got stoned. I liked having conversations with people I knew, but I didn't like socializing with new ppl. That scared the shit out of me because my intelligence is a big part of who I am, and without that I felt like I couldn't be myself.
So I had to find another way to relate to people when I got stoned at parties. Finally I just told myself ""I might not be able to sound like my intelligent usual self...but I can make people feel good about themselves"". That's where this all began.
I've come to learn that making people feel good about themselves simply means shutting up and listening to them. Just letting them talk about whatever they want. Believe it or not, people don't wanna talk about politics or business. They don't wanna debate the intricacies of the stock market or of tax policy. Shocker, I know. 
Usually they wanna talk about THEMSELVES. About what they did last weekend, how it felt when they did activity X and Y. 
But in order to really know someone, you can't just listen to them all the time. You've gotta give them a piece of yourself too. And that's where everything changed for me.
I realized that I had to give myself the space to EXPLORE MY OWN FEELINGS. You'll have to figure out how to do that on your own. But what helped me was going on long drives down the coast, being around nature, listening to music... All things I did while I was high. I can listen to music for hours when I'm high and I'll never get tired of it. Like that alone is an activity for me. No way I'm doing that when I'm sober lol.
Every weekday night I drive to the beach, get high and listen to the evening news in my car while watching the sunset. It's interesting because I'm still doing an ESTJ activity, I'm still listening to the news. But I try to surround myself around something beautiful so that I can learn how to open up my heart to it-- something that I DID NOT KNOW how to do previously. But I'm trying. And I've learned that just as real as any fact or statistic can be, a glimmering sunset or a good song can be equally just as real. Again, so many other types would shake their heads reading this...it seems like such common sense. But I'm glad that it happened to me this way. You can either be an emotional person trying to find logic in this world...or you can be a logical person trying to find emotion in this world. I'd rather be the latter because an emotional person is learning logic to survive, whereas a logical person is learning emotion in order to find new meaning in life. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I finally found what I'd been missing all along, I just had to have a reason to look for it.
Anyways, that's my ESTJ perspective on smoking weed. If you're curious to know, I don't do ANY other drugs and I drink maybe once or twice a year. I wanna do DMT or acid, but studies have shown that even one strong acid trip can change your brain chemistry so I'll probably never do it. 
Now I wanna hear your stoney ESTJ experiences!"
1217,estj,"It helps me connect with my kids, since I've been built and conditioned(thanks emotionally retarded dad) from birth to lose all emotion and irrationality. It allows me to get on their level, and makes me a better parent. 
I'm in a legal state, I don't do it directly around them, and I don't get ""fugging ripped"". A couple of puffs to ""take the edge off"" as my wife says, and I'm down on the floor playing trains with my youngest or building a massive city in Minecraft with my oldest. And I make WICKED good snacks."
1218,estj,"Late response, but YES! 
As an ESTJ I find it very difficult to just kick back and relax ‚Äì there‚Äôs always something that needs to be done right? 
A little THC (I also recommend CBD if you‚Äôre not in to or don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòintoxicated‚Äô) is all it takes for me to allow myself to get some much needed relaxation without that ‚Äòbut I could be doing ___‚Äô hovering in my head. 
HOWEVER, I do use it quite sparingly. I have been through a few periods of using it every day/night, and that was a bad idea. Not sure if it‚Äôs just me, but frequent use leads to a 24/7 ‚Äòmental fog‚Äô that I just can‚Äôt stand. And as and ESTJ I greatly value my own heath, and to hell with what others say, smoking (or vaping) anything is still putting stuff in your lungs that your body probably doesn‚Äôt want there. 
But anyways, the stuff is great ‚Äì if used responsibly. 
Happy highs! "
1219,estj,"Well, I just retook a test and went from ISxJ to ESTJ. Like others have pointed out, it could be a manifestation of taking the tests on a bad day.
Don‚Äôt forget, it‚Äôs near impossible to objectively type yourself. 
Edit: Grammar is hard."
1220,estj,"What is your sense of humor like? ESTJs like dry humor, understatement, wit, puns, and subtlety.
What characters do you like and what personalities do they have?
In a debate, ESTJs focus on understanding the other person. They're usually looking for a logical contradiction that even their opponent will recognize."
1221,estj,"Yeah, it‚Äôs the shadow stack.
Massive differences.
Are you more process over outcome or do you care about your outcome more?
How many goals do you set and how many do you really actually complete and accomplish?
Do you have a winning urge? Do you care to win all the time?
How good is your memory?
Are you attracted to environmental details? Do you tend to notice many details in your environment?
Do you use comparative type of languages. This is like that, this isn‚Äôt like that?
What is your leadership style. Do you like to lead groups and are you a good leader?"
1222,estj,"could you explain ""shadow stack"" to me? Im still new to this
To answer your questions


I tend to care about outcome more. Process is important to me but as long as I get my desired outcome, its not a big deal


I set goals for myself but they seem to be more general (better grades, meet new people, etc). I complete these goals.


Yeah I'd say so. I grew up playing a lot of sports so I've always had a competitive drive behind me. 


Id say I have average memory. Good at remembering big picture but I can recall details well if I'm talking myself through memories


Idk what you mean by environmental? Like with nature? I dated this environmentalist girl for a bit and now Im hyperaware of how much plastic is being used and wasted lol. If you mean environment as in ""surroundings"", I try to take notice of what is around me and what situation i'm in. 


I use comparative language. Metaphors are easy to use when explaining thoughts. 


I've been told that Im a natural leader and I notice it myself. I take more of a proactive role when being a leader. Sometimes too much and notice I micromanage a lot. I do like being a leader. I like being the one to make decisions and the one people rely on. 

"
1223,estj,You didn't fuck up somewhere. The tests are extremely inaccurate so please don't take them as if they are giving you the correct answer. I would take a look at CS Joseph or Dave superpowers. They can give you a wayyy better understanding of typology
1224,estj,"You really do sound more like an ISTP than an ESTJ. 
For the environment one, they meant, do you notice things around you? Are you aware of your surroundings? Do you notice small details about someone? ESTJs are hyper-aware of their surroundings. They will recall details others would miss, they can usually size up a room pretty quickly. "
1225,estj,"Hmm. Your answers are interesting. I‚Äôll throw in this couple of clarifying and extra questions. I promise I‚Äôll to get to typing and I‚Äôll throw both in there.
Do you consider yourself to be mechanically inclined? And do you work well with your hands?
Do you like debating or arguing with people, or pushing limits or buttons?
So you set some goals but do you set more specific goals that are more short term as well. To long term?
What kind of sports do you like and why do you play it. Do you like the risk and the thrill aspect of the sports? Do you like out door events that tend to be risky and thrill seeking?
Do you mind risks or do you minimize them?
Why do you micromanage? What‚Äôs your thoughts behind that."
1226,estj,"But that's not how MBTI works. 
It's not extroversion and judging, it's 4 cognitive functions. 
Extroverted thinking, introverted sensing, extroverted intuition, and introverted feeling. 
And ISTPs are the exact opposite in all 4 categories. 
Introverted thinking, extroverted sensing, introverted intuition, and extroverted feeling. 
You could possibly be developing extroverted skills, becoming more talkative and social, and maybe seeing yourself as more organized or goal focused, but I'd say don't take 16personalites as your test because that gives people a horrible understanding of MBTI and causes the most mistypes."
1227,estj,"I'm not entirely sure why OP described himself that way in the first place, but these are my thoughts. 


an ESTJ would very much care about the process. Efficiency matters to us. We obviously want results, but we aren't just going to wing it and hope for the best. 


They set general goals. ESTJs set specific goals. Long term and short term, but we like to achieve, our goals would be focused around that. My ESTJ dad wanted the house paid off in 20 years. I wanted to graduate by XXXX, pay off all my debts by 26...etc. 


Sports don't define most types. My infp mom was a college athlete, so that isn't telling us much. Maybe the sports played might give it away, but likely not. 


Average memory. I see more than enough ESTJs bragging about how strong of a memory they have. It might not be type related, but there are quite a few posts out there talking about strong ESTJ memories. 


The environment one sorta made me laugh at how that went right over their head. But this is something we are really good at. We notice our environments, and we notice details, details most miss. 


I'm not really sure on this one, but I see myself as someone who is very much to the point. 


humble brag.


I see a lot of people do this when they are trying to figure out their type. They get weirdly specific about describing themselves and it makes it harder to really know what they are like.
I like getting them to talk about other details that aren't focused around themselves. Tell me about your friends, Tell me about the activities you are involved in, Tell me about a hard time and how did you get through it, What makes you angry? What motivates you? What frustrates you? If I cleaned your room without asking you, how would that make you feel? How do you like people to show that they love/appreciate you? How do you like to show others you love them?
I know those sound really weird, but you get someone to answer questions like that and you'd easily start noticing certain cognitive functions. "
1228,estj,"No istp maybe estp I‚Äôll test for that. But yeah.
And for the other poster se is actually better at environmental details colors, decor stuff of that nature. Si is different si people use memory recall and mostly compare their environments and is still using memory things. 
Also se people are regularly better at sports, especially the high thrills type but any sports is their thing. Good hand and eye coordination.
Se is more traditional sensing. Use your five senses non-mbti type of talk they mean se. Pure intake of sensations, that is raw.
Si is always comparing and using the senses in memories and other things.
Sj today is colder than yesterday. This noodle is fattter than the other one. This icecream is more creamy then the other one.
Se tends to not do this. They notice the full experience of the icecream. They can see very precise details of a color and not compare it they sense in a raw way.
Does this make sense?"
1229,estj,"I see. I want to answer these questions and get typed
I barely have friends since most people I meet have too many apparent flaws that annoy me and I relate better to my family than friends. The acquaintances that I have are self-absorbed (we're teenagers) and I am not interested in hearing all about them without getting asked about myself.
I'm not involved in any activities right now. I'm looking for employment experience relevant to my major but besides from that I just stay at home getting good grades.
I've never been through a situation that tough but I just kept things to myself and sought solutions to my problems.
I have a huge temper but the thing that makes me most angry is wasting time and people telling me what to do. I'm super impatient and can't wait for anything. I get mad when people tell me what to do because I see it as them trying to have power over me but I want the power. I also get mad at disrespect because they had the audacity to act in a rude way. Condescending people annoy me a lot because these people have no reason to have huge egos.
I am motivated by power, success, money, and time. These are mainly the four things I care about in life because without them you won't get far.
I am frustrated by an inability to follow through with my plans and schedules. Difficulties like traffic are inevitable which would cause my whole schedule to be ruined which frustrates me a lot.
I would be happy that you cleaned my room without asking me because it would have saved me plenty of time, but I'm already very clean and organized in the first place. If my belongings were misplaced, I would get annoyed and tell you to place everything in its proper spot the next time.
I like people to show love and appreciation through both words and actions, but more actions. I don't like cheesy and cliche things like ""I love you"" but I like to hear things like ""you're so smart, pretty, etc"". 
I show love through actions and making time for people rather than words. I am uncomfortable expressing emotion"
1230,estj,"You just need to understand that relationships are an important part of life. And if you want to be successful you need to be liked or a genius. So if you aren‚Äôt planning on creating the next best social media platform you need to understand that you‚Äôll get nowhere  by being a self absorbed asshole. 
When I realized I was getting easily annoyed by certain people I decided to go meet new people. Met amazing friends and let go of the bad ones. Instead of just being grumpy and miserable all the time. 
I understand being easily annoyed and irritated but I also understand that you‚Äôve got to understand that the world doesn‚Äôt work according to our standard and you‚Äôve got to let shit go. "
1231,estj,"You come off as holier-than-thou in the way that you talk about yourself, and I don't know about others, but those are the last people I want to be around. 
How does any of that make someone superficial? Liking that kind of stuff does not make someone fake or less of a person. 
I've been working with teenagers for years and am also back in school and I can say that I do not see people the way you do. My friends who like to party are some of my best friends who are also really fucking smart and amazing people. They just like to let loose every once in a while and have some fun. 
You are not better than someone because you decided not to drink, party, or do drugs. You are not worse either, but you are not better. "
1232,estj,"I'm looking for advice from other ESTJ's here. Fiance is in a dead bedroom and it feels like she's just staying because of tradition/shared past, but is this a limit with you all? Is there actually any coming back from this situation or is this actually done and she's just clinging?"
1233,estj,"Girl ESTJ here. Currently having similar problems with my SO. I would say, the best thing you can do is under promise and over deliver. And take a few days for a getaway and have a good time. Don't expect / ask any sexual activities, just go as best friends. Go for a hike, eat good food. Try to connect, small chats and all. Talk about music, TV shows, places, funny memories you had together. After a while she'll open up. Then, you can talk more deeply about how you feel.
I always do what I say. Especially with people I love, it's like I owe them my words. When my SO doesn't do things he said he's gonna do, I feel hurt because it's so important to me. In your case, if I were your SO, I would say 'you should have thought about this before you promise anything to me'. I would feel I couldn't trust you anymore, hence the avoiding physical touch. We value integrity and when we see that you don't demonstrate that value, we are put off.
She still loves you. Despite the traditional values that ESTJs have, female ESTJs defy those traditional values anyway. We are not scared to cut people off. The fact that she's still with you means she still sees hope in the relationship. And I can understand her wanting to start over. Don't see this as an ending, see this as a fresh opportunity. Go on dates, no expectations, have fun together, like old times. I think that's what she meant.
Sorry if it's all over the place I just woke up and I can't stop myself from commenting, your problem sounds so much like ours and I want to help."
1234,estj,"okay so 
maybe she isn‚Äôt attracted to you mentally and ambition/ lifestyle wise  so that leads to her treating  you  with distance rather than amicably? 
I recall when I didn‚Äôt feel the need to show affection to my bf because I felt it was forced and that we didn‚Äôt connect. I was like yah no goodbye kisses, etc.
so I think she is tolerating you and not interested and you need to find some common ground? 
it will be hard to figure out what she wants... maybe. This is because if you randomly try really hard to connect, she might analyze it too much and respond poorly. 
I think she needs to view you again in a positive and high regard then she could like you again enough to respond well."
1235,estj,"Hey there,
This was literally some of the most thoughtful advice I've ever gotten on this site (despite the throwaway I've been on here for like 10 years, too). 
My hand was hovering over Reddit gold. Just know that if the admins here didn't support some very shitty subreddits (and I""m protesting that) you'd have it right now."
1236,estj,"after college i worked at a hospital as an admin and have through the years made my way in to compliance - i feel like it's the perfect job for my personality type. anyone else feel that way and what is it that you do? for me, it was not planned to work in this field, but seems like a natural progression. i oftentimes refer to myself as an adult hallway monitor. "
1237,estj,In my spare time I work as a secretary of the church and I am also the secretary general of the church's council and I am loving every moment because I mostly organize stuff and papers and appointments and I am happiest when I see all the work coming to fruition in a meeting or an event
1238,estj,"I work in credentialing for a PPO. Our department makes sure the doctors in our network have the proper licensing and make sure they haven't had history of insurance fraud, malpractice history, etc.
I basically gather paperwork and do spreadsheets, and since I'm training now I tell others how to gather said paperwork.
It's very enjoyable to me, but it definitely wasn't planned. I didn't even really know what credentialing was on my first day."
1239,estj,"My dad is a concrete construction superintendent in Chicago and an ESTJ, and I would say it's pretty fulfilling for him, inasmuch as he is unlikely to think of it in those terms himself. 
He worked on houses as a teen, and I guess he just kept working because it kept paying the bills. His work ethic and attentiveness / care for the work was noticed and he just kept getting promotions... going on 30 years now and the only thing keeping him from starting his own company is, I think, a fear of going out on his own. He's very much a ""King's Hand"" sort of guy, not as much the King. "
1240,estj,"ahaha ah it's our generation to not be on time... bahaha, at our office its, ""if you're on time, you're early. if you're late, you're on time. and if you just didn't show up, you're working from home."" kills me. 
does he find your sense of fashion too far from ""classic attire""?"
1241,estj,"i'm glad i'm not the only person that enjoys organizing! and you're so right about the final event you're working towards, it feels like such a great accomplishment!
sometimes i wish i were a wedding planner, but i wouldn't even know how to get into it. but that seems to me like the ideal job. "
1242,estj,"Yeah, one of his favorite phrases about work is ""If you're early you're on time; if you're on time you're late; if you're late you're fired."" He's a pretty nice guy, but definitely the type to appreciate ""a respectable young man"" sort of thing, and give a stinkeye to people he sees as doing things poorly.
Of course he ended up with a son who wore skinny jeans, has long hair, and is never on time to work.... x)"
1243,estj,"It entails listening and connecting with individuals or couples to help them make smart financial decisions such as how to buy a home, how to send your kid to college, how to prepare for retirement, how to create a estate plan, protecting your family from unexpected disasters, and how to take care of a aging parent. 
Once the goal is determined I help build a strategy from a financial standpoint on how to fund their goals either through investing or saving while keeping taxes and laws in mind. 
Basically a financial life coach :)"
1244,estj,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
1245,estj,"I've never cheated and never would. 
I'm married, and most of my friends are men including my best friend. I regularly go out with them/crash at their place if I can't drive home or I'm in their town. It has NEVER crossed my mind. I would never break my husband's trust. "
1246,estj,"Only once physically but I broke it off with the guy I was seeing the next time I saw him. Slight guilt but the guy and I were in a super new relationship.  I didn't enjoy cheating, per se, but I enjoyed how I felt with the ""other"" guy. "
1247,estj,"I saw a disturbing one unfortunately where two Turkish soldiers were captured on the Syrian border, put in a cage and burnt alive. They were calling out for their mothers as they died. It was absolutely horrifying."
1248,estj,"Oh you are watching execution videos. Well, that changes things.
Media like that is used as a propaganda tool by IS and by consuming it, you are playing directly into their hands. Please don't do it. Report the video and move on. 
It's difficult to make a judgement (and so react accordingly) about why you would watch something like that. 
Perhaps you're very young, morbidly curious and fortunate enough not to have experience  with visceral pain, fear and suffering. In which case, it's obviously gross, but no need to freak out. I do suspect this is the case for you, if you are curious about death you can talk to your family about it. It's good to talk about death, it helps us to remember that we are indeed alive and that our lives are brief.
Perhaps you're the type of person that's titillated by it. In which case it's very gross, no need to flip out though. I think my reaction to that would be to stop associating with you.
Perhaps you have IS sympathies. Still no need to flip out though, just report it to the authorities and let them handle it."
1249,estj,"I don't regularly watch them but sometimes I will watch live-leak type stuff so that I can see what evil looks like. I don't like to be shielded from harsh truths. Regardless, I wouldn't share something like that with anyone unless they specifically asked for it. I read ESTJs don't like unusual or unexplainable things/events, they like their world to make sense at all times. So I was wondering if I should avoid sharing too much of those things to avoid making him anxious."
1250,estj,"Yeah, but the unusual things on Dark5 are not that unusual- they're largely easy to explain and, as your time on live leak has taught you, the world is a violent and unstable place so a bit of violence and instability is to be expected."
1251,estj,"As said, I'm an ENFJ and I'm a highly emotional/feeling type of person. I've been dating someone (for 6 months) who is similar to me in so many ways, EXCEPT for the fact that he's a thinker. 
Sometimes he doesn't appear to have much empathy, but I understand that's just how he is. However, what I find difficult is knowing what he's thinking, because it's most likely the polar opposite to what I think/feel. And I wonder, do ESTJ's actually feel much? (Legit stupid question...sorry) or is it all logic and reason? When I ask him he tells me he thinks with logic and reason...but I literally just don't understand that! So I thought maybe someone here could explain it better, because I'm really curious to get a better idea of how you guys 'think' and how you experience feelings!
Thanks :)"
1252,estj,"agreeing with all of the above. i'm a STRONG T so i've even met other T's who are too ""f"" for me. i am constantly told that i can be intimidating or cold. i can see why, but i don't think that that's the case. i also dont think that we ""don't feel anything"" because i actually tend to feel perhaps overwhelming feelings sometimes. the difference is that the way we process the world, think, make decisions, is we do it based on rational things alone (not feelings). for example, approaching a court case or something. for all the world, i might feel bad for the victim in the situation. however, if i think they honestly broke the law, then i'm going to convict them regardless of how bad i feel about the guy. that's just how i roll. (and you know how us ESTJs love the law... haha)
anyway, my best advice for you when reaching out and communicating with your guy is to just remember that we DO have feelings, we just prefer not to use them as a way to make choices/decide things. i feel frustrated when people always tell me i'm heartless because it's not the case at all, and i just wish more ""F types"" could understand that. Also, if you ever want your guy to do things or to see things your way in an argument, it's almost useless to try to reach out and appeal to their feeling side. its always better to give a good, well-formulated argument with thought-out reasons. :) i hate being ""wrong"" but if you can give me good, real, rational reasons for your way of thinking, i respect that enough that i will switch sides."
1253,estj,"Thanks for your reply! Haha I like you. You actually sound a lot like my partner! Lucky for me, I am quite a rational 'F' (I know some people think 'f' types are inherently irrational but I don't think that's the case at all. In fact my partner has said the thing that makes me good is I rationalise all my feelings to make sure I don't act irrationally on them) so I am naturally good at presenting my side of an tif (or small argument if you don't know that word!) to him in a way he can understand it! I'm actually starting to understand how he thinks now and it's going great and I have all of you to thank for that! :) "
1254,estj,"Thanks for your reply!! :) 
Haha well I guess it just seems to me that estjs don't really feel much. I'm wondering if that's actually the case or if you process your feelings differently. 
What confuses me most is that I'm a fairly rational person (for an emotional one at least haha) and I always think about how I feel and decide whether it's a rational or irrational feeling and act accordingly. So I also use logic and reason but it just seems to be different to the way estjs use logic and reason... Does that make sense....? "
1255,estj,"I don't think we feel any less than the average person. 
The difference is that you seem to have two categories for feelings: rational and irrational. We view all feelings as irrational, we think ""rational feeling"" as an oxymoron. We have feelings, but in the context of decision making, our feelings automatically go quiet and shut up in a corner. There are exceptional cases where it doesn't work that way and we can listen to our feelings to make a decision but it's a HUGE effort to do so, and it tends to make us uncomfortable and pessimistic, like we made a wrong choice. We're just not wired that way. "
1256,estj,No sometimes my feelings can be rather intense but normally its as if im a step back from the situation like an observer of the entire thing rather than whats best for me. Typically though I know what I do and dont want really strongly soo
1257,estj,"Hmm okay. That's interesting! Thanks! 
One more question though, when you get emotions do you like the feeling of them ? Because I actually enjoy extreme emotions and almost seek them out,but I can't really picture my partner doing that! "
1258,estj,I can sometimes swing from emotions randomly but yeah human instinct is to feel happy so ^_^ It doesnt mean I hate emotions I enjoy being happy or exited or whatever I just dont let it impact on decisions is all.
1259,estj,"A Sith Lord is at bat.  He hits a long fly ball in left field towards the fences, but several feet foul.  At the last minute the ball suddenly breaks right and goes over the fence in fair territory.
Does the ESTJ umpire throw him out of the game for cheating or just let this one slide?"
1260,estj,"ESTJ umpire announces that the Sith team has forfeited the game, because they were already warned for pulling the bats out of the hands of the Jedi players at bat and force-choking the outfielder so they could get a home run earlier in the game. 
ESTJ umpire also warns Jedi team that their mascot, Jar Jar Binks, is not permitted on the field and must stay on the bus next time. "
1261,estj,"This will probably help. 
My sister uses introverted sensing as an ESFJ and she has very vivid and personal experiences with food and music. She can remember any song and the moment she heard it and what she felt about it. She‚Äôs like a human Shazam. She knows what she likes about food and what makes it good to her, and cooks for herself every night whereas I don‚Äôt use that function and all and frequently neglect my physical comfort and health. When she‚Äôs hungry, she keeps repeating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry, I‚Äôm so hungry‚Äù until she‚Äôs fed. She is very particular about her comfort. 
I dated an ESTJ and he was a history buff, can remember details in sequential order very well. He was also super into movies and could compare any kind of movie and remembered the exact year of each one. He knows what he‚Äôs in the mood for pretty much all the time and you can tell he‚Äôs not enjoying a moment by his physical reactions to discomfort. Incredible memory, broke the MCAT by getting into the 101st percentile. This is more of an ability example but for someone to be this good at memory, they must hold those things with significance. "
1262,estj,"I saw so many conflicting definitions for si, that I think that there is no general consensus.
That said, I see si (ha) as experience, the head cinema that shows previous episodes of your life, an anti-gaslight function. This sort of thing.
Example: Lets say I would give you an apple and would claim it is a pear. You can tell that it is not an apple by it looking, smelling and tasting different than any apple you have ever seen. And if you had enough experience with pears you could identify it as one.   "
1263,estj,"I (24m, ENFP) am dating an ESTJ (19f) and would like to do some small things every now and then to make her day. The problem is, being an almost opposite personality means that I have no clue what kind of things she would really like. Any suggestions? I'm thinking just small things like a note or small gift once in a while."
1264,estj,"We're just new friends but for his 40th bday, I sent my ESTJ a care package of interesting treats and a pair of novelty socks that said ""Natural Born Asshole"". He really liked it and even wore the socks to his certification exam for good luck (and got a 98/100). Also, he loves receiving and sending pictures by text for some reason. But he's a dude so YMMV. "
1265,estj,"I work with an awesome ESTJ, and I think I made her freaking day by offering to do a small task for her which I was dressed appropriately for (it was outside work, a SUPER hot day and I was already dressed down to move dirty boxes all day) and she wasn't.
Honestly as an INTJ this would have made my day too.  "
1266,estj,"Are any of you here rebellious, innovative, creative, untraditional, and/or willing to dive in to the unknown, anarchaic (and/or meaning even if just one or two of those adjectives apply to you)....
Roll Call. Lemme see which adjectives apply, what you think/have done to earn that description and why you're still sure you're an ESTJ despite having these non-stereotypical characteristics"
1267,estj,"The only one on the list I'd identify with is ""willing to dive into the unknown."" Not that I'm not uncomfortable with it, I am, but I've learned from my very adventurous ENFJ husband that the amazing adventures available somewhere out there are worth the discomfort associated with finding them.
For example, for our anniversary last week he surprised me with flying trapeze lessons. And I don't like heights. And it was terrifying. And I had no idea what I was doing. But it was also fantastic and I would do it again.
Does stubbornly and proudly identifying myself as a Super Nerd despite ridicule and peer pressure to conform count as being rebellious?"
1268,estj,Counts as something... I guess it's kinda rebellious. Not rebellious enough to be able to claim the title tho. But thanks for your response anyway. Y'all as rare on this board as INTJs are irl
1269,estj,"I am very aware of that. The purpose of the post wasn't to find ""daredevil insanity"" but to hear from ESTJs that have some non-16personalities.com traits since the primary thing i hear about ESTJs is enforcing tradition when as far as I am concerned, the primary thing about being an ESTJ is making sure whatever is happening makes sense. 
It also would have been interested to see how such behaviors would manifest in someone who identifies as ESTJ. 
I already know what the ENTJ's ""daredevil insanity"" is like. I've been living it for 23 years."
1270,estj,"I feel like I have a responsibility to upkeep both my reputation as a ""rule follower"" and my parents reputation (I still live at home and although I rarely feel like rebelling against my parents, people at church may think less of my parents if I act a certain way). So although I do have some rebellious feelings my reputation and my parents reputation especially among people at church is more important to me. "
1271,estj,"I'm not quite sure. Maybe it's just because I like being known as a ""good girl,"" but I think it also has a great deal to do with my religion. As for my parents' reputation, it's just out of respect for them. They raised me very well and I don't want anyone to think any different. "
1272,estj,"Cool. I respect that. Especially the part about respect for your parents that raised you well. Anything else about you that you think would interesting for me to know that's along the lines of ""not typical/stereotypical for an ESTJ""?"
1273,estj,"Creativity depends. Stereotypically I'd imagine the ESTJ being the one that makes sure to hit every note exactly, and bashing anyone who fails, including his/herself.   
Jokes/bad statements aside, I don't think it's atypical, but it surely is very against stereotype.... Unless you're the conductor/instructor lol. Anyway thanks for all your responses. I appreciate it. Always good to hear from my Si using cousins."

1275,estj,"I am going to be a bit sentimental, I'm sorry in advance!
Yesterday, in a pretty confused state, I wrote this post about going on dates with this ESTJ. And you guys gave me good feedback. 
To summarize the post - I hit it off with this ESTJ guy, who was sincere, sweet, and very expressive. It was very obvious we both felt the click. We kissed on all three dates. However, he wouldn't initiate or send a text after each of our dates. You guys gave me good feedback, mostly saying that the ESTJ is definitely interested, and ESTJs aren't usually good at texting/small talk. It made sense, so I just took the advice.
Today, I found out that in the last three days, he's changed his pictures on a dating profile. This indicated to me that he's actually not looking for anything serious with me. 
I was actually devastated. I know it's only been three dates, but the connection was great and mutual (unless I am totally fooling myself). 
I guess I'm just venting because I've never done ""casual dating"" myself where I get physical with a man but look for other men at the same time. It sucks to know that whatever I had with this guy, he was probably not very serious about.
Anyway, just wanted to vent. Would love to hear any feedback/words/comments... I'm a sappy sad gal tonight."
1276,estj,"I'm sorry.
You might be reading too much into it like the other commenter said, but I think your reasoning is grounds to be worried. If I were you, I'd just send him a text to find out where you stand with him. Worst case scenario, you both go your separate ways, which is going to happen if you don't initiate contact anyway.
Wishing you the best."
1277,estj,"To be honest, from your last post, if he doesn‚Äôt initiate then he‚Äôs not as into it as you are. He might be into it but just not as deeply as you‚Äôre thinking. Of course, it sucks not to be on the same ‚Äúpage‚Äù in the relationship. 
Source: ESTJ female. I gladly, gladly initiate and ‚Äúdouble text‚Äù to people who are just friends, let alone someone I‚Äôm interested in. "
1278,estj,"Thanks for your comment. I have initiated texting a few times in the past several days, which makes him engage in a conversation but never initiates back. I feel that asking him to define ""where we are"" seems premature at this point. It's a good suggestion if we had hung out a bit more.
I'm just figuring out that if he's updating his dating profiles while going on dates with me, it probably means he's just looking for flings or not as interested in me as I had hoped."
1279,estj,"Haha, I see how my post can sound dramatic. But given how close we got during our first few dates, I was thinking that we were headed in a good direction. I mean he was planning our future dates, wanting to be physical, doing all the ""early dating stage"" things, etc. I don't know about other people, but when I feel a connection with someone, I don't go home and update my dating profile to woo other men, you know?
I think him going on dates with me while updating his dating profile means that he's just not that into me."
1280,estj,"Thanks for the comment. Didn't it make you feel uneasy dating him continously, though, knowing that he is looking elsewhere at the same time?
Was trust ever an issue after your relationship was established?"
1281,estj,"Thanks for this comment. I agree with you 100%. I was confused because during our face-to-face dates, he would be planning with me our future dates (i.e. museums, restaurants, etc. based on my preferences). And then the texts would just drop after the dates. I found it a bit strange.
Thank you for your feedback!"
1282,estj,"Honestly, I rarely initiate text conversations with people as I just don't really enjoy talking with my thumbs, and my social media profiles are mostly me updating my profile pictures from time to time. Maybe you could plan another date with him? If he goes on another date, that means he very well may be into you, and if he doesn't, that's your confirmation that he isn't. Very few people would go on multiple dates as a quick fling. "
1283,estj,"Yes mam, big time. Especially as we lived an hour apart and I have ridiculous trust issues as is. He lied to me for 4 years straight. I caught him lying to me quite a bit about those sorts of things, and we got into some pretty big fights. But apparently I was worth it to him because he faught hard to keep me when he did fuck up. And I mean REALLY hard. I can't say this for a fact, but from what I know ESTJs have very high sex drives and that's what's caused alot of our problems in the first place. 
Trust is still an issue today.. But he's finally realising that lying to me has only pushed us farther apart and put us in a bad place, and that life is so much better when you don't have to hide anything and we can be open and honest with eachother.  Unfortunately it took the experience for this to really get through his head, but things have gotten much better since. Nowadays we'll fight occasionally and if he confesses to things, I don't get mad, but rather try to help him fix the issue so he won't do it again, and it motivates him to want to be better for me.
I say all of these negative things, but I want to let you know that he was incredibly good to me aside from those setbacks, and impressed me otherwise. I remember one day he came over and randomly surprised me with more bouquets of roses than I could carry, along with a ton of chocolates! He did alot of sweet gestures randomly out of love and took better care of me than my own parents."
1284,estj,"Ohh I see. Glad to know that some ESTJs don't like to initiate texts! My previous ESTJ boyfriends have always been so blatantly clear about their interest from the get-go that I found this to be a bit different...
Just out of curiosity - if you meet a woman you feel attracted to, how do you take her out on a date if you don't text/call? What would be your strategy? I'm genuinely curious..."
1285,estj,"I am sorry about the heartbreaks... That's so strange because while I found my ex-ESTJ boyfriends to have high sexual drives, none of them were even close to being prone to cheating. If anything, they were the more jealous ones in the relationship :/"
1286,estj,"Most of the time I wait for them to approach me, not the other way around. Now that I think about it, I probably should've said that from the get-go lol. However, I was raised in a pretty progressive sort of environment with pretty laid-back gender roles, so a woman asking me out isn't as foreign an idea to me as it may be to some people, so if that isn't the case for you, I may not be the best person for advice in this area."
1287,estj,"Oh wow thankyou:) we really do have to be very flexible along with staying true to our boundaries. I thought I could tolerate alot more than I really can, and in result I had only let myself get hurt worse. My husband comes off as quite flirtatious too, as he's charming and smooth beyond words. And emotional cheating hurts me just as bad, but means nothing to him. It's incredibly difficult to put that into perspective for him. We went through many ups and downs as well, and we still do of course but thankfully not as extreme. YES! I think that's true, ESTJs show love through physical touch.. They aren't much for touchy-feely subjects, and Feeling is their most inferior function after all. But we've both adjusted to one another. I absolutely know where you're coming from, I don't entirely know what he sees in me but he has everything I want, I just wish honesty was never an issue. I think you're right, they do remain aloof and it takes them longer to realize how badly they want you. When he left for basic and AIT training he was excited to go and I died on the inside the moment we said goodbye- he didn't start to feel the empty feeling I always had until a couple months in, and then he completely flipped and wanted me more than anything. He even grew depressed without me as I had been the entire time all along. It just took him more time. Lately I've been trying to be more independent and do my own thing (as ESTJs are natural leaders) and I think with time he has and will continue to realize what he has, and he will fight harder for us. "
1288,estj,"Yeah he thankfully never actually cheated on me. It was all things we were able to work through with time, but we met online and before we were dating he talked to an endless amount of girls. Once we were dating he continued talking to some girls from online dating apps and on kik, claiming he didnt of course. I don't think he wanted anything more from them but pictures but either way that's enough of a lie and was hurtful to me, because he made me feel insuffienct. And when I noticed those apps on his phone I'd question them and he claimed He just really hasn't gotten to deleting them. He also hung out with this one girl he used to be ridiculously into from highschool sometimes and never mentioned it to me, and we lived an hour apart so there wasn't much I could do. I found out later from the girl herself when I was doing her hair. Another thing that really bothers me, that I know a lot of people don't understand is porn. It leads his desires elsewhere, distracts him from work, takes up alot of his time, breaks me up inside, and not only that but its literally a drug that a person can form an addiction to, and will absolutely alter a person's brain. It tears a relationship apart, and it almost tore ours apart, mainly because of all the lying... I couldn't believe he'd really lie to me every day for so many years... And just for that. "
1289,estj,"Yeah it's definitely a personal preference when it comes to porn. I never cared about anything like it with my ex's, but then again I didn't love them. I hated erotica was taking away from me and my husband's time in bed together, because we started spending less time intimately and now I know why. It was replacing me. Porn led to more secrecy, he even had another phone hidden in the house that I didn't know about. Since then we've been through alot. I knew its not something I could get rid of instantly and expect for him to move on from so for a while we tried incorporating it in our time together (Which I must add, could save a relationship. Or work the opposite way) and I just fucking murdered myself internally. I watched him pay more attention to the screen sometimes than me, and I'm plenty of a woman to look at.. It's just the scene he loves I guess. He's come to recognize his obsession and he seriously needs help in this area, even though its embarrassing. He's been reading up on the effects porn has on the brain along with alot of other facts nobody talks about, like the way it promotes sex trafficking. This website is interesting to look at and gives proof on the topics if you're curious. Tons of men are addicted. I've started using porn blocking and incognito mode blocking apps on his phone and laptop and he claims he agrees it's a good thing, that way the temptation won't always be so easily accessible and hopefully one day he'll get to the point he won't need  it blocked anymore. It's just all the secrecy that comes from it that kills me. I think he actually means it this time but I can never fully trust him as bad as I want to. I'm really happy for you that it doesn't bother you, I wish I could overcome it. I know they're just random girls, but not entirely to him in a way because he obsessed over specific ones and knew all about them. 
Yeah you really do have to just trust and pray he stays true to you. People are naturally more inclined to rebel when more rules are placed on them and that could potentially have been where I went wrong long ago.  ESTJS can have big egos and see status and rank as important (I don't get it in the slightest, but MBTI kind of explains it haha.) It's true, if we focus on the good in a person then they'll desire to do more good, or at least that's what positive motivation does. Fighting will only push people apart and make them not want to fix things, so I'm doing my best, to do what's best for us and motivate instead of condemn. He is extremely dedicated to me and it shows in many ways, and I believe he'll never go as far as actually cheating. I guess it really is alot of what you said, different social perceptions that can cause a stir in our minds. But it's only in our minds. Haha allergies is an exciting topic;) that's good at least you know deep down that he's simply conversing with people and nothing more. Girls will be all the more aware they don't have a chance when they see a ring on his finger:) "

1291,estj,"I have ADHD and I'm ISFP. I am so disorganised, forgetful and have struggled for years with finances, holding down jobs and overcoming my many shortfalls. 
I've lived with my ESTJ boyfriend for three years - and it's been hell. Sheer fucking hell. He's a nagging, nit-picking, soul-sucking twerp. 
But we also have the best fun. 
We laugh our heads off together and he keeps me going because I learn from him and my friends say it's changed me for the better.
But is the relationship ultimately doomed? Is it best to go our separate ways now because our dynamic is not sustainable? He gets so annoyed with me for everything while I just get more depressed and go into my own world (until it's the weekend again and we're having fun again...)
Does anyone else have similar experiences? Thanks for any words of wisdom x"
1292,estj,"ESTJ here-
This sounds like the kind of relationship that is good to learn from on both sides, but won't last. If you describe your three years living together as ""hell"" what about marriage? Having children? Even if you don't do either of those things, ""hell"" is not a good way to live your life. If you only have fun on the weekends, it's not a good relationship."
1293,estj,It can work but it's not just your diagnoses that make a good match. I'm ESTJ and my hubby is both ADHD and INFP. you have to make a lot of compromises and understand how the other person works and feels.
1294,estj,"I am estj and have adhd myself. I tend to be pretty critical of all the symptoms that come along with adhd, but medication makes me super neurotic and angry. I can deal with it within myself, but if those two aspects of myself could be separated, it would definitely be easier. "
1295,estj,"I'm an ENFP with ADD dating an ESTJ. 
My ESTJ is ""in charge"" of all of the logistics of our lives, but has never once put me down for being bad at that stuff. She looks at me like I'm a magic fairy that she is so happy to get to be around, and I look at her like she's this captain of competence and success. There's so much mutual respect. 
The problems in your relationship aren't because your boyf is an ESTJ; it's because he's a dick. Tell him that you love the way that he helps you get your life back in order [or whatever], but that you don't want to be in a relationship where you're made to feel less-than and nit-picked. Have healthy conversations about what you need, and hear what he needs from you. If he's not willing to soften his tone with you, though, (or whatever it is you need to not feel soul-sucked) then it's not the relationship for you"
1296,estj,"You guys are the most textbook people anywhere, one estj who shall remain unnamed is your classic overachiever, 100% top 1% grades, wins competitive sports, music, maths you name it and does every extracurricular out there. (And is top performer in each) Maybe I am salty said estj is so boring in general.  All he does is brag about his newest achievements that is when you get to talk to him. Usually said estj is very focused on what they are doing and is absorbed into studying or whatever OR trying to command the whole room to do their will.(which btw Is always the most boring, predictable ""efficient"" thing) he has a lot of admirers but not a lot of friends. Is this an estj thing or just him? "
1297,estj,"I find this post especially interesting because OP comes across as insecure, judgmental, and perhaps believes themselves to be inadequate. Why post on an ESTJ forum attacking ESTJs?
Anyway, I am NOT an ESTJ, so this post doesn't impose on my personality at all. However, I'm responding because I think you are incorrect, OP. ESTJs are ""textbook,"" I guess you could say, in the sense that they are some of the most dependable and reliable people you will ever meet. I've found that most ESTJs don't have to brag about their achievements because, honestly, they usually don't feel the need to prove themselves to anyone they don't care about. And, if they do care about you, it's because the feeling is mutual. You'll already KNOW their achievements if this is the case. ESTJs have a natural commanding presence without even trying. Yes, their notion to believe they're always right is annoying sometimes because they're so damn stubborn, there's no swaying them, but that's only one downfall in a plethora of good qualities. If you can't handle their personalities, don't be friends with them. Jealousy isn't becoming on anybody, OP. "
1298,estj,"Lol. My boss (who was recently unceremoniously fired) was an ESTJ, and routinely proclaimed that she wasn't racist/sexist/classist because she has a Ph.D. in Equality. While I can laugh about this now, I'm somewhat perturbed by her driving need for extrinsic rewards. 
I don't agree with the OP re: ESTJs being boring, but I am interested to explore the role of extrinsic (rather than intrinsic - autonomy, mastery, and purpose) motivators in the lives of ESTJs. "
1299,estj,"I wanted to point out that getting ones own achievements does not mitigate the need for empathy, which the OP AND my boss clearly need. 
I'm not saying all ESTJs are like my boss, just pointing out the similarities of her extrinsic motivation and your insistence that the OP also acquire such extrinsic motivators. Since you (likely) don't know her, and I was not painting all ESTJs with the same brush, I don't understand your quickness to becoming defensive (exemplified in your questioning of baseline assumption of good will)."
1300,estj,"No, I know how I come across, but I can't control how others react. To assume ill will immediately is more indicative of the other person's world view than mine. To be easily offended is just too tumultuous a life or mental landscape for me. It might be cause for additional self reflection on your part.  
In any case, Thanks for this interesting spar. While I initially sought insight into the relationship between ESTJs and extrinsic motivation, what actually happened was illuminating nonetheless. 
Happy New Year! "
1301,estj,"First off, you guys seem to get a lot of hate, and this is an appreciation post. To preface this, I'm an ENTP with a long history of terrible prioritizing, scheduling, and organizing skills. I came into this school year with no calendars, no schedule, no real motivation, no cares, or worries. After a semester with my ESTJ roommate I have learned a lot:
When I first moved in I thought this would be like living with my mother round 2. She was high-strung, bossy, and bitchy. SHE CAN'T STOP CLEANING AND BITCHING ABOUT EVERYONE/EVERYTHING. The girl literally had no idea how to have fun. I honestly thought she and I would butt heads about anything and everything, but it turns out it was the best random roommate I could have asked for.
The girl taught me how to organize my life. 


How to stop procrastinating by: ""Do it right when you get it, make the deadline tomorrow.""(I am now a month ahead of reading/hw/projects in my courses and I'm taking a full load). 


How to clean up after myself consistently: Every (one day of the week) pretend friends are coming over that night-(even better, invite a few over that night). 


How to make schedules/plan (I revamped it to fit my personality a little better). 3 attainable goals of the day, 2 reach goals, and 1 long term goal/progress on it (When you start with this method I recommend just lots of baby goals to cross off).


How to only keep/maintain healthy friendships-I deleted 

How to take an extra second to make better decisions.( Take a deep breath and look at the clock, list/say the worst things that can happen for the next minute). Really helped me stop going Ne crazy.

Basically, she taught me how to ""life"" in just a semester without even knowing it or trying. So although our opinions and points of view on things don't always agree, She really is the yin to my yang.  While she does all this for me, I have shown her how to relax. How to start laughing about the little things in life. How to live life a little more on the edge. How to start thinking outside the box about how to solve some of her problems. Finally, I showed her that things are always black and white. There is a middle area and there are other perspectives and feelings we need to take into account before making broad statements.
Overall, thank you ESTJ's for helping some of the lost find a path.
If you have any questions at all ask away! :)"
1302,estj,"Just curious, maybe you are ENFP? NFP + STJ is usually like a yin - yang relationship, they share the same beliefs and attitudes, enjoy similar activities etc. It would be interesting to find that ENTPs really like ESTJs too."
1303,estj,"See, we don't share anything like that. Like our conversations never last more than an hour, because she always has to complain about somebody being stupid/bitch/annoying and then when I go to my usually mind set, ""Well are you sure blah blah, didn't mean this this this"" She gets pissed. I mean her habits have grown on me a bit.
I don't really like ESTJ's in positions of authority-(my mom is one).
I like having conversations on an equal level of listening and respect to every comment and she always comes into it with a preconceived idea of everything and never really looks/listens to my POV till way after the fact(we are talking anywhere from ~48 hours to ~5 months).  It's frustrating because it doesn't get anything done. I don't respect people like that, because they are unwilling to grow.
No, we tend to hate authoritative/powerful STJ's, but enjoy having STJ's around to keep us focused.
I'm an ENTP, but my Fe is pretty strong/developed and before my roommate my Si was nowhere to be found."
1304,estj,"Yeah it's fairly common, but apparently ISTJ is moreso, Florence Welch has an ISTJ manager and good friend that basically keeps her together (not romantic though idk). Susan Cain's husband is likely ESTJ. A lot of my good friends have been STJs too."
1305,estj,"Ayo!  Male ENFP here.  I recently just got into a relationship with an ESTJ and I realized that she is exactly the opposite of me.  It's painfully obvious in our conversations yet somehow, I enjoy it so much.  I literally have her figured out to the point of all I have to do is think the opposite of what I'd normally say/do and bam!  that's what she's thinking/doing.  Obviously this is not to say that you are a simple bunch ;)
But my real question is have any of you ever been in a relationship with an ENFP and if so, what would you say are some tips to make it work?  "
1306,estj,"My mom is an ESTJ and my dad was ENFP.  Also, 4 of my best friends over the course of my life have been male ENFP's.  I'm an ISTP, and we have an excellent cognitive relationship.
The same is true with you and an ESTJ.  You guys are activity partners in socionics terms, meaning that your top two functions are her bottom two and vice versa.  So inasmuch as you guys are very different, you can communicate quite effortlessly, and literally complete each other, cognitively.
The key would be to allow yourselves and each other to be who you are and  benefit each other.  She'll provide structure and data and logic that you have a harder time seeing, and you'll show her possibilities, help her get in touch with her values, and help her go with the flow a bit more.  "
1307,estj,"You know, this guy is the first to educate me about the 4 sides of the mind, i always understood the concept of ego and shadow, but subconscious and superego? It makes sense if you consider the potential for maturing the weaker functions, you would behave like you inverted your function stack if you focused on using them."

1309,estj,"I‚Äôm pretty sure Hermione is an ESTJ. 
And I see Leslie Knope as one too. People say esfj but I think she‚Äôs just an extra positive ESTJ. But I could be wrong. I just don‚Äôt see esfj and I know it‚Äôs a character which they can make however they want. 
I also always saw Brennan from Bones as an ESTJ. 
Which just leaves me with me with 3 fictional characters who are extremely different from each other but I somehow relate to stronger than anyone else. 
But what brings them all together and makes me believe ESTJ is their work is always the most important thing to them. And that‚Äôs why I believe it‚Äôs ESTJ. Other than Leslie they aren‚Äôt as social but our extroversion allows us to work long hours without burnout and that‚Äôs why I think we are so hard to type. We will work 50-60 hours a week no problem but getting out to go out and be social and party just doesn‚Äôt interest us the same. Unless it‚Äôs work related in which case it makes Leslie even more likely. Everything she does is revolves around her job. 
It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt enjoy being social and usually once I‚Äôm done with work I make sure to give those most important to me my utmost attention and leave work at work. But at the same time if work calls I can still show up and I usually will want to. 
Honestly I can see how they might be typed differently but I still believe they are all ESTJ. "
1310,estj,"That's a fair question.
I use my instincts based on my secondary Si function as an ESTJ. This works better for some types than others. With ESTJ, it's most likely to get ESTJ confused with ISTJ.
As a fan of Socionics, I reinforce it with relationship analysis with other characters.
With ESTJ specifically, I can compare their thought processes with my own."
1311,estj,"I don't know any of this well enough to give feedback. I do want you to clarify for Harry Potter characters whether you are talking about the books, movies, or both.
Hermione as ESTJ would surprise me mostly because I got different impressions from other people. Now I'm curious."
1312,estj,"Books. Maybe both I don‚Äôt think her character was all that different and she really embraced her role. 
Hermione taking extra classes and being as involved as she was and staying on top of everything the way she did could only be achievable by a Te Dom. And that sort of organization is Si. 
She had a plate full and it never got in her way. It never stopped her from helping Harry and it never hurt her performance. It‚Äôs what gave her life meaning it pushed her. And I find that difficult circumstances are what drive ESTJs the most. 
People often say introvert but her snobbiness is an underdeveloped Te. But as much as it might have hurt her when others called her out she took it like a champ. She was able to recover quickly and move past it. She didn‚Äôt think it was worth dwelling over. 
she was never one for revenge if anything everything that went against her pushed her even more. But again ESTJs can take wrong doings against them really well but when it‚Äôs done to those they care for they want revenge and they want to protect and stand up for them. And her forest scene with Umbridge is a good example of that. 
And advocating for the Elves was a great example of our fi. 
Granted I read the books a few years ago but I see her as ESTJ better than any other type. "
1313,estj,I also think Professor McGonagall is an ESTJ (a quick google search backs up my thinking). She is a leader throughout the books and definitely has a strict sense of right and wrong and will defend those values. She isn't afraid to discipline but she also has a strong sense of morality in those decisions.
1314,estj,"Hey everyone! Given the small number of posters here, I'm only vaguely hopeful I'll get a response, but it's worth a shot to see what the ESTJ hivemind can tell me. 
I'm an ENTP woman. I've been married to my ESTJ husband for about 10 years. 
We've been, in very stereotypical fashion, arguing about his driving for a loooong time. Years even. He's an insanely aggressive driver. If someone is going slower than he wants to go, it's not just that he has to pass them, but he has to do it with this super over-the-top ""I'll teach you a lesson!"" flourish of speeding up dramatically and then nearly cutting them off. He's constantly gesturing at people, flashing lights at them, tailgating, speeding up to prevent people from changing lanes, laying on the horn if someone doesn't change lanes fast enough. It's like he has to correct everyone on the road, but his version of correcting them is terrifying everyone around him, including his lovely wife (me). 
I know what you're going to say. ""Why don't you just drive if he's so bad?"" The problem with that is twofold: 1) He insists on driving; 2) When I drive (and I am objectively a far safer driver than he is) he badgers me about my driving style constantly, I think in an effort to get me back for my comments on his (actually terrifying) driving. Sometimes I grin and bear it and do the driving anyway, but it's not a solution for when I'm not in the car with him or when he really does need/want to do the driving. 
Anyway, after years of telling him his driving was problematic, he finally got pulled over and summoned to traffic court for which we had to hire a lawyer and pay about $1,000. I felt like after this experience, he had finally realised that his driving is not okay. And for a brief moment, he seemed to change. 
But now he's back to his old ways. I've tried appealing to his sense of moral duty by telling him what he's doing is breaking several traffic laws and if he gets pulled over again they'll take his license. I've tried telling him it scares me and makes me worried for my safety and his. I tell him it makes him less attractive. I've told him that he can't control everyone's behaviour on the road and to focus on himself not others. I've tried not saying anything. I've threatened to call the police on him. I'm seriously at my wits end. 
What would resonate with you guys that I haven't already tried? And, like... are you guys all this obstinate and focused on correcting other people? I've noted this need to correct is a theme, not just in the driving, but in a lot of other areas of his behaviour. Sometimes it's good and makes sense, other times it results in crazy terrifying manic driving. "
1315,estj,"Female ESTJ here. 
I'm not sure how much of this is ESTJ behavior and how much of it is just him being a jerk. 
I guess I can see why he would want to cut people off with a dramatic flourish (not your exact words, but you get what I mean), but for me, I feel like the potential extreme danger of doing stuff like that outweighs the ""ha! I sure showed that guy!"" effect. "
1316,estj,"Does he have any healthy ways to relax? ESTJs put so much stress on their duties, they sometimes need to be told it's normal to vent in a healthy way. Talk to him and see if you can get the creative juices flowing for some projects he can work on. Anything that can give him the sense of control he likes, without harming others."
1317,estj,"I had an estj boyfriend who had a terrible road rage. If anybody cut him off or drove too slowly, he would get very angry. Also, if anybody drove too closely to our car, he would feel really mad and say some bad words at them in our car. 
I always thought of his behavior as hyper-protective, meaning his reactions were over the top because he felt threatened by these cars and needed a way to get past/solve it.
I also think driving must be one of those annoying situations for estj's because practically nobody on the road is under his control. Lack of control triggers all the emotions from an estj...
I'm sorry I don't have an answer, but as this is your husband of ten years, maybe the best way is to challenge him other ways. Like make this into a game/competition that he needs to conquer... Ive been told that when you want a man to do something, make it into a tangible game of something me sort, haha.. good luck!"
1318,estj,"Admittedly, I did make my husband sound like an asshole, didn't I?
I'd say he mostly isn't, but he has this innate focus on what's ""right"", and I think when it comes to the driving he doesn't consider what he's doing unsafe. Of course, he thinks he's in control. 
Is the ""I showed that guy,"" effect something that you periodically feel, and under what circumstances? "
1319,estj,"Good suggestion...
He wants to redo our patio, and I've been against it since I think it's too big a project for him. But I've decided to let him run with it. Maybe it will give him an outlet? Hopefully he doesn't destroy our backyard. "
1320,estj,"I married one, so I at least like that one quite a bit :)
In general i like the INFPs that see the good in the world and are generally happy people. 
There are other INFPs that strike me as just having bad attitudes and I really want nothing to do with them.
I like spending time with INFPs for recreation.  I think dealing with an INFP professionally or for business would be very frustrating."
1321,estj,"I'll flip your question just for fun:
INFP here. Brother is ESTJ. When we try to interact directly it gets a bit strenuous. But just having him around makes me feel cared for and protected. I like how confident he is when he engages with the world, and I usually don't disagree with him I just don't have the same interests."
1322,estj,"Hey ESTJs, :)
I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project. 
I am happy to share with you guys the last video of the series:
(Sorry that it took so long) :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEJJJUDR9Sk
I think I will create some more MBTI stuff in the future (so stay tuned :)
because it I had a lot of fun creating these videos and I love the theory.
I really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think!
Enjoy! :)"
1323,estj,"Hey hey, :) 
I know that the INTP - ESTJ pairing is debated in many forums and it is also highly debated in my INTP video. (I even have to delete a comment from time to time because of that - lol)
I think it was David Keirsey in his original book "" (1984) please understand me (Part1)"" who listed the INTP + ESTJ pairing as one of a few ""ideal"" matches, and I think in his second book he changed his mind about his first ""natural partner"" theory but I am not 100% sure.
There are also ressources like the MBTI compatibility chart:
http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/13/03/a1/1303a1988541e3026f3dae1664a2a3b0.jpg
or personalitypage.com, etc, etc:
http://www.personalitypage.com/ESTJ_rel.html
that also lists INTP + ESTJ paintings as an ""ideal matches""
and lastly one of my best friends is an INTP and is happily married to an ESTJ woman, so I thought it would be nice put this into the video.
Thanks for your feedback! "
1324,estj,"I tested ESTJ on every test I could find online. I was wondering if hedonism is a common trait among us. The only thing I care about in life is making lots of money and having as much pleasure as possible, eating the best tasting foods, owning luxury cars and new homes, experiencing new sports and activities, going to as many countries in the world as possible, spending everyday happy..etc.
I'm also extremely materialistic, I don't care much about having a family or having family values or contributing to society at all, I just want to live life for myself and doing everything so I have zero regrets when I die, that's all"
1325,estj,"Interesting. I'm not sure if these are necessarily traits of a typical ESTJ. What you're describing reminds me a bit of an enneagram 7, actually. Do you feel like you can relate to any aspect of the description below?
‚Äã
‚Äã"
1326,estj,"I tend to prefer optimizing a chosen experience - quality over quantity. I try to find the best way to do A thing rather than trying all the things. 
If anything, I probably need more hedonism in my life. My idea of a regret is a mistake made out of impulsivity rather than missing out on something because I‚Äôve made a ‚Äòsafer‚Äô choice.
But I have no idea how typical that might be."
1327,estj,"What's important to you in a woman (other than, obviously, physical attraction)? 
Or could you give me your insight into your preferences based on the following list? Are any of these deciding points?

Feminity - how much?
Passive vs. Assertive 
Introvert vs. Extrovert
Intelligence/education
Spirituality 
Job/pay/ambition
"
1328,estj,"MBTI doesn't go too much into this, it'll vary from person to person. Socionics delves into it a bit, however, though you have to keep in mind that an ESTJ in MBTI will most likely, but not definitely convert to an ESTj in Socionics. An ESTJ will sometimes be referred to as an LSE in Socionics (L as the first letter means logic [thinking] first, S means sensing second, and E means that the dominant function is extroverted).
Here's a link outlying the four different ""romance styles"". ESTJs are under the caregiver category: http://www.sociotype.com/socionics/romance-styles/
If you're curious, though ESTJs will typically share interests with and hang out with mostly STs, the theorised ideal partners are NFPs, especially INFPs. Other STJs are also good, but there won't be much room for development and they might get bored.
EDIT: I should also tell you that if you delve deeper into Socionics, some of it seems kind of, uh, strange, I guess? It's less accessible than MBTI for sure, and a lot of writing on it may make you say ""I guess that makes sense but what the hell"". Maybe you won't have the same experience I did, but it certainly threw me off for a moment. I don't know if this is clear, but if you do have the same experience as me, you'll understand what I'm talking about when you see it for yourself."
1329,estj,"I'm an INTP female. I am going to say, based on my observations, that nothing would make an ESTJ man happier than seeing his woman become the embodiment of all the advice or instructions he has given. When he has successfully ""developed"" her into someone he perceives as better, he would feel that his project has succeeded and he has made a better person out of her. Then, he can enjoy the fruits of his labour - a woman who is very much the way he would like her to be. 
Naturally in today's feminist world, this is like blasphemy to some women. But, I guess if you don't like it, you can just find another man. You can observe this phenomenon with many ""rich mens' wives"" - the wives become the embodiment of everything their husbands consider to be attractive or feminine, down to every piece of clothing and every dramatic wrist movement. The woman is sometimes ""transformed"" so much after meeting the man that she is barely recognizable. But depending on her personality, she also happens to be at her happiest, and is not at all upset by the huge changes she has undergone, because she personally prefers the polished woman she has become. "
1330,estj,"I guess you mean in a romantic/sexual relationship?
In a partner it is stability. Someone who can maintain the course without going on a spontaneous rabbit hunt.
In a lover it is excitement. Good sex, witty conversations and conflict.
If I put my romantic preferences in MBTI terms, then it is: EJ "
1331,estj,"Hi, I'm a 25M ENFP who is dating a 20F ESTJ. She has been gone for about 4 weeks at a summer training program, and I am planning to drive out to visit her this weekend. 
Some background - we are both from a fairly conservative Christan setting, and have individually committed to be celibate until marriage. We have been dating for about 6 months now.
I just got a nice card in the mail today (we snail mail each other on occasion) that just said that she feels nervous that I am coming to visit and she is afraid she won't be a good host for me, in basically so many words. I thought it was very sweet, but I'm a little confused as to what she is trying to accomplish by sending this - obviously it was important enough to her to go to the bother of going to the store, buying a card, and mailing it to me.
What are some things that would motivate an ESTJ to go to so much effort just to share something like this?"
1332,estj,"She is explicitly telling you her feelings. That's pretty nice of her. Believe her, don't look for subterfuge. Reassure her that you are sure you'll have a great time because all you care about is seeing her and being with her. Like you said, it was effort for her to do this, reciprocate with some emotions. "
1333,estj,"The ESTJ does not know how to optimize towards a goal, for not everything is optimizable yet it is the ESTJ's instinct to try to optimize with Te.
This is really a Fi thing, but Fi often finds an outlet via Te, (they are each other partner after all), but the normal Te outlets will not work for there is nothing to optimize.
Thus your girl has to find an outlet in another way and that is sharing her Fi feelings, and she wants you to acknowledge her Fi feelings and for her to feel seen, but at the same time do not rub her nose into it too much for she is feeling vulnerable and nervous.  Instead just hug her and say she is great / grand and then list a reason or two that she cares so much.  Let her know that she is seen both that you see her nervous feelings but you also see her in other things where she is less nervous, all her optimization, but sometimes ESTJs feel no one ever see them and all their caring and i tis this caring that drives them to optimize."
1334,estj,"Thanks, that's very helpful. I was a bit suspicious that this is what it is, but I wasn't sure. As an ENFP I am way more likely to have an ulterior motive for saying things like that, instead of just expressing my feelings outright. I will often do or say something indirectly to get the result I want to, often in a manipulative way (but not with malintent). Because of this, I am often unable how to decipher when someone is being really direct with me."
1335,estj,"As an ESTJ most of my close relationships are with introverts, other than my previous relationship that was with an extrovert I've never just been to fond of other extroverts. It's not that I don't like them, but most extraverts tend to push me away and turn me off (not in a sexual way).
I'm curious if this is just an individual trait that I have developed because I primarily hangout with introverts, or if other ESTJs feel the same way."
1336,estj,"I‚Äôve only dated introverts, so I suppose that I share that preference. When I‚Äôm with another extrovert, there‚Äôs a constant building of energy, like every topic is met with ‚Äòyes, and...‚Äô so it‚Äôs just more more more, revving each other up until one person cracks. Which can be fun, but also exhausting. With introverts, things feel steadier, and I can make a bunch of noise or just be chill. There‚Äôs more room to breathe. "
1337,estj,"Yeah I like Introverts a lot. Dating an INTJ and adore him. Also really good friends with INFPs and they are some of my favorites. 
I put my energy into work. So I don‚Äôt want my friends to be huge into parties and bars and stuff like that. It‚Äôs fun on occasion but not every weekend
 I like coming home and doing nothing or just chilling. And I like one on one interactions A LOT more than groups. Which is why I prefer to date introverts. "
1338,estj,"Hm that‚Äôs a good observation. I suppose you‚Äôre right. I do have a couple very good friends that are extroverts. But I think two ESTJs especially would butt heads. And ESTJs typically like to be leaders, so perhaps with introverts they feel more in charge or the outward leader/speaker of the group. And other extroverts could be seen as competition or something. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm explaining that well. "
1339,estj,"That is exactly how feel, that's crazy. To me it feels more natural around introverts because they don't tend to have that high energy. However, I will say the only thing that bugs me about introverts is that it's hard to get them to be in more extroverted settings, which can be a little annoying sometimes."
1340,estj,"I agree, I'm the same way. I enjoy going out, but I use the majority of my energy at work as well so going out occasionally is perfectly fine with me. I have three best friends two are INTPs the other is an INFP, I prefer hanging out with them because I like the low energy vibe. Plus, I'm usually the one who convinces them to get out of there comfort zone occasionally to do extroverted things which I genuinely think they appreciate. I think that is why we've been friends for 8+ years."
1341,estj,"My last relationship was with an extrovert, not exactly sure what her personality was because she didn't have the patience to take the test. She was low energy as well, but we both enjoyed the same amount of social time so it worked. Occasionally we would clash and need space though.
Have you dated an extrovert? If so, do you think you vibe with an introvert more?
I feel like conversations would be better with an introvert, but at the same time I enjoy doing things in social settings so I fear I would get bored too easy. Is that a problem you have faced in your relationship if you don't mind me asking?"
1342,estj,"I haven't really just came across another ESTJ personally and if I did I surely didn't know or pay attention. Anybody who is more extroverted than me usually doesn't catch attention, it's mostly the quiet ones that intrigue me."
1343,estj,"I work with an ESFJ and I fucking love her. ESFJs in general are hilarious and super goofy. I feel the most comfortable being myself around them and not feeling dumb or too mean. 
My dad is ESTJ and we get along really well. 
I also kinda like ENFjs. Sometimes they get a little too opinionated about stuff but otherwise lots of fun. 
Worked under an ENTJ and it was hard but I had a lot of respect for her because she worked VERY hard. She expected a lot from me but sometimes I‚Äôd come into work and she would still be awake from the day before finishing a project. Still friends today. 
EJs are good. I don‚Äôt mind them. EPS on the other hand...."
1344,estj,"Never dated an extrovert. I don‚Äôt even know if I have gone on dates with many either. I always find myself around introverts. 
Well we‚Äôre long distance but I‚Äôm finishing school and he‚Äôs military which already makes things hard but we actually do okay. We are both so focused on work and or school that I‚Äôm not so bored or lonely that I need his attention. 
Honestly the relationship is too new to really say. 
I am work besties with an ESFJ and I gotta say we have the best conversations. I enjoy conversations that aren‚Äôt so damn deep all the time. Let‚Äôs just talk about life and our opinions on stuff. And esfjs make that so easy and fun. While others criticize it I love it. But I couldn‚Äôt date them. They do have more energy than me and sometimes it‚Äôs too exhausting. "
1345,estj,"Hi there. Male INFP. I study visual arts, and my hobbies are composing music and writing stories, so all the common places that I visit are full of FPs. Specially ISFPs. Seriously I want to meet an ESTJ girl, they seem very different. I think I'm missing someone like that."
1346,estj,"Girl here, ESTJ. I am a graduate school student at a large university. I do yoga and exercise at a spin studio. Maybe try on campus or at the gym? I also like to check out the local art museum, dance groups, cocktail bars, coffee shops, the farmers market..."
1347,estj,"First, gather the following materials:
- 3 chicken feet, harvested with a silver knife under the full moon
- 5 black candles 
- a stick of white sidewalk chalk
- dried sage
- a well worn copy of Catcher in The Rye
- 4 iron nails 
Arrange the candles in a circle, with the nails equally spaced between them. Put the chicken feet in the middle of the circle and cover them with the dried sage. 
Sit at the southwest edge of the circle, put your underpants on your head, write ""Bob is a fishmonger, sheep are heavier when they're  wet"" in front of you in sidewalk chalk, light the candles, burn the sage and then open the book to page 87 and hold it upside down.
Sneak a look over the pages at your amassed crowd of intrigued  and confused onlookers. The ESTJ woman is the one calling the police."
1348,estj,"ESTJ guy here.
I'd guess the beach, gyms, parks, farmers markets, coffee shops, and hobby groups.
I've met a few ESTJ girls at my church, and in fan groups / conventions (anime, My Little Pony, nerd music)."
1349,estj,"If my ESTJ gf is any good indication: 
at work, working out, out with friends or decompressing on the couch binging some nostalgic series on Netflix.
So my guess, the gym or sports club would my guess. It is the one screaming everyone should take it more seriously and work harder :)."
1350,estj,"I am an ESTJ married to an INFP. It's a great pairing in many ways, but also can be difficult since we are (obviously) so different. We fought the most at the beginning of our relationship as we were getting to know each other. Everything about how we process & value information, how we communicate, what we prioritize, etc. was just so different! But once we learned to value & appreciate that, we became a strong team. We have always had great chemistry & have now been married 10 years, have 3 kids, and manage multiple businesses together. Where to look? Work, business school, community events, meetings, charitable boards....."
1351,estj,"ISTP here. Met my ESTJ gf in church, she likes working in the administration and loves graphic design as much as I do. They‚Äôre everywhere in small businesses or HR. If you‚Äôre into that night life, they are typically in a group of all other women and no men."

1353,estj,"My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.
It would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. 
There would be NO ""tell the person how you feel"" or ""just be yourself"" or ""love yourself at your size"", feeler advice. 
Just cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. 
So I'm taking a survey. 
How many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? 
Additionally....
We are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)
Our test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. 
Of course, your identity would remain anonymous. 
You can send a letter here.

I think I am on the order of very extroverted. Very outspoken conservative I am very conservative. fundamental Christian, that‚Äôs the closest I could think of to describe Christianity. 
I live in California.
In recent weeks, I‚Äôve been viciously attacked in my political science class and a short time as the school‚Äôs political correspondent. As a 1w9 I feel I am a bit of a social changer, trying to perfect society, reform type of person. I am also very extroverted so I am not shy at all in voicing these views. My ISFJ teacher probably SP variant instict has been attacked too, but I feel more in danger because I loudly defend him and stand up for my views. It‚Äôs not like I can help it. I tell myself, not to, I semi-regret opening my mouth, but feel like I should. I open it or raise my hand naturally. 
If they were polite about things it would be different but these people are antagonistic, and on the attack. They get on my last nerves. I feel my 1w9 so and ESTJ just feels like speaking and telling them that their behavior is inappropriate. My SP stuff is arguing with that. I also currently fear my safety.
For example, last class, I went to drop a bunch of newspapers. A conversation started and I ended up lecturing them on what civil conversation and political debate was.
Any suggestions? If I was to be less opened about it how? What of my learnt urges to speak up, to give an opinion, debate, answer questions?
I also don‚Äôt get emotional, I feel like my FI has been triggered. Also,this type of situation make think I am some of introvert. I can upset and very to myself when I am not arguing with them or defending myself. I am like ultra cautious of myself, and don‚Äôt necessarily want to socialize. It‚Äôs pretty bad. I start feeling as if the world everyone could be like that. I also start to lose the ego in me. E.g. start to feel friendless, unappreciated, no one wants me. Ordinarily I am not like that. Occasionally mass drama can get me like this, but not as bad as this. "
1355,estj,"MBTI is just a guide to assessing your motivations and how you interact with those around you. You seem to be trying to follow it like a formula and explain everything you do through it. That's not how it works.
If you're going to actively engage in controversial discussions with your classmates, be prepared for people to disagree with you. That has nothing to do with you being Christian or conservative, it's just part of life that people will disagree with each other sometimes. If you don't like the people in your class, socialize with different people (join a club, or hang out with people from church, etc.)
Nobody likes someone who is constantly defensive and arguing. That doesn't have to do with your MBTI or your religious/political leanings. Consider why you feel the need to constantly defend yourself and why you are afraid for your safety and if those are accurate concerns. On the other hand, some people are just dicks and are going to be rude and antagonistic for whatever reason, and that's not about you in particular it's just what they do. If you don't like someone, don't waste energy being around them and letting them antagonize you. "
1356,estj,"Tbh, I only skimmed, but I think I get the gist. When Te-Fi  goes into an unhealthy place, it usually comes out as something like ‚Äòthe world should be (Te) the way I feel is right (Fi)‚Äô. Te gets dirty when it believes its Fi is fact. Fi gets dirty when it pushes its feelings onto other. That shitty ego-hit wanting-to-withdraw feeling is your Fi struggling with its perception of itself. Fi is a stubborn function, but in a healthy place, it remembers to allow others to have their own Fi, it leaves space for other people to be on their own path to betterment. Because Fi isn‚Äôt meant to be in charge of others; it‚Äôs meant to understand itself and leave others to do the same."
1357,estj,"Whoa! Okay! So I am defending when they attack first. And I don‚Äôt mean disagreement, I can handle that! This is I feel like I have to tear you down kind of deal. I am the sort of hey be polite kind of person. Regular disagreements is actually good. But vicious attacks and tearing down is not!"
1358,estj,"I think it‚Äôs mostly Te until it gets really bad situationally. Then I can get very much emotionally angry and outspoken, even more than usual, usually. Mostly defending and stressing conservative views especially if those are being severely under attack and tearing down. . It usually doesn‚Äôt happen.
Now the question is what to do, and how to deal with this. Others aren‚Äôt nearly as upset and attacked, probably because they‚Äôre much less outspoken. I score almost top on extroversion, and on the higher side."
1359,estj,"Right, in those moments it‚Äôs all about you. That‚Äôs your Fi. It‚Äôs focused on how you feel. Te isn‚Äôt the part of you that feels offended or attacked. It‚Äôs the part of you that see if things work or not. When you have these discussions without feeling that rise of something big and demanding in your chest, that‚Äôs when you‚Äôre in your Te. But that uncontrollable feeling of it, that‚Äôs when you know your Fi is involved. Our Fi is usually very ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô -situational, as you said - so it‚Äôs not good at doing the right amount of processing before it speaks up. It has tantrums and stamps its feet and wants what it wants right now. 
As far as what to do, recognizing when your Fi is involved is a good first step. But I have no magic wand for having healthy Fi. I struggle with it too. I just try to understand Fi and what it does and why. I find focusing on its healthy tendencies at least gives me something to aim for."
1360,estj,"And, when you feel like speaking out back, as I can very vocal, which was why I brought MBTI in to it. I can be very e and very vocal really quickly. It‚Äôs my natural tendency to raise my hand or to participate lots in class. It‚Äôs been a constant the last however many years I‚Äôve been in school, like, 20? My 7th year in University. Usually very little shakes my cool demeanor, but this has, this is how bad it has gotten. We‚Äôve reported it.
I can‚Äôt report to the teacher because he‚Äôs very aware, which why I brought him up, he‚Äôs probably under as much attack as I am, if not more. I‚Äôve also taken to correct them and say, respect him he‚Äôs your professor and no, he‚Äôs good. I took him because I know he‚Äôs a great teacher. 
They are even getting personal and saying to both of us and people who agree with him, or their perceived perceptions stuff like ‚ÄúYou should be fired‚Äù ‚ÄúYou are too political and is a bad teacher‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be teaching‚Äù
This is also effecting my mood severly, as I said ESTJ and very thinking based, but this has really depressed me, That‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say to that. I‚Äôve been doing worse, because I feel very disturbed with them.
I guess there‚Äôs a handful that‚Äôs been very quiet and they‚Äôve not been attacked because the attackers don‚Äôt where they stand, against or with them. I guess as a high extrovert I am trying to seek ways to be a little more out of the way, though the damage has been done."
1361,estj,"That‚Äôs true. Yeah,my extroversion has something to do with it too. I am way up there, usually test on the higher side like 62 percent on MBTI sometimes higher. ON the big fives I usually test highest 97 percent and usually above the 70 mark."
1362,estj,"ENFP here.  I am finding a pattern in my life that my longest, most fulfilling and most authentic relationships are with ESTJs.  Everything I read says we make bad pairs, specifically in relationships.  I am inclined to vehemently disagree assuming you have two developed / mature people.  I find that we really bring out the best in each other and are instrumental in becoming better versions of ourselves.  The way the internet talks about you guys,  you'd think you are monsters.  My ESTJs are the most loving people I know.  They show it through consistency, action and honesty intended to improve environments.
I love MBTI but I am curious about why everyone seems to think ESTJs and ENFPs could never have fulfilling relationships.  It has not been my experience at all."
1363,estj,"ENTP here. One of my best friends is an ESTJ. My dad is also an ESTJ.
Both seem to really value people in their lives who are smart, honorable and hard-working. Makes for a very good relationship because even though we don't at all see eye-to-eye on abstract issues and deconstruction of social expectations, we respect each other's strengths and I know how to meet their reasonably modest expectations.
But there is certainly a controlling, stubborn, rigid, self-obsessed, and overly-confident side to both of them which can really grind my gears. I can handle them in small doses. Hopefully most mature ESTJs aren't like the two I know."
1364,estj,"Look into Socionics. ENFP and ESTJ are considered Activity relations and those are some of the best intertype relations according to that theory because they share the same top 4 cognitive functions, in a different order.
And I'd have to agree with you... I am an INFP (INFj in Socionics) and the ex I miss the most is an ISTJ (ISTp in Socionics); we are also Activity relations. There was something about that relationship that was incredibly comforting, warm, and motivating. He got me accomplishing stuff like no one else ever did, and he didn't even have to say or do anything, I just wanted to be the best I could be for our relationship's sake. On his end, he also made several improvements to his life, creatively and career-wise. It's just a pity he was inclined to cheat and lie, otherwise we would still be together.
I've also been in a short 2 month thing with an ESTJ and it was a different energy (in Socionics, it's called Dual relations, ""supposedly"" the best relationship). Also comfortable, but I felt less inclined to rev up my inferior function usage because the ESTJ could take care of those matters. The best thing about that relationship was the mutual admiration of each other's natural strengths. It was attractive and cute to see him do his dominant Te function thing, and he appreciated my Fi. It was easy to see how we'd make a great team if we had the same vision. But it also felt a bit alienating, because Te and Fi are somewhat opposed to each other too. Whereas with my ISTJ ex, when we were together, we were often on the same wavelength (Si and Fi loop) so we could just BE and enjoy the same things without pushing each other too much to be what we were not, if that makes any sense. I should add that it was when we were apart that we'd be at our most energetic, separately tackling our individual goals and projects. When together, we just relaxed and it was wonderful."
1365,estj,"That's awesome. I was best friends with an ENFP and I honestly just stopped talking to her because the friendship felt so dead. 13 years and looking back I felt like I put way more energy into it than she ever did.  She was my number one and most important person and she treated me like I was nothing. She also threw me under the bus in my most vulnerable point of my life which eventually led to me living out of my car. 
I have another ENFP friend and we distanced after high school but have managed to make it work and I've been able to call her out on her shit and she tends to take it really well, but I've seen the same behaviors and patterns when it comes to that type. 
ESTJs don't take relationships lightly, even friendships.  I get that ENFPs are very bubbly and have tons of friends, but you need to be careful about the people you are interacting with.  ENFPs like to get involved with peoples personal lives and you make it very easy to open up, but then you tend to just disappear.  It has happened to me with every single ENFP I have ever met to the point where I ended up in therapy over it.  I have some severe abandonment issues, it wasn't just ENFPs, but they weren't doing me any help.
You know those friends that you can call or text and they will answer in 5 minutes even if it's to tell you they cant talk. Those people are Never ENFPs.  I've been in serious emergencies and it has taken some ENFPs 2 weeks to finally respond, some never do at all.  Who the hell would ever want to be friends with someone like that? My best friend is an INFP and that hasn't happened in 4 years of friendship, and we live 1500 miles away from each other.  
I'm ranting at this point, as I tend to get really worked up when it comes to ENFPs.  But if I have anything to say it's this.  ESTJs care about their people, and they don't take those relationships lightly.  If an ESTJ has chosen you, and you betray them, it's done.  "
1366,estj,"ENFP here; married an ESTJ.
Didn't look into MBTI until she had been introduced to it at work.
It's tough but can be very rewarding too.
You're right in that we have to both be mature about it to work and know when to act (not be) immature to lighten things up.
We can be a fantastic balance, but it is often a task to maintain that balance."
1367,estj,"Ahhh.  That is so incredibly on point with how I feel.  What I love though because what I experience is that my close ESTJs always mention loving the things about me that I love the most too & mention it often & I feel like the things I love about them, I am constantly telling them that I am in awe of which is always nice to hear.  It's nice to hear someone else compliment you in those areas you love about yourself from someone who encompasses strengths in areas you suck at.
funny about your ISTJ mention.  I love being managed by ISTJs.  They love the enthusiasm and effort I put into a job and appreciate that I recognize their sense of duty and work ethic so they tend to take me on as a bit of a project in helping me to improve my weaknesses.  When I revert to bad tendencies (overpromising, being distracted, etc) I can get a little nasty with them and then I feel horrible about that.  They are really nice people once you get in there and make them feel appreciated.
Thank you for sharing."
1368,estj,"I am Enfp and my ex is estj and I loved how we worked together. So much of what you're saying I relate to.
Yup that was the same for me. I made better choices for myself because I loved how proud it made her. She was full of praise and encouragement when I looked after myself, eg by getting an early night or walking up a mount, or cooking a healthy meal.
Yeah I adore my enfp friends but I think I must be an opposites attract type because I found it impressive (and sexy!) that my estj had skills I wasn't strong in, and vice versa. Like I loved how organised she was because I have to work at that. I found it hot that she was more math / logic minded than me. She loved the things about me she didnt possess herself necessarily (e.g creativity). "
1369,estj,"Now that you mention that, I have noticed a pattern of ESTJs emphasizing that they are positive people who like other positive, optimistic people. Which ENFPs are, if nothing else. :)"
1370,estj,"Yes!! I'm an ENFP and this is what contributed to me falling so hard for my estj ex. It felt so good to have someone see the qualities I am most proud of and compliment me on them a lot. It made me feel like, wow this person sees me as I am and loves and admires who I am. 
My estj told me she loved my kindness and that I ""love people who might not feel much love in this world."" She loved my optimism and open mind and creativity. She loved that I challenged her intellectually and helped her consider things she hadn't thought of before. Hearing all this from her felt so good. "
1371,estj,"Hi, I have a male friend (33) who was on an acid trip. I have always assumed him to be estj because of how hard he works, and how he barks at me but even though I have a sensitive nature, I have always felt he was trustworthy and does not mean any malicious intent. Anyway I have convinced him to take the human metrics test while he was on an acid trip and it came out enfp. 
‚Äã
My question is, is there a possibility that he felt and thought differently when he took the test cause of his trip? I had assumed mbti was failsafe even if you were a little bit stoned. I would've expected istj or estp to come out, but definitely he is far from enfp. I am infp and no way in hell the guy is enfp.
Thanks!"
1372,estj,"Suitability will vary from role to role, but generally, type doesn't matter when coming down to skill in any particular role. However, good leadership skills, communication abilities, ability to make decisions under pressure and a generally logical thinking pattern are valued skills in most roles, which are often traits assigned to ESTJs. They don't necessarily apply to you, but chances are they do."
1373,estj,"I don‚Äôt work in PR, but do work in a media agency. Everyone pushes and is excited by innovative, out of the box projects, just for the sake of being splashy and different, even if it isn‚Äôt the best use of budget. You have to be accepting of needing to do things that are inefficient or ineffective just because the client wants it. A lot of big brainstorm sessions made me feel out of place, critiquing everyone else‚Äôs big ideas while not really coming up with my own. Leadership, communication, organization, and being detail oriented made me good at the job, but I found it exhausting after a while. Most people I know working there are NTs or NFs (though I find NFs also find it unfulfilling after a while). I switched into an operations role in the agency and am much happier leading more of the logistics, improving processes, managing the portfolio, training new members, and making sure everyone is doing their job correctly and systems are running smoothly. I like being in the media world while being on the periphery outside of the people who are there looking for a creative outlet."
1374,estj,"I'm wondering how true this feels to all of you? Would you provide some examples if so?

1375,estj,"I take responsibilities so seriously that when outside influences change how I planned something might go I adjust quickly, inwardly beating myself up at the same time, but still.. I think constantly wanting to be liked and seen as competent makes for this rule following strength. I'm also able to prioritize really well. My boss seems to appreciate it. For example, an aspect of my job is driving people to a lot of different destinations on the fly. I get asked spontaneously to go to places I haven't been to in a few months. I'm super goal oriented so I like this. It makes me feel extremely good when I've accomplished what was asked of me in an ever changing job."
1376,estj,"Goals are for losers; systems are for winners.
http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102965026826/goals-are-for-losers-passion-is-bull
In some ways, this conflicts with the excerpt, but in some ways it matches. "
1377,estj,"First of all, thank you very much for taking the time to respond! I appreciate it.  =)
Would you prefer to be liked by the majority of people, or to be consistent in everything that you do?  The reason I am asking, is that sometimes upholding a rule might make you very unpopular.  How would you feel if the majority of your co-workers were often late (15-30 minutes)?
That does seem like a very useful trait.  =)"
1378,estj,"I have to say that I completely understand this sentiment.  Back when I used to work for a company that didn't stagger the shifts, I ended up waiting a long time to go home due to the tardiness of others.  I suppose it got me some overtime pay, but I'd rather have gone home."
1379,estj,"I am acutely aware of where others fall short. People often ask me to do things for them. Note that I sometimes view others' requests as their incompetence, but I like it because it gives me the opportunity to lead by taking care of the fine details. Sometimes its simply to be compassionate, but mostly it's my overwhelming desire to prove my competence in all that I do. All in all, I would love to be liked by the majority of people as much as possible, but I do see the benefits of holding others to a standard. I'm just more likely to walk with someone that is incompetent to lead them to competency than rat people out or nag people about rules."
1380,estj,"Disclaimer: I do not think all ESTJs are like this (that's why I'm curious to hear what you think.)
I've known this person for a few years (though on an acquaintance level). From what I've seen, he fits the cognitive functions of an ESTJ almost perfectly. The thing that surprises me a bit is how traditional he is. I know that with Si as the auxiliary function, of course he would be more mindful toward the past, but he seems extremely  grounded in traditional values and ideas. Just about every time we've had a conversation or I've overheard one of his on public transit, he judges whatever someone else says in terms of old English/Victorian moral standards and ways of living. For example, someone in a class we have together brought up the topic of women working in trades careers that are typically masculine jobs. This guy is not shy about talking in class, so he responded to this by saying that gender roles should be protected because that is what societies are built on, and that more women should be encouraged to stay home to have children. Being millennials, many other students said that he was being ridiculous and too traditional. Does this resonate with you, do you think this is common for ESTJs?"
1381,estj,"Doesn't resonate at all. 
Probably because I'm ESTJ, in a very male dominated career, in a very male dominated industry and I happen to have a vagina. I've been exposed to lots of fragile masculinity (that's actually what this is) and haven't really noticed that it's more prevalent amongst certain personality types in comparison to others. 
Your buddy is aspiring to the cultural imaginary of traditional values, not the historical reality of them, as a vehicle to excuse his misogyny. Under the traditional Victorian values of education and social mobility, it is highly unlikely that he would be in university at all. Presumably he's opted to neglect that. How does he feel about kidnapping brown people, forcing them to work on cotton plantations and occasionally lynching them? "
1382,estj,"My boyfriend is an ESTJ and, from the very beginning, he made it clear to me that he has duties in our relationship (his words, not mine) that tend to be on the more traditional side. However, that being said, my dream job is a predominantly male career, but my ESTJ is extremely supportive of me pursuing this career and maybe even more determined for me to achieve this goal than I am. I don't think ESTJ men are traditional in the sense that they think women can't or shouldn't be independent, but more in the sense that they have an innate desire to protect and provide for their families. "
1383,estj,"Yeah, actually.
As dumb as that all is, ESTJs rely on what they know to have worked best as a way to know what to do going forward. We typically stick with what we've determined to be the tried and true method. In this guy's case, it's gender roles. Doesn't mean he's right, just for him he's seen this to be the proper way and so he's going to judge everything going forward against this baseline.
edit: random character."
1384,estj,"Hello there ESTJs, just wanted to let you guys know I love you all as parents. 
I love my mother to the point I'd die for her. This woman has protected me, taught me valuable life skills, I've learned everything I needed to survive from my ESTJ mother. At times I've hated her bluntness, but over time I have come to appreciate it. I may silently seethe for a bit, but I've learned to think about what was said. I appreciate her honesty the most. 
As an INFP I know I was probably emotional and as a teen I was hard on her at times with my storming off and sulking. But man did I learn how to appreciate honesty and have grown thicker skin because of my mom. 
I swear as an INFP, I always see you guys as the smartest people I know. Dutiful, clever, no nonsense, intelligent, brave, and fun. 
I know there have been infp who hate their estj parents. But I remember when my mom would be strict about something I'd always think she was doing things for my protection and wouldn't think much of it. I swear you estjs are always right about people when it comes to a judge of character.
I have avoided some really effed up folks and situations by using my mother's advice. Also if you are an INFP who is reading this, just know that your este parents means well. They are protective parents, their honesty isn't to hurt you but again to protect you believe it or not. They don't see no sense in lying as it wouldn't be helpful to you and that the world will be much crueler in telling you the truth vs them. Also don't take things super personal. I know it's hard, but try to get out of our feelings for a bit. 
ESTJ parents with INFP kids, just be gentle and understand that we are sensitive. We feel things deeply. Its better to suggest things to us rather than set it as rule. And little bit of some independence. 
I swear me and my mom are very close.
The only parent I didn't get along with is my father (ENTP). I know daughter and fathers are supposed to have this ""close"" relationship. Nope he's cold hearted. Anyways love you guys (ESTJs) as parents. "
1385,estj,"My dad is an ESTJ and I‚Äôm an INFP. He is so overbearing, condescending, and cold, and has been my whole life. He won‚Äôt change. He‚Äôs the smartest person I know, and yet he‚Äôs still so emotionally blind. Yes, he does have other personal issues unrelated to mbti that have made our relationship difficult, but still.
Does he love me? Of course, he‚Äôs my dad. He would do anything for me. He just makes it so hard to want to be around him. He is so stubborn, and always has to be correct. He has to have the last word, always. "
1386,estj,"Saaaaaaaaaame. I would certainly love to encounter a mentally healthy ESTJ in real life just to experience the difference. Reading all of these positive parent stories makes me wonder if we're even talking about the same personality type. I am envious of all these wonderful positive experiences and simultaneously happy for you all. 
My dad and I clash so badly because he can be so stubborn and pigheaded. He refuses to empathize and is quick to play the victim. Things were great when I was a kid and ignored my own personality and desires and completely submitted to his definition of what I should be. He is also smart and thoughtful, and oh so flawed. His thoughtfulness was contingent on whether or not I was doing exactly as he wanted with my in my life. Up to middle school was okay, but home life was miserable in high school because of his overbearing and controlling personality. One time I was studying for an exam the next day and my car was messy. He came into my room to actively distract and yell at me until I cleaned my car. No amount of pleading would get the harassment and emotional abuse to stop until I did exactly as he wanted, regardless of my scholastic priorities. Everything was a contradiction, be great at school, keep your room insulate, keep your car immaculate, everything was an impossibly high standard.
High school was when I began to rebel and argued back. I called out every last little flaw. After a while, it just feel good to nonchalantly call BS. I found my power in my level-headed reason and gained control over my own life again.
We bicker, he eventually succumbs to frustration and devolves into personal attacks. Watching him always emotionally lose control and be the cause of all his own self-inflicted misery was sobering in childhood and I don't bother to listen to him complain about how all these relatives from our third-world country of origin only want his money. Plenty to spare for these relatives, but practically nothing for my tuition. I took on student debt, which he of course berates me for to receive a college degree he also would tell me I needed to survive. 
Graduation, moving away, and freedom from under his roof and control has never felt so good. "
1387,estj,"But the post was about how amazing ESTJ parents are. And then your barge in bitching about how awful yours is. 
Can‚Äôt just let someone compliment their parent. Gotta make sure we spread some negativity too. "
1388,estj,"Hi guys!
So far people are saying I'm ESTJ, I just want to see what you guys think. I've reposted my self description to different MBTI threads:
https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/8jpag9/am_i_a_lazy_ass_entj_or_something_else/
r/ENTP says I'm not ENTP. r/mbti says ESTJ. r/ENTJ says I'm some ISTJ or ESTP. 
I'm just very dissatisfied with how inconclusive most of the typing has been so far. I just want to confirm my suspicions that I'm ESTJ since that's what most people are saying.
I'm still available to answer any questions!"
1389,estj,"Looking over your posts, ESTJ seems like a good fit.
I see you asked questions quite a few times. We're very big on the Socratic method.
One good test between ENTJ / ESTJ is that ENTJ's will ramble on and I usually have to talk over them to say anything. ESTJ's tend to have more balanced conversation."
1390,estj,"They're all inconsequential, whichever you feel yourself drawn most to or you feel will help you grow as a person is the one you probably should identify as.
The first time I took the MBTI test I came up as an ESTJ, the subsequent tests I took came up INTP and the most recent actual ""official"" test I took came up with me being an ENTP. My point is, there's only as much stock in MBTI as you put in it."
1391,estj,"ESTP
First: your username alone is pretty aggressively not Te (and just as equally aggressively very Ti, so I started off pretty confident you were xxTP)
Also, I see a.) almost no indication of Te that isn't also Se, b.) no indication at all of Si (except you saying you dislike it), c.) very high indication of Ti and d.) very high indication of Se
From your other post:

Pretty much all I see from start to finish is Ti-Fe... ""annoyed"" at others, ""logical,"" ""meme lord,"" ""I do care about people and I refrain myself from cursing/yelling/etc.""
Se: ""going outside and exploring places,"" ""real world application,"" ""physical activity,"" ""the heat of the sun,"" ""camping,"" ""I get annoyed by pure theory... want to apply it to something useful,"" ""I can catch a dragonfly with only two fingers,"" and ""I signed into a competitive water polo team without knowing how to swim and now im still alive and can chuck a ball at your face""... are all very high Se, especially that last one
I don't see any indication of Ni, except ""I also have some kind of subconscious that tells me if I'm feeling good or not"" which is not a strong example of high Ni, and exactly the sort of way Se-doms talk about their Ni
I also don't get a strong indication of Si (and, on the contrary, you specified ""I dislike monotonous routine and use these to make me feel less bored (I get bored easily). Although I understand routine is part of life sometimes you need to break it to make yourself feel better... LOL"" which really isn't something an ESTJ would ever say.)
"
1392,estj,"LMAO, so I've been larping as an ESTJ this entire time? I took on the persona of being ESTJ for like idk half a month and no one questioned me so I just assumed I'm as ESTJ as it gets.
I've never had the thought of ever being ESTP I swear. I got typed by ""professionals"" aka admins on typing forums and get ESTJ so then I assumed the rest of it was true and that ESTJ was the answer."
1393,estj,"If I didn't have my username be that, I wouldn't think you would type me as XXTP. üòÇ
I suppose you have pretty good support but how would you know for sure I'm this type because some other guy said with about the longest essay why I'm ESTJ and so I just believed him. It's all the same with most of these typists and I find it difficult to believe them. On the other hand about my knowledge of ESTPs, I am not the stereotypical ESTP and I'm not annoying/boisterous/adrenaline junk addict Logan Paul boi. I'm actually quite reserved outside though I can bother to strike up a conversation when I want to. Might have been my upbrining/social anxiety IDK, but if you didn't know me you'd prob type me some kind of INTP or something. I'm not that impulsive either as most of the ESTP descriptions say they are, I actually think some time ahead of what I'm doing and what is going to happen.
I assumed the ESTJ description fit me because of the social part / future thinking stuff. "
1394,estj,"If you fight all the other ppl that claim otherwise and win, I will let you be the winnar
Also do you wanna see what this other guy, who wrote a long ass essay, said why I was ENTP? You can fight him like legit he wrote an essay I don't know what to say lmao"
1395,estj,"You're not an ESTJ, not based on what you consciously choose to say about yourself. But literally everything else. Your word choice, indesicion, overt playfulness, etc. ESTJ are fundamentally serious people, with a fun side that comes when they're relaxed/have free time. That doesn't describe you, does it? Most people make the mistake of discrediting MBTI because they think it's about how you ""feel"" about yourself or what you want to be/self-ideal. Your personality type is actually unconsciously expressed."
1396,estj,eh I suppose so you are right. I do have a playful side and I tend to push against the rules here and there when I feel like it. Whether playfulness is a tendency of a mbti type or not IDK it seems arbitrary to me. 
1397,estj,"My work life and home life have very different aspects of joking about.  Throughout both though, I'd say that just blatantly stating reality (or perhaps a slightly facetious version of it) at just the right time to get a laugh is my preferred method.  Most often, people do reciprocate, because most often I'm around like-minded people and rarely does it go over their heads.  When I do present that dry humor to some other people I know (like family) they usually just take it at face value and/or seem confused until I tell them ""it's ok, it's a joke"" and then we can all laugh about it.
Only example I can think of right now is when my daughter shouted, ""I don't care!"" at the top of her lungs and stormed off during a work/friends party, it kinda caught everyone off guard for a second.  My boss and I looked at one another and he said, ""I don't think she cares,"" and went back to drinking his beer.  That was a good laugh all around.
As for being socially awkward as a kid, definitely, even if I didn't realize it then.  I look back and definitely cringe at things I did. It took me until adulthood to realize that I had little to no friends as a child; something I attribute heavily to my parents' style of... parenting.  Causation? Correlation?  I don't know.  I know I had a singular friend I preferred to spend time with and no one else from elementary school until I was almost out of high school though.  I didn't like social gatherings, pep rallies, formals, or just dealing with other people in general.  It was just easier to do my own thing."
1398,estj,"very socially awkward, but even when people hated me they couldn't resist my sense of humor.
we joke with all systems go balls to the wall both barrels ernesty at all times. very vigorous and loud. our sense of humor is amplified by groups which we will gravitate to the center of....unles there is anotehr funny man in the group in which case we will fight for dominance and one of us will absolutely be leaving that circle of friends sooner or later"
1399,estj,"There's an estj guy at my workplace who joked with me just as you described and his joke completely went over my head. I felt bad because I can tell he was being a little vulnerable. He also mentioned to other people that he doesn't like interacting with people at parties and he was really awkward with me at first. I would say ""hi"" and he'd run away. So the fact that he tried to joke with me and open up to me while I just said ""huh?"" makes me feel bad... How do I respond to his jokes? I genuinely don't get them but I don't wanna question him and make him feel awkward or fake laugh..."

1401,estj,"Step 1 is recognizing that when something is said almost unnecessarily, it may very well be (probably is) a joke.  Appropriate response is (probably) identifying recognition of the joke through a similar response.  Conclusion of the shared joke is as simple as a smile.
Example: My coworker couldn't get a word document to format the way he wanted.  He tapped his mouse extra hard on the table and said, ""I cannot get this damn thing to work."" JOKE I looked over the cubicle divider and said, ""Maybe you should try replacing your mouse battery.""  RESPONSE He laughed and nodded his head knowingly, saying, ""It has been a while since I've done that; you may be right.""  CONCLUSION He cracks another short laugh at the end of his response, I smile and perform my required sharp-air-out-the-nose laugh and we go back to work on whatever it was we were doing.
So, in this example, I knew what the problem was because he'd been complaining about it, but by tapping the mouse extra hard and then saying he couldn't get ""this thing to work"" he left it open to interpretation and I suggested, facetiously, that he change his 'mouse battery'.  Knowing full well what had just transpired, his only option was to go with it and we shared the joke before moving on.
So, reading over what I just typed, we sound lame as fuck...  The reason it works for us (me and the people I interact with daily) is because we spend more time with one another than we spend with our families and we get one another.  It works with my dad because he doesn't take anything so seriously he can't laugh at it.  I definitely understand your response to the joke though.  When someone approaches me this way, but I don't understand the reference they used, I have to ask for clarification and they often won't give it because now the joke is ruined.  That doesn't happen often, perhaps because we're all equally stupid, but it also occurs if I don't hear what they said and have to ask and I often just left being the one laughed at by everyone else involved.
If you want to approach him on a friendly basis to reassure him he's not being put out, ask him to explain something to you.  It needs to be something he does for work (or an advanced hobby) and that he does well, preferably REALLY well, like he's the subject matter expert of that thing.  It'll get him focused and also bolster his confidence and ego, he won't be inclined to run because that's his comfort zone, and you can use it to segue into any other conversation you want to have with him.  However, be prepared to listen and/or talk about that thing for as long as it takes to be explained and have a reason for asking or he'll be put out when it seems like you're just testing him or making fun of him potentially.  
Also, this may seem silly, but when you see him at a party or something, say hello and compliment him in some fashion. I know it seems shallow, but it'll make him relax regarding social interaction.  Not over the top, just small will do.  Like, ""Hey anon, nice shirt,"" and then present attention to his response.  Or ""Hey anon, I heard those TPS reports you turned in were better than mine.""  If you're not inclined to date or be interested in him beyond that, continue to reference your relationship with him as a working one (regarding speaking to other people) and don't leave it open to interpretation.  ""This is anon, he's a co-worker of mine,"" for example.  It's likely he values working relationships just as much as personal, non-working relationships due to his low-interpersonal inclinations.  He just won't (probably, everyone is different mind you) attempt to create a personal relationship out of a strictly working one."

1403,estj,"My father is an ESTJ and he can be quite choleric. I'm assuming it's because life has been tough, he may even have mild depression (he doesn't care about his health at all). 
At his worst I can best described him as a narcissistic parent. At his best he is the ultimate provider and hard worker who will lend a hand to anyone in need. 
Naturally as his adult child, and ENFP, I care about his health (both physically and mentally). But I doubt modern  (tell me your issues and feelings) psychology will do anything for him. For me it works wonders. My dad is an Alpha-Male who has to keep a tough exterior at all times (even though he's gooeyer than me deep down inside). He doesn't believe in therapists. He considers himself a REALIST, even though I see it as pessimistic. 
What are healthy ways to get my father to cope with his issues? Something that won't emasculate him (he's old school)."
1404,estj,"As an ESTJ and a mental health clinician, the thing that pulls me out of a slump the best is doing something that is physically challenging. Training on a punching bag after a challenging day at work does wonders for me.  I also love getting together with a small group of close friends so we can all talk and cut loose for a bit.  One one of my biggest challenges is that I take most things way too seriously and need to just have some fun once in a while."
1405,estj,"I always try to do something to improve myself, or at least my image of myself. For instance I'll run, or work harder on the job, study or read, or plain just listen to a song that gets me pumped. It helps when an ESTJ feels useful. It's funny you're an ENFP because my father's an ENFP as well."
1406,estj,"Agree with the physical challenges. Or just trying to be social with my close friends or family, though sometimes it's still not enough to pull me out of my own mind. But like mentioned, doing things to improve my work or further my goals or something... That does help. And music, definitely."
1407,estj,"I deal with the depression by finding the root cause and figure out how to either:
A) Eliminate it
B) Avoid it
But this analysis and decision can take months/years. He isn't going to seek professional help because he has likely analyzed it himself and found the cause. He just doesn't know what to do about it."
1408,estj,I'm an INFP and I just wanted to say that I love your type. You are my favourite (other than my own). You just care so much and are so strong. Others may see you as harsh and pushy but all I see is how much you care and it's the sweetest thing. 
1409,estj,"You‚Äôre the sweetest thing, OP. I can‚Äôt speak for all ESTJs, but I really am trying to help people and have realized lately that what I do isn‚Äôt always interpreted that way. I really don‚Äôt mean to come across as cold or bossy, I‚Äôm just passionate about doing what makes the most sense. Learning to balance that passion with showing respect for other people‚Äôs viewpoints is something I‚Äôve been working on lately. "
1410,estj,"That's what I feel is the most similar between us. Our passion for doing what we think is the right thing in our own way. You express yourself directly in a practical way, I use other means to do it. You know we can make quite the team If we put our differences aside. We could take over the world. "
1411,estj,"I want to do it through writing, I've written many stories, for games, movies, and novels that express specific emotions or ideas I want people to hear, or even sometimes for my own mental well being. "
1412,estj,"JRR Tolkien was one of the most influential writers for me, and people think he was an INFP. I think there would be less art and beauty for the sake of beauty in the world if everyone was as fiercely pragmatic as I am. 
I‚Äôve gotta be honest, both my father- and sister-in-law are INFPs, and I can only take them in smallish doses, in large part due to personality differences. What do you wish ESTJs would keep in mind about INFPs, knowing that we‚Äôre both very passionate types but with completely different values? "
1413,estj,"Even though we have different values, we can easily inspire each other, I'm sure a lot of your perspectives on the world may have been shaped by your sister and father even though they can be so intense with how they express them. I hope ESTJs understand how sensitive INFPs actually are and how we see the smallest things you wouldn't think about. Which is probably something you can get annoyed of. We can seem like we are being completely over the top about something and you may think we are being crazy, but we would only ever go that crazy when we love you so much. I also wish you would engage more intimately with us because we kind of need that a lot. We have our boundaries but we love being loved, and to be told that. Even if our reaction to it is defensive. Also the biggest thing is to not underestimate us. We can be fucking badass, which is the time your type probably likes us most. I think an INFP and ESTJ relationship is one of the best. The support and push you guys can give (if you agree with the INFPs idea) can really bring it out to the world and make a real difference. And the deep emotional thinking that we do can really support you in the right ways to make you feel the best you can. I just really fucking love you guys lol you are like our perfect guardians and protectors. "
1414,estj,"Thank you. Also I can feel what I think you can be to us, it's harder for me to feel what we could be to you. Although I feel that we can be gentle and intimidate supporters for you. Pretty much your emotional guardians. Trying to make sure you are happy and to defend you from emotional harm. "
1415,estj,"Dear ESTJs,
So I've been in an awesome relationship with an ESTJ girl, amazing. Hard working, disciplined, funny, straightforward. And more features I really admire. 
But,... not so adventurous. I for one, as an ENFP, am curious as shit! I have learned my gf to open up more on a emotional level, although I do respect her more closed nature in this. But I want her to share her sexual interests as well. It seems this is very hard for her. We do make small steps. But still, I think there are hidden desires, she has a hard time expressing.
How can I help her express/open up her self more in this regard? Without disrespecting her boundaries ofcourse. 
Thanks :)! "
1416,estj,"MBTI aside, I think many men think that we women have some unshared sexual desires or some fantacies, but.. many of us... just don't... haha. I wouldn't expect to get a lot out from her verbally if she is one of these women. I certainly am, and I think I might even feel a bit pressured if I were asked about it since I really wouldn't have an answer hahaha
Sometimes making it about you is less pressure on her. Depending on the person, ehh.
I think you're on the right track, though, for wanting to communicate!"
1417,estj,"One thing I can think of is to make sure she feels very comfortable and not let her feel embarrassed at all. Don't make it seem like you're not satisfied so far, but want to explore new things together. And compliment her on what you've like so far, so then she'll feel more comfortable and more in control to do and want more "
1418,estj,"I'll be honest, as an ESTJ male I already have a tough time with intimacy and even just talking about sex makes me feel uncomfortable.. Imagining a female ESTJ go through something like that... sounds like a nightmare LOL..
I think using logic is one way to go about it, I mean logically we should be able to discuss sex! it's feelings that get in the way of that, so you could just bring it up by talking about past experiences , or stuff you like to do. It would make her slightly uncomfortable and that is where you have to find out what's wrong, and how to make it okay, acceptable.
Might not be the best advice though, think about it. Honestly I've not idea how to go about this. but I guess you gotta start somewhere?"
1419,estj,"A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?
Should there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?"
1420,estj,"As long as it's made very clear that you can opt-out, then I'd support automatically having your organs donated. In younger cases where they haven't had time to decide, I think that it would be better to not take their organs. I personally wouldn't give a shit if my organs were donated without direct permission, but some people might. I haven't heard any opinions on this subject, so I'd like to hear opposing view points."

1422,estj,"I know I can be too trusting at times because I‚Äôm willing to extend the olive branch of peace even when I know the person involved is kind of shitty.  I wouldn‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm oblivious to other people‚Äôs motivations as sometimes I‚Äôm willing to overlook motivations (at least at first) in order to preserve the greater balance/attempt to give them a chance to be better.  Sometimes that blows up in my face.
It‚Äôs also true that at times I‚Äôve been able to bring out/understand the more positive aspects of a person that is generally labeled as ‚Äúnegative‚Äù by others.  So oftentimes it can be difficult for me to demonize somebody when I can see where they‚Äôre coming from/the reasons why they do the things they do.  So I can at times be too sympathetic to people who don‚Äôt really deserve.
On the flip side of the coin I also have gotten a lot of shit before for not tolerating people who actually were complete assholes but we‚Äôre considered paragons of a specific community.
A lot of these issues arise not from an inability to read people at all I feel, but being able to read people too well in certian areas while still missing/purposely overlooking the warning sides because I can read their motivations/reasoning."
1423,estj,"Yeah but I don‚Äôt really see it as this horrible trait. 
I‚Äôve been hurt by people who took advantage of me and I‚Äôve been too forgiving at times but it‚Äôs not like I really care. 
When I realize I‚Äôm being used I just move on with my life and put my time and effort into those who appreciate the help I give. 
I‚Äôm not the revenge type. I truly just don‚Äôt care enough to want to get back at people who hurt me. You just become irrelevant to me. 
So many people get so caught up in wanting to hurt those who hurt them and you‚Äôre just wasting time
And energy on the wrong people. 
Focus on those who care and appreciate you. 
The best revenge is living your best life. Moving on and being happy. Not letting the hurtful actions of others destroy your life. "
1424,estj,"No, I think I‚Äôm decent at it. Most people are oblivious and self centered, so that‚Äôs an easy starting point. I‚Äôm oblivious and self centered too, so I usually don‚Äôt care what people‚Äôs motivations are or bother to think about it."
1425,estj,"Most ESTJS I know in real life are excellent at reading people's true motivations and are balanced with F. They make a great lie detector and good at managing people both emotionally and logically. It's funny because sometimes I'm providing logical feedback to them and they provide me with a useful emotional insight that help us work towards our goal, it almost makes me second doubt who is which lol (I'm an ENFJ). I can understand where the ESTJ stereotype come from as I've seen a minority, but most of them don't fit it. At least not the ones I meet in real life."
1426,estj,"I‚Äôve had the misfortune/educational opportunity to meet and interact with a lot of really shitty people. A sure sign of habitual duplicity in others is that it that it‚Äôs habitual. 
If they habitually shit talk other people behind their backs, the odds are good that they‚Äôre doing the same to you. If they can‚Äôt acknowledge when they‚Äôve made a mistake and try to blame it on some other circumstance or make themselves the victim, the odds are good that one day that circumstance or antagonist is going to be you. If they lie to others, the odds are good that they lie to you. 
You‚Äôre not going to get special treatment. If you associate with them, at some point, it will happen to you. 
Their motivations are almost always driven by their egos or some kind of personal gain. There‚Äôs really no need whatsoever to go into further detail than that. So, no, I don‚Äôt care if I can‚Äôt recognise or understand them. 
Learning to spot the behaviours is much more important than trying to figure out what drives them. 
Further, the if you‚Äôre not able to recognise the motivations of shitbags, it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not like them. It‚Äôs not a bad thing. "
1427,estj,"I never said it reflected poorly on one's character. I've said before I think ESTJs are innocent people, which is a loveable quality albeit frustrating because they project their straightforwardness on others (when they shouldn't). All of what you say is true BUT it's only one kind of shitty person. Specifically those who are also stupid. Those people are easy to spot. The problem is genuinely intelligent and sinister people who cover their tracks well, who say the right things...and have you support their cause (that if you knew what it was truly about, you would never support in a million years). "
1428,estj,"Let's say this. The ESTJ I know grew up belonging to a group of people that were heavily persecuted and killed in their home country and he lived in the middle of this violence. It is a very sensitive issue for him and he is passionate about stopping this violence. There are people who work for charities and other institutions that merely CLAIM to help these people. Maybe they will do so for PR reasons, but they are very skilled in crafting an image. They obfuscate their financial details, and it's not quite clear what they do on the ground (no evidence that their presence is even felt). He provides services for these institutions that have other motivations than helping the persecuted people, in fact they are likely complicit in harming them indirectly. He does not engage with criticisms of these charities at all. Everyone I've met who is associated with this ""cause"" shows a completely face to me than they do to him (because they need him for their image of having support from a member of this persecuted group, also translation services). When I've questioned those people about certain things that seem shady, they provide no answer. But to him, that's not proof of anything. Sure...but where there's smoke, there's fire. "
1429,estj,"Coworkers: INFJ 
Friends: INFJ = INFP. Both types are ok to be friends with. When they care they care a lot, except INFJs express it in the most gentle ways and INFPs tend to bury it deep for some reason. Maybe it has something to do with me interacting with them as an ESTJ.
Spouse: INFJ = INFP. Both require extra care and attention, INFPs a bit more than INFJs and a lot more confusing than them as well. Don't really have a preference on this one."
1430,estj,Perceiver vs. Judger really stands out in my experience. INFPs are more scattered and unsure when it comes to dealing with the outside world but internally they are structured and have an individual opinion on most topics. INFJs are the reverse: MBTI Type Differences: How to tell apart INFPs and INFJs - How to Tell Apart
1431,estj,"Hey guys! It's my first time on this subreddit. I'm an INFJ and I have an ESTJ friend. We get along very well. He's awesome, so I'm sure you guys are too! I'm curious to know how your interactions have been with INFJ's, how you perceive us, or any experiences you've had, whether positive or negative? Thanks in advance!"
1432,estj,I have a few friends that have either tested as INFJ or at least have the characteristics.  They're some of my best friends.  I'm borderline E/I.  I love talking with them because of how differently they prices information.  Most of my best friends are probably somewhere around that type (everyone drifts a little).  I would imagine they love hearing you talk.  Especially about things like how certain situations might make you uncomfortable and why.  Always interesting.  And it's definitely pleasurable to put that P into action and just confuse your J friends.
1433,estj,"I had a really close friend who was an INFJ. He was really fun to talk to, and had a lot of very interesting viewpoints on things. However, his viewpoints on issues we both felt mattered, were drastically different, and being the strongly opinionated J's we are, we didn't see eye to eye on a lot of topics.
A little self absorbed, but overall a great, empathetic friend."
1434,estj,"OP, not sure if you wrote that, but if you did, I recommend proof reading it. Secondly, not every extrovert is like this. We love to talk to people; we like making friends with people and it's fun for us. I get introverted people don't like to get to know everyone else as much and put themselves out there, but I really like having a lot of people I can call my friends. People that I knew who had 10+ friends, were very close to each other. More than anything, I see this as some introvert lashing out at extroverted people because they make friends easier. We still have close connections."

1436,estj,"Hey, a site which uses the latest (and official) MBTI statistics. This alone makes it better than 90% of the garbage floating around. Including (surprisingly) the owners of the MBTI (opp). They still act as if their pre internet statistics are gospel.
And who is downvoting this and (better yet) why? "
1437,estj,"I've grown tired of waiting for people to come around, so if I'm not able to determine interest fairly early, I don't really bother anymore. Doesn't stop me from crushing on them still. Been crushing on one girl for near three years now. Likely never going anywhere though. Never much of a problem talking to girls though. I can walk up and talk to them just fine. It's more of a ""is it worth my time""."
1438,estj,"I don't give up quickly, but I have noticed that I get bored quickly with people. I had this pattern of talking to guys for a month before I was over it. It kept happening and I couldn't figure out why. Then I met my current partner and we've been going strong for 6 months. 
I personally think ESTJs have this ability to see things in people that others might not notice. We might see recklessness in someone and we'd know that isn't something we want. We see laziness or someone who isn't very motivated and we know that bothers us. ESTJs are one of the last types to want any of their time wasted so any indication of a potential relationship not working out and we won't even bother. 
I had so many of my girls say I was too picky and judgemental about relationships but I just kept watching their relationships fail and it all seemed pointless to me. Not to mention the one who would never shut up about me having too high of standards is already on her 2nd husband before 26.  
For me, there has to be a point to the relationship. I'm not just going to spend 3 months with a guy if I don't see a future with them. And I do hookups or fwb but none of those are ever with people I'm remotely serious about. "
1439,estj,"I‚Äôm a girl, I don‚Äôt have a problem talking to guys I like, but I do get discouraged if they‚Äôre not interested right away. The guys I‚Äôm usually into, take ages to make a move-that‚Äôs how I‚Äôve learnt patience haha"
1440,estj,"INFP but I'm getting more and more like this as I get older. Used to hang around with people I wasn't compatible with at all and agonize over whether or not we get getting along or enjoying each other's company. Now it's snip snip, bye bitch. Or I just mind my own business from the gate."
1441,estj,"As the two extroverted types within the Delta Quadrant, I'm very intrigued by how we would interact. I have a few INFPs and ISTJs in my life so they're not as a much of a mystery to me. 
I often wonder if I'm an ESTJ with a preference for Ne, but my Fi is quite strong, and my Si is definitely my weakest. I tend to force myself into Ne-Te quite a lot and sometimes wonder if I prefer Te to Fi, although I can find that if I stay in Ne-Te too long I can develop a bit of a Messiah complex, so after a heavy day of Te I deffo need to ethically recalibrate by pondering over my favourite philosophers. I definitely prefer Si-Fi to Si-Te. 
I've definitely learnt a lot by examining the ISTJs but as we both have an unbalanced perceiving axis, I feel like it would be more fruitful now to observe ESTJs, I feel like we can help each other as I have the balanced judgement axis, so I like to believe (although this is probably my ego) that I find a perfect equilibrium between efficiency and ethics. But my perceptions man, not only do I find living in my own body and experiences traumatic on a day to day basis, but my memory is the worst so most of what's in my head is just me filling in a lot of blanks, which makes everything very pretty, but not very grounded or down to earth. I feel like I would greatly benefit from understanding the ESTJ, with your balanced perceiving aixs, you can use your own experience to gather facts and details with Si and then draw the necessary conclusions with your Ne. I find that INFPs tend to bring out the worst in me, which is my laziness, and my sadness, but I feel like the ESTJ I would find empowering and motivating. 
So here's a few questions that I have, that if you feel you have any specific insight that you may like to give, would be greatly appreciated:


what differences do you notice between those of you who prefer Ne to Si, and vice versa? 


what is inferior Fi like? How does it affect you? What do you notice in your day to day lives that shows you have inferior Fi? 


do you ever feel like you wish you could stop moving? When in Ne-Te I feel like a hummingbird that has to continuously move from flower to flower to get sugar in order to stay aflight. I feel like being in Te nearly all the time must be tiring, 


how do you use Si to balance your Ne? 


I feel like we would get on, because of that shared Ne-Te that we may like to use together and may take us on many adventures and I feel like ESTJ company would help me get things done. However, I feel like I could also be very annoying, either because I'm a total Politically Correct, philosophical, & ethical square. Or I can see us as being rivals, I know that I get a wee bit schemish, malevolent, and competitive when someone else who is also very unique and leader-ey is around, ( makes me insecure I guess) 


do you have any other advice, feedback, anecdotes, tips, that you can offer? 


I feel at home in the Delta Quadrant, I feel like other quadrants have very different values, but interacting with types with the same functions as me is so refreshing and really helps me to ground my sense of self, and that I'm not a weird freak. Everyone around me seems to have Fe-Ti axis and it really gets me down because I feel like a black sheep. "
1442,estj,"Male ESTJ here.
I love almost all INFP (Socionics EII) music I find, but tend to ignore ENFP. The same with most other stuff like novels and youtube video makers.
I usually like ENFP characters a lot. Sometimes they compete with my favorite INFPs.
In conversation, they tend to bounce around topics a lot more while ESTJ / INFP conversations act more like a stack. We're constantly adding something new to talk about and figure out with the intent to make it easier to understand the topics before it. Eventually, we'll make it back to the original conversation.
My closest relationship with an ENFP is my female cousin. We hit it off like magic when we get together, but it's usually several years apart when we see each other in person. I don't have any ENFPs in close friend groups at the moment.

The Questions

I'm a little confused by what you mean by prefer here. My Si greatly helps in my personality typing, even as a secondary trait, as I can feel my own reactions to people and distinguish between them. Ne with Fi seems to like to break the rules of logic in a way that is appealing to Deltas, and it's stronger with ENFP than INFP. I don't know much about using it myself. In the context of Gammas, it seems to be about gauging power / willpower and similar concepts. I find that pretty hard though.
In terms of my own inferior Fi, it's difficult to feel empathy with a lot of people. I'm working on it with the help of INFPs and I've gotten a lot better. Also, it's really hard to distinguish the details in my emotions. Do I feel sad? Lonely? Resentful? I don't know, often.
Mentally, being in our own function is easy. We also seem to have huge amounts of physical energy as long as we are being energized and our extroversion is satisfied.
I'm a little confused here. Secondary Si use already feels situational and Ne even more so.
This depends so much on how our functions interact. I'm not politically correct, but I can follow some of the rules presented to me by INFPs. They usually give an explanation which I need to follow them. As far as leadership goes, I tend to give it up easily and only take it when it is clear everyone wants me in that position. This might be tied to my brother and mother being INTJ.
"
1443,estj,"Belated response, but perhaps I can provide some insight as an ESTJ female. I don't know all these inner workings of MBTI personalities, so I can't answer your specific questions directly, but I can speak to my opinion of ENFPs very well. My best friend of 5+ years is an ENFP male. I really enjoy spending time with him because he is so lively, open to new ideas/trying new things, and genuinely engaging with other people as this personality type. He is supportive and encouraging and can read people in under 30 seconds. In general I have a positive opinion of ENFPs as we can spend the whole day together and it's always great.
However, the parts of his ENFP personality that do rather drive me up the wall sometimes is that he is completely okay living in the ""grey area"" so to speak. He def doesn't see life black and white like I do, so naturally we clash on things. Sometimes he is, what I view coming from an ESTJ, as flaky because he'll change plans kind of last minute or change the restaurant etc. We dated briefly and definitely experienced the typical challenges in an ESTJ-ENFP relationship. For example, I wanted to define what was going on, exclusivity, etc. or at least have that discussion. For him, he felt like he was being boxed in. I value tradition on things like Valentine's Day, he doesn't nearly as much. Hence, we are much better off as friends. 
We can occasionally get annoyed at each about logistical things in our friendship which comes from our differences in personalities as I'm routine oriented and like to stick to a plan and he is much more spontaneous. But what friendship doesn't on occasion? That being said, he is one of the most fun people to spend time with and I enjoy his ability to just life life and his understanding of people pushes me to understand that feelings aren't so black and white/logical and to analyze my own emotions.
Hope this is somewhat helpful! In short, ENFPs make great friends and I love spending time with them but don't feel it's a particularly compatible dating partner."
1444,estj,"I‚Äôve only known ONE ENFP that I‚Äôm 99% sure I‚Äôve typed correctly, so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm allowed to judge ENFPs in general, but we didn‚Äôt get along - at all. 
She would cry often about things I‚Äôd consider minor, she is very sensitive. She wasn‚Äôt a mean person, but she wanted affirmation/validation from her friends and attention constantly - that personally annoys me (my most hated question is: do you like me? NO, THE ANSWER IS NO~I‚Äôd remain silent). We just don‚Äôt understand each other. 
Anyway, it eventually blew up, after dropping so many hints about the fact I didn‚Äôt consider her a friend, I flat out told her and you can imagine how that went. The rest is history, we don‚Äôt speak, but she‚Äôs happier now and so am I :)
I think it‚Äôs more a personal preference than an ESTJ thing, but idk "
1445,estj,"Estj 3w2 here.
So what is inferior fi? The most unhealthy think about what our president is doing or does when he gets angry. I don‚Äôt go that far but i can have states of unhealthy fi, but it has to be very far out, and not very often, usually with family. Mostly snarky comments sometimes a few and I pretend you don‚Äôt exist until you agree with me. I am blind and I don‚Äôt mind questions, but sometimes people underestimate me. I usually regret it but I was standing there greeting one sunday at church and someone asked he was a fellow greter you‚Äôre blind how can you greet? I gave him this shrug of the shoulders and like watch me I am sure you can‚Äôt do any better and kind of did it showily. Haha! I usually am more stable and then I felt bad when he said oh well you‚Äôre actually a really good greeter. I held my tongue but I was going to say I knew as much. I tell people to think trump but I don‚Äôt get as bad. But snarky comments can be my thing. I also think trump is an 8 I am a 3.
But I can lose my cool completely as well, not as bad as trump but think percy weasley. I am a lot more like that too.
I am also one to prefer ne a little for those estj who does it‚Äôs called looping I think. See do see do is the type of thing that happens. Too much on their plates. I think estj with a heavy ne is a big 3 thing. I am fairly intuitive, and have a good ne. I thought I may be entj. But probably not. But te ne loops happen and then I get exhausted because I have 3452671 tasks to do and wonder how I can do them all. They all sound great. I was on the newspaper for a bit, I was a journalism student for a bit, and I‚Äôd take on 6 articles and then I realized I had to interview, transcribe write down quotes and write my story for all these good ideas. Yikes!!! No thanks! Overload is my thing then I wonder why I need so much sleep like today. I‚Äôve gotten like 11 hours, I keep going back for more. And I am not a big fan of sleeping.
So I don‚Äôt know much enfp personally, the ones I know really seem happy go lucky. I had a notetaker she was a comm major we were on the newspaper together actually but she was the best at what she did. Really chirpy and really in to the werid. Haha!"
1446,estj,"Yeah, spontaneity is actually something I like about myself, but that's because boredom is the demon that haunts me always lmao. And as for the punctuality thing, I'm aware that I have a tendancy to get distracted or for me to mess up, so I usually just plan that into my schedule and give myself like an extra hour or two for everything. I also set all my clocks 10 minutes fast in hopes that oneday I'll forget that I set them ten minutes fast and so I'll always be 10 minutes early. "
1447,estj,"Thank you so much, this was a great response. Do you ever feel like you're too in your head? Like you wish you could just come back down to the present and into your body? This is what I struggle most with Si, I try to meditate regularly, but I can only manage few minutes at a time of being still in my own body before my pain and boredom start to crawl under my skin, and before I know it I'm in my head again daydreaming my cooky wacky dreams. Do you have any tips or techniques that get you to calm down, be present, and more in reality. I'm known for always having my head in the clouds, people describe me sometimes as 'in la la land' or not in touch with reality, that pains me a lot because I know that reality is painful and will never live up to my dreams. I kind of see life through a ven diagram, with one circle being what is possible, and the other circle being what my dreams are. I see no point living if I can't achieve my dreams, but what point are dreams if they're not actionable? So I like to try and stay in the intersection of where the two circles overlap. But it's hard because I know that anything is possible, I think about string theory a lot, and multiple dimensions and timelines, if there really is an infinite number of realities, surely there's a version of me that achieves my dreams, I just need to figure out how to do that. Unfortunately this thought process is incredibly abstract and I worry that sometimes I slip too much into my dream circle. I have an awful memory, how can I use my Si to bring me back to the centre of the ven diagram to the vesica Pisces "
1448,estj,"Other people will say I'm too much in my head, but I never think it on my own. We will often daydream but it doesn't get usually get as wacky as INFP / ENFP stuff. The core of it is usually romance, logic / thought experiments, puns, and curiosities.
People often say I overthink things, but I'm very comfortable doing that and it feels like a natural part of ESTJ. I think that they're just feeling normal type conflict.
Curiously, ESTJs have a very difficult time organizing our thoughts on our own. It's like we don't know the right questions to ask. I need to be talking to someone else that I'm comfortable with to know what I am thinking and feeling. Case in point, the ESTJ subreddit is really quiet when other types aren't asking questions about ESTJs.
""Do you have any tips or techniques that get you to calm down, be present, and more in reality.""
This is pretty much Si for me. We are almost always practical, in the present, being the foundation for common sense. When I have gotten anxious over romance or something, I called up a friend and talked over the issue. They were able to pull apart my thoughts so I felt like I had answers to my anxiety.
""I see no point living if I can't achieve my dreams, but what point are dreams if they're not actionable?""
I think that almost all dreams are actionable, at least through story and art. It seems like you really need an ISTJ / ESTJ friend to help you sort through your thoughts though."
1449,estj,"At work the other day we were talking about these ESTJ clients we have (just a few). They are amazingly productive people, but we can't figure out why they neglect us so much. When we meet with them, they are buzzing with energy and they have so much to talk about. We make plans, and we carry them out. But outside of that, when we email them, we rarely hear back. When we call them and leave voicemails, no answer. If we send updates explaining that we're done, we get ""thanks"" as a reply. Anything else we get nothing.
These are really good people. Hard workers. So what do you think is going on here? I have a non-client ESTJ friend who does something similar, so the curiosity is killing me. I usually think ""dutiful person"" but when I ask her for a favor and she says ""absolutely, I'll do that"" and it never happens...is that just killing her that it sticks out on her list, but she can't get around to it?
These are people in their 30s-50s, in case the developmental aspect matters. Love to get your thoughts."
1450,estj,"I‚Äôm super excited when I am around people, but if I‚Äôm by myself I kind of withdraw and don‚Äôt really seek out anything. After I get too lonely, I will reach out to people, though. It‚Äôs a weird balance. "
1451,estj,"ESTJs are a lot less socially robust than they come off as on the surface. When we're (or at least I'm) around others and we're making plans, I'm typically incredibly enthusiastic and have an opinion on just about everything. People are then surprised when I almost never contact anyone about anything ever unless it's related to work, sometimes to the point where I really need to contact others but I procrastinate on it. I won't do that if I'm incredibly invested, but sometimes I appear more invested in things than I actually am just because I like planning and expressing opinions. I can't speak for your clients, though. ESTJs are usually direct enough that they'll respond honestly to most questions, so if you have a conversation with your friend (in person) you might find something relevant to your situation. If her answers are too personal, your clients probably won't mind you asking why (but I guess that might be seen as unprofessional)."
1452,estj,"I feel a little confused by this. If they are clients, how can they neglect you? Even if you‚Äôre asking them a question that needs to be answered before they get the thing, it‚Äôs their thing, right? If they chose to delay getting the thing, isn‚Äôt that their choice?
I don‚Äôt reply to every email I get. I‚Äôm not even sure what more I could do to show my appreciation for something other than saying thanks. Or why I would be obligated to do more than that. I‚Äôve ignored calls and voicemails when I have something else going on, especially if that person calls a lot or if they‚Äôre difficult to get off the phone. Email is better for delivering information anyway, that way I can refer back to it on my own time.
As far as favors go, was there a deadline? Priority is a big thing for me. I do not tend every task in the order in which it was received. And I try not to ask for favors because that opens up a can of worms that I don‚Äôt navigate well. I do favors, but they are favors, not obligations, which means I do them if it suits me.
These kinds of social protocols are always very strange to me."
1453,estj,"It could be a number of things.  As someone else mentioned, as an ESTJ I‚Äôve found that when a problem/issue is more removed from my life it can be harder for me to get back to it because I expend my energy on so many other issues that are seemingly much more present first.  It also depends on how dedicated they are to whatever it is they‚Äôre purchasing and what they‚Äôre planning to do with it.
I know for myself that sometimes when I‚Äôm purchasing a service I‚Äôll attempt to be socially jovial/helpful because I feel that helps to expedite the process and improve everyone‚Äôs mood, but I may actually be feeling kind of ‚Äúmeh‚Äù over all.  Or I might be focused/‚Äúpepped up‚Äù about the purchase at that given moment but then return to my home and end up going back to my sort of nuetral state of emotianlity/energy due to the change in circumstances (going back to what I was saying about getting distracted/burnt out by other stuff).  Or maybe something happened after I left that made the purchase that seemed like a good thing at the time feel like a bad decision, so I might now be feeling bummed out/lethargic over it.  Either way I‚Äôm unlikely to let the people involved in said purchase in on that fact unless I felt they could assist/were somehow involved/responsible for an aspect of that poor choice on my part.
I‚Äôve done this before and usually it does bug the crap out of me yes.  I feel socially obligated to assist and when I don‚Äôt after having offered to help I feel like a dick.  I‚Äôve run into issues before where I offer too much help to too many people too quickly and I just burn out so now I‚Äôm more careful about this sort of thing."
1454,estj,"The clients don't sound like they just weren't ""feeling"" the issue, more like neglecting their social duties. Either way, as an ESTJ myself, I don't think what you're describing is actually a thing. Might be true for younger and less developed Se-dominants (and that's still dumbing them down to an extent), but unlikely for a T-dom, and because they're older they likely have stronger Intuition as well."
1455,estj,"Nah I get what he‚Äôs saying.  It‚Äôs harder to hold onto issues/people if they‚Äôre not as physically present in your life.  There‚Äôs a certain amount of social reluctance as well but I‚Äôm less desirous to get involved in something the further removed it is from me.  I‚Äôll end up either getting distracted by other issues that are more present in my life and expending all my energy on them, or I‚Äôll have to sort of work myself into going back again.  Depends on how committed I actually am to the thing I‚Äôm doing."
1456,estj,"I think for my boss it would be (who is ESTJ):
""it is finished and 100% approved""
for me it would be (ENFP):
""Sharks with shotguns in outer space""
or, on a more serious note:
""You are so fascinating, you never run out of crazy ideas!"""
1457,estj,"http://www.celebritytypes.com/estj-description.php
I've read a lot of type descriptions for ESTJs, and this one seems to be the best for me. It cuts out on the stuff I usually disagree with [""ESTJs hate being proven wrong and other people's ideas"" ""ESTJs hate any abstract concept"" ""ESTJs are hardcore traditionalists""], and adds more depth to the ESTJ character than most sites do. There were parts of the description that gave me a hearty laugh because they were just so accurate to me. I feel like xSTJs, and to a lesser extent, Sensors in general, are kind of shat all over when it comes to type descriptions, so this made me very happy to read.
Parts I particularly agreed with:"
1458,estj,"I've written replies to this post like 6 times, which all meander off onto my own tangents. But yes! It's nice to get away from the whole 'traditionalist' or 'stodgy asshat' descriptions and step a little more into the actual ESTJ experience. Refreshing! And way more welcoming. No one wants to repeatedly read 'you're boring and you're a bully'."
1459,estj,"Greetings to all ESTJs. I have a problem with knowing great things to do, and better ways of doing things - but I don't stick with them for very long. Any advice will be greatly appreciated, thanks. Or any insight into your thought processes that lead you to act on things and remain consistent. "
1460,estj,"Break your tasks into 45 minute chunks. List them. Cross them off as you go along. Take a 5-10 minute rest between chunks. 
Make promises. Remember how shitty it feels when people you thought you could trust break their promises. Keep your promises. 
Enjoy!!!!
Edit: hello /r/iamverysmart!"
1461,estj,I‚Äôm INTP and whats made me active is discipline. Maybe we are not disciplinable naturaly but we can pretty able to. As I‚Äôm muslim praying 5 times in a day helps me so muchhh. But only when I do that in time and focused. If you do some tasks in specified time every day this may help INTPs.
1462,estj,"Well, none of this helps, especially not the last one, but thanks for your answer anyway. 
Since I posted this question, I have found a way to solve my problem. I will be working on it.
If you are curious, here is a link. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth_(deadly_sin)"
1463,estj,"Hey I have done this stuff. I make tons of lists. I even get quite a bit of stuff done. This is not the problem, but thanks anyway. If you read other comments in here you may see that I was able to identify the problem and the solution."
1464,estj,"Recognizing what your problem is, will enable you to solve it. These articles about Acedia, have shown me what my problem actually is, and that it is not ""laziness"" but something much deeper and harder to get rid of. Apparently most INTPs have this problem in spades, and the more ""INTP"" you are, the worse the problem is, which means I have more work to do than some people. 
I think if we can honestly tackle this one problem, we will be able to move forward and use all of our good qualities, such as the love of learning or thinking. And not be hindered by this ""acedia"" problem. As you know, a lot of INTPs don't really care about many things, and many suffer from problems either in academia or employment, and it's not because of low intelligence. Thanks for your interest."
1465,estj,"That is interesting. I'm not INTP. I'm INFP. But I think I can give some help. I think we (INFPs) can build extreme passion for something which can motivate us to want to do something. Since I don't think you will be able to do this my only advice would be to use your introverted thinking to realise you need a job, and stop being lazy. You know it's the truth and I think your mind being on 'how do I stop being lazy' rather than 'how can I make money without a job' is a good indication that you will stop being lazy for the most part and try to aim for what you know is right. "
1466,estj,"Well as you might have seen in the Wikipedia link above, Acidia can be defined as affectlessness. This means that developing affectedness, or emotions, is necessary if one is to escape it. Therefore your advice on needing to ""build passion"" is not useless. It's just that I have to figure out how to do this. In my case I do not need a job - not everybody actually needs a job. It's not about ""getting a job"", it's about becoming a better person. Being caught in Acidia, you can never reach your potential as a person. "
1467,estj,"I feel great. I love being emotionless because it's my way. So it's not about feeling better either. Rather, I can SEE that I am not reaching my potential. It's more about thinking or perceiving than feeling. However I can understand why you would talk about ""feeling better"" - perhaps your feelings usually drive you to make changes in your life."
1468,estj,That's 100% true. I was thinking saying feel would be wrong. You know you need to be better. Your going to do it. You are an introverted thinker and I'm an introverted feeler. Quite similar but very different.
1469,estj,"You guys are mysterious as heck. 
I see an ESTJ rushing somewhere by himself after work and now that I think of it, he only interacts with people at work, unless he's secretly a great party host which I doubt he is."
1470,estj,"I spend time with friends (most of whom I've met at previous jobs), attend live shows (concerts, musicals, comedy shows, etc.), and hang out with my grown kids. 
‚Äã
I put my weekend plans together like any good ESTJ - with a To Do List, making sure to include lots of time with friends and family."
1471,estj,"It totally depends on how crappy my work days are. When I feel like crap I turn off phone and stay in bed all weekend watching YouTube/Netflix on my TV. I won't move unless I need to eat or go to the bathroom. Friends and family have complained on how I can't be contacted during those times. Most days, however, are fully scheduled with activities with friends/family or maintaining the house."
1472,estj,I like to to go hang out at my favorite bar. Half the time I just eat but I like to find a corner and chill. Eventually i'll get a beer.  But just being around people is better than going home to be alone.
1473,estj,"Note: Im ENFP, my boyfriend is INFP, his mom ENTJ and his dad ESTJ
My boyfriends parents inherited a large fortune. My mom is a clerk with an average salary, while my dad left us when I was young.
I genuinely love my boyfriend and he loves me too. We are dating since 4 months but we know each other since a few years. We were casual friends before. I had a boyfriend in the past, while he was single all the time.
Im extremely happy with him. But his parents are absolutely convinced that I am a gold digger. Let me be clear: I do want a career on my own.
Maybe they believe me to be a gold digger because I look very good. I am attracted to my boyfriend but many people would rather say that he looks averagely. Also Im very extraverted, while he is rather introverted and a bit shy.
What should I do?
TL;DR: My boyfriends parents falsely believe me to be a gold digger even tough I am educated and want a career on my own."
1474,estj,"Inherited means they didn‚Äôt earn it themselves through hard work so they can shut the fuck up about you being a gold digger. 
Just work hard and make sure you don‚Äôt depend on your ESTJ for too much. 
Do you work? Do you split dates? Or why else are they saying that. 
But really they sound greedy imo. Greedy for money they didn‚Äôt earn fair and square. So I personally wouldn‚Äôt listen to a word spoken out or their mouths."
1475,estj,"So i'm a year younger than my ESTJ and he just graduated and is going to college(i'm an ENFP), i will graduate next year. We've both always had an attraction to eachother even though we didn't talk. We were both in relationships during school but whenever he was in the hall I knew it and would always make eye contact with him. I knew he found me attractive but i thought that was it. fast forward to when we both break up with our significant others, he texted me telling me he wanted to hook up, well i did too but i was having many issues with my ENTP ex, so we left it at that. a month after that we started talking again and ended up hooking up. Since then he's been extremely sweet, showering me with compliments and telling me that he's attracted to everything about me, how he wishes we could go to college together, when i graduate i have to hit him up, how he will take me to new york one day, and stuff like that. The reason we aren't dating right now is because he said he doesn't want to get attached before he leaves for college.  Yet we never hangout, he will say he misses me a stuff, but he only ever asks to hangout at night. I don't know, i guess i just don't know what to expect. I feel like how he says he's feeling can't be real and I don't know if he's being serious when he talks about a future between us. Is ESTJ just having fun for the summer? "
1476,estj,"i give him all the space he needs, especially since we aren't dating. i guess it just bothers me that he says he misses me yet he doesn't try to hangout (during the day at least). Thanks, i appreciate it :)"
1477,estj,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion? Thank you!"
1478,estj,"This sub is pretty quiet, so I'll bite, but I have no idea if my answers would be 'typical of an ESTJ'. It might just be me.
I'm extremely cautious about romance and I would really need to be friends before I could even drum up romantic interest.  You know that game where you people watch and say yes or no to each person who walks by? I always say no.
For a friend, just any kind of casual offer would do, I suppose. Because we're friends. If we're both flirting and testing the waters, great. If I smell that someone is interested when I'm not, I tend to keep my distance. I don't believe in feeding the pigeons. I think it's cruel and I avoid it when I can.
For a stranger, I might be flattered, but no. In fact, I find it a turn off. I actively do not want to have a relationship with someone who propositions strangers in a bar. That screams of an invitation for out of control drama to me."
1479,estj,"Ahem.
I'm also an ENTP, but married to an ESTJ.
My husband asked me out. I got the sense he was the take charge and ask the person out type. But he was quite awkward about it. Though, he seemed to appreciate being clear and straightforward and having a date that included an activity. "
1480,estj,"Well since this dude isn‚Äôt responding (what a dick muncher) I‚Äôll ask a question as I was typed as an INFP myself...
How did your type get to be so decisive? 
Do you sometimes regret your decisions you made right then and there and think of the other possible routes?
How do you make decisions in the face of little information to go on? 
I‚Äôve heard that you guys see the world as very black/white, while I see it as multiple shades of grey and struggle to come to a conclusion without lots of information, so I would like to see how you think."
1481,estj,"So, this is obviously my personal responses, but I feel like they're pretty typical within our type:

We didn't do anything to become decisive, we just get tired of people hmming and hawing and say, ""Fuck it, I'll do it.""
Dunno about other ESTJs, but I tend to be pretty methodical about my decisions, even if they have to be made relatively quickly.  Of course there are times when I regret the outcome, but I try to make the best decision I can of all the possibilities that seem to be available/that I can conceive of (limited creativity sometimes, so I definitely miss some).
I try to use a lot of context and past experience, as well as doing a bit of research.  If I have to make a snap judgment with no info, the best I can do is go with my gut (which is usually going to be whatever seems most logical at the time).
I see lots of grey, I just think some of the distinctions are bullshit.  Too many instances to name, but I (personally) actively try to reduce some issue to black and white because the in-between just isn't that important to me.  Kinda like Yoda, ""Do or do not"".
"
1482,estj,"He/she sent us a direct message about it.  To answer your questions:

It's instinctive. Our strongest cognitive function is Te, which I've seen described in a number of ways.  I like to think of us as ""swift categorizers"".  Our brains are wired to immediately suss out the positive/negative, useful/not useful, efficient/not efficient, working/broken aspects of nearly everything. It makes us great at optimizing.  In the workplace it gets applied to plans, strategies, instructions, tactics, etc.  If a coworker mentions a fresh idea, I can always see the 12 steps it will functionally take to make that idea a reality. When I see those 12 steps and I believe that only half of them are actually feasible, I can look like a naysayer or idea-squasher to the idea people.  (When, in reality, I may be a proponent of the idea as well but I just see its limitations.  This can be insanely frustrating and think it's one reason I struggle to get along with ENxPs.  ENxPs often start pushing an idea before they assess its feasibility.)  Unfortunately, we can also apply Te to people and that's where we can really get into trouble.  Some of us also fail to see that just because we have a swift, solid plan of attack...doesn't mean it's necessarily the BEST plan of attack.  The healthiest ESTJs will want input from other types, especially feelers and intuitors.
I rely on my gut to make swift decisions.  The only times I typically regret those decisions is when they are emotionally-charged, i.e. driven by anger.
It doesn't bother me.  It means there's less to analyze and I can decide more quickly.  All of life is making decisions with the information you have on hand.  What makes logical sense?  What makes financial sense?  Which decision will bring the most happiness? Is anyone in danger?  If no, then it's not that big of a deal. I think a lot of indecisiveness is fear-based.  (This is completely my  opinion.)  Sometimes life just requires that we be brave and take calculated risks.  Also, one thing that I think ESTJs have that INFPs don't is self-efficacy.  Most ESTJs have an inner-belief that if we put our minds to it, then we can make it happen.  Most INFPs I know seem to be missing this?  Not sure.
The black/white thing comes from our categorizing.  It can be a great tool for work environments, critical decision-making (I used to work in emergency response), and efficiency; but can also make us very opinionated and often too judgmental.  It's a double-edged sword.  It's practically impossible to turn off my observational judgments, so I'm just working on keeping them to myself and logging them - more like an introvert would do.
"
1483,estj,"Thats cool. Your ability to just throw out the emotions and see things unfiltered are kinda cool. Ofc there are advantages to both types, but I‚Äôm working on improving Te, so this is an interesting insight in how you do it.
Reducing issues to black and white can be useful and save you stress, while I tend to mull over a problem and find no apparent conclusion. Just because life is really grey doesn‚Äôt mean my decisions have to be grey as well so black-and-white thinking can serve you well in work situations.
Anyway, thanks for responding, this will be useful."
1484,estj,"Ahh ok well then I take back that dickmuncher statement.
Thanks for the long response, and you‚Äôre definitely right about feelers abstaining from decisions because of fear. 
Sometimes we just need to shut up and get on with it. My weakest function is Te, so of course I‚Äôd like to improve it and try to be in the present. That fast rationalization is appealing to me, because emotions are never a great way to decide major life decisions.
I liked that part about having less information to analyze and meaning you can decide quicker. You dudes just do that straight away, while I would be in the corner trying to think of other factors and implications when theres really no point. 
Thanks for answering in detail, its interesting to read and will be useful for me one day."
1485,estj,"I mean, I recognize emotions (most of the time), they‚Äôre just not what I usually base my action/reaction on. Exceptions for people I care about, like my wife and kids, though that‚Äôs still sometimes a struggle."
1486,estj,"On cognitive function tests, I get ESTJ around half the time, but I've never received ESTJ on a letter dichotomy test. Usually, I get ENTJ, INTJ and very occasionally ISTJ. Function tests often give me INTP (I tend to score highest in the T categories, and both Ne and Si score quite highly, so this isn't surprising). The only thing that stays consistent is that I virtually always get Thinking over Feeling, but usually only just. Letter dichotomy tests usually give me around 60% Thinking, and it's very stable, whereas my S/N can range from 60% Sensing to 80% Intuition. Once I tested as an ENFJ on John's Personality Test, however.
Honestly, I'm guessing that the ESTJ subreddit doesn't spend quite as much time taking personality tests as I do, but what have you gotten before?"
1487,estj,"I know you were just saying those were the scores you receive and not what you actually think you are, but I feel like my Ne is around as strong as my Si. Despite that, I know that's not how it works, and I have a few ideas for why I feel this way. My working theory is that I'm only under the impression that my intuition is of equal strength to Si because I have a lot of ""special exclusive Intuitive club hobbies"" (philosophy, doing excessive amounts of research on obscure Austrian personality classification systems, math, etc), and that ingrained Intuitive bias has led me to believe that ""my Intuition can't be THAT low, right?""
I'll be honest, I misread your comment and I wrote that clarification at the start after I reread it. I thought you were saying you feel Te"
1488,estj,"For what are you apologising?
And I think it is pretty normal for ES_J's to have good iNtuition, probably one of the main reason why there are so few self-proclaimed  on the internet.
On the si and ne thingy: Personally, I see myself as a Magic Knight. "
1489,estj,"I will never marry, don't like the push behind it from the community. And you can be 20 years married, 25 years together and people forget the 5 years before being married. Strange. 
About children; I'm a last minute mom. Never wanted them, then I met this amazing safe person with no drama. "

It's simple and I would love to expand on it in the future but these are all the variables I need to complete my Multivariate Statistics Analysis class.
Thank you!"
1491,estj,"I'm an INFJ and I've never been able to settle into a faith - probably because I got burned by drinking the Kool-Aid in a fringe spiritual community in my early adulthood and could never trust a group again.
I feel that, in turn, conservative religious people don't trust me when they sense my lack of official alignment.  But I can't lie and go along with something if I'm not actually 100% on board, even if it would be to my advantage socially.  I've had very meaningful personal experiences that I'd call mystical, but they're quite abstract and I keep them to myself.  The resulting ethic is to experience and respect the indwelling divinity in all beings as much as I'm able, which I don't explain to people; I just do it.
How do ESTJs experience religion?  Is it more about the other people in your religious community, the laws or commandments set down, the subjective experience of grace/redemption/sacredness, or other?  I ask because I realized that I use nothing but feeling and intuition, and have no idea how a person could relate to the ineffable using the other functions; yet I understand that your religion could be the most important thing in your life."
1492,estj,"I think we are just very certain about it. I have been an atheist since I was 9, and I am very certain. 
I will say that a lack of structure can create stress for us, so religion may provide that structure if we don't have it in school or at home. "
1493,estj,"Good point about structure.
I thought it was interesting that my ESTJ aunt was an atheist, but she loved to do up the holidays.  She was also incredibly loyal to family, even if she thought we were being idiots.  I felt like she held us together and traditions were a big part of that."
1494,estj,"That's for sure, I was in a tiny church and an eventual schism changed it so much it was unrecognizable.  I always felt it when I was being judged, too.  I like anonymity and grandeur - gorgeous architecture, lots of light, and formal ceremony let me relax into the experience and get outside of myself.
Personally I feel a paradoxical attraction to praxis-based religions, but definite lack of attraction to the politics and competition when spiritual development is constructed as having a hierarchy (so some members are ""more advanced"" and therefore better than others).  That made me bounce into and bounce right back out of cultish situations."
1495,estj,"I can relate to preferring an upward trajectory.  Maybe that's why I went in for a spiritual system in an extremely dedicated way only when it was presented as having a series of grades to systematically work through (Masonic Lodge style).  Church-on-Sunday religion doesn't offer me that, especially since I don't want to be clergy.  
Do you have particular religious/spiritual goals you work towards, or is it more a consistent application of self-discipline type thing?
Thanks for the feedback!"
1496,estj,"I have created a new subreddit to discuss MBTI and make new friends/meet new people.  If you are looking to chat with a certain type or just want to chat about anything and everything MBTI, this is the right place.  Anyone is welcome."
1497,estj,"Not enough information.
Is his line of reasoning more concrete or less? Does he like data and facts and seem to go by those?
Do you know much about SI or NI? Can you tell which one he relates to more?"
1498,estj,"This is a poor method of determining N/S, it correlates more with one's level of education and intelligence than their type. Perhaps ENTJs will be more likely to entertain bold, risky plans whereas ESTJs may prefer to look for the option with the most reliability and safety (I know I do), but I don't think that's what you were suggesting when you said abstract/theoretical conversations. That being said, I'm sure ESTJs who are able to entertain abstract/theoretical concepts are more likely to test as ENTJ than ESTJ, but that doesn't necessarily make them that type."
1499,estj,"You made this shit just up.
And even if you didn't, how would this help to determine the type of her boyfriend? There is no  control point for capacity of abstract ideas. She would first have to make some statistics.
Actually I found the opposite:
""The fact that a student has a strong preference for sensing over intuition, for example, provides little indication of his or her ability to function in an intuitive mode‚Äîor in a sensing mode, for that matter."" - THE EFFECTS OF PERSONALITY TYPE ON ENGINEERING STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND ATTITUDES"
1500,estj,"My wife stays home, and I work. We discovered when we were dating that we both had very similar sensibilities about money. We're both extremely frugal, she probably even more so than me. We both had zero debt coming out of university, both having made our way through on scholarships and working, so I knew I could trust her with money, and she knew she could trust me with it.
Our arrangement is simple: all income in our family is shared equally between us. We have no individual accounts, and both of us take turns entering our expenses in our budget so we know how we're doing each month. I have always filed our taxes, but I talk her through it as I do them so she knows what we're reporting. We both share all our passwords, are each other's beneficiaries, etc. She spends what she wants when she thinks it's justified, and I do the same. We agree on a set amount of no-justification-needed money that we can each spend each month, and if we don't spend it, it accrues so we can each save for big purchases we might want. Anything over that limit, we discuss. I don't think either of us has ever vetoed the other's proposal of what to spend."
1501,estj,"Was engaged to an ENFP for a while. We had different budgeting techniques and styles and spending habits, but we would always talk about the big things, how much we would each contribute, and would make sure we agreed and knew what was going on.
However we both had completely separate accounts. We didn't even have a joint account, and weren't planning on getting one either. We each had methods that worked for us, and though we tried we couldn't find a way to make them work together. So, we trusted each other to manage our own finances in the way we saw best to meet mutual goals.
It worked out pretty well for us - much better than I anticipated, since I like to be in control of these kinds of things - but it was a good experience for me to cede control to let her do her thing on her own time. And it worked! I still have absolutely no idea how, but it worked lol."
1502,estj,"Damn, I love the way you guys do your finances. This is exactly how I'd want the set up to be. Thank you very much for sharing.
I am an INFJ and also have found ESTJs to often share similar attitude towards personal finances as me. (Although you guys usually make a ton more, lol). Can I ask what your wife's Mbti?"
1503,estj,"My wife is an INFJ, and we have a pretty similar arrangement. Our difference is she handles the short term (e.g., bills, balancing checkbook, checking credit card statements) and I handle the long term (e.g., investments, savings goals). We each have full access to all accounts, and can check them whenever we please. We keep the other apprised of what's going on and we talk through all significant decisions.
I should note that after 8 years together, our personality types have somewhat converged. "

1506,estj,"Have some of you been very dependent on someone and ""used"" them a lot for getting the things you want? How did you guys move towards being more independent? My ESTJ SO is bombarding me with requests for help and assistance on stuff she is very capable of doing great herself, how can I support her in a positive way to be more independent? I am an INTP and I need my ""me"" time to feel like a human, so this behavior needs to stop or have a drastic decrease in frequency."
1507,estj,"My ENTJ friend is similar. How can someone I know be useful/advantageous to me? is a question that often goes through her head. Let me see if I can offer them a deal where I'll be able to save money and effort, and they can get something in return too (but what they get is not as sweet as what she gets). I think she loves the idea of people serving her too much. She's also an only child."
1508,estj,"This is going to be very blunt, but it's not personal, so please don't be offended. I know when I ask for help I want it to achieve whatever I'm currently focusing on and I cannot be distracted from it, and so I often neglect the feeling of the other person because if I had time for that I would have gone through the bother myself. 
So my advice is that do it for her now and quick, but talk about it afterwards. Tell her that you aren't happy with how she treated you like a tool and everything, she's going to feel like you aren't happy helping her out, explain to her clearly what you want, not just lay the problem on her and let her figure out herself. Tell her exactly what you think is unacceptable, and tell her what you want."
1509,estj,"What's her motivation for asking for all this help? Determining that might uncover a tidy solution. Have you tried communicating in very clear, concrete terms, with examples, what you need and what you want to change (and why)?
Personally, I've always been a very ""if you want something done right, do it yourself"" type person, and while I prefer company I don't like to be dependent on others.
If you really feel she's using you like a ""tool"" it might have less to do with her being an ESTJ and more to do with her. No personality type gives someone license to treat others badly."
1510,estj,"Yes, I realize that that has been a fault in my approach, I whent from ""sure baby"" to ""hell no"" when I started to figure out just how little she appreciate whenever I help her.
And I love helping her out, I live for her happiness, but it is so extremely draining for me to help her with  ""everything"" and that she don't even put a little effort herself is just not OK, but yes, this is great advice. "
1511,estj,"Yes, and the MBTI, especially the cognitive functions has really helped find some of the root causes of the issues.
I don't really know her motivation, I think it is a combination of low self esteem with being spoiled and lazy. Each thing reinforcing the other into making it OK and preferable to of-load things on me. I think the reasoning shifts and it has become a habit and she does not really think before going to her ""go to"" solution for any problem.
EDIT: I say these things not because they are always true, but because they are transient reasons for doing this or that thing, I get how this can be read as talking bad about her but I mean it in the most loving way there is."
1512,estj,"How does one define ""good"" tho? I'm sure my ENTJ friend thinks she is being very generous, offering clever solutions and deals to others in which both people benefit. However, for her, efficiency trumps being considerate. It's the same thing I run into with my ISTJ boyfriend. "
1513,estj,"Yeah sure, we can get so absorbed in our own thing we forget about how much it drains the people around us as much as it drains ourselves (something definitely worth watching out for her as well, some of us- including myself- don't know when and how it comes all crushing down on us, but when we notice ourselves it's often too late)"
1514,estj,"What if she just wants some romantic attention? I know that both ENTJs and ESTJs super struggle with their inferior Fi functions and have a hard time expressing them. The facts that she can do these things herself and that she's a young ESTJ makes me think she wants to be emotionally cared for the way she knows how to take care of others: doing things for them. 
Note that the Si function is very detailed and self/past-oriented. She may not know how to show a need for intimacy in a clearer way. I know you mentioned her being spoiled and lazy, but Im giving her the benefit of the doubt until you have the chance to rule out this need for intimacy. I consciously try to give those I value very highly the benefit of the doubt so that I don't unconsciously treat them as if my negative assumptions have been proven true. "
1515,estj,"Yes, her ambition and drive is part of what I admire most about her, but it is a double edge sword and she can't be counting on me to pick up her slack whenever she bite over more than she can chew, not that I don't love too, it's just a bit too much at times. "
1516,estj,"We broke up, mutual decision, the distance was too big and the difficulties in communicating was just too big, problems where never solved, they where just pushed back and forth then left in the middle, unless I caved my will, when she first put her mind to something she never budged, not how I wanted to live my life, ruled by a dictator. "
1517,estj,"Yes, that's unfortunately a lesson she has to learn. It's always hard being the person who has to make an unappreciated choice on the matter before everything goes on the wrong track (you already know that it's not going to be wonderfully resolved immediately with no cracks or clashes anywhere I assume), but somebody's got to do it. And for this alone, kudos to you."
1518,estj,"My boss is an ESTJ and we get along great. His Te motivates me to get things done, and um...I tell him how people feel. :D
I think the key to a successful INFP/ESTJ relationship is respect. If both parties respect each other and give each other grace and space, then it works out. "
1519,estj,"My partner is exhausting - mentally and spiritually. He doesn't say I love you, he's critical, insulting and judgmental. He fights over food ('I bought that!') and he used my family history against me in an argument - so so hurtful. On the other side, he's highly intelligent, funny, a great cook and is very popular. He tested as ESTJ who are known to be rigid, but I'm tired of reading into MBTI to understand him. What am I living with exactly? A plain ESTJ or just an asshole? Any helpful thoughts welcome. "
1520,estj,"""he's critical, insulting and judgmental. He fights over food ('I bought that!') and he used my family history against me in an argument - so so hurtful. "" 
Red flags of someone who may have a borderline personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder.  I wouldn't jump to the conclusion just yet but I would watch myself before I got into too deep with this fellow."
1521,estj,"My ESTJ doesn't say I love you either, but he'll say other affectionate stuff, and his love languages are primarily Acts of Service, Physical Touch, and Quality Time. He's not petty, critical or insulting or judgmental toward me, but he can be critical and judgmental toward people at his work, or other drivers during traffic. Mine is not very funny, and he's not cooked for me once yet in the year we've been dating. But he's fundamentally kind and patient with me. Is your partner aware how much he's hurting and exhausting you? Sounds like he needs you to explain how the things he says and does make you feel."
1522,estj,"Hey y'all.  I'm an ENTP, and I recently moved back to my hometown.  A childhood acquaintance (ESTJ) ran into me, and has since decided that we are bff's.  She seems sincere, but she hardly knows me!  All of a sudden I know all of her life secrets (and family secrets), and she always wants me to come over, hang out, or chat.  Is this for real?  I'm usually a pretty good judge, but she genuinely seems to believe that we are close friends now.  I'm reeling a bit from the suddenness of it all, since I usually don't consider someone a friend until at least a year has passed."
1523,estj,"Probably a sincere act, but also severely lacking in boundaries. Whenever anyone shares too much too soon, I become very careful in how I choose to interact with them. In my experience, over-sharing personal problems right off the bat is unhealthy behavior (think codependent Enneagram 2). Once intertwined,  it's hard to extricate yourself from the situation without drama. Trust your gut. Always. "
1524,estj,"How soon are you talking about?
I get on with ENTPs but at a distance I think I do but yeah. I know this guy who is and he use to stalk me all over twitter and debate absolutely everything. He‚Äôs a marxist or close to it and I use to be a libertarian center right but I am more along the GOP lines. But still haha! Interesting is all I can say. I liked my entp teachers but not a lot of entp friends.
Apparently the entp I am talking about shares musical tastes."
1525,estj,"Hello fellow ESTJs, im an Infj and im currently struggling with enjoying each passing moment. i would like to get some tips on how to appreciate the details of life (smells and tastes, scenery etc). How to be more moderate  with everyday activities and how to listen to myself?
This is also a hidden appreciation post too :)
Thank you in advance!"
1526,estj,"First of all, I 'was' a real ENTJ transformed into ESTJ. I was a lone wolf that was ambitious and brutal to most of the people. I had great schemes in my brain to achieve my goals and moving towards them in Machiavelli way.
As a healthy and happy ESTJ (who is good at teaming up and networking), First thing I do recommend is ""stay away from toxic people"". Positivity is contagious so the negativity. NTJ's also love being productive and efficient. When I was ENTJ, I was only scheming plans rather than starting them. You need to keep yourself busy and thereby you will not have this dull time to think about things all over and over that eventually ends up with bad thoughts. There is no meaning in life, all you have to remind yourself is we are going to die already, why not enjoying the time left. If you are worrying about stuffs ask yourself this question; ""Will it matter in 10 hours?"" if the answer is yes, ask again with 10 days, then 10 years .... The point is, there will be problems of course, but what matters is your self awareness that it is not going to last forever. If there's a solution, don't just plan; ACT! I'd recommend you to research ""Mindfulness"" and ""Stoicism"". In addition to this, i also love this quote ""if you want to go fast, go alone. if you want to go further, go together."" I just realized how my inner circle is important. I radically changed my close friends and now we are acting like a team that supports each other in terms of caring, supporting, contributing to each other. When you don't have open minded circle around, you will not act yourself and it is impossible to be happy like that. To conclude; - Have a goal in your life -Start acting for it -Have supportive and productive friends around you -Speak up your ideas! -Do not stress about the stuffs that you can never change, if you can't control, it's not your business. (politics, your appearance etc.) And avoid judging people; everyone's not the same in this world and it is impossible to make all people perfect and change their characteristics to make them more like us."
1527,estj,"So I'm strongly inclined to believe I used to be an ESTP when I was younger. I was a troublemaker in school  would hate any rules imposed on me and just did whatever I wanted when I wanted. I was all about partying and drugs for awhile. One day I had a near death experience because I overdosed and it forever changed me. I realized that life is more fragile than I initially thought and there was definitely a very high likelihood I could have died that night. I made a conscious effort to not be so reckless all the time. This is when I think I started developing my ""J"" .I planned every little detail of everything. I made sure to be alot more cautious about what I put into my body. Eventually this also went over into all facets of my life and became alot more organized. I got my act together and eventually attained financial stability and then some. However, there are times when I feel I really miss being a ""P"". because I feel I was alot happier.  At the same time, I remember the pain in the ass I was to my parents and don't know if I'd wanna go back. Altough I'm alot more successful now as a ""J"", I know suffer from mild depression that I never once experienced as a ""p"". What are your thoughts on this? Also, did anyone else think they were a different type at one point?"
1528,estj,"This is an EXTREMELY stereotypical description of an xSTJ. STJs can disobey rules too you know, it's not that I'm physically unable to. Rules /tend/ to matter more to STJs, but if I find the rules completely asinine, I'll just make up my own. "
1529,estj,"Not an estj, but I've noticed that that kind of behavior isn't unusual for estjs I've known. My father is a textbook estj in a lot of ways but growing up he was pretty wild. He was the leader of a gang, he got into a lot of fights, dated around a lot, but he was simultaneously a good student, a good athlete, and really family oriented even before he had a family.
Some estj's are very straight laced but others have a play hard, work harder mentality. "
1530,estj,"THIS IS MY LIFE. 
Holy balls. I have never related to something more in my life. 
I was not always how I am now. I believe that my childhood, especially dealing with a narcissistic mother, really changed my personality. "
1531,estj,"DEFINITELY. I had a really awful experience with an ex which made me realize that I was too trusting and stoned all the time. I stopped smoking weed, started doing my homework, graduated (finally) and started working in insurance."
1532,estj,I never mentioned that ESTJs were incapable of breaking rules. I simply mentioned that I became more organized and responsible. I still break the rules every now and then I but do so with MUCH less frequency than I did as a youth.
1533,estj,"I am not an ESTJ. The ESTJ's I know who like me, have just always liked me, we've been friendly from day one. However, I know an ESTJ, who just does, not like me. It would not bother me so much if it wasn't for the fact that his reasons for disliking me, are things that have been disproved. If it was something about my personality I wouldn't really care. 
I just think that after having been proven wrong, he'd have been like; ""I was wrong about you."" or something.
Anyway any ESTJ comments? "
1534,estj,"Oh, I don't know if this is ESTJ specific, but being one, it is extremely difficult for me to admit that I was wrong. I HATE BEING WRONG. It takes time. In the end, I can't deny what's fact, so hopefully this person will overcome his immaturity. "
1535,estj,"You drank and had fun until 4:00 AM. 
You slept until 2:00 PM the next day. 
At night, you cannot sleep because you slept during the day. 
You need sleep to be maximally productive the next day. 
How do you get out of this situation?"
1536,estj,I think the trick is not to sleep until 2pm. You don‚Äôt really need to be well rested for the day that you sit around eating hangover food and vegging out. Shorting your sleep will make it easier to get to bed on time the next night.
1537,estj,"I don't see the problem. So you will fall asleep later and have only 5-6 hours of sleep.
What is the big deal? Unless you work physical labor, lack of sleep for one day would not affect your productivity much.
As an ESTJ I do not see this situation as even slightest ""problem"" :) It is almost literally nothing to me (and I like my 8 hours of sleep). "
1538,estj,bring it on ESTJ love war. we are hardened utilitarian thinkers. I hope you weren't expecting any human rights in this war we are going to hollow out the chest cavities of your children and make punch bowls out of them
1539,estj,"I am an INFP that said, when it comes to work I like to be organized, have a plan, I hate inefficiency or sloppy work, I want things to be done the ""correct"" way, just overall I take a lot of pride in my work. I expect perfection of myself.
The thing is I am INFP. When I'm not working I'm very relaxed, and the reason I do work hard is because my moral code, can't stand feeling like I've let myself, or others down. 
The issue is I apparently turn into a little tyrant, without meaning to. I've actually had ESTJ friends pull me aside, and they'll basically tell me; ""It's great that you take pride in your work, but you need to take a breath, and step back.""
You guys, and girls though ESTJ's always seem like you can have amazing work ethic, without going too overboard on others. 
I'm not going to stop working hard, so since your type is about the hardest workers I know, naturally I'm wondering what your secret is, to doing so, without coming off like a taskmaster?"
1540,estj,"Care more about results and less about the correct way.  Get things done more quietly.  
There is surely an art to ""rising above"" the situation and mastering it.  A good manager can tell his employees what to do clearly and with empathy, but a great manager doesn't need to.
If I get demanding, frantic, or frazzled, it's usually because I feel out of control of the situation and I am doing everything I can to get control back. The solution for me is instead to find ways to get the right outcomes without having total control.  
More and more I see the biggest factor in this is trust.  If I trust those I work with, I let them do their job in their way, according to their judgments.  I can nudge, influence, and suggest--if they're good, that will be enough."
1541,estj,"This is a great, answer for myself as an individual. Especially the last part, in how it relates to me. I am not a trusting person, unless I know someone takes their work as seriously as I do. I tend to get into this mode, where I feel like everything has to be perfect, and if I see someone doing something in a way that isn't correct to me, I get all flustered about it. I do try to be somewhat understanding, I would much prefer to see someone at least trying to work, over someone being flat out lazy. "
1542,estj,"Agreed, this IS a great answer and I think why working ""hard"" isn't a bad thing for me. 
I also am very individualistic in the sense that I'm just trying to be the best that I can be and believe that it will show with my work. So, in so many ways, I'm competing with myself. I also believe that quite often the answer is to work smarter, not harder. I trust in tried and true concepts because they're proof that sometimes we don't need to reinvent the wheel. I will pick up the slack for other people because I know that this only makes me a stronger asset to my company. I make sure that what I'm doing is not ignored, but I'm not going to brag or be flashy about it. When the subject of merit comes up, I'll be prepared with the data that shows my value. I guess I see work as gaining value constantly and I want to rack up as much value points as I can - like a game. 
I actually don't really trust that people work as hard as I do but that's because I think I actually LOVE to work and they just do it because of money or something. I'm sure that's not always the case, but I always assume that. 
I can't help but think the the OP seems angry about working hard, not necessarily because they don't want to work hard but because of how frustrated they feel in general. Maybe the difference is that ESTJs seem to find identity in work and feel like they're in their true element within their work while INFPs need an emotional connection to it or they feel it's not worth it. Whenever there are emotions involved that is when things get hairy. It's hard to think logically and effectively when you're battling emotions. Emotions typically affect INFP's judgement."
1543,estj,"There are people who like calling our way of thinking ""prefer cold logic"". But instead of relying on logic we are also heavily empirical, in my opinion, empiricism does not necessarily render anything ""cold"", does it?"
1544,estj,"Not an ESTJ, but I lurk this sub frequently. I don't necessarily that that empiricism denotes anything ""cold,"" but it can seem cold to other types, especially those whose dominant or auxiliary function is Ni or Fe (possibly Fi too). This is because Ni-, Fe-, and sometimes Fi-doms/auxiliaries navigate the world using their intuition and/or base their decisions solely on the feelings of others or their own personal belief system. Empiricism denies all of those things because there's no scientific evidence to back the claims."
1545,estj,"Ni is a perceiving function and not going to deem anything cold or otherwise. Also, NTJs use both Ni and Te in their upper stack. 
High Fi users might find it overly critical or unimportant, high Fe users might find it inappropriate or irrelevant, high Ti users might find flaws in what they perceive to be oversimplification or inaccuracy."
1546,estj,"For the sake of the argument let's assume what you're saying is true. It's still the judging axis making the call of it not being warm/inviting.
You can rely on ""intuition"" and be empirical at the same time. Just because something isn't apparent to you/you can't explain something, it doesn't mean that it isn't there or there is no explanation. You just lack the means of revealing it."
1547,estj,"Hmm...okay, that makes sense and I stand corrected on the Ni function. I also hadn't thought about Ti, but, based on the one INTP I know, your statement about them finding empiricism overly simple or inaccurate seems very likely. "
1548,estj,"That's a typical ESTJ thing to say. I'd rephrase it to say, ""It's good that feelings aren't too important to ALL of the types or else relationships would be disastrous."" I can agree with that statement, but I can't agree that feelings aren't important. I don't think the world would function properly without both thinking AND feeling types. :)"
1549,estj,"Yes, but the difference between ""Aren't too..., or else..."" and ""aren't... at all"" is yet to be eliminated. I would think it's still within my right to refuse words being put on my tongue. As for the second point, I've never promoted any type-extermination agenda in order to secure a better future for the world. "
1550,estj,"I didn't try to put words on your tongue, dear. I said I could agree with the statement if it was rephrased in such a way. Ah, and I never said you did promote any agenda. I simply stated an opinion. For an ESTJ, you sure read into things a lot. "
1551,estj,"Hey reddit,
So this ESTJ I am an acquaintance with, I haven't seen him for like 4-5 months in person, but we have kept in touch through text and phone in between for a long long time (I would say like 30 hours in between). He texted me last week to check up on how was I doing too. 
I ran into him today in the workplace. Except I was with my team and he was with his team. I saw him out of the corner of my eye and it took me like a 3 seconds for me to process who it was. I was surprised and said ""Oh, hey."" I was too taken by surprise to say anything further. He looked at me and didn't say any greeting. I just kept eyeing him. Then he asks me ""which team are you on now""? (we rotate teams). I tell him. He doesn't say anything. He smirks a bit, then he looks to his side, rest of his team members arrive, and then they all take the staircase up. No goodbyes or anything. 
I thought this was a super strange interaction...I thought he'd be a bit happier to see me. I guess I wasn't too friendly either, but I was honestly too surprised to see him walk out of no where and see him. 
Is this normal? I hope the guy's not like angry at me or something. "
1552,estj,"I agree, this is just weird.
Maybe he is just shy and was so surprised, that he could not handle the situation?
Personally, I hate texting and phone calls. I prefer to meet people in person. Especially people I haven't seen in a long time, always brings me in entertainment-mode.
I don't know any ESTJ (and this includes myself), who is a silent rager. Usually we are more assertive and expressive. If I would be angry at you, you would know that I want your head on a pike and the reason for it. "
1553,estj,"I‚Äôm an ESTJ and that seems cold to me. That‚Äôs not how I‚Äôd greet anyone I knew and hadn‚Äôt seen in a while, much less someone I‚Äôd kept in regular touch with. Even being preoccupied doesn‚Äôt seem to cover it. I don‚Äôt know that a personality type can explain all interactions - this one just seems like it was simple rudeness. 
Edit: ESTJs do like directness though. If you‚Äôre concerned something is off between you, I wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to ask directly. He should be able to tell you directly. "
1554,estj,"As an estj, I can understand him and am pretty sure he has zero negative feelings towards you (in fact this would be possible if he felt positive towards you as well).
Of course that is not how all estjs would do (like they most likely would say hi and ""see you later""), but it is not that surprising behavior. I can totally relate to this (although I would be a little more polite wit hi/bye).
Rest assured - he has no negative feeling towards you :) (He would have not texted with you for that long otherwise. Also smirk would indicate positive feelings). It is highly possible that he even likes you as a person, not just having neutral outlook towards you. "
1555,estj,"I agree with you. It seems strange that people think this is normal behaviour for almost 10% of the population. Maybe the hard-nosed sounding ESTJ descriptions online turn away the friendlier ESTJs from their type, so the ones you find online are predominantly ones that relate to the often extreme descriptions."
1556,estj,"Even so, it‚Äôs my understanding that ESTJs have a reputation of being cold based around our no-nonsense decision-making approach, not our interactive social skills. Yes, we value logic and decisiveness, but we‚Äôre still extroverts. We like people. 
I think a danger of using MBTI terminology to explain everything is that people can use the weaknesses of their type to justify disrespectful behavior. One of my weaknesses is being prone to interrupting, but I still recognize that it‚Äôs very rude and use the knowledge that I‚Äôm prone to it to keep me vigilant against it - I don‚Äôt use it as license to continue interrupting. It could be that OP‚Äôs friend is an ESTJ who is also emotionally immature and doesn‚Äôt see that growing as a person means tempering your faults, not catering to them, but either way, the interaction OP described does not sound like extrovert behavior. 
Edit: I also agree with you! Didn‚Äôt say that sooner. "
1557,estj,"It just happened like an hour or so ago, I noticed that I was irritated (disgusted even) by myself for being over-sentimental. I was told that ""this is definitely a ESTJ thing"", but was not convinced since there was no solid proof for that. But anyway, it rarely happens since I don't think I'm a sentimental person to begin with, but when it happens I think it irks me more than it should. So fellow ESTJs, have you ever experienced this? And if so what do you often do to get pass the irritation or just try to ignore it and wait it out like I do?"
1558,estj,"I'm not very sentimental normally, but I find myself being so with my kiddo. He's 7 and I get irrationally angry when my husband throws out completed school work/art that I haven't gotten to see yet. You'd probably think, ""Well duh! Every parent wants to see their child's work!"" But I get upset when I can't even see the truly dumb stuff too.
Anyway, I don't necessarily care about being sentimental, but I do care if I'm being percieved as being irrational/overly emotional. That's humiliating to me and my reaction is usually to be angry about it. "
1559,estj,"Same, but I've gotten myself to fix this particular problem when it comes to organising and throwing stuff out. Not sure if this will work out for you but here goes: Get a stack of sticky notes while evaluating the stuff you got, make a mental note on two or three threshold requirements for the item to be ""of value"" to you (e.g. If you'll need it, if it's better off sold in a yard sale, etc). Check all items according to that and give each of them a sticky note so that you can put down ticks if yes and leave blank if no directly on them (I tried jotting everything down on the same paper, it was more organised but didn't work well, was a pain to write down descriptions for each items to not get mixed up, effectively slowed me down.) And when I do that I guess I can logically persuade myself to throw out all the ""sentimental"" stuff. "
1560,estj,"I should have also stated that during a specific week of the month I'm esfj. I'm borderline but mainly t. That week is now. What I will also say is that I've never not enjoyed my sentimentality. I express them freely and I believe I enjoy them thoroughly. It brings me a lot of delight seeing something that I tie heavy to emotions. Like at work I have a pic of my SO when he was in the sixth grade that his mom gave me. I love looking at it and laughing about it. I've even kept the first flower my SO gave to me on a coffee table in my room. It means a lot and always has place of pride. 
I guess you could say I get a little shy or embarrassed if someone says ""awwww"" or something along those lines. "
1561,estj,"What you're saying is that your dominant function could be Fe rather than Te. Ok, I can get behind that- along with your take on this particular topic.
-So evidently it's both for you, the examples surprised me. Personally I have never brought anything that would remind me of my family/ SO etc to work and have never kept anything my SO gave me that's already expired. It's uplifting to know that you take pride in your souvenirs and I would say good on you!
The last point confuses me though. Are you embarrassed when people find something enjoyable? It needs context."
1562,estj,"‚úæ
^Spot ^a ^problem? ^Contact ^the ^creator.
^Don't ^want ^me ^to ^reply ^to ^your ^comments ^anymore? ^Click ^me. ^This ^function ^is ^in ^beta."
1563,estj,"Ok that makes sense. It's personal and so it's not meant to be pointed out by, let's say ""emotional outsiders"" jokingly or seriously in a casual setting. Personally I would be more uncomfortable than shy though."
1564,estj,"We have been together for 7 months and I want to continue to make this work.  I sometimes feel like I am not able to be myself, and at times I submit to her ESTJness and supress the real me.  She does love me very dearly and I really appreciate that. I find her extremely interesting because she is pretty much my opposite.  I am messy and spontaneous, she is organized to a T and very scheduled.  I am abstract and philosphical and she is very realistic and concrete. One of my biggest problems in the relationship is that I love to talk existential and she does not.  However, all of these citations of disagreement are merely from my perspective.  We have not discussed our differences.  I am under the impression that she ""fakes"" and pretends to be interested in my ""lost and space"" antics, however, I think she really trully does not understand.  I am afraid that the only reason we are together is that we are both very smart and investigative and we find one another to be extremely interesting.
TLDR
INFP male dating an ESTJ female. I feel like she doesnt really get me.  I want to make it work. Please help! Thanks "
1565,estj,"All I can say is let her wear the pants in the relationship. I doubt you have a very assertive personality, but I would think that she does. If you're not alright with her dominance, you will need a way to assert your wants/needs where she takes them into consideration. If that doesn't happen, you'll have a rough time. "
1566,estj,"I am a (very) ESTJ-oriented male and my girlfriend is a very introverted and reserved, quiet-type (I'll have her do the Jung test the /r/mbti sub recommends and edit later this evening; edit: ISFP). She is constantly challenging me in the creative ways to help me see when what I mistake for my own assertiveness could be gravitating towards being controlling. She balances with me well with her intelligent and empathetic, purposeful passive-agressiveness; often letting me figure out what it is I am doing that I would judge another person for. 
Note: I'm not a raging asshole or anything and I sorta just summed this all up in terms of the aggressive nature of many ESTJ's. Also, I just learned about all of this MBTI stuff from the /r/bestof thread on the front page. 
Note2: I am aware of the inaccuracy of internet tests. "
1567,estj,"As a fellow INFP, unless you really really really love this girl run. We idealize relationships and I can guarantee you have attributed more attributes to her than she really has (goes for any relationship). To put it bluntly, can you picture yourself spending the rest of your life with someone who does not really attach importance to emotions like you do? In my experience the most important thing to an INFP is being understood and I hold the belief that XSTJ types are not able to fully understand us.
I'd like to add that this doesn't mean I hate XSTJ types. I admire the sense of duty fulfillment XSTJs have. You can always depend on an XSTJ to come through. I just can't fathom the XSTJ mindset and I think it goes both ways."
1568,estj,"A bit late to the game but I just wanted to add, I am an INFP who has been forced to spend the last 9 months living with an ESTJ roommate. I have never wanted to murder someone so desperately in my life.
I commend the OP, because living with this type has been hugely difficult for me (and I suspect it would be for most INFP's)."
1569,estj,"Because my assumption would be that she will tell you what she wants before you do the same, and she'll be less willing to settle for less than what she wants. Don't take that to mean you get run over, you just have to be willing stand up for what you want. I should think that if she likes/loves you, she would want it that way.
As far as what she can do, force it out of you."
1570,estj,"Firstly with ""you guys"" personality mix (she has many of the strengths that people normally associate with men and you have many strengths that people typically associate with women), you have an opportunity to do something really innovative and amazing with your relationship, don't get stuck inside of traditional gender roles, you could miss out on something awesome.
As someone with an ESTJ mother and an INFP father, I also have to add that she will need a lot of independence beyond the home/relationship. It's not a good idea for her to get stuck in the house being domestic (ESTJs just aren't cut out for that). She needs to regiment and control concrete things (not necessarily you or your relationship or home but she needs to have positions/things outside that she can control and keep in order) and she will be great at that too. 
Yes you will benefit immensely from her organization, leadership skills, neatness and down to earth-ness but she needs other ways to express those strengths outside of the home. If you play to and allow each of your strengths to flourish, you tenderheartedness and her leadership skills you will have something wonderful that many people miss out on with the traditional gender roles."
1571,estj,"When people say I‚Äôm good at my job I usually melt into a puddle. 
I work sales and it can be rough at times but one of my supervisors is always writing me little notes thanking me for doing such a good job and honestly I love it. 
If the complement isn‚Äôt about my talent or skills then I don‚Äôt really care for it."
1572,estj,"Honestly I don‚Äôt think supervisors understand how far a simple compliment can go. Or a thanks. 
It would honestly motivate me more than ‚Äúdo better‚Äù. 
ESTJs are driven to work hard and exceed expectations but the second I‚Äôm micromanaged or undervalued I start looking for a new job. 
It‚Äôs extremely important to be recognized especially when I know I‚Äôm doing a good job that is actually making a difference."
1573,estj,"My husband has never been great at talking about his feelings, and I accepted that a long time ago mostly because I realized that the ways he does show affection are so meaningful and creative. I hate being cold, and on cold mornings I'll wake up to find he put my clothes in the dryer so they'll be warm when I get dressed. I collect Disney trading pins, so when he got us tickets to see Beauty and the Beast he chose a theatre like an hour away because he read that they were giving out promotional pins that weren't available at our usual theatre. He takes care of me when I'm sick. He's always recommending shows he stumbles across that he thinks I'll like and watches them with me even though it's not his thing. People seem to put a lot more value on what is said than done when it comes to love for some reason, and most of it probably stems from insecurity, but I've come to appreciate the concrete gestures so much more. Anyone can say anything, but actions don't lie. So anyway, I think yall are pretty great, mine in particular, and I think yall need to hear it more often. "
1574,estj,"That's very nice! 
It sounds like he really pays attention to you and ""gets"" you. And I can't help but think his love language is actions/serving (but not in a slave kind of way, I'm sure you get what I'm saying)."
1575,estj,"I almost cried reading this because my ex boyfriend was an ESTJ and the man I'm currently dating is one as well.
You're right, they show affection through action, and there is nothing I value more than actions. And when you realize how meticulous they are with planning things out, I always make sure to thank them from the bottom of my heart! 
I love this side of ESTJs as well. 
I used to park outside an ESTJ's house when visiting him, and the street was hard to find a parking spot in. He would always move his own car out of the garage and find me a spot an hour before I got there, so I wouldn't have to look for parking at night. It was the sweetest thing ever...
I'm an INFJ and these little details of life escape my brain sometimes. I appreciate it so much!
What type are you?"
1576,estj,"I have another thread up right now about how I'm an ISFJ who seems oddly drawn to (fictional) ESTJs; the only 3 television characters I've ever greatly admired are all ESTJs. And I admired them independently + didn't know much about MBTI at the time apart from the superficial 16personalities kind of typology.
So yeah, there must be something pretty great about them. And I do see the same quality of being able to remember minute details and use them to demonstrate love through actions in the characters I like as well.
+1 to some ESTJ positivity c:"
1577,estj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/mbti] X-Post from r/ESTJ I feel like there's a lot of ESTJ negativity so I wanted to add some positivity to the discussion

^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)
"
1578,estj,I just came across his post. I'm an INFJ as well. It's really important to me to convey love or care or consideration to others in a way they understand and receive that message. How do you convey these things to an ESTJ? Through actions? I'm such a wordsy person. 
1579,estj,"In my experience with 2 ESTJ boyfriends, I think what they appreciate the most is being on their side, their teammate - at all times. We INFJs have such high moral compass that anything that deviates from what we think is ""right"" presents as a threat/""wrong doing."" At least that's how I am frequently. But what realized was that ESTJs respect loyalty and being on the same team very much.
If the ESTJ is going through tough times, it's better to boost up his ego than to advice them about how he can be better. If ESTJ is venting about a person, it's better to agree rather than giving them second opinion, especially not the one that favors the person in discussion.
Loyalty and being on the same team. I would focus on those! They do really love it. Compliments go a long way, too. Not in a worship-y way, but in a respectful real manner, you know? :D"
1580,estj,"Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :)
You don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
Any comments, ideas, critics are welcome!"
1581,estj,"I got ENFJ-A (which is weird, because it also said I got 51% Thinking...). My results were:
E: 57%
N: 63%
T: 51%
J: 62%
A: 65%
Well, first of all, I think that the T/F dichotomy is bugged out.
Secondly, I think where you went wrong on the N/S dichotomy is that you predominantly asked if the user could intuit, so you would only get sensing if you cannot intuit, not if you can sense. For example, when you say ""I can see the bigger picture"", Sensors can use their lower Intuition function to do so, so the only people who can't see the bigger picture are underdeveloped or young Sensors. Because of this, well-developed Sensors will likely test as Intuitive. You need more questions where Sensing is the positive focus, not Intuition. I realise that you had questions such as ""I'm more practical than creative"", but that's a poor question. Would you think an artistically-minded ISFP wouldn't put down creativity, for example?
Thirdly, it's pretty obvious you copied 16personalities on a lot of these questions. It's not even the best website to copy, the test is pretty bad, but it's probably better to copy a bigger company which can handle the hit rather than a smaller and more refined test, so I'll leave you be on this one.
If you're set on making a dichotomy test over a function test, I'd follow this guide to the dichotomies. It still won't be 100% accurate, but it would be better.
Also, nothing of value comes from the A/T dichotomy, I'd just ditch that all together."
1582,estj,"iNTJ-A. 3 out of 5, close enough I guess.
Your iNtuitive/Sensor dichotomy asks ability not preference. Just because someone can swim, doesn‚Äôt mean their favourite  sport is swimming.
And your Extroversion/Introversion is mainly social extroversion, something modern Big five tests disassociate themselves  from.
A better question would be:
""What do you seek in your free-time?"" Excitement/Calmness
But I think you put this into the A/T dichotomy.  So I am not sure if this is a design choice or not.
edit: I read your post about your A/T dichotomy. I guess I was wrong, still leaving it in. Interesting concept by the way."
1583,estj,"I know why I got N, I predominantly answered N/S questions in a way that skewed towards Intuition. I said I can see the big picture, and that I'm more creative than practical, that I get lost in thought when I walk in nature and that I have big dreams. These aren't traits that are inherently exclusive to Intuition, I just didn't have any opportunity to show off any of my Sensing traits because the questionnaire was asking if I can intuit, not giving me the opportunity to say I can sense better.
The Assertive/Turbulent dichotomy was taken from 16personalities, most people are aware of this, I'm not sure if you're trying to hide that or not. I'm also not sure if it carries any value to actual personality typing, I think it's a dichotomy best left to the Big 5's Neuroticism scale. I'm just not sure why people try to incorporate it into typology, but if you can explain why I'm all ears.
When you say it isn't MBTI exactly, I can agree with that, but I'm not sure if you're trying to suggest I could be an ESTJ in MBTI and an ENFJ in your testing system or if that was just an unrelated tangent.
I'm sorry if I sound harsh, if I do, it isn't my intention. I just didn't feel like my original concerns were addressed by you, and so I tried to make myself more direct."
1584,estj,"That would be great, thanks. Maybe you should put that on the website for ease of interpreting results.
I still think you're glossing over the other points I'm making - I'd appreciate if you took the time to answer them."
1585,estj,"So, my idea detecting is it assertive (strong answers) or turbulent (weak answers) is like that: we have 32 questions, each question has range between 1 and 5. So max ammount will be 32 * 5 = 160; That measn healf will be 80. So, if sum of your answers is More than 80, it means, most of your answers were more than 2,5, that means your answers are strong (assertive). If less, than turbulent :) Did you get my idea? It wasn't stolen from anywhere :) I invented that just to have more fun, but it might not be accurate, but I have to tell how it is based :) I also invented a way of palm reading and meanings but it's offtopic"
1586,estj,"INFP here. Can someone explain what's going on? I have a friend who's an ESTJ, who's friends with an obvious narcissist. The N can act friendly and personable, but his real personality is nothing like that. If you slightly get on his bad side, he'll turn other people against you. He openly threatens to destroy people's reputation. Uses moral language to manipulate people and bolster his image, bullies the weak, etc. The ESTJ knows all of that and I've talked to him about it, and he agrees with me...then he goes right back to associating with him. Obviously it's his business, I'm just trying to understand why this is happening. I know my friend isn't shitty himself, he's genuinely well-intentioned so for now I'm assuming he doesn't actually believe that the ENFJ is a complete asshat due to weakness in the presence of Fe and Ni. "
1587,estj,"I like being with outcasts and weirdos a bunch of the time. I'm also pretty good with barriers and think troublesome people need friends too. That said, I don't think that I've ever been friends with a narcissist and I wouldn't be surprised if this stayed as a distant friendship."
1588,estj,"ENFJ's are very manipulative and clever with it.  Narcissists are very manipulative and clever about it.  That combo is dangerous, and can suck unsuspecting people in like a vortex.  Good luck to your friend, and to you, because he likely won't come out until he has gotten hurt by it."
1589,estj,"I knew and ENFJ like that. He wanted to be a double of malcom x and called himself blinky x haha! I never like the guy. If nothing bad happens leave it, not sure how you can persuade him to stop liking him, hopefully if the enfj does something realy bad he will see it."
1590,estj,"INFJ here and currently dealing with an ENFJ narcissist.  (Hence, why I'm on here, needed an outlet for my emotions - disappointment, grief, sadness, anger, shock, etc.....). I can't tell you why your friend is caught in the web of an ENFJ narcissist, but I can tell you why I'M having such a hard time detangling myself - and I hope it helps.  . .
He was like an annoying little puppy following me around; he was more than charming; no, he was far more substantial - he was invested in those around him - ready to be their friend and confidant in their times of need. It was not the mesmerizing way in which he commanded the social atmosphere - no - it was the way he moved me to find my inner strength and resurrect my own dead heart. It was not the handsome face - no - it was the glimmer in his eyes when he beheld my light, and with the outstretched hands of a wizard, raising the flames consuming me - slowly, ever slowly, ever surely, until my hope was once again reduced to coals and incinerated. 
The ENFJ narcissist I'm involved with [was] a friend and coworker, now he's my coworker (trucking partner). I have hopefully less than a week before I'll be transferred to a different partner. The ENFJ is the archetypal life coach; they bust into your world, rip your heart out, show it to you, and either A.), encourage you to make it blossom, or B.) Begin with ""A.), and then manipulate your vulnerability to their voracious appetite for exaggerated self veneration, meanwhile insisting upon the worst of your intentions, fabricating accusations against you, and gaslighting you under the guise of ""helping"" you confront what they'll have you believe are your own shortcomings, but in reality, they are the deflected shortcomings of the narcissistic ENFJ. They use their social prowess to blackmail you against the reputation they seek to destroy."
1591,estj,"We enjoy doing the same things, have similar world views, have similar senses of humor, all around friendly match. Though, in group settings, the dynamic shifts and the performer comes out so I tend to go off and do my own thing. He has said that I bring out the better qualities in him, so he is somewhat aware that he gets away with a lot more with others. "
1592,estj,"Like taking personality tests? I need research participants to take a bunch of them and answer a long questionnaire! I‚Äôm posting to this subreddit specifically because I need more ESTJs to take the survey, since last I checked only one or two ESTJs had taken it.

Research context: I'm writing a book about personality, pathology, states and spectrums of consciousness, the art+autism connection, comics, and a bunch of other stuff. The book, Don Depresso, Not Otherwise Specified (DD-NOS), will include analysis and discussion of the data I collect from this questionnaire.
Research goals: I want to connect various, disparate personality frameworks that already exist as well as add my own scales to measure traits that don't appear on any well-known personality tests to date. I'm especially interested in identifying patterns of human behavior and frequently clustered traits using a descriptive approach that remains independent of cultural constructs of pathology‚Äîso I'll be looking at characteristics associated with mental disorders as well as those considered ""normal"" variations.

1593,estj,"For me, it's this one (make sure you scroll down, there's a bit more). There are a couple of little things that I didn't agree with 100%, but otherwise, it almost seemed like something I would write about myself. I'm interested to see other descriptions that you all found to be true to you."
1594,estj,"Michael Pierce's videos here and here tickled me and I felt like he covered some things that don't come up often. I don't think I've ever heard a better explanation for my sense of humor, for example.
It don't know that I would say it is the most complete overview, but man, did some parts of it resonate with me."
1595,estj,this
1596,estj,"I sort of agreed with this.
I agree that I have a good sense of responsibility, sometimes flare up a little bit, becomes very serious and determined when someone is in physical danger, and don‚Äôt tolerate loafers and idlers. I agreed with most of the ‚ÄúRecommendations for self-improvement‚Äù section. One part I particularly agreed with was this:
However, there were a few parts that I really disagree with. It seemed very intent on the fact that I throw a lot of shit. I really don‚Äôt like throwing stuff, and I think that‚Äôs such a specific characteristic (I believe at one point it even said I get angry and throw dishes at people, like wtf?) that whoever was writing this said that from a more personal experience with an ESTJ. I also like to think that I‚Äôm pretty good at cheating and lying when I want to. There were a few really weird lines in there, at one point it said ‚Äúall these qualities have helped George W. Bush to become president of the United States of America‚Äù, which just kind of left me confused.
Overall, not the worst description of me, better than the 16Personalities description for sure, but not the best."
1597,estj,"lmao, people saying they want to be called ""alpha"" is so weird and bordering on pathetic.
For me, I guess I like being complimented on whatever I put effort into. It's nice to receive validation for my hard work."
1598,estj,"Do you know how much stuff I have done only because someone told me I couldn't do it? 
If you don't want me to do something, just support me or don't say anything at all, because nothing drives me to doing something more than telling me I can't do it.  "
1599,estj,"I have a bisexual ESTJ friend who is not out to her family or many others. Her family used to joke about her being gay all the time because she was single all through high school and a Tom boy. She worried that She was only so into woman because she couldn't get a guy. She told me one of the motivating factors in marrying a man was to prove a point, to herself and her family, that she could do it. "
1600,estj,"Hi guys, I just want to say that ESTJs are amazing. You definitely don‚Äôt get enough credit for being the caring, principled, consistent, and loyal type you are. And yes, this is gushy but I don‚Äôt care. Just want to show appreciation."
1601,estj,"They don't get the credit 'cause they are stubborn about their point of view.
Also they show lack of emotions when it comes to things like discussing things and details.
Others easily get mad for these reasons and they feel like the ExTJ does not deserve the credit even when they are truly awesome."
1602,estj,"Hi all,
Some of the online tests show ESTJs as natural partners for INTPs. It so happens that I - an INTP - am envisionning a business partnership with an ESTJ to run a small company.
How do you guys see your enconters with INTPs? What are the issues that might rise long term in a relationship between these types? Any past anecdotes worthy of notice ?
Best,"
1603,estj,"I love socially-developed INTPs, they're loads of fun to have conversations with. There's one INTP I know who likes to springboard their ideas off of me, tell me what they're thinking to get a Te-perspective on the problem. They loosen me up. 
Ne/Si is a good point of communication between ESTJs and INTPs. When well developed, both of them should have relatively strong Si and Ne, and will both be quite cautious, meticulous, but open to ideas and new points of view.
You should probably note that ESTJs can be very organised and typically really dislike not having a plan ahead within their professional lives, sometimes to the point of frustrating those who require a level of spontaneity. We're basically the ultimate contingency planners.
Honestly, as long as you're both well-rounded, friendly people, there shouldn't be too many long-term problems that arise, especially if you're good at resolving conflicts. ESTJ-INTP is pretty much the best business partnership I can imagine tbh. ISTP-ENTJ would probably be on-par, but INTP-ENTJ or ISTP-ESTJ isn't something I can see happening with ease."
1604,estj,"I was in a relationship with an ESTJ female and I‚Äôm an INTP.  We enjoyed each other‚Äôs company but also really got into each other‚Äôs nerves.  Definite sparing between her Te and my Ti.  Plus we both have inferior Fe and Fi.  So she could come off as cold and me not very affectionate.  
As the other poster mentioned you really gel with your sandwiched Ne and Si functions.  I did appreciate her Te take charge kind of an attitude however it would come after me with a vengeance if I was being unproductive or taking too long to do something.  
Bonding occurs with the your shared auxiliary and tertiary functions which are flipped and slightly more developed for each person.  I got her out of her comfort zone and challenged her with my Ne and she showed me more practical ways of handling day to day activities with her Si.  "
1605,estj,"Many of my ESTJ friends and past significant others have been pretty frugal yet have an inclination for finer things in life. However, some were borderline stingy. I really appreciate frugality, but I cannot stand stinginess.
I was wondering how you differentiate between the two, and which one you lean more closely to!"
1606,estj,"The ESTJ I dated was bad with money, even though he was frugal with random things.  He overspent and did not discuss finances with me.  But he made good money, so he'll be fine long-term.  He was just young and stupid.  The INTP I dated was a lot more generous, but just as bad with money.  He also made great money, so he'll be fine too."
1607,estj,"There must be a fine line between the two, but I don't know which side I lean closer to so I'm just gonna sum it up a little.
I don't get things (buy, rent, get for free, etc) if I don't need them. I don't like useless stuff piling up at my place.
I make sure that I always have savings at hand. Whatever happens I know I can have my back covered if rainy days happen.
I spend good money on things that need to be expensive but try to save on things that don't as much as I can.
I don't really enjoy many things expect for books (I can live without music and movies and video games. I know.) so they don't really cost me much. 
So l guess I pretty much have no personal life to spend money on."
1608,estj,"I‚Äôm an INFP dating my boyfriend of 7 years who is an ESTJ.  We‚Äôve been together since we were 17/18 years old so we‚Äôve really grown together. But now that we‚Äôre older, I‚Äôve realized how different we really are and it‚Äôs making me worried if we are truly compatible and capable of having a future together.
The other day we had an argument because I told him I believed that kindness is everything and the world would be a better place if everyone just learned to be kind to one another. He disagreed and said he‚Äôs not obligated to be kind to everyone (strangers, people not in his ‚Äúcircle‚Äù).
Also throughout our whole relationship he has struggled with being able to comfort me when I cry or have a panic attack. He will usually just say and do nothing or he will get mad and say I‚Äôm overreacting.
It‚Äôs hard for him to show emotion (I‚Äôve noticed his whole family is like that as well). I‚Äôve noticed he actually tries to avoid anything that could possibly make him ‚Äúfeel‚Äù anything. For example, he refuses to talk about death, tragic events, even our relationship when i try to tell him when I‚Äôm unhappy, etc.
It‚Äôs tough because we are literally complete opposites. Any insight? Any way of helping me understand his way of thinking/feeling? I really want to make this work."
1609,estj,"I definitely don't agree that Kindness is what this world needs more of. I believe in being respectful, but kindness seems a little much. 
Also, ESTJs imo are better than any other type at taking care of their people. They see it as their duty and will work overtime just to make sure their loved ones have a roof over their heads and food on their plate. So they might not have that same heart for strangers, but that isn't always a bad thing. I personally believe in taking care of my people before strangers. 
Instead of looking at what your ESTJ hasn't been able to do for you, take a step back and try to see what he's done. 
ESTJs love through actions. Taking care of basic needs, doing what's practical. They might not be the most romantic, but that doesn't mean they don't care. 
Also, not wanting to talk about death or tragedy is more likely because we ARE sensitive to those kinds of things and don't want to talk about it because it's actually uncomfortable and something we aren't really interested in. 
My mom and dad are INFP and ESTJ and have been married for 30 years and have a rock solid marriage. My mom has shared a lot with me about what it's been like for them. I personally think their differences complement each other. Because I have had friends who seemed to be dating people who were too similar and they seemed to have unexciting relationships that end because there is no gain from being with someone who adds nothing new. 
My dad does appreciate my mom's feels and emotions but doesn't always agree with them. But my mom will stand behind what she feels 100% and that's why my dad loves her. ESTJs don't like people who crumble under pressure or change their minds because we don't agree with you. I like that you're so passionate about what you believe in that you're willing to fight about it. Sometimes ESTJs disagree not because we actually disagree but we wanna see how much you actually care and how much of a fight you're willing to put up. Half of the political arguments I have are simply because I wanna see if you actually know what the hell you're talking about. I wanna see you push back. I do it because I feel like I am surrounded by a bunch of people who only believe what they believe because that's what everyone else believes. And it's pathetic.  
I bet you anything, you're ESTJ loves you for who you are. He might think your kindness argument was dumb, but he knows how big your heart is. 
You aren't going to get that emotional gushiness from an ESTJ, but I'm willing to bet, you actually don't want it as much as you think you do. I think the stuff you want from your ESTJ boyfriend are actually things a girlfriend would be better with dealing with. Do you have girlfriends you can share that stuff with? Is there a reason you want it from him? Do you want it from him because you can't get it from anyone else? "
1610,estj,"It's not doomed because of your personality types, if that's what you think.
I'm an INFP and I've been struggling silently with similar concerns regarding an ESTJ in my life, who's my good friend but we'd be in a relationship if it weren't for specific circumstances preventing it right now. But I have a message to any INFP going through this...your greatest strength is looking inwards. We are extremely emotional and idealistic people, and it's very rare to find anyone who can understand us, which feeds our sense of loneliness. In reality, the reason we are continually disappointed in relationships is because we hold unrealistic expectations for our partners. What we need, we already have within us and no amount of external search can alleviate our longing to be understood. When you are at peace with yourself, your thoughts, feelings, and opinions...then you can love someone for who they are and not who you want them to be. And once you can love someone for who they are, you are completely free. You hold no expectations. You are able to love people unconditionally. It's a wonderful gift. So, you have a dedicated partner of 7 years but you disagree on certain things, and he's bad at providing emotional support. None of that is truly terrible unless you choose to see it that way. I say, cherish your differences. He wouldn't be him otherwise."
1611,estj,"Lol you two dorks are just made for each other. You keep going on with all the security theater and him cringingly going along the whole nine yards like nope nope nope! Its like trying to give my two dogs a bath. One likes the water so much it won't stop playing with the damn toilet and the other one has already run off locked itself in its carrying cage.
One question though is there like a significant height difference between you two? Because I've heard and theorized a bit that INFP are probably kind of short and youthful looking. Which reminds me of this funny video I saw online this tall fellow buys his gal a little happy meal. She rages so hard beating him with an ice cream cone. And there ain't no dodging an ice cream cone that mess gets everywhere. Maybe you two should stick to going out for coffee and avoid the ice cream... ^_^"
1612,estj,Thank you for the thorough and detailed reply! I definitely see more of where he‚Äôs coming from now. I honestly do not have a lot of girl friends and my best friend is my boyfriend so I guess I do have that expectation of him being able to comfort me when I‚Äôm upset. I am someone who has struggled with anxiety and depression in the past and there were times where he was the only person I had so it hurt me when I felt like he couldn‚Äôt be there for me. But I do know majority of the time he means well. 
1613,estj,That hits a chord with me as an ESTJ husband with a INFP wife.  Been married over twenty years but still sometimes feel that I can't really be what she needs emotionally.
1614,estj,"INFP female here in relationship with ESTJ male. Re: Emotional support - They do their best at comforting, but you have to accept that this is not, and will never be their, strong suit.  They will support you with the day to day, practical things that you may not see as obviously important, but if you step back you'll realize your life is all of sudden less stressful and you have more time to focus on processing your emotions.  If you need actual emotional support, you may have to find this elsewhere depending on your ESTJ.  I go to my dad (ESFP) and best friend (INFJ).
I would also recommend taking the love languages test.  It'll give more insight into how they show love so you can work on adjusting your expectations accordingly."
1615,estj,"Thanks for replying.  I certainly can relate to the ""guardian"" personality traits, and I know my wife understands this about me.  I think she also tries to be stoic and not burden me with issues I cannot resolve for her, but at times it boils over and I really have to be what she needs and try to understand life from her perspective. "
1616,estj,"Why are ""Enegram"" & ""Big 5"" test not as popular as MBTI?
I think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the ""Enegram"" or ""Big 5"" test.
What do you think?"
1617,estj,"That might be the case but since the enneagram is trying to tell us the root of our behavior (anger, fear, or shame), it can be pretty limited. Not many people can relate because the ""why"" is so much more elusive. MBTI just tells us the results of our behavior and not the cause, which is why I think it can be more relatable to people. You can find people of the same temperament but have completely different values. I think this is also why the enneagram is used in conjunction with MBTI. "
1618,estj,"I've had a limited number of encounters, but the main problem I encountered was perceived lack of effort on their part.  I became easily frustrated when simple requests went unfulfilled.  Additionally, their ability to focus and stick out certain activities or projects irked me.  "
1619,estj,"No idea, but from what I've heard other people dealing with them they're commies that fail to accept that just because they feel something doesn't make it factually correct and they shouldn't impose their views on others, or try to make them feel bad, just based on that. "
1620,estj,"I'm absolutely wrong when it comes to sensing emotions, ticks, clues.
If it's not clear directions, I won't get it, which is why I know very little boundaries when it comes to friendships and thus am incompatible with people who are damn good at expressing their emotions deftly.
I'm ISTP, so I imagined people would have always had a problem with that issue."
1621,estj,"I'm ISTP, a common mistake is thinking there's a ""Bad"" MBTI type, which isn't really true.
When I have strong views I study the facts and come up with a conclusion, I'm also very vigorous in argument and I attempt to disprove all of who I'm arguing with's points, which people tell me seems like ""I want to prove something.""
I don't think I'm correct all the time nonetheless, no."
1622,estj,"The social aspect of just not getting things is frustrating to a degree. 
There is a guy at work, I don't know if he's ISTP, but he doesn't get how unliked he is. 
And while we keep it professional, we don't want to eat with him on a lunch break, get coffee with him, smoke breaks etc. and he doesn't get it.
Ultimately my frustration at this point comes from not only his terrible work but his lack of self awareness. So if that describes you at all, that would be the frustration point to an ESTJ.
Other than that you're not describing anything too bad. Not getting ticks in a friendship pairs well with someone who is blunt, just give the same honesty back."
1623,estj,"ugggggghhhhhhhnhnhgnhgnhgnhgnhg
Goddamn Keirsey ruining every single SJ description he can get his grimy little hands on, why have you done this to us?"
1624,estj,"Lol, none of the ESTJs I know are like this. One is even leading somewhat of a taboo lifestyle. The only thing that seems to be true across the board is being workhorses. BUT I understand where the notion from the quote comes from, and it's because SJs prefer not to be imaginative, even if they are capable of it. Sometimes I (INFP) talk with SJs on a heavy subject like religion or politics and many of my musings are met with blank stares or completely ignored and the topic is changed. Which I find hilarious. It gets me curious because I desperately want you guys think in the face of absurdity! "
1625,estj,"Hi ESTJs! Lo and behold I am an INFP invading your space :) I am here asking for your advice regarding my closest friend, my mother, who is an ESTJ. We have a very mutual love- hate relationship. My ideas are constantly against her ideas and she always think she is right. So I just follow what she says but it is so exhausting having my opinions put aside. How do I deal with her? Thank you all lovely ESTJs."
1626,estj,"If you live at home you should follow her within reason. She is your mother. Have a direct talk with her about it. State what you mean clearly, but try to be calm. If she gets confrontational or wants to argue, just continue to stay calm and speak softly."
1627,estj,"What may be seen as low blows by you may be seen as honsety by him. Try not to take it personal, chances are he doesn't want to hurt your feelings. Again, as I stated before, you should have a talk with him, and tell him what you want directly, but calmly."
1628,estj,"Im always confused by this description of honesty. I get that that a clear statement of how things are and have been in one person's experience is their truth, but to say that their experience is everyone else's is a very narrow position to take. 
I agree that trying not to take it personally is a good tactic, but I also think the father has an equal responsibility to tap into his Ne to be able to conceive that what or the way he says something is not universally true. The past experience oriented Si + the organizing principles of the Te can create an exceptionally myopic and self centered view of the world in the macro and relationships in the micro."
1629,estj,"My preference goes to comedy, and the more unexpected the better. I hate predictable stuff. 
My fav shows are Xavier Renegade Angel, The Eric Andr√© Show, Louie, Regular Show, The Thick of It, My Name is Earl, The Mighty Boosh, Doctor Who, WLIIA, and The IT Crowd. "
1630,estj,"The shows I currently enjoy watching are Bates Motel, Penny Dreadful, Once Upon a Time, Pretty Little Liars (though it can be infuriating), and Adventure Time.
I don't think I can narrow down what my favorite movies would be. I don't normally like romantic comedies, some stupid comedies, and really, any movie that was poorly made (due to the writing, the directing, etc. whatever the reason may be.)
My favorite authors are Stephen King and V.C. Andrews. I like reading thriller and suspenseful novels, and novels that are really dark and twisted/fucked up."
1631,estj,"Not a big fan of TV anymore. I used to enjoy shows like Friends and Seinfeld. Before I cut the chord, the only show I would watch with some regularity was the Daily Show. I find myself more interested in science minded documentaries these days. And popcorn action flicks, cant forget about those. Explosions are always cool."
1632,estj,"I love Portlandia and Louie! Do you also watch Maron? It's sort of in the same vein as all of those. Marc Maron is a lot more whiny in the show than he comes off in interviews and such, but I still find him amusing."
1633,estj,"This comment made me realize I need an ESTJ friend in my life, haha. I'm exactly like this when it comes to shows and movies, and pretty much no one understands and just thinks I'm going out of my way to find things to complain about. I used to be able to watch anything when I was younger--not so anymore. But I find that if I'm watching something WITH someone and we're not taking it seriously, I can stomach more things than I would alone. However, nothing is worse than feeling obligated to sit through a terrible series because the person watching it with you loves it, so I usually have to watch something on my own first before agreeing to watch it with someone else, unless it's just supposed to be mindless entertainment.
Somewhat related to the last part, I watch a lot of things at night and when I'm alone (and always have) because I'm irrationally terrified of ghosts and think about them less when Netflix is on. :P"
1634,estj,"Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.
See you there (:
https://discord.gg/6xE4qMt Edit: If that link expires, use this one: https://discord.gg/ct8BRps"
1635,estj,"I'm really big on Socionics and use MBTI by translating from Socionics.
It gives me a lot of insight into many of my relationships.
I don't trust most other personality typing systems like the 4 temperaments. I haven't done enough with enneagram to form an opinion. Big 5 seems useful but doesn't seem permanent, so that's probably something different."
1636,estj,"I use MBTI and similar personality systems as a springboard for developing my own ideas that are most effective for me. I pretty frequently disagree with a lot of claims made by MBTI, Socionics, and Keirsey's bullshit (I hate the impact this guy's work makes on personality discussions), but I pull ideas from all of them (except for fucking Keirsey).  I'm interested in the relationship between letter dichotomies, function axes, Socionic quadras, etc, and developing my own, personal systems with inspiration from all of them. Not in a formal sense, I don't write a lot of it down, but I think about them a lot. There are some aspects I've neglected, though. The conventional ""temperaments"" (NT, NF, SJ and SP specifically, I don't mind EJ, IJ, EP, IP), Reinin dichotomies (although they have correlated pretty well with my observations), and a few other things. 
Honestly, the only scientifically rigorous personality system I know of is the Big 5, but it all seems pretty obvious. I could figure out if someone was agreeable or not without that system, it rarely provides any insight. "
1637,estj,"I doubt the Big 5 is there to provide personal insight. I see it more as a tool for statistics.
Example: People with low conscientiousness and high extroversion tend to consume more alcohol. And people with low extroversion, high agreeableness and low openness tend to abstain from alcohol altogether."
1638,estj,"Oh gotcha, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty good at judging how someone else will react to what I say-then slightly adjust what I say accordingly-if that makes sense. 
For friends and family, there‚Äôs nothing that I won‚Äôt say out loud lmao. At work or with acquaintances etc. it depends on the person I‚Äôm talking to-but I‚Äôm pretty open regardless"
1639,estj,"Hi everyone,
I'm a female INFJ and have been in a relationship with an ESTJ in the past. It was by far the best connection I've ever had, and I still miss him from time to time... If curious, I've written about my recent thoughts on my ESTJ ex in the INFJ subreddit.
What are your impressions/thoughts on INFJ women in general?"
1640,estj,"I'd like to think that I have a high opinion of INFJs, considering I married one.  I think, generally, we compliment each other pretty well.  My extroverted side can exhaust her introverted side at times though.  I also feel my natural, knee jerk inclination to step in and ""do"" what needs to be done can be at odds with her more patient approach and desire to get things exactly right.  I tell people it's like what happens when the unstoppable force meets an immovable object. :p"
1641,estj,"Im supposedly and INFJ female, and my husband is supposedly ESTJ. If I had to guess at what he thinks of me, an INFJ woman, based on what he's said:
He admires that I have me feelings and beliefs and stick to them. I always criticize myself for getting a philosophy degree, but he says its one of his favorite things about me - because I did what I loved, not what I should have done.
He always says he loves that I have a kind/good heart. I dont know where he gets this because I think Im awfully cynical, but thats a big one for him.
He is always telling me to be more decisive and assertive, and that I need to work on my confidence and ability to converse with people I dont know. And communicate in general.
He struggles with my inability to take criticism well, and that my emotions can be more powerful than my reason. Which I acknowledge.
I dont know if this helps you, but this is my anecdotal answer! If we are typed right, this is what a particular M-ESTJ thinks of a particular F-INFJ."
1642,estj,"Thanks for your comment!
I literally laughed out loud at your analogy: ""the unstoppable force meets an immovable object."" Hahahahaah!!! 
I really think my best romantic connection was with an ESTJ because I admired/respected him as much as I loved him. The ""do"" part is very appreciated, although we might not express the gratitude often enough. 
If you don't mind, would you be willing to share a little about how you got to date her? I'm just in the mood for a good INFJ-ESTJ story. Sigh. 
It's been a few years since my break-up with an ESTJ (due to our future plans not aligning), but I do think about him from time to time. :/
Edit: grammar"
1643,estj,"Whoa. Another INFJ-ESTJ couple!
Hahaha, by ""wrong reasons"" do you mean emotional, passion-driven, intuitive reasons that ignore logic and practicality? The way in which we make every major life decisions, including the selection of our spouse? Hahaha
Her intuition probably told her to stick to her ESTJ. :)
What does ""lots of judging"" look like?"
1644,estj,"eh?
i'm confused by what you're saying... because INFJs are rare, i'm an ISFJ? all the tests i've taken since high school til now (more than ten years later) have given me INFJ as results. both MBTI and socionics.
there's nothing cool about being rare, either... i don't think i've ever talked myself into being an INFJ. haha
i actually think the likelihood of any type ending up with an ESTJ is very high because there's a lot of ESTJs, especially in the male population...?"
1645,estj,"Which restaurant should we go to? What do you think of the new neighbors? Is that show good anymore? What do you think of this outfit? Do you think we can paint that wall next weekend?  Should we have more kids?
We decide what is better in any situation immediately.  Even if we don't need to."
1646,estj,"https://youtu.be/p8RHW3xMAds  **sorry based on this i meant INFP. watch the video, she says it better than i ever could... and no, not just because INFJ is rare. I was just assuming youre more likely typed wrong than he is since ESTJ is most abundant, but he could be typed wrong. i mean its totally possible you both really are INFJ/ESTJ (i dont know you) just making an observation, something to think about!    "
1647,estj,"I agree. Even one or two out of a hundred isn't even that rare. If 16 types were equally distributed, it's still around 6 per 100.. 
And I actually think I heard a psychologist say that the original percentage was drawn from a sample of generally white male population. "
1648,estj,"I‚Äôve always assumed ESTJs have no difficulty ‚Äòtelling people off‚Äô (that‚Äôs what other MBTI types have said). I have no problem telling people what to do, but I can‚Äôt seem say things like ‚Äòyour behaviour is unacceptable yada yada yada‚Äô. 
Anyone else? Thoughts? Opinions? Or am I just an unhealthy ESTJ because I prefer to avoid conflict? "
1649,estj,"It depends on a few things, but in general, it's not too difficult for me to tell someone off. 
For example, if I am confident that whoever is on the receiving end of my ""wrath"" is not going to cut all ties from me afterward, then I have no problems laying into them. 
If I know that there is a sensitive person who would not take it well, then I'm not going to bother. That would put me in a counterproductive situation where nothing would be accomplished. That being said, for me ""telling someone off"" is less of a personal attack, and more of a ""please listen to me, I'm trying to help you see how to be better"" type of thing. 
I take care of my ISFP uncle by doing the tasks around the house that he cannot do anymore because he is getting older. Sometimes he will stubbornly go outside and lift a heavy piece of machinery and potentially hurt himself. I cannot stand this, so I tell him off. I don't take pride in it, and I don't like to tell him off because he can be overly sensitive sometimes, but I care more about his well being than his feelings. In this case, I don't find it difficult to tell him off because I know that he still loves and accepts me for who I am, and knows that I mean well. We have a... Black and White relationship. We can either get along really really well, or he just bugs me sometimes. 
I'm in college, and I study music in a place where there are a lot of my peers who think it's okay to slack off, not practice, skip class and prioritize debauchery over academics. I wouldn't feel comfortable telling my peers off in this instance because they would think I'm a stuck-up goodie two shoes and not want to be around me. "
1650,estj,"In my experience, ESTJs with more developed Fi are more aware of, and considerate of, others' feelings; making ""telling people off"" more complicated.  I have seen this change in myself as I've gotten older and life experience has forced growth of my Fi."
1651,estj,"It depends. And it also depends on what estj you are I am 3w2 so yes. But especially life choices. I know what‚Äôs right but I can‚Äôt tell others what‚Äôs right. Like I have no backbone even if I know that lifestyle choice is wrong to say so. I want to but yeah, I use to be better at it but had less friends. I know practically everyone these days. I‚Äôve had issues of saying no though."
1652,estj,"You‚Äôre back again haha
That‚Äôs what I meant, well, I guess either way I am essentially telling them off. ‚ÄòWould you mind yada yada yada‚Äô still sounds like I‚Äôm telling them off, does it not? (Ok, that sounded like an attack‚Ä¶) Asking them to act a certain way seems rude. But I get what you mean, maybe I‚Äôll ask a friend to reword what I want to say, because I know I often come across as blunt or harsh.
Yeah, generally people want a reason as to why, but my answer isn‚Äôt a good enough reason - we‚Äôll see. I‚Äôd say either the person I have a problem with is either very sensitive (tears and all that drama) OR they wonder why I‚Äôm being so irritated when I usually take jokes really well.
Thank you :)"
1653,estj,"I agree, if I know the person‚Äôs reaction, then I‚Äôll decide accordingly. But most people I have so called problems with, I don‚Äôt make a habit of associating with them. I‚Äôm pretty much clueless about how they will react. I can only categorise people into roughly two groups: the sensitive (meaning crying) and the people who aren‚Äôt that sensitive (being defensive/angry/yelling OR an actual proper, mature conversation).
That‚Äôs completely fine, your helping your uncle because you don‚Äôt want him to get injured. I‚Äôd have no problem speaking up in that case, but I‚Äôm more on the ‚Äòpersonal problem‚Äô side. For example, I don‚Äôt like how someone is being irritating etc. 
I wouldn‚Äôt tell my peers off either, unless it actually concerns me, then I might consider it (it depends). My friends at uni think I‚Äôm a goody two shoes haha"
1654,estj,"Any tips-wait, are you an ESTJ? Just curious, because I know I‚Äôm horribly blunt, which is fine most of the time, but not in this kind of situation. Any tips on how you now go about ‚Äòtelling people off?‚Äô "
1655,estj,"I think for me, it‚Äôs more, let others do what they want. If it doesn‚Äôt concern me, then I don‚Äôt have any right to tell them how they‚Äôre living their life. You would prefer to have more friends and ‚Äòno backbone‚Äô than less friends and have a backbone?"
1656,estj,"Yes, I am an ESTJ. For me, it's all about the balance between the discomfort of the moment (vocalizing your frustration, annoyance, etc.) and the amount of discontent I'll feel if I DON'T take a stand. Brene Brown tells you that it's better to choose discomfort over resentment in most cases and that choosing to politely set a boundary with someone in the moment (a bit uncomfortable) will pay off big by minimizing massive resentment and anger (and a big blow out) in the future. I find that I can do this with most people, but not all (e.g. unhealthy feelers and hyper-sensitive to criticism thinkers). 
Another way I've been thinking about it lately is Mark Manson's theory of ""some things are more important than feelings"", like personal values and boundaries. When someone steps way out of line, I have no problem letting my inner-ESTJ out and telling them off. I try to keep it from getting to that point, though, because that's not my best self, ya know?"
1657,estj,"I like a backbone it‚Äôs just that at the end of the day I am a people pleaser but if I have less friends I also have less to talk to and less opportunities and It doesn‚Äôt seem nice. It‚Äôs more like people pleasing a little, but not blatantly obvious that it is. I just don‚Äôt know how to say it without ruining my image I think that‚Äôs it. I am huge on looking good."
1658,estj,"Wow, thank you so much
Small issues a fine, honesty first always, but if I know it could turn into a huge argument, I usually just deal with it. 
That is exactly me, but usually what happens is I simmer for 9+ years then BOOM I blow up - not the healthiest way to solve a problem, I know. One problem was resolved, I don‚Äôt speak to her anymore and the other basically said ‚Äòdeal with it‚Äô.
Yes, those types are exactly the ones I struggle with - the ones that think they‚Äôve done nothing wrong and the ones that a super duper sensitive. "
1659,estj,"I've seen a lot of the folks talk about music and MBTI and its quite tough to type Musicians as such.
You ESTJs fill me with hatred and admiration for your dogged persistence. I type Steve Vai as an ESTJ,  He is possibly one of the most talented guitarists there is. 
Metallica's James Hetfield, ESTJ again ! 
I would love to discover new artists of your type. I definitely think each type is drawn to its own Musicians. 
So I invite y'all to come over to  -"
1660,estj,"I think Steve Vai is technically great, but he kinda sucks in the way that his music doesn't mean anything to me. I think he fakes emotion too much. Like, his music isn't even that emotional, yet he overacts on stage as if it is. Lol.
I prefer anything by Slash over Vai. "
1661,estj,"Always been into the sciences. I like the methodology and the way it yields reliable results. 
As for mind games (I assume you mean manipulating people to get a desired result). I don't think so at least not in a emotionally manipulative and slimy way. Honesty, reliability, tradition and integrity are large parts of the ESTJ persona. You can't be seen as any of those if you are acting like a lizard.
If I want something. I will say it. However if I know I can't get it now, I will work / position myself so I could get it if asked in a transparent discussion."
1662,estj,"Physics, yes, math, not really. But frankly I'm much more into philosophy and art in a pedantic sense than science.
I cannot speak for every ESTJ myself but I do not initiate mind games. I'd play along if I have to, but I'm not fond of them. Of all methods, I prefer actual hard work and precision."
1663,estj,"My boyfriend is an ESTJ and is an actor with strong interests in literature and philosophy, and falls a bit flat with math and sciences. He does have good capability to understand new concepts, though, but I don't think that's ESTJ related as much as it is just that he's an intelligent person. ESTJs also like directness, so mind games are counterproductive. 
I'd say no to both of those questions. "
1664,estj,"Like I said in the title, I keep testing as ESTJ, but I feel more like ISTJ or even IIFJ. I read the descriptions, and they do seem to fit.
I fit that very well. I am listed as promotable very often in reviews at work even, and I feel I lead well. Still, I think I am more introverted. I was only 51% extroverted versus 49% introverted anyway. Outside of work, social events with a lot of talking put strain on me, but I don't like being the quiet one either. I feel awkward if I am the quiet one and find ways to make conversation even though I feel more comfortable being around someone I care about silently. I don't like being alone, but I enjoy silent time. I'd just walk or watch TV in silence with someone I care about or am close with; I don't mind listening, but I'd rather observe than speak.
I like having friends even though all my close friends only talk to me online anymore. I moved away from most of them, and it has been hard for me to make lasting connections in my area. 
I am very intuitive, too. I figure things out on the fly, adapting quickly. Everyone comes to me for thinking outside of the box. I predict things so well that my fiancee likes to make fun of me calling me a psychic. I can tell her how people will act or even what will happen in a TV show. I enjoy watching a TV through to prove that I was right in my assumptions. My fiancee doesn't understand it. She asks me why I watch something if I know what is going to happen. I tell her I just like being right and laugh.
I am very emotional too. I have trouble going to therapy, but I always want to talk about my feelings with someone I am close to until I feel like I have unloaded and can be comfortably silent again. I have a history of abuse from a female teenage babysitter, and I have had toxic relationships and been cheated on a bunch of times. I wonder if that has more to do with me feeling, but I can also be a bit of an emotional sponge. It seems like I can predict and feel what others are feeling at times. I have trouble watching very awkward scenes on TV because I can literally feel the awkwardness the character is going through as they go through it... same thing even in person if I see an awkward personal situation go down.
Anyone else here get similar impressions of themselves?"
1665,estj,"I can't offer too much help here, other than telling you, I have an ESTJ uncle, and an ISTJ father, who are seriously living stereotypes of their MBTI type, and you don't sound like either of them.
I'm guessing you aren't extraverted. I'm thinking probably ISTJ, but not entirely sure. You could by a shy-ish ESTJ, or either ESFJ/ISFJ. To really get at the core of what MBTI is, you should learn how each function presents itself. So, one by one, Google Se, Te, Ti, etc, and see how they match up with your experience. This is a great way of understanding yourself a little better. 
Personality tests are extremely superficial. In my instance, I am an INFP, but I would be a fool to say there is not a logical answer to everything/most things. For a long time, I was thrown off by the questions themselves. 
Good luck, PM me or reply here if you need further help."
1666,estj,"Have you heard of Ambiversion? It's a ""type"" between Extraversion and Introversion. You probably fit that description, I know I do. check out /r/ambivert Each of the 4 traits (e/i, s/n, f/t, p/j) is on a scale so it's important to recognize that also you might be VERY Extraverted, feeling and judging, your s/n letter might change based on the day of the week because you might fit both at different specific times! :)"
1667,estj,"You want to watch a movie. You don't feel like going by yourself.
You ask your friend to come along. He/she added you to their movie group.
They decided to go on Sunday, but you aren't free on that day.
You suggested an alternative date, but another member that belongs definitively in the group rejected your proposal.
He doesn't want to compromise. He fixed the date and told you to watch it by yourself.
 You don't necessarily need/want to hang with people you don't know. 
What would you do?"
1668,estj,"'Recruit' someone else? There should be someone I know out there who can watch a movie with me. And if bad comes to worse I could always buy an escort.
Wait, this was actually a joke but I will just roll with it, because the answer is genius. I call an escort and go with her to the cinema. Try to top this, you can't.
Well I can, 2 escorts."
1669,estj,"But discussing a movie with friends is usually more fun than watching the movie itself. Not just consuming art but absorbing it. And having people who understand in-jokes and references is also nice.
It is like sex. The more the merrier."
1670,estj,"Are there any other disabled people who type as ESTJs? How do you view your disability? How do you deal with it or how do you find you deal with it? Personally, I am a totally blind ESTJ, and personally, are usually do not think or notice my disability much. Fortunately for me I had a lot of help, but I‚Äôve also had how to work with my disability figured out. So far I‚Äôve had my share of successes in life and for that I‚Äôm very grateful!"
1671,estj,"Like how I am reading this? I use an iphone. And the software voice over, which is built in reads out all that is on screan, including banners I think they‚Äôre called? So, yes, it tells me what notifications I get like just now, this post you posted. But if you want a notifications app, hmmm. I don‚Äôt know."
1672,estj,"Hi, I‚Äôm a ENFP dude, currently pursuing an ESTJ for a romantic relationship. To start off, I know relationships and compatability aren‚Äôt defined by personality types, but they do give a good baseline for how people think and behave. However, I felt it would be really helpful in consulting other ESTJs in how I carry conversations with an ESTJ. Despite having a really good first date where talked for about 4 hours, I find that many times it is difficult to talk to her about more big-picture things and emotions, which is fine. But I‚Äôm  having a hard time finding topics we can easily talk about, and running into roadblocks in conversations... thankfully, I‚Äôm quick enough on my feet to have fun conversations. I‚Äôm curious to what is interesting to talk about and why.
TL;DR: Me ENFP, her ESTJ. What do ESTJ‚Äôs like to talk about? Why?"
1673,estj,"So happy to find someone else like me! I am an ENFP (25m) and have been dating an ESTJ (20f) for about 6 months now. The internet has so little information on ESTJ-ENFP relationships (actually ESTJ relationships in general).
Im definitely no expert, but here  are a couple of things I've learned:
1 - ENFP's have an amazing talent of saying things in the nicest way possible. Often this means saying something in an indirect way. This is almost perfectly opposite of ESTJ's, who like to bluntly say it how it is and they don't care who they offend. They simply don't understand why you would want to ""beat around the bush"". When telling your ESTJ how you feel about something, use your Te instead of Fi to say it as directly and openly as possible. Tell her what you actually actually feel instead of how you think she thinks you should feel. This may seem disrespectful to you (at first), but perfectly normal to her.
2 - don't let her (or other people) run over you. ESTJ women get really bothered by men who just let themselves get pushed around. She will try to test you by manipulating you with her natural intimidating nature. She will say things just to be contrary. When you let her run over you and do what she wants (even if you don't really care), she will see that as weakness and won't be able to trust your judgement and leadership where it counts. Along with this, don't let her convince you to do things that don't line up with who you want to be. This will be hard at first because you are tolerant about most things and pushing back at her seems intolerant and offensive, but in reality this will help her be able to trust that you are being honest with her and taking a stand about the things that matter to you. ESTJ's have deep-rooted convictions and don't feel comfortable trusting someone who doesn't stick to their own convictions.
3 - don't act like you agree with something that she says unless you actually do agree. ENFP's have a weakness where they just agree with someone to be nice. ESTJ's pick up on ""fakeness"" really really fast, and dislike when people don't agree but just say they do to be nice. Also, never lie about any past experience to build rapport with someone.
4 - educate yourself on cognitive types, functional stacks, and the strengths and weaknesses of each type. The ""Personality Hacker"" podcast is a great way to start. Look especially for the episodes about ENFP types, including 
-ENFP personality advice
-Ne-Te cognigive loop
-developing Feeling (Fi) as an auxiliary function
One warning - never assume that you know her just because you know her type. Knowing each other's types and functional stacks is helpful in identifying causes of behavioral differences, but won't help you predict exactly how the other person will respond about something. It's really easy to assume that ""well, since she's an ESTJ she probably thinks this"". Your personalities are so different that you won't be able to identify what she likes and dislikes unless you ask her."
1674,estj,"I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend is ENFP, we‚Äôre both female, she can drive me nuts because I feel like she lives on another planet sometimes... I would say in your dealings with her, be 100% transparent, be a straight shooter, don‚Äôt be evasive or she will view you as shifty and untrustworthy. You don‚Äôt have to avoid certain topics or anything ...be natural and be yourself just apply the things I mentioned up there and it will be great. Personalities I find don‚Äôt necessarily affect interests...but she will be passionate about things she‚Äôs into and will most likely take them seriously, not lightly. Just be a stand up dude and be honest about everything. Once you lose our trust it can be hard to get it back. "
1675,estj,"I guess I can give the perspective of an ESTJ who does not pair well with quite a few ENFPs. And I will share what went wrong. 
The first ENFP friend I had was also one of the first real friends I ever had. We met in homeroom in the 6th grade. Right off the bat some of the main problems that started arising was that she was all about groups of people and making sure no one felt left out, but I wasn't. I wanted to only be with friends I liked and felt like she was always just leaving me behind in order to include everyone else. Fast forward to 13 years later and I can honestly say that was one of the biggest issues we dealt with which constantly hurt me.  
ENFPs are huge group people always wanting to hang with everyone and make everyone feel special and included. I am literally the exact opposite of that. I don't want to be friends with everyone, I want a select few and I want them to be the most important people to me. 
I am a social (networking) butterfly and can connect with just about anyone, but at the end of the day, I have my few friends and they are the ones I want to spend the most time with. And I'd prefer if I wasn't constantly fighting for their time and attention. 
I also met another ENFP in high school and we were besties, it was a group of 4 (ENTJ, INTP, and ENFP and then me) I was probably closest to the ENTJ but had a lot of time after school with the ENFP and we were total goofs together. After we graduated and moved on she pretty much did with every ENFP tends to do and just leaves you in the dust. We have the hardest time catching up, and she's always ""busy"" but is constantly posting pictures on social media with other people (we also live in the same city). And I'm just convinced that if you are apart of an ENFPs life by a class, a club, a job, church.... or something similar, you'll be spending plenty of them with them, but if your lives are different and you have to catch up with them, it's nearly impossible to get with them. 
I had an ENFP mentor who I was in a small womens group with her and she was amazing, and again, when I was in the group we always were able to go out to coffee or lunch and hang and she made me feel so special and then I moved and she never responds to me on facebook or anywhere else and it just sucks. 
Why do ENFPs just leave you once you are no longer apart of their social circles? Why can't they simply answer a fucking text or message asking how they are doing? How come if I don't see you regularly I become non-existent? 
3 times it's happened to the point where when I meet another ENFP I keep them as far away as possible and don't even bother getting close or personal to them because I know it won't last. 
I work with one now and she drives me insane and I know I'm not easy to work with either, but she's 6 years younger than I am so it's a very distant relationship anyways, but I love her creativity and really appreciate working with her.  
I have an INFP best friend who lives 1500 miles away and we talk almost every single day and have for the past 4 years, either facetime, memes or just messaging. She makes a point to keep me in her life, and that's why I have such a problem with ENFPs. I am not holding them to unattainable standards or expecting too much from them. "
1676,estj,"I am an ENFP female who is totally in love with an ESTJ man.  It's really hard sometimes and fair communication and space is HUGE.  It's really important to try to understand the differences in our personalities.  ESTJs will show love through actions - helping you do things that need to be done.  You need to appreciate that, it is important.  We hit roadblocks because I tend to approach conversations in a way that says you are doing x and it is making me feel y.  This is not a good approach for the enfp / estj pairing.  It is better to say I am feeling this thing and sometimes things you do make me feel this way and I am not blaming you but could you work with me on it.  ENFPs will also struggle believing ESTJs because sometimes they will come off as uncaring because they are direct and relying a lot less on emotion than we are, so when I feel like he should be apologetic about something and he does not believe he did anything wrong - we hit a wall.   However, honest talks that allow both people to honestly evaluate their own roles in the roadblocks are hugely helpful in my experience.  My ESTJ is the best.  It is not easy but no relationship is and we really bring out the best in each other and in good times, admire and appreciate the other person for embodying the things we struggle with.  I also find that when you try to consider the ESTJs actions and let them know how much you appreciate them for the things they do and are good at, they are MUCH more willing to discuss all our crazy theories.  My longest best friend is an ESTJ too and it's crazy how similar the issues and wonders are in those relationships and I do anything I can to nurture the connection with them, I hate the hate ESTJs get - they are awesome people."
1677,estj,"My husband (ESTJ) and I (ENFP) typically don't talk a ton about deep emotional stuff, I mean, we do when we need to or if one of us is feeling particularly like we need that connection, but we do goof around a lot and have inside jokes. We really don't worry about the lighthearted nature of our  conversations. Ithink it's more of the fact that I can't rely on him completely for my emotional support. I really need a lot of connection from friends and family so I don't overwhelm him."
1678,estj,"Oh also, just skip the small talk - neither of you actually enjoy it. 
And, make sure you spend enough time together, just the two of you. It's way too easy to hang out with other people the whole time and you can get disconnected from each other."
1679,estj,"holy shit that sounds too exhausting, would that even be considered a relationship? 
It sounds like it could even become borderline abusive if the ESTJ went too far. Who has time to police what shit they say to each other and do ‚Äòtests‚Äô? Thats demeaning as hell."
1680,estj,"Thank you so much. I didn‚Äôt realize how much it meant to her for me to constantly be in touch with her. I was worried I would look to clingy, but I think she did appreciate it because I think she felt like I was pulling away (I was) because I didn‚Äôt like her anymore. (I like her a lot though). This will definitely help me in the future."
1681,estj,"While relationships between two people of such differing personality types often doesn't work out well, if you put the effort into it to making it work, these can be the most rewarding relationships ever! 
I am still in a relationship with her (10 months now) and love her to death. And not the ""hmm I really think this is going to last for the next few years"" type of relationship. It's the ""man I couldn't imagine myself marrying anyone else for the rest of it life"" type. I'm serious about this.
No matter whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, every woman will test you, just like every boss will test you and every one of your children will test you. They need proof of who you are and what you're made of. They want to see if you will measure up to their expectations. If you fail those tests, trust and confidence in the relationship is broken, and it is hard work to gain back their trust. The sooner you learn this fact of life and learn how to properly respond to these tests, the better quality of life will be. Check out the book ""What Women Want When They Test Men"" by Bruce Bryans.
It just so happens that the woman I fell in love with has a personality that doesn't naturally mesh well with mine. As a result, this relationship requires a little more work for the both of us. It means we are required to communicate about everything because, even though we usually see eye to eye, we often don't approach it from the same angle so it seems like we disagree initially. That is why it is extremely helpful (however not actually necessary) to understand each other's personality types and learn why your partner thinks differently than you. And, as a side benefit, understanding another person very intimately will automatically improve your understanding of other people and help you build rapport with them."
1682,estj,"And remember that one-on-one time is extremely important to an ESTJ. 
If you didn't have a lot of time together, you turning down something with others just to spend time with the ESTJ says so much to them. Soooo much. I get that you all have these huge social circles and a million activities and are always invited out, but an ESTJ knowing you turned it down just to be with them is something that speaks volumes. 
And ESTJs aren't necessarily all about that party life. We might be extroverts, but we like spending our time with those we care about. Parties and concerts and bars and nightlife aren't really our thing. We will go occasionally and really do like a good party, but for me at least, it's rare that I go out more than twice a month.  
I like going on dates with just my guy. Going to the park and kayaking down the river, going on a hike, going to the shooting range. I like dates that are actual activities and not just sit down and talk all night. 
I love that my INTJ partner texts me almost every single day, even if it's just a simple hope you're doing okay. We are long-distance which is hard enough for me, so knowing he at least is saying hi means a lot to me. I guess that some people see that as super clingy or annoying, but he's not asking what I'm doing at all hours of the day or gets paranoid if I'm not responding right away, and I don't get that way either, but that simple checkup is perfect. Or a funny meme or video he saw. Just knowing I'm on his mind is great. Even just watching the same show and catching up on what are thoughts about it was. Gosh, that honestly means the freaking world to me, as dumb as it sounds. I'm super romantic and buying me flowers (or sending me) and those small simple reminders that you are thinking about me are what matter most. 
I am financially well off and HATE when people try and take care of me, so don't do that to her, DO NOT act like you are taking care of her, I swear she will end it if you do. Respect her independence or end it now. Even if I am not financially well off I still hate when people try and do everything for me and treat me like a charity case. I find it extremely insulting. Just let me figure it out for myself. And believe me, I will end a relationship if you don't treat me like an equal and respect my need for independence. You might think I'm overreacting, but ESTJ females do not like being submissive in a relationship and letting the man take care of her. She probably will never be a stay at home mom and will want to work as much as possible. There are times when I allow my INTJ to help pay for something, but he lets me pay for dates or flights out to see him because he knows I would refuse if he offered and instead of saying him making a big deal he respects that. 
She is her own person, and you are her partner. You are equals, you might play different roles in life but at the end of the day, you are equals. You are not going to be the man who takes care of her or does things for her that she can do for herself. 
ESTJs love others by doing things for them. Cooking a meal he loves, helping him run errands, cleaning the house so he doesn't have to worry about it, doing laundry, doing anything he needs. I love through actions. Not words, so if I say ""I love you"" I fucking mean it, it's never going to be casual. I am only affectionate with my SO. I want to hold his hand and I love hugs and cuddles, but he is the only person I will ever be affectionate with. And gifts are cute as long as it's not crap I don't need.  I had a friend buy me a 4 pack of Redbulls because he knew I loved them, especially with vodka. That gift meant the world to me.  Buying something expensive to try and impress me won't work, don't try. If she doesn't wear jewelry, don't buy her jewelry. I'm pretty simple so keep any gifts you buy simple. Buying me surprise coffee, I will never turn down coffee, or flowers, a stuffed animal of my favorite animal. Things that have meaning in my life. A teddy bear won't mean as much as a stuffed penguin. ESTJs are pretty specific about things they love so if you buy a gift make it simple. 
ESTJs are simple people as long as you listen to them. Don't make assumptions thinking you know them better than they know themselves. We are very much, say what you mean and mean what you say. If I say No, it means NO, I'm not going to say no if I don't mean it. Don't read into what we do, and don't tell us you think there is deeper meaning either. "
1683,estj,"That book would be good, but I‚Äôm a girl so yeah lol.
I mean I get having expectations in a relationship and testing them a LITTLE bit while dating and things to see if they‚Äôre compatible with me, but beyond that, I think their character is already obvious from how they present themselves. 
I don‚Äôt value traits that the ESTJ does, so I would never do testing the way they would, and is not the relationship for me. 
edit: I also really loved your last paragraph, I think that was explained well with opposing personalities, I get it now!
I also feel that you have the added benefit of being a male and better physical strength, as well as cultural biases that tell you to be strong. I still wonder how a ESTJ male and female version of your relationship would even work, I feel like the power dynamics would be favoured to the man, be cause they will always be physically stronger, so the worst case scenario doesn‚Äôt look good. But best case scenario would be a kickass awesome family, thats good too :)"
1684,estj,"I'm not sure if it's really unintentional, but whenever I talk nobody seems to want to listen or answer my questions. I'll have to repeat myself, and sometimes even then they ignore me.
I don't like getting ignored. What do you think is the cause of this? Are any ESTJs like this?"
1685,estj,"Sometimes ESTJs talking about unnecessary things especially with people that they are feel near to Them. I personally try to replay but things my ESTJ mention doesn‚Äôt have a replay! Then I go frank. If you talk about every little things people can‚Äôt hear your significant things among EVERYTHING. 
By the way you are good listeners with low memory and no matter what,  you are always there and that‚Äôs means a lot."
1686,estj,"This probably isn‚Äôt useful, but (in some cases) the more people try to make me do something (if I don‚Äôt want to do it), the less likely I will be to do whatever it is they want me to do (we‚Äôre stubborn).
To answer your question directly: idk"
1687,estj,"If you're already trying to motivate an ESTJ to work harder I think there's a problem. Growing up I always had plans and goals. I was very future-oriented, so the thought that you (op)  are trying to get your younger brother to work harder to reach his goals might just be the problem. 
ESTJs value their independence and like accomplishing things on their own and I'm sorta getting the feeling that you are trying to assert yourself in thinking it's your responsibility whether he does something or not.  
The second someone else tries to help me do anything I almost immediately give up. And I'm talking about goals and plans that I have. I like to keep a lot of that stuff to myself and just because you can't see it doesn't mean nothing is happening. 
Can I ask what goals we're talking about here? Has he told you them? Has he asked for help? Has he given you any indication that he needs help? "
1688,estj,"INFPs (Socionics EII) are superb motivators for us. ISFPs too.
Other good things are curiosity. Give us good problems to solve. Good probably means he has some ideas about how to solve them.
We often get told things and interpret them wrong because we took people literally. Make sure that he's got the right idea for the subjects he's having trouble on."
1689,estj,"So it depends what type of estj I am a 3w2 so achievement is my thing some may be 1w2 and are different or 8w7.
I want to ask what goals your goals or his goals? Maybe he‚Äôs working hard but you don‚Äôt know it? I‚Äôve had arguments as to who‚Äôs goals a lot. I don‚Äôt take interest in your goals sorry. I don‚Äôt want to do this. Yeah, this may be your priority but it isn‚Äôt mine, and here is why. Sometime they listen and sometime they won‚Äôt.
For example I am busy up to my eyeballs with other stuff and I left some paperwork to my father. I am also blind so filling stuff out is a tedious and b inaccessible. He‚Äôs found a bunch of scholarships but that‚Äôs not my top priority. Am I not driven? No. Absolutely not, but that‚Äôs just not my priority. I‚Äôve also been told I look like I do nothing. What cranking up my music and doing stuff is doing nothing? Okay? Haha! And then there are periods of burn out I am a 3 so that may make sense."
1690,estj,"A million times this. I'm a procrastinating ESTJ and my wife manipulates me this way. (not a bad thing, this sub and my other list taught her how.) The other thing is make it about competition or performance. If we can compete or look uber competent at something we will salivate like a rabid dog."
1691,estj,"He has learning difficulties but I know he is capable of achieving a lot of he just applies himself more. 
He isn‚Äôt sure what he wants to do you which is understandable because he is young but as a supportive brother I want to help him in any way I can. I asked him to take the mbti I test to see what type of personality he is so that I could figure out the best way to help him..."
1692,estj,"Not sure why this got downvoted, but it's absolutely true. This is the only thing that really drives me to do something. Telling me I can't or shouldn't do something will push me to do it more than anything else. I might not even want to do it anymore but will do it because proving people wrong gives me more satisfaction than anything else."
1693,estj,"It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do. Spent a lot of time working random jobs before I found what I enjoyed. Was all over the place and felt like a mess, but that never stopped me or discouraged me to stop trying. 
Honestly, I think ESTJs thrive most when people back off. The more you try and help the more discouraged we get as it can come off as you thinking we are incapable of doing it ourselves. 
I know that sounds strange, but as an ENTJ yourself, do you sometimes hate when other people step in and try and help you with anything at all? We're independent individuals, we don't like people trying to figure things out for us, we want to do it alone, because it makes our successes feel better, knowing we did it ourselves. 
EXTJs are the most likely to enjoy helping others succeed but at the same time are the last ones to enjoy when anyone helps us. And while a lot of people love our help, you are going to come across EXTJs that like yourself want to be left alone. 
I think as long as you remain a supportive brother that's the best you can do for an ESTJ. "
1694,estj,"When I'm working with a group, I'm sometimes very commanding, but only if others aren't doing their share of work to a high standard. If I'm in an environment where everyone is working hard - and well - I don't feel the need to boss people around (though I do prefer to have a degree of authority over the project). I want to succeed, and that isn't going to happen with people who refuse to participate.
Frankly, it sounds like you've read too many ESTJ stereotypes. "
1695,estj,"Fair enough. I always say there's some truth in stereotypes, since in most cases they derive from witnessing overtime a recurring behavioural trend from certain groups of people and now with mbti this is linked to a preference for a certain cognitive function stack. I ask these questions to see how certain mbti types respond when being stereotyped. Responses range from defensively, self-reflectively, dismissively etc. None of which is suprising. 
Thanks!"
1696,estj,"Are you 12? Do you seriously believe that most of the ""jerkfaces"" in the world are ESTJs? You've been going around this sub talking about how shitty ESTJs are, it sounds like you've had a really bad experience with one (or at least one that you believe is an ESTJ). Why the vendetta?"
1697,estj,"I suppose there are some truths to MBTI stereotypes. I mean, after all, that's literally what MBTI is all about. However, when used incorrectly, they can get frustrating. I was reading through some INFP forum about ESTJs and their perception of us was so ridiculously skewed. A few people made the claim that ESTJs and INFPs can literally never get along. I know one INFP in real life and we get along very well. 
I think people's stereotypes of ESTJs are often very different to reality. Any ""good"" ESTJ will be typed as something else, those with overwhelming Te being labelled ENTJ and those with well developed Ne being labelled ENTP, and anyone that seems too bossy or structured gets labelled as ESTJ.
Generally, xSxJs are pretty sensitive to stereotypes, as we have some pretty shit stereotypes. xSFJs are often assumed to be dumb and xSTJs are often assumed to be bland. You may have been asking a genuine question and that's fine, but you may need to be more clear in the future."
1698,estj,"This is true. My husband can sometimes come off as very blunt. English is also his second language, so a lot of nuance can be lost.
As an ENTP, I'm also accused of being insensitive, but I'm typically also more interested in winning others to my side than my husband often appears! "
1699,estj,"Hey I figure you deserve a reply.  ESTJ's have tormented me my entire life.  My father is a walking stereotype and I honestly couldn't ask for a more loyal, caring, or giving Dad.  That being said it's just always been a given that he has believed that I am developmentally challanged and has a list of mental disorders he believes I have.  I am a stereotypical INFP so I share you guy's primary 4 cognitive functions, you guys just have them ass-backwords.  
All my life ESTJ bosses, teachers, coworkers have smelled the irrationality in me and have gone out of their way to tear me down whenever possible.  In almost any and every conversation I've ever had with my father my entire life, he will just let slip some little comment that happens to be rude as shit cutting me down, but carries on as if it was just a given fact not worth considering, and any mention would be considered further obvious proof that there is something wrong with me. Micro-managing ESTJ bosses make me want to rip my hair out.  
My dad focused so much into teaching me to be super logical that I can be very logical, but I describe it as akin to bringing an atomic warhead to a tennis match.  I find logic very unnerving and it makes me very uncomfortable when someone explains a solution in terms of pure logic, blind to the fact that they are simply wrong or their logic is faulty with skewed information or incorrect assumptions.  
I was rather inconsiderate this morning and you probably realized I came in here to find an argument.  I do find your replies humorous but I won't further make an ass of myself.  Thank you for bearing with me and replying as thoroughly as you did."
1700,estj,"Yeah, when I feel strongly about a decision for a group project, I typically don't care all that much about making sure everyone agrees with me, I just want them to do it lol. I'll definitely focus on making people agree with me if we're making decisions in a more democratic manner, but otherwise, I do come off as a bit of a ""my way or the highway"" type."
1701,estj,"I'm sorry to hear about your experiences, you don't deserve that.
Next time however it may be best to not claim 8% of the population are inherently arseholes due to your personal experience, okay?
It's also worth mentioning that controlling and micromanaging bosses are often typed as ESTJs simply because they're controlling and micromanaging. Any type can be controlling, but they'll get typed as ESTJ anyway.
Also, it's not okay that your father told you that you have a mental disorder (assuming you don't). That isn't normal ESTJ behaviour, he sounds very unhealthy."
1702,estj,"Thank you for your compassion, and I do apologize for slighting a swath of people as I did.  Stuff is what it is and I love my father very much, and I am very grateful for both what he taught me and that he is still around.  You are absolutely correct that I don't know for sure regarding other's mbti, I kindof do feel one needs to consider his own cognition himself, either through research or assistance.  Although I am very certain in a couple instances, I will admit I can be and probably often am wrong.  
I sincerely appreciate your calm and level tone, and I will go back to lurking, and learning what I can."
1703,estj,"My ESTJ provides for me materially. Small gifts, food, etc. She's covered my costs for random things, expecting nothing in return. Bigger things too, like plane tickets for a trip together. She doesn't make more than me, and I have money (most of the time!). It took a while for me to realize the extent, and that it was a way she showed her love. "
1704,estj,"ESTJ here. 
Acts of service. (i.e. Taking care of dreaded tasks so you don't have to.)  Monetary generosity. Quality time.
Of the ""5 Love Languages"", physical touch and words of affirmation are my least preferred."
1705,estj,"I feel like I show it a lot of ways that I honesty didn't even realize till I saw this post and thought about it... I am not nearly as patient or forgiving with others as I am with my husband. I'll explain things or keep my cool wayyy better and longer with him than anybody because I care for him more than anybody,,, 
I like to provide and take care of him, maybe it will be saying I'll go the g very store so you don't have to or you should go play your game while I clean up from dinner... I like to make things special for him or be the sanctuary for him in those ways... sex is one area I'm like that big time. I believe that's part of loving someone, I also try to be very clear and honest with him because I feel a life partner deserves your best in those ways."
1706,estj,"So I'm wondering if you guys can help me with this one.
I've read through all the functions and i identify best with ESTJ, however, when I'm around other ESTJs or any of the Te Se dom, i feel really inferior, self conscious and unintelligent but Im the complete opposite with Ne and Fe doms.
Am i missing something? Is it possible im not an ESTJ by feeling this way or is there more to it?"
1707,estj,"You need to stop stereotyping ESTJs as being pushy, insulting and lazy. My mum is an INFP and can be all those things, so can my ENFJ sister.
Any type can be insulting or pushy or lazy if they choose to be.
You are also insinuating all ISFJs are going to get walked on. My last retail manager was an ISFJ and she was a great manager. If you're both mature enough, you'll have a good working relationship regardless of what type you are.
Just because someone give you a bit of criticism doesnt mean they're insulting you. Maybe you just need to pull your big girl panties up and take responsibility for your actions.
(I got that quote from my ENFJ sister btw)"
1708,estj,"My type? Lmao you don't know my type, hell i don't even know my type but if you want to be so narrow minded about it, you wont get very far in life. Btw Si hero is about traditionalism and duty, not stereotyping. Stereotyping goes against every harmonious bone in an ISFJs body."
1709,estj,"First off traditionalism and duty is side effect of long memory not the cause of it. Functions doesn't determine your believes. Si organise facts. One of common methods are indeed stereotyping. 
Yeah harmony ISFJ is meme. They can literally betray their family on fist sight if they don't fill ISFJ imaginary vision of family without remorse. They can even raport against his family members in court of law. So yeah harmonious are those ISFJs."
1710,estj,"Probably would've made for a stronger post if you didn't only use fictional examples.
Also, you can't just ""develop"" a function. You can try putting yourself in a situation where it needs to be used, but in the end, you're probably just going to be emulating that function rather than actually using it. You could argue that it could be developed by surrounding yourself with high Fi-users, but it's not indicative of very high Fi to surround yourself with fake-friends for the sake of achieving a practical goal as efficiently as possible...
You're gonna need to back that up a little bit. Either way, it's not like you can say that a monk's motivation comes exclusively from Fi. The functions are not objective, biological brain functions, what function someone is using is up for debate.
All my other points aside, you've come to this subreddit before and strongly criticised ESTJs, going as far to say that they're ""indoctrinated"". Although I did appreciate how in your previous post about ESTJs you admitted it might be difficult for you to ""recognize ESTJs from Gen Y and Z"", you might need to apologise if you're planning to come here and boss people around."
1711,estj,"Honestly, she'd actually probably like the present, but would probably dislike the implication of the joke... I mean, she's into history like most ESTJs, and I genuinely think she'd find it interesting to read such a disturbing account of the dude's plans. "

Thanks!"
1713,estj,"Hey it‚Äôs that ENTP again ... this is kind of a follow up on the other post about understanding ESTJ on a personal level.
It‚Äôs almost been 24 hours since I posted that and my ESTJ friend just acted out of character ... like shit.
I‚Äôve always had difficulties with my friend, we initially bonded over interests, aspirations and morals and I always found her reactions amusing. I‚Äôm very assertive, my other friend is aggressive and she is quite passive. We usually hang out as a trio. But I always found my ESTJ friend quite insensitive and lacks the ability to acknowledge other people‚Äôs efforts and sacrifices for her. That was usually our main conflict, her not putting in the same effort as we were, she‚Äôs very oblivious to the fact that we care about her but I don‚Äôt think she realises our efforts. She doesn‚Äôt notice things until they come up. I‚Äôve always admired her work ethic although she is not academically smart and tries to play it off as if she doesn‚Äôt study or works as hard and we‚Äôre similar in the way we don‚Äôt express our feelings a lot and look for effective and rational solutions. Everything I said up until this point in normal behaviour.
The problem is she got a boyfriend. I‚Äôve discovered that TODAY. She‚Äôs been dating him for A MONTH. Now I won‚Äôt lie but I do feel betrayed at the fact I was not worthy enough to know from the start, and she told this friend that I don‚Äôt know that well before me. She is my best friend but once I found this out I was questioning if she thought the same, but I didn‚Äôt express my anger to her because I needed to collect my thoughts and I needed to be sane for her to listen to me, my other friend found out before me. THIS IS A VERY LONG STORY.  If you want to know the full story feel free to message me. But in summary she used my other friend for herself disregarding my other friend‚Äôs feelings and efforts, displaying no remorse for my other friend. She used her for her boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt even treat her right, and has a toxic relationship. I always thought she was rational but she is a complete slave to her emotions when her boyfriend only shows lust.
My friend (Not the ESTJ) and I are very disappointed with her and she is so blind that she doesn‚Äôt see it. She thinks that everything is okay between us. My other friend believes we shouldn‚Äôt openly express our feelings to her until the time is right, but I feel like scolding her right now because I always kept it in when she doesn‚Äôt acknowledge us but she crossed the line with this one.
To clarify, I do not hate her at all and have no interest in cutting her off from my life. I‚Äôm just irritated and frustrated that I always have to point something out for her to realise. 
I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts. 
As a bonus, I feel like I said so many negative things about her that I‚Äôm going to talk shit about myself to kind of balance it out, I am cold and rude and I purposely say things to incite a reaction, I take pranks to far and laughed when I discovered she had a boyfriend because I didn‚Äôt think it was possible that someone would want to be with her. "
1714,estj,"I think you ought to stop relying too much on this personality thing. Remember that this isn‚Äôt a perfect science. Every person is an individual and while some people may share similar traits, they can and will act under their own steam. No one is a perfect image of their personality category. 
That being said, it sounds like some high school drama that you‚Äôre dealing with. And I‚Äôm not trying to down-size that, it really really sucks to go through it. It‚Äôs good that you took the time to think before talking to your friend. But you may want to think from their point of view. Despite what it may seem, it might not have anything to do with you. 
Talking to your friend and expressing how you felt in a NON-ACCUSATORY way would be a good option. And remember, any personality can get along with one another. There are so many other factors that go into it. I‚Äôm an ESTJ and my best friend‚Äôs an INFJ. Just as an example. "
1715,estj,"Okay, I'm going to give you a different perspective. 
I cannot tell you how many guys I've been interested in and got all excited only for it to end in a few weeks making me feel like a dumbass. So I might tell casual friends but I won't tell my closest friends because I don't want to get excited about something that isn't very serious. 
I also think my efforts go unnoticed ALL THE TIME. I'm actually having roommate problems right now because no one thinks I do anything around here. And I purchased half the house when I moved in because no one wanted to contribute anything. So I took everything I purchased back. And I can easily live in my own space without sharing, I was only sharing and helping out because I thought it would be a nice thing to do. And now they are all flipping their shit because we don't have dishes, trash cans, towels, toilet paper...etc. And I couldn't care less. You want to be ungrateful and bitch, go right ahead but don't ask for any favors in the future, because the answer is no. 
Sometimes you need to take a step back and try and see what other people do. Because we can easily see things from our own perspectives and it looks like people don't care, but they do, they just care in different ways. 
I actually have an ESTJ dad. And he fills up our gas tanks when we visit home and checks our oil. He does so much to help other people out and never asks for anything in return. He sees it as his duty and that's how he shows people he loves them. But is he going to sit and talk about feelings with you? No. Is he going to comfort you when you're sad? No. Because it's not his strength and instead of getting mad at him for what he can't do, I thank him for what he can. 
And one last thing. I am a fucking moron at reading peoples emotions and problems. Unless you say it, I just won't figure it out. And when people lash out at me for not figuring stuff like that out, I get so angry and because you couldn't communicate to me the problem I have a hard time feeling bad for what happened. Lashing out at me for something that happened 3 months ago isn't' going to get my sympathy. You suck at communicating and expect others to just figure shit out like we're all capable of reading minds. 
But ESTJs aren't perfect people and we can really suck at times. "
1716,estj,"How do you know she‚Äôs even an ESTJ?
Yeah, I would be kind of perplexed myself, I usually tell those I know well, and if I didn‚Äôt. I simply forget and it‚Äôs like oh sorry and there‚Äôs a reason, didn‚Äôt get to you too busy. And I mean it. If you see the work I do you‚Äôll know hahaha! I am now getting more. Hahaha!"
1717,estj,"I'm not an ESTJ. I'm an ENTJ female who's been around the block more than a few times with toxic people and friends' relationship drama with toxic people. 
If I'm reading between the lines correctly, your ESTJ friend is in a very bad situation with this guy. A big red flag to me is that she's saying how much she loves this guy even though it's only been a month. Her secretiveness about the relationship is another huge red flag. That's really not a good sign. 
From my experiences with situations like this, you won't be able to talk her out of it or make her ""see reason"". 
Her bad behavior is also not about you. I know it feels personal and I know from experience how much that sucks, but it's not. She's all wrapped up in this, she can't really see anything or anyone else right now. Her perspective is skewed and she's not going to be capable of having a rational discussion about this for awhile if I'm seeing this situation accurately, though of course I don't have all of the information. 
You and your other friend are taking the correct approach by not confronting her. It will not end well if you do that. I cannot stress that fact enough. 
If you want to message me about this privately you're more than welcome to. This really sucks, I've been in this kind of predicament before. It's not fun. "
1718,estj,"Let me explain a bit about ESTJ dating.
We often leave relationship status ambiguous for a while, especially if we're talking to INFPs. INFPs seem to be especially cautious about dating. Meanwhile, we're comfortable just figuring each other out for a while and not declaring things a date.
I've known several friends who hung out for several years and eventually decided to just make it official and start dating.
‚Äã
Similarly, ESTJs like stability and don't like having to update people on things like ""we just started dating!"" One week later, we break up and now we have to update all of those people and it feels silly. We'd be much more comfortable talking about people that we've gone out on dates or are interested in than that we just started dating.
‚Äã
Another issue is that we get concerned what other romantic interests we have might think if we took someone else out on a date.
‚Äã
Finally, we often separate romantic interest from specific questions about the relationship. These questions include things like:
""I have kids and she's indicated 2 years ago that she doesn't want to deal with that. Would she make an exception for me?"""
1719,estj,"My best friend (honestly best friend is not an adequate word, she's my soulmate lol) is an ENTP and we always get along. If I didn't tell her something / if she didn't tell me something like that, maybe we'd both be a little disappointed, but we'd express it to each other directly (i.e.: ""why didn't you tell me? :( but I'm happy for you! blah blah etc) and get over it right away lol. We know that things happen and we can't always update each other right away. I think we have that basic trust that we'll never betray/hide something from each other on purpose. But also, I don't think I'd not tell my best friend such news for a month...
I also agree that it might not be a personality thing. Altho my soulmate's ENTP and ESTJ, and our interests aren't exactly the same, we grew up in very very similar backgrounds (similar family dynamic, socioeconomic status, etc). Sorry if this didn't help, but nah, I don't think it's a personality thing. "
1720,estj,"ESTJs are in benefit relations with ENTPs where ESTJ is the benefactor to ENTP, so they will always slightly dismiss you as being less important to them. This relationship type is very common as friendship and for making acquaintances, and fairly common among married couples, even though there is always slight dissatisfaction present. It's described being similar to older sibling (benefactor-ESTJ) - younger sibling (beneficiary-ENTP) kind of relation. If you want to read more about it see: MBTI types matches for ENTPs and MBTI type matches for ESTJs"
1721,estj,"I‚Äôm not really relying on personality types, I understand that ESTJ does not fully represent what my friend is. However, I feel as if I post on a community with like-minded people who can somewhat relate I can gain new perspective on my friend. 
Although it may appear like ‚Äòhigh school drama‚Äô, it really isn‚Äôt. My friends and I have been through high school and we are pretty good at avoiding drama. It‚Äôs deeper than that and it‚Äôs darker than that and we‚Äôre more mature than that. That‚Äôs why I stated that if you want the full story I‚Äôd rather direct message because it‚Äôs too overwhelming to include in this point. It worries me because she hasn‚Äôt faced any complications like this considering we‚Äôre really good at not being involved.
Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt describe this as drama, more like it‚Äôs highlighting a problem between my friend and I. The point is trying to get people‚Äôs take on it, because I feel like my way with dealing with it is too blunt and she needs more than that. Thank you for your advice, I‚Äôll make sure to talk to her without being too insensitive and considering her perspective."
1722,estj,"Thank you so much for the insight !
I‚Äôm not used to my friend being in such a complicated matter and responding in a way that I could not imagine. It worries me, to be honest. Because she says she LOVES this guy. 
I feel like her being oblivious to other people‚Äôs feelings contributes to her lack of acknowledging other people‚Äôs efforts. To her they are just there. My friend warned me to not to instantly speak my mind with her, because I‚Äôm very direct and honest so if something is bothering me, I attack the problem. But if it‚Äôs not worth my time I leave it. She‚Äôs in a very emotional state right now, which I‚Äôm not use to so I can‚Äôt speak to her the same way, so automatically would think that this man is a bad influence on her.
My friend said just to agree to everything she tells us or else if we tell her ‚ÄòNO‚Äô or ‚ÄòDON‚ÄôT DO IT‚Äô she‚Äôll just think it‚Äôs being us which is kind of shallow? I don‚Äôt know how to treat her now but I want to direct her to a more healthier state of mind.
No person is perfect. I think this man kind of exploited her in a way, and her loving him, I feel I should respect her relationship, but the way she acts. That ain‚Äôt it sis."
1723,estj,"Sometimes you just gotta let people make mistakes. 
And lashing out while emotional isn‚Äôt the best idea but sometimes it‚Äôs necessary. And I know that sounds immature but this is your friend. You are upset with her so get angry. 
I love when people get angry and mad because I feel like people put on a show and try to be respectful and it‚Äôs so obvious how fake they are. 
I just don‚Äôt like people lashing out about stuff that happened months ago. But if it‚Äôs something now I actually sorta love emotional outbursts. 
I had an ENFP friend in the past. We were friends for 13 years before I just walked away because I was so sick of how pathetic our relationship felt. She never expressed anything. Always bottled stuff up. But I always knew when she was mad or upset. I just couldn‚Äôt stand how peaceful she wanted to keep things. 
I just like people who are real. Who aren‚Äôt afraid to open up and express themselves. Might be why I gravitate towards INFPs. No one is more real and authentic than an INFP. They aren‚Äôt afraid to be themselves even if they are standing alone. 
I‚Äôve had people call me out in the past and yeah it sucks and can be embarrassing if they do it in front of others but it made me realize I was being ridiculous and they were right. 
You‚Äôre trying too hard. "
1724,estj,"Hi ESTJs!
I am getting mixed signals from an ESTJ man I met through friends.. What do you make of this situation?
Instant connection on first date. He showered me with verbal compliments (""pretty,"" ""cute,"" etc.). He held my hand, went in for a kiss, etc. etc. 
He works in finance (a lot of hours), so I understand that he's very busy. We just had our 5th date, but I had to initiate every one of those dates. For example, after each date, I'd have to text him ""when do i get to see you next?"" and he'd respond ""i'm busy this week, but the follow week is good."" This happened three times already, with me initiating the conversation about our next meet-up, and him just following up. He NEVER texts first.
During our last dinner date, he spontaneously asked if I wanted to join him to go to his coworkers' birthday party. So I followed along with him, he called me his ""date."" 
We made out afterwards, but again, after that, he never texted again.
I'm so confused.... I thought ESTJs were straight-forward. Am I just a fling to him???"
1725,estj,"I am an ESTJ guy. I think the best way to find out is to ask him straightforward. Just ask him exactly what he thinks of you and whatever else you want to know. If he's like me, he is really careful (and thus sometimes just quiet) with what he says, we best communicate in, as we fear it to be, in such concise and to-the-point language and tone that it can be uncomfortable or harsh to the people we are communicating to. If you directly ask him, he will likely see it as a great opportunity to open up and talk because he knows you're ready for it. 
Hope you find out and all turns out well for you two!  "
1726,estj,"Work is his first love. He's never going to think of you when he's in work mode. That's why he invited you to his coworker's party because it's related to work. Personally, I usually push everything outside of work to the bottom of my list and I don't mean any harm by it. It's just where my priorities lie. "
1727,estj,"I agree with 4dimentionalflower, the best action is to ask him directly.
I never text first, because I hate texting. Face to face conversations are awesome though.
To be honest, my guess would be yes. The lack of active pursuit on his side plus the fact, that he gets all the goodies without any sort of commitment or effort.
I had such relationships before, and saw the woman in question as a mere lover. "
1728,estj,"I can‚Äôt speak for all but as an ESTJ I find that the characteristic ‚Äúdirectness‚Äù applies to flirting in more than just words, and sometimes not to words at all. If your ESTJ doesn‚Äôt have a high level of extraversion (remember some don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs more of a middle to low end statistic for them) they probably won‚Äôt straight up tell you things they like about you, they‚Äôre probably a little shy about it. But their actions will prove they‚Äôre interested in you because THOSE will be very deliberate. Examples, listening to a band you mention you like so they can talk about it with you later, making a point of going exactly where you want to go for dinner, making time to be with you and when they are with you (especially if they are super into you) dedicating every second of their attention your way. Not obsessively (hopefully) but body language can help tell you for sure. Examples, keeping their phone off the table or facing directly at you and leaning towards you rather than away from you, etc. 
These sound like common courtesies but if you imagine flirting in a bar setting, it‚Äôs much more comfortable for an introvert to settle into their chair watching the basketball game than to spend the night talking to the guy/ girl next to them. So if they seem quiet but invested in you and your likes, it‚Äôs probably a good sign that this is more than just being polite. Again, not always, I don‚Äôt want to generalize, but from experience this is how it works for me."
1729,estj,"I am an ISFP and I'm pretty sure my gf is an ESTJ. It's very hard for me at times, because I really feel like she isn't all that in to me. We've made some pretty bold moves that one would only rationally do if they were truly in love, yet she very really seeks intimacy, in words and touch. She is also abrasive and I do feel judged at times by her. Yet, there are those moments where you just know she actually loves you. Plus we enjoy each other's company and play sports, workout, and play games together. So we enjoy all the same things. We rarely fight, if at all. 
How, as an ESTJ, do you show your partner love? "
1730,estj,"If I'm in love, I take my commitment to that person very seriously and will try hard to make the relationship work. I might not say sweet nothings in your ear but you should be able to tell through my actions. I might say things that can hurt your feelings at times or sound judgmental but if I'm trying to help you to work on yourself or trying to make our relationship better, I love you.
Physical affection and touch are also important but usually only in private. Not big on PDA."
1731,estj,"You might want to read about ""semi-duality"" relations in socionics for some tips (some discussion here. This is the type of relationship that ISFPs and ESTJs have.   
I wonder if she is enneagram type 1 or 8. These are the 'gut' types that tend to be somewhat on abrasive and critical side."
1732,estj,"I've been consistently tested as an INTJ since I first took the test several years ago, the result being the same on all the tests I've taken from 16Personalities, to the HumanMetrics, to John's Test, and to Keys2Cognition. For the years since I first took the test, I was satisfied with the INTJ typing as the description seemed to suit me well. However, I've recently began doubting this as I've began doing more investigations into other types. 
Most recently, I've been categorized as an xNTJ by PersonalityJunkie. In accordance with that, I've been compared many times with ENTJ characters from popular media, and they are often my favorite characters to watch as I tend to relate to them quite a bit. Having been praised throughout my life for my ability to lead, being told I'm ""remarkably persuasive and charismatic"" (something from a friend), and I have this deep motivation for bettering myself and the world around me. I sympathize greatly with ENTJ characteristic of mastering myself and my environment quickly, knowing that I'm in control of those things gives me comfort; feeling like I'm 'going with the flow' of another person's lead makes me uncomfortable. I tend to be a bit theatrical when expressing something I'm excited about, being animated and enunciating my words in a particular and deliberate way, but if my point is misunderstood or rejected without a good reason I can become blunt and insensitive to others, and I know that. It just feels necessary to be blunt in situations such as that. People can also become discomforted by my commanding presence when I'm expressing an idea I've thought about for a long time. Still I hold a strong love for individualism as a concept that I've evaluated on a deeper level, and deemed to be the best way of thinking from a rational point of view. I'm very much both a rational and psychological egoist. Striving only for a reasonable and logical framework to operate in, which collects an abundance of information and then converges toward a single way of doing things through inner deductive reasoning, being harsh and honest with myself by excluding any external influences. I strive to find some universal way of doing things instead of relying on multiple points of view. Furthermore I'm highly self-confident and self-motivated to make the world a better place for others and myself. I don't like being instructed on how to do things and prefer learning it on my own. Making it my own, if you will. 
The INTP typing is more interesting, but I feel less likely than the ENTJ. Mostly because I've been praised as exceptionally mature emotionally and in my way of thinking over the years and tend to prefer single conclusions and a set of well-defined rules formed through assembling my own complex set of ideas, created independently in my mind. In part, I feel that I have a well developed sense of introverted thinking, or at least I'd like to think so. Assessing all the parts of a concept, asking INTP questions such as ""Why does that happen?"" ""How does it work? ""Why is it this way?"" and so on and so forth to develop a deeply rational approach to everything. However, it unequivocally returns to the question of ""How can I apply this to make people understand it?"" or ""How can I use this?"" In a more -NTJ fashion. I do love the experience of learning for its own sake, but it has to be useful to me by either adding to a pre-existing foundation that is rational, or by breaking that one pre-existing one down and contributing to some new foundation. 
As a review, my major characteristics, as I see them, are these:
‚Ä¢Care for the improvement of both myself and the world around me.
‚Ä¢Known to have a commanding presence
‚Ä¢Called charismatic and persuasive
‚Ä¢Very confident in my own abilities 
‚Ä¢Quite capable of, and enjoys, leading a group toward a particular goal; Leadership is something I'm eager to take up and feel very comfortable in.
‚Ä¢Always keeping in mind some goal or idea for the future of what is the best and most efficient way of doing things
‚Ä¢Zero tolerance for emotional or arbitrary justifications (such as irrational traditions or perceptions); will only listen to arguments based in reason
‚Ä¢Almost always the leader of a conversation when I do interact with others, holding the attention on myself and driving the conversation toward particular points
‚Ä¢Willing to listen to other perspectives so long as they are rational.
‚Ä¢The knowledge I gather has to have some application which is useful to me, either personally in the pursuit of knowledge for its own usefulness, or in the workplace where I can use it to refine or reform my present strategies or approaches. I'm able to adapt to changes if a new idea is better or more efficient than the current one. 
‚Ä¢Tend to spend a lot of time alone, pondering new ideas or refining old ones that I've developed independent of external influences. 
‚Ä¢Long-term planner, usually with a single, flexible, and complex plan. Knowing exactly how to reach the goal I want to. Not concerned particularly with any one part, but more how the sum of the total amount of parts interact with each other to create the exact function I want. In business this takes the form of stock market investment, a high paying career, efficient management of finances, and capitalizing on my confidence, charisma and calculating nature to reach new heights at a rapid pace.
‚Ä¢Hold myself to a certain integrity or code of honest.
‚Ä¢Creator of my own set of well-defined rules that have been endured the process of being ripped apart by my way of thinking and tested as being rational and legitimate; doesn't like disorder, uncertainty, or arbitrariness in how things are run. Everything needs to point toward one particular goal.
‚Ä¢Fiercely independent and can become discontent or even antagonistic toward a particular way of doing something if it is inefficient or significantly flawed.
My strongest function has almost always been my iNtuiton, never dropping below 50% over the years, while my Introversion has been the weakest, never going above 30% on any metrics. I have a tendency to sit back and zone out deep in thought often if the current conversation bores me or I just have time alone to do so. Connecting not only to the philosophy I'll mention here as well, but also to the supposedly crude/dark sense of humor seen in Ni types. I have a dark sense of humor and can be sarcastic too. I have a vivid image of who i want to be and where I'd like to be. Which is either being extremely wealthy, living alone, spending a lot of free time studying or writing, and having connections in elite circles, or alternatively pursuing a career in politics by transforming the playing field and striving toward my vision of the most desirable society I see in my mind. I also see everything as being connected in a rational way, often achieved through my passion for philosophy and particularly with metaphysics, free will, ethics, and mind. I also have a strong skepticism to me. Lastly, while I am confident and charasmatic, I have a penchant for sticking to the back of a room and thinking before I speak. Sometimes not at all if it isnt that important. I deliberately set myself apart from the group. Im currently in college, and i sit at empty tables both in class and in the dining hall by choice normally, and prefer talking to the people next to me or small groups usually with a focus on philosophical, political, organizational, or general interests. I tend to be much more assertive when expressing an idea though. Can even be theatrical in the presentation of a grand vision I have. I'm competitive in that I see debates as a testing of both mind and will, and find that experience to be exciting. 
I think that about covers it, what do you guys think I am?"
1733,estj,"INFJ isn't my least favorite type. So far, I've had pretty good interactions with them. 
Ni users have described the processes as ephemeral. They'll know something, or have a strong sense of a thing, but when asked to pull apart why they know it, the details slip away whenever they get close to being identified - like trying to remember a dream.  So the conclusion I've come to is that Ni is drawing from a mass of information, but without being able to pinpoint the details, they cannot verify them, so they may be making an assumption from faulty info without ever knowing it. On the other hand, Si collects only concrete information. It can verify everything, but it's missing a lot of stuff that could also be true, all the information in between that could lend more context. There's room for error in both. So in that way, they are somewhat equal.
I've also seen Ni manifest their conclusions. Because it is so certain, the Ni user can react as if a premonition has already come to pass and thereby create that outcome. (For a really dumb example, if you come to the conclusion that Martha is a jerk, and then you react to her as if she's a jerk, she's probably going to start to be a jerk to you) And then they pat themselves on the back for knowing it ahead of time. Really, they just made it happen without necessarily realizing it. Because every function has its faults. 
But I really appreciate that 'toward the future' outlook. My own 'against the future' can be very limited and anxious and it's nice to hear that more optimistic, or even just more confident, perspective. There's something about Ni that makes me think of faith.
As for Ni in myself, being Polr, I think that I would immediately disregard an Ni insight, or more likely, I would explain it away with all of my preferred functions. I regularly find myself making a judgment and then afterwards asking myself why. For all I know, my Ne is just coming up with reasons that suit my Si, but in reality, maybe it was a more amorphous Ni conclusion that truly led me there. But without those reasons, I would never trust it or act on it."
1734,estj,"I don't think it's faulty or dangerous, it's just confusing. That might relate to the fact that there's a tendency within Typology communities to incorrectly conflate Ni with ""mysticism"" and say that ""Ni is too subjective to give a concrete explanation to"". I'm not entirely convinced by that, Si is also highly subjective and Ne is also highly abstract, but they get concrete explanations. 
In real life, I sometimes get frustrated around NJs. We're both planners, but we often have very different ideas on how to go about the same thing, which leads to conflict. This also happens with SPs, but they at least sometimes let loose on the reigns. NPs and SJs are much easier to work with. SJs usually have similar ideas on the ""right"" way to go about something so we plan well together, and NPs, unlike SPs, usually agree with my ideas, they're just pretty chill on the planning part of it. However, they also help come up with and develop ideas in a way that suits what I want to do, whereas SPs come up with and develop ideas that contradict my plans.
That got off-topic for a bit, sorry. But generally, in real life, I find NFJ's (particularly INFJ's) intentions confusing. NTJs are easy enough to relate to but are a bit too intense for my tastes and we often end up annoyed with each other (this mostly applies to INTJs, I usually get along well with ENTJs, but I feel like they sometimes have a streak of vindictiveness that I haven't really observed outside the Gammas). On a more theoretical level, Ni is the only function I feel like I don't ""get"". I don't think I could actually explain what Ni is off the top of my head, whereas I could give a rough description of the other functions.
Sorry if this comment sounded harsh or offensive, it wasn't intended, these are just my honest feelings on the topic. I think Ni is certainly a valuable function, it just sometimes ends up in conflict with my own functions. Please let me know if I've made any incorrect assumptions about it."
1735,estj,"ENTP?! Even though I wouldn't say the ENTP is my least favourite type. More like, ENTP(s) tend to be my natural enemies . They are still highly entertaining and having a conflict with them teaches me about the limits of reality.
???
But I like INFJ(s). Usually they are allies of justice and mean well. 
I once seduced a woman because I was so fascinated with her introverted intuition and wanted to be closer to it.
On one hand, I like the perspective it brings, especially because I have problems reproducing it. On the other hand, sometimes it looks like utter madness and nonsense.
That said, I actually can open my mind eye just fine. I even can solve problems with it. The main problem is just, that prolonged use lets my imagination go wild and berserk.
I get visions about puppets, strings, spiders and so on. Usually I close my mind eye at this point. The last time that I didn't, I had a 'conversation' with society itself. I needed months to get over it."
1736,estj,"Hey! I actually like some infjs. If I was to be honest, I really don‚Äôt know too much about Ni. I know how it works a bit, but that‚Äôs it. I have friends who are both infj and infp. I actually like both of them enough though I tend to like infps a bit more, but the infjs I know honestly seem a little more stable."
1737,estj,"I would say my least favourite type is either esfp, isfp, and Intj.. Entps are fine, but at some point I have to tell them it‚Äôs time to stop arguing, because I really don‚Äôt have the time. There was this guy on my Twitter who would debate every tweet I put up that got annoying."
1738,estj,Thanks for the responses everyone! I'm having a real hard time maneuvering the micromanagement and conflict with my ESTJ boss and I was just thinking it'd maybe was a fundamental difference in our functions. She has a really hard time seeing my perspective.
1739,estj,"And they are all shit.
How do you explain the colour red to the colour-blind?
How to explain colour to a blind person?
We are talking about different perception here after all. BTW,  look at your surroundings and try to give a concrete explanation on how your brain comprehended those objects. 
We can barley comprehend how we perceive, and even less the different forms of perception. All we can say is, that some people see things different."
1740,estj,Basing my judgement of INFJ hate from this comment:
1741,estj,"That's true. It's hard to comprehend one's own perception, let alone explain others. The judging functions have always seemed far more reasonably/rationally explained to me, but I assumed that could be because I'm a J-dom myself. The concept of ""seeing"" a perception function in another person seems to be overly entrenched in the theoretical and rather disconnected from empirical observation. By its own definition, it doesn't seem possible to externally ""observe"" how a perception function would, well, function, especially for Pi. The functions seem to be working for me so I've just gone with it, but it does raise questions as to the plausibility of them when they're so difficult to verify."
1742,estj,"Lack of self-control?! INFJ are still Judgers, and the INFJ(s) I identify had all rather high consciousness. It seems this person confused INFP(s) with INFJ(s).
And I would not say INFP(s) are dysfunctional or dangerous. They are people with lots of creativity and imagination who want to play with their 'My Little Pony'-toys and write some fan-fiction about it.
And exterminating them sounds a little bit harsh. I would not even think that this would be a good idea in a battle of survival. A good strategist finds a purpose for all resources.    "
1743,estj,"I‚Äôm an INFJ and I find this ESTJs opinion very funny. Some of us INFJs are stupid so I don‚Äôt blame y‚Äôall, especially one of our moderators. I would argue with this copied comment anyways, but Im too tired to do so lol."
1744,estj,"I think it is easier to describe active decision making rather than passive information gathering. Like a rorschach-test, people don't choose what they can initially see.
All we can do is reject the information we are given and try to consciously gather information or transform the information into something we could not see.
And at this point, have we used a different form of cognition, or did did we produce an imitation of the real thing? "
1745,estj,"I'm currently feeling conflicted between istj & estj for my type, so I was curious about what decided it for you all. 
I think that answers that discuss cognitive functions & their manifestations would be more helpful to me than discussions of how talkative one is...
Thanks in advance!"
1746,estj,"I think I have stronger Ne than I do Fi. I use Ne quite a lot in my everyday life, and though I'm a friendly person (I think), I definitely don't have very strong Fi. I'm okay with other people expressing their emotions, but I somewhat repress mine.
I was also a bossy little shit who tried to structure and organise everything I was a part of as a kid, suggesting my Te was more developed than my Si back then.
EDIT: Also Reinin Dichotomies, if you're willing to delve a little into Socionics."
1747,estj,"I struggle with it too, I think partially because neither type has been very well explored by the community. We‚Äôre common and therefore uninteresting? 
Without other ESTJ to compare myself with, it‚Äôs difficult to assess. I have a lot of introverted tendencies that I think stem from my inability to deal with how other people are feeling and how poorly I‚Äôm able to communicate how I feel, even though I consider myself quite open and expressive.
I feel like I‚Äôve leaned toward ESTJ because of my tendency, as Moodle put it, to be a bossy shit. I feel like I‚Äôm likely to say ‚Äòooh neat idea‚Äô and ‚Äòfeelings don‚Äôt matter‚Äô, but I know I‚Äôm also hesitant about turning that ‚Äònew idea‚Äô into something real and  I‚Äôm painfully aware of how much my feelings do matter every time people react to me like I‚Äôve said something terrible or selfish. 
I generally feel like I‚Äôm unpalatable and I can either lean into it or let it crush me, so I tend to chose the former. Because I‚Äôm also sick of everyone whining."
1748,estj,"Because I am an extrovert. :P
But the manifestations of the functions lead to how talkative someone is. In the case of extroverted thinking (Te) it is more about activity/assertiveness (in regards to extroversion) and extroverted perceiving (Ne/Se) is about excitement seeking.
Personally I hate sleep, prefer to interact with my environment and like to overcome new exciting challenges. I like competition and rivals. I take the hard path over the easy path, because the easy path leads to boredom. "
1749,estj,"Thanks for replying. I have a few questions, if I may ask:
What do you consider Ne use in your daily life? 
Are you suggesting that for you, repressed Fi is a lack of emotional expression? Could you elaborate on what repressed Fi means to you?
As for the Reinin Dichotomies, I have looked into them somewhat, but I can't really come to a conclusive preference for many of them. Or when I feel I do have a clear preference, it may rule out the types that I am considering..."
1750,estj,"Thank you for replying. I would agree that I also don't really communicate how I feel, but for me that's a conscious choice...
Can you think of any reasons why you think your feelings communication is poor?
I do feel like I have a problem with ""bossiness"" seeming to be a determining factor for people's self-typing... Maybe it gets at a real correlation, but I'd hate to assume that it's true. I'm more inclined to see it as a self-fulfilling prophecy...
You say that like you aren't sure. Could you elaborate?"
1751,estj,"Thanks for the response. 
That's an interesting argument. I think I could get on board with it. 
However, ESTJs and ISTJs have functions in very similar positions. What you said still doesn't seem to distinguish the two.
I appreciate the specific examples. Were those some of the behaviors that helped you confirm your typing?"
1752,estj,"Yeah, I could only decide maybe 2-3 Reinin Dichotomies, but it eliminated some types for me.
In conversations, if there's an awkward silence, I'm usually the one left with the burden of bringing it back to life and have to quickly come up with conversation topics. I'm constantly asking questions about how things work and can be very inquisitive (more on a theoretical level, however. I'll always ask what would happen if I do this, but I'm sure as hell not doing it). I often explore hypotheticals and where they can lead. I'm often prone to having fruitless conversations just to explore an idea. I tend to use a lot of analogies when explaining things and making arguments.
I never take my personal feelings into account when making decisions, and only decide what I believe to be logical. That isn't to say I don't take emotion into account, I take other people's feelings into account as a logical consideration (although I am willing to override them), but I often hold back my own feelings from influencing me even a little bit. I don't think I necessarily value other's feelings over my own, it's more like ""you people have all these feelings and you just can't keep them back, I guess I'll have to repress my feelings so we don't have even more feelings to address"". I'm consciously aware that feelings are a good thing, but I think I subconsciously believe that they're a weakness. It's not an active process of holding back my emotions. Sometimes when I'm making big decisions about my life I think about all of the pros and cons. Going over them, I realise I haven't even thought about what will make me happiest."
1753,estj,"On communicating feelings:
I think tone is an issue. When something is very clear in my head, the tone is probably more demanding than I mean it to be. I suspect people react to the tone without hearing my actual position, perceiving a finality that may or may not actually be there.
I don‚Äôt craft my words in reality; I talk while thinking so whatever goes through my head comes out and I don‚Äôt have time to fine tune it. 
I‚Äôm also aware that the emotion I‚Äôm most comfortable expressing is anger. Anger is strong and active. If I‚Äôm feeling something more vulnerable, I‚Äôm not comfortable showing that and perhaps not even comfortable examining it. I will, however, complain about it.
On bossiness:
One thing with bossiness that I can‚Äôt speak to is how it manifests differently in ESTJ vs ISTJ. It just seems like ESTJ is more likely to go on a tear, while ISTJ seems more steady, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs accurate in reality. I‚Äôm curious how ISTJs see it. 
On being unpalatable:
I have no problem thinking of people as cogs in a machine. So I might be musing over the solution to a problem only to find that everyone is staring at me like I just strangled a puppy in front of them. I call it ‚Äòcrossing the invisible evil line‚Äô. From my perspective, I wasn‚Äôt talking about the right or wrong of a thing, just the functionality of it. I think the reactions I get might be exacerbated because I‚Äôm female and so people are even more put off by my apparent lack of sympathy.
I find sounding unsure is a habit I‚Äôve picked up to soften my delivery. It‚Äôs more about being unsure how things will land than being unsure about what I want to say."
1754,estj,An estj and a youtuber is kinda contradictory. Too unpredictable for a career don‚Äôt you think?Aren‚Äôt they all in business schools or some shit? Or even if they aren‚Äôt they are probably busy doing chores around their or someone else‚Äôs house
1755,estj,"Kinda know what you mean. I look at YouTube as a way for me to be my own boss though. Be able to put time and energy into the things I love while sharing it with others in a way it can support me. I started working full time in a corporate office recently and it drive me insane. Not being in charge, making final decisions, having to put up with HR. Part would be because I was raised by entrepreneurs. "
1756,estj,"Yeah, it makes sense to be honest. I think a lot of estjs want to be their own bosses and even if they live basically according to the rules at the same time they want to make the rules and live and work in ways they think are right and efficient and youtube gives you this kind of freedom I guess"
1757,estj,"I'm not doing MBTI videos in particular, more trying to get into vlogging. 
See here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPOkrZQ7NNOqdcXgilphlAw
Also do some streaming:  https://gaming.youtube.com/channel/UCXDoL4wK1lx9lJl-BzJ_Rkw
And if I start doing some news commentary here in the next little bit, I'll add that too. "
1758,estj,"so I have lots of posts up there. I don‚Äôt know how many. but people can see what I write and say. I wouldn‚Äôt say I am much different besides maybe being more social and talking to a lot of people in real life.
So I would really like someone who is an estj to go look through my profile. Do I seem like you or one of you folks?
Thanks please explain.
Do you folks think I have fe?"
1759,estj,"Have you considered ESFP? I've read through some of your history and everything seems to point to that.
This site may be helpful for you https://www.typeinmind.com/sefi/. I've pulled a quote from this site that seems to fit your use of Te quite accurately under the ESFP description demonstrating Te as your 3rd function instead: 
""In a lot of cases, Te is the protector function of the SeFi. When one of  their values comes under attack, they rely on a direct, matter-of-fact  Te communication style to defend it. When they feel so strongly about a  subject that they know they must take action on it, they tap into this  part of themselves that is powerful and commanding to take a stand for  that what they believe is right."" "
1760,estj,"People say that but based off anyone I know it‚Äôs thinkers who tend to be more religious. The only religious type I tend to see among feelers is ESFJ and ENFP. 
I mean religion is just dying off in general. But an ESTJ would latch onto a community like that it it meant enough to them. 
I don‚Äôt necessarily see OP as similar to me but I wouldn‚Äôt give up on ESTJ that easily. "
1761,estj,"I recommend watching Davesuperpowers videos on YouTube and joining the Objective Personality Study Group on Facebook to start and you can ask people how to find out what type of ESTJ you are. They also offer a paid service if you want to be officially objectively typed, but the wait list is long that's why I recommend you start with the Facebook page and YouTube channel."
1762,estj,"EDIT: before you get mad, I meant to type tendency, but it autocorrected to decency. Ok, resume.
I'm INTJ, and my crush, 25 m, took the test recently for the first time and came out ESTJ. I could have sworn he's xNFx, so I thought maybe ENFJ? Idk, the more I read up on the two, the more I'm convinced he's ENFJ, but perhaps he has developed his Si and Ti.
He does act like an ESTJ in that he tends to judge people at work based on their compliance and respect for, schedules and procedures. He also talks about how he gets his work done asap, before his deadline, however any work that comes in when he's off the clock must be saved for the next work day. He's got a lot going on since he works full time, he tries to keep a really regular schedule of stuff he needs to do outside of work (laundry day, college classes, study time, and usually calling me at the end of the day and we talk for a couple hours). I have heard though that ESTJs are stereotyped as being ""sticklers"" and ""hardnosed"", but he's very laid back.
However, when he's always very expressive (doesn't sound like an ESTJ trait), when he tells a story he usually explains everything surrounding/leading up to the story before he gets to the actual story, and he usually describes his overall impression and how he felt about what happened. He bought a book on watchmaking, and pretty much immediately started reading and applying what learned to watch repairs. He's really good with numbers and math, and is currently taking a class in differential equations (I'm not sure if that's uncharacteristic of ENFJs, but it seems like understanding systems like that is typically an N thing). He was taught how to cook from a young age, and the way he talks about it, he actually enjoys it. We've been friends for almost 2 years, but things have only started to progress in the pass couple months and now when I see him he is very into physical contact (e.g. hugging me, touching my arm, dancing with me pretty much all night). I was invited to a small gathering, and the hosts wanted to get everyone dancing, and he was the first to start the dancing. He fixed me some food, and I got food poisoning and he took care of me. Usually when there's a ""milestone"" in our relationship (like talking on the phone during the recent eclipse), he says, ""Are we having a moment!? :D"" Whenever I start to wonder if I should tell him something, he always encourages me to be open with him. In fact, when I asked what he wanted me to tell him, he specifically said, ""Everything! I want to know everything you're thinking about!"" He seems to really enjoy when I open up to him, especially when it's uncomfortable and vulnerable (which is scary for me, an INTJ). He said something about how it shows trust? He said he's typically really good at reading people, but these days he makes a conscious effort not do it anymore because he feels like he knows too much about the person and it can being upsetting sometimes. And the last reason I think he's ENFJ is he is a slut for the Confucius meme, lol.
Where the two personality types (ESTJ and ENFJ) overlap though is what trips me up. Both are goal oriented. Both care deeply about family and friends. Both tend to be good at leading people, I guess both in the office and with friends.
So does it sound like ESTJ behavior to you?
TL;DR Does anyone else find that they tend to act like an ENxJ? How can I determine if he is ESTJ or ENFJ for sure? What do you feel like your biggest differences are with ENFJs? "
1763,estj,"My girlfriend is an ESTJ, and I'm an ENFP. I almost never see her sympathize or empathize with anyone, even those she cares about. However, she is very warm and affectionate to me (and also with animals). I get to see a side of her that really, no one else does. It makes me feel very special!"
1764,estj,"Older ESTJs seem like ENTJs to me, especially if they work in finance, business, etc., where meeting and venturing into new areas are a part of their job. Something about having to have many different views to be successful at their job gives them that N practice. Still pretty S in other areas of life. "
1765,estj,"He must really like you!  The S types I know most definitely don't want to hear most of what I'm thinking (other than my ESTP SO).  Then again I'm an INFJ, and what I consider recreational speculation sounds like stoner wank to people who want to see concrete outcomes.
I really try to stick to the facts when I talk to STJs."
1766,estj,"I'm sorry, the decency part was a typo. It was suppose to say tendency. However, being that I'm an INTJ, I've been doing TONS of research on the types. But when I try to bring up the personality types to figure out what he is, he doesn't like it because he feels like I'm trying to ""put him in a box"". So I've been trying to sort it out without bringing it up to him. And as far as determining ESTJs, they're terribly underrepresented in the online MBTI community, and finding info to compare the two personality types is difficult."
1767,estj,"And by ""mature"" I mean people who have developed their function stack. Not necessarily people who keep their house clean and do their laundry on schedule like they're suppose to."
1768,estj,"Ok, I'm sorry, but if you'd have seen my reply to another redditor, you would've seen that ""decency"" was a typo, it was suppose to say tendency.
That being said, I think most J types tend to be pretty on top of things anyway, but maybe it's their attitude toward the work or something. He's good about getting his work done, and fascinated by the whole watchmaking thing, but idk if I'd go as far as saying he's obsessive about it (in fact, he doesn't understand my tendency to""obsess"" about stuff, like trying to figure out his personality type, lol). Like, ok, I know both types get upset when people don't follow the rules, but I think it's for different reasons, right? I just can't seem to figure out what the underlying reasoning is on it.
I guess I'm just trying to figure out where the differences are in the types, because, to me atleast, he seems to fit pretty well into both. So I'm trying to figure out his underlying motivations and reasoning on stuff. Like, ESTJs supposedly have a knack for being motivating, right? And so do ENFJs? But is the SJ driven by wanting to see results, and the NF is driven by wanting to see people live up to their potential? Is that where they differ?
Where do you feel like you differ with ENFJs? "
1769,estj,"Met somebody recently who is very familiar with MBTI and was almost embarrassed to tell them I'm an ESTJ because I so don't identify with many aspects. 
‚Äã
I love productivity, goals, and getting things done....but don't do it without considering people's feelings along the way.
‚Äã
I don't care about status (never even owned a new car), could talk endlessly about emotions, don't like confrontation, and not traditional. 
‚Äã
Seems the Enneagram and gender of an ESTJ can matter a lot. Seems many of the most aggressive types have been males with an Enneagram of 8. I'm female with an Enneagram of 3. 
‚Äã
Are there ESTJ things you can't relate to?"
1770,estj,"Well I‚Äôm obsessed with MBTI and I always feel weird about it. I‚Äôm taking theories of personality next semester and I‚Äôm so excited. 
I throw the best parties. My roommates and I threw a Dad themed party once and it was the coolest party I‚Äôve ever had. I also LOVE karaoke, I go almost every single week. Cannot sing for the life of me but I just think karaoke is so fun. 
I‚Äôm a sex worker. Financial Dominatrix. I‚Äôve had a sub for 2 years who gets off sending me money simply because I demand it and calling him a pathetic loser. I jumped into the scene because a friend recommended it and was way more successful than I expected. 
I know html and I make templates and designs for other sex workers on my free time too. 
I also spent 5 years traveling the country solo. For the hell of it but I worked the same job, lifeguard. I had a blast and met so many people and have so many network connections when I graduate. 
Honestly I fit ESTJ more than you might think but there is so much more to someone‚Äôs personality than bullshit stereotypes. "
1771,estj,"I'd say I'm pretty close to the stereotype. I usually try to consider people's feelings but if I'm accomplishing a stressful or time-critical objective I don't have time for people's feelings. The priority is finish the task efficiently or get out of the way, and in this case I definitely steamroll and offend people and then need to apologize once the task is complete. Even if I don't want to admit it, I am extremely concerned about my objective appearance in most situations. Never knew about the Enneagram! Just clicked through one and I came out with an 8 and then a 3, which aligns with your data. Thanks!"
1772,estj,"Yeah, same, I don‚Äôt care about status, but I do care about reputation. I also thoroughly dislike telling people off-I can‚Äôt do it, I‚Äôll mind my business and you do your thing. Apart from that, I‚Äôm pretty stereotypical-just a bubbly ESTJ :)"
1773,estj,"I feel like most ESTJs aren‚Äôt likely to sit down and write about their personalities in the same way others do. This community isn‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs enough for me. 
Our sub is small and across other sites our presence is small. 
So out of all the types, just like ESFJ there are more of other types speaking on our behalf than we are. 
And honestly sometimes the hatred towards us is annoying but I think our strength is that we are able to let it go and move on. We have shit to do and sitting around worrying about what others have to say about our type would feel like a waste of time. 
I think a lot of the information regarding us is wrong but I‚Äôm not tied to my personality in the same way other types are. I don‚Äôt need to defend myself. "
1774,estj,"The online tests I have taken often gave me very close results between these two, and I feel that can I relate to both types in different ways. May I know how I will be able to clearly differentiate whether I am an ESTP or ESTJ? Are there any crucial differences that set the two types apart?
Thank you so much!!  "
1775,estj,"Are you comfortable seeing things as they are, or do you have a need to put everything in a box (as in, right or wrong, etc)? This is one way I see the difference between P and J. 
Do you like having a plan for everything? Do you feel ""anxious"" when your home is dissorganized? If this is true, you're probably leaning towards J.
‚Äã"
1776,estj,"When you encounter a problem with several alternatives, are you driven to understand the alternatives, or more just to choose the best one?  Are you more at peace with understanding the options without choosing one, or with actually choosing one without fully understanding them?
My wife and I are both J's, so niether of us can stand the tension of an unresolved dilemma even if the options are fully understood and there is no compelling reason to resolve it, but my P friend is content once he understands the options and might never actually choose one."
1777,estj,"Ah, thank you so much! What if I am not that particular about the organization in my environment but is very particular about the organization of information (basically the internal stuff)? Does that impact my profile in any way?"
1778,estj,"So there's this ESTJ who I really like (I'm an ISFJ) and I noticed that he rather enjoys really arbitrary arguments about really silly things. So he and I have a lot of completely meaningless little theoretical debates/arguments about terminology or something completely pointless and I'm not sure if he likes to do this just to sharpen his brain or if he actually somewhat flirting? I ask this because oftentimes throughout the argument either he or I (or both) just sort of slowly start to smile as we realize the absurdity of the debate as it devolves into complete meaninglessness... so yeah, I was just curious. Thanks!"
1779,estj,"Yeah maybe.  I've never really thought about that.  I could see that though, it's definitely engaging you so that very well could be.  I wouldn't do it with someone I didn't like, so at the very least the person likes you."
1780,estj,"Confirmed ESTJ? ENTP's are called the debaters. We'd debate Hitler as an SJW if we were subjected to it. I will say though that I, as an ENTP, never debate as a form of flirting. We tend to take debates way too seriously and flirting (at least for me) I never take seriously. On top of all that, though, If you debate me and I don't completely obliterate your half (ie you proverbially ""hold your own"") I might catch feelings. 
¬†
I know this sort of came off ""look at me"" - I didn't intend that but I hope it helps nonetheless."
1781,estj,"But he IS a SJW though.
I don't think ENTPs are ""serious"" about debates. It has to make sense but more often than not, it's for shits and giggles and just a good way to occupy the time. Also I'm still not 100% sure what flirting is. I just know that whenever I try to impress someone, I invariably end up embarrassing myself (more than usual). 
The part about catching feelings is very true. I think we as ENTPs like people who can keep up intellectually and are straightforward. "
1782,estj,"Yeah that's what I was wondering... he'll pretty easily get into any theoretical meaningless debate or discussion. I will admit, I tried to engage him in them more by asking questions I thought he would find interesting, since I wanted more conversations with him. "
1783,estj,"Management and Marketing - currently going to school for. I obviously enjoy the bossing people around part ;P but really, I like working with a team and organizing tasks, communicating with stakeholders, etc. Marketing is where I get to use my brain more. I am more interested in the marketing strategy and research side, where I can use critical thinking and problem solving, research and work with even another team. I am going to school at a predominantly engineering school, and I am actually hoping to continue working with engineers after I graduate. "
1784,estj,"I work as an insurance adjuster for long tailed claims like asbestos. Insurance is just about the most boring industry I can think of, but only love my job. I read a lot of contracts and lawsuits (and I'm applying to law school), but I like being able to get into the nitty gritty of contracts... it's more fun than it sounds."
1785,estj,"Military.  I got into the military as a regular 11B Infantryman and shortly thereafter got through the selection and assessment to become an 18E USASF Communications Sergeant.  All in all, best choice of my life as far as careers go.
Personally, I have a really hard time holding a single hobby for a long time.  I find comfort in some repetitive tasks but only to an extent.  Being in SF allows me to change my responsibilities and expertise fairly regularly, but always with the Communications background to keep me on a comfortably familiar ground.  For example, I've been in charge of UAVs and UAV training; I've been in charge of contracting, money, pay, interpreters; I've been in charge of training and logistics; I've been in charge of drivers training and maintenance on certain vehicles; and on top of all of that I've always been the subject matter expert for pretty much anything that runs on electricity for my team.  It all can change very quickly but, through my own personality and interpersonal relationships, I have garnered longevity in the positions I enjoy.
Don't misunderstand what I'm saying here.  This isn't a pitch to join the Army, this is just what worked for me (without me totally realizing why until fairly recently).  The Army can really, really suck.  I have only seen my daughter for half of her life to this point.  My point is that I have that familiarity of my specialty in commo and all those basic duties from day to day, but I also have the opportunity to expand and change and satiate my need for something new and challenging to persevere through.  That's why it works really well for me and I don't want to kill myself from boredom."
1786,estj,"Come join the discussion!
https://discord.gg/s62PNyP
There's a large community of people who love discussing myers briggs, enneagram, socionics, and general psychology.
We are looking for fun, interesting people like you"
1787,estj,"ESTJ girl here married to ENTP guy. He's the love of my life. He's brilliant, funny, kind, and I love the way his mind works. He keeps me open to life's possibilities, and makes me a much less narrow-minded person than I would otherwise be. His people skills are way better than mine, and he genuinely brings out the best in everyone around him. (I joke that he keeps me open to the possibilities in the world, and I keep him in washed and ironed shirts.) 
It works for us, in part, because we're both older. (It's a second marriage for each of us, and we both admit we'd have killed each other in our twenties.)  Also because we work really hard at appreciating each other and appreciating the differences in our perspectives, and the way we both influenceone another for the better. 
Tl/dr: it works because we both respect each other and appreciate our differences. "
1788,estj,Cool thanks! How did it compare to other types?  What did you like / dislike.  Did you feel like you really understood each other/ clicked? What would be keys to making it work from both sides?  Do you think both sides could stay true to who they are and be happy or would someone end up changing a lot?  Take your t√Æme. I appreciate it! 
1789,estj,Ha th√© one response I get is not even from an ESTJ that tells you something!  Ok ENTP man to man.  How's it going? What makes it work well? What doesn't?  Has educating yourselves on each other's personality been needed/helpful?  how high is the potential for such a match? Bla-bla-bla 
1790,estj,"It's not going super well but we're pulling through. We get on each other nerves most of the times since she is stubborn but I'm right. You can imagine the ""I told you so""s, and how much it pisses her off. We manage to get along well when she takes her time to think instead of just going with her gut feeling and I put some effort into getting my shit together. You have to be be respectful of your partner and put effort into improving the parts of you that get on her nerves, becoming a better, rounder person while you're at it. But I guess that's the point of relationships in general. Also , knowing our types and how they work actually helped us a bit I think, it gives us words to talk more precisely and concisely about parts of ourselves. Then again, that's the point of MBTI as a whole I guess."
1791,estj,"Scenario: 
Your SO is an irrational and spoiled stay-at-home ESFJ. Your kids played games at home all the time while you were out working. They type as INFJs. Let's say you and the kids can't have any lengthy conversations with each other because your interests or perspectives are too different. How would you feel or cope?"
1792,estj,"I would try to make their upbringing the best that I can for them, it's not like I'd disown my children for having a unique perspective on the world. Having different interests and perspectives doesn't mean I can't have a conversation with them, I'll try to understand their views and see if they can understand mine. Having a couple of STJ children would be great, but it's not like there would be much room for growth for either of us. I'm their parent, not their MBTI instructor.
EDIT: By the way, this post sounds pretty personal. If you need to talk, whether you just need to rant or want to get some perspective on the ESTJ view of the world, go ahead."
1793,estj,"The sham marriage is working as intended. Not sure why I had a sham marriage in the first place, but I probably had my reasons.
Well at least the kids are judgers, so I have a real pension insurance. They can work all day while I play games at home. Or better yet, burn the money for hookers. Daddy needs his massages!"
1794,estj,"Hi ESTJs,
I am doing a survey on whether a person's personality type has any kind of influence on what a person might dream about. If you are interested in taking it, I would appreciate your thoughts. The link is below. I can also post the results to this forum or DM you if anyone is interested in the results. Just let me know in the comments.

1795,estj,"Hi, for those that are interested, I have the preliminary results on my blog. Here is the link: http://kayla.kaylasweirdbrain.com/2019/05/mbti-and-dreams-is-there-connection.html
I will have later posts that will break the information down into types so feel free to keep checking back for more insights.
Thanks to all who participated!"
1796,estj,"So I'm an INFP. If you hang out in any infp group, there's destined, nay, fated to be some ESTJ bashing from time to time. We call you anything from robots to ants to unfeeling Jerks who take pleasure in kicking puppies. Seriously, we can be a spiteful bunch! 
Anyways, I've got to wonder what you estjs think about us. Are we special little snowflakes? Are we crybabies? Are we just plain ungrounded in reality? Well... I guess we are all three actually. 
So.... Be  brutal. And  note that while I tease, when I've actually known an ESTJ, they've actually been cool people. "
1797,estj,"Not an ESTJ, but I had the fun of observing the ESTJ/INFP dynamic between my dad and one of my best friends.
My dad (the ESTJ; ESTJs are like the perfect Dad stereotype) distrusted the INFP as a matter of principle, because the INFP was trying to date his daughter (my sister.) However, after the ESTJ had known the INFP for a while, he began to see him as a good guy. They didn't have a whole lot in common, but they liked and respected each other. I think a huge factor in this was that my dad is the only S in a family of Ns, and married to a really strong I. This gave him an ability to appreciate the INFP where other ESTJs might have blown the INFP off as unfocused, undisciplined, or otherwise worthless.
My INFP friend's relationship with my sister ended, but whenever we talk and reminisce about my family, he tells me, ""I miss talking to your dad the most. I never knew what he was thinking."""
1798,estj,"INFPs are probably my favorite type. I have 3 best friends and they are all INFPs.  Considering how different we seem to be, somehow they are my perfect match. 
They are also the pairing of my parents (ESTJ & INFP) who have always had a rock solid marriage.  
I get along with INFJs, but don't have a lot of them in my life, met a few on different Reddit communities that I've gotten close to, but don't know many in my life right now.  
I personally don't mind them, but the connection is nowhere as close as it is with INFPs.  I feel like I find INFPs wherever I go, and always make friends with them.  They crack me up and they just get me in a way that makes me feel understood and special.  
I used to work at a coffee shop and there was a girl there who I strongly hated, we never got along and she ended up being one of the main reasons I quit.  She made the environment extremely toxic to a point where it was affecting my life outside of work.  I was always upset and the thought of going to work made me sick.  Apparently, she was an INFJ, I wasn't sure, but that experience has always left me with a negative opinion about them.  
I've met the other INFJs online and never really dealt with them in my life, but the one I did was so negative that whatever type she was, I hope to god I never have to deal with someone like that again. 
For me, I feel like INFPs are weird and quirky but they own it.  I've never come across an INFP that I felt was mistyped or didn't actually embrace it.  That's my favorite part about them.  "
1799,estj,"I think I get along with INFP better.
I think this friend I had in high school may be INFJ and this guy I know somewhat.
I think INFPs seem for me to be easier to get along with. I suppose as a perceiving type they don‚Äôt mind my dominance and assertiveness. Seem to be a much more easy going friend and we talk a bit less. They are much less decisive and is okay with much more.
I feel like the INFJs I know hang around longer and want a deeper conversation, but is faster on the burn out. More readily to point out that it‚Äôs my fault for things or ask more analytical questions. Hmm. I dunno, both seem fine, just that INFP seem to mesh better with me."
1800,estj,"I don't know, most of my INFP experiences have been negative while INFJs more positive. 
The INFPs I were friends with were pretty whiny and would give me very long essays about their life and what they think and what philosophy they want to discuss. I sort of found it annoying because I can just feel the angst/whydon'tanyonefeelthiswayorknowthis in these long winded messages that it turns me off and I ignore them sometimes. I understand they are trying to articulate their feelings in a verbose way, but I can't handle it sometimes because tbh I really don't care too much and lack experience talking to their feelings. They are very trustworthy though so I like them. It's just that there's some strange distance between us that I can't really connect it's just there.
The INFJ I was friends with was very cool and collected. Although quite similar to the INFP, he does get to the point quite quickly and he also helped me emotionally become centered with myself. He was also very chill and we could talk about anything and he was very receptive. It was very fun being with him as it was like he understood me and my own personal space somehow, and he also respected my time talking to him and when we can meet up again and talk about more things etc. Although academically he wasn't the best and dropped out many times, there was something about him that I really liked even though I was frustrated a bit to why he is very lazy and doesn't bother to do well in school that I was concerned for him. However, it's like he knows where he's going so it's cool."
1801,estj,"but he doesn't love me back. We hit off in the form of episodes. Every once and a while we turn into luis and clark, but most of the time he's just yelln' at me. Like, it's the typical sibling rivalry, but one sided. 

Attempt to hug *

""stop it.""
""Why are you soooooo mean""?
""shut up. That's gay stop it. STOP IT."""
1802,estj,"Hugging your brother is not gay, unless you‚Äôre hugging his penis. I‚Äôm assuming that you‚Äôre not hugging his penis in this instance, so the conclusion here is that he‚Äôs just not a cuddly person. 
And that‚Äôs totally cool, but you‚Äôve got to meet him where he is on this. There are loads of ways to show him that you love him without hugging. "
1803,estj,I‚Äôm ESTJ and I‚Äôm not physically affectionate with my brother I‚Äôm female if that makes any difference. My favorite thing is when we hang out and talk and lately that‚Äôs when we run around town playing Pok√©mon Go. 
1804,estj,"Just curious what projects y'all are working on. I personally enjoy working on cars, metal work and some wood work. (Photos of my '84 K20 on my profile) 
So basically comment what your focus is outside of work/family/relationships."
1805,estj,"How do you feel about INTPs? I haven't had the best experiences with ESTJs, although the ESTJs I've had were in their 40's if even that, were teachers, and were from Texas. The other ESTJs I've had...Let's just say they didn't seem fond of me...Also, what drove me nuts is the ""I just don't get it."" moments. They'd think I was rebellious in the same manner as an ISTP...Last I checked, I don't think INTPs exactly fit the greaser type...
It may be hard for me to recognize ESTJs from Gen Y and Z since A. I live in Texas and B. Gen Y and Z are VERY different.
To be honest, I don't think I've ever met an ENTJ either, but surprisingly, I've met a few INFJs. I've only come across one INTP, and that was through cyberschool."
1806,estj,"Did you finally manage to ask how we see the world, instead of forcing a narrative (or accusation) on us? Congratulations (I guess) and it took you what, weeks? I probably should not complain, at least you learn.
To answer your question: I like INTP(s), for the most part. The ones I have met personally are insightful, humorous  and witty. Although sometimes I want to shout at them things like ""Speak up more"" and ""Stop drinking so much"" and ""Instead of complaining about your problems, how about you try to solve them"".
Sometimes I wish I could order people to have a good and fulfilling life."
1807,estj,"I am in a relationship with an INTP.  A solid relationship, he is probably one of the very few people I have felt close to.  We can talk about anything and everything and the conversations are never dull.  He isn't afraid to call me out when I'm being dumb and I can be myself, and often times a little extra and he doesn't mind it one bit.  
I am very forward and honest about what I think and he always compliments me on that, and I've probably spent my whole life being criticized for it.  
My brother is also an INTP and we were always the closest.  I've always felt that INTPs got me in a way that others don't.  Even had a best friend from high school that was INTP and we got along really well.  
I have no complaints about INTPs.  Sometimes Y'all seem a bit lost in thought and can be a little spacey, but it doesn't really bother me.  "
1808,estj,"My best friend is INTP. I've also met other INTPs in my daily life. 
They're generally very reasonable people and I appreciate them for all they are. They're also the only ones who get my physics jokes, so 10/10 would find an INFP and ESFJ to high five and annihilate again. "
1809,estj,I like INTP but I am not sure what they think of me. My favorite math instructor is INTP but I went to him and asked him one too many questions. This other person online I know is INTP. We‚Äôre thinking of meeting up when she comes over from Denmark in november for a friends wedding. She was the one who retyped me for ESTJ.
1810,estj,"I mean I can do that again if you want.
Oh, you're one to talk Mr. or Ms. Si. XD
I've always thought the drinking part was dumb. It's illogical and isn't really the most pleasurable experience. You become a numb robot."
1811,estj,"XD INTPs love answering questions as long as they're thought out and don't have a ""Whyyy?"" ""Whyyy?"" Whyyy?"" feel to them. I have an ISFJ mom who will ask questions like this. It's not that I have a problem answering them. It's the way she does it."
1812,estj,"I figured the best group to ask would be other ESTJ's.
Anyway I'm a feeler, so it's kind of hard for me sometimes to communicate with ESTJ folks, and the issue right now is an ESTJ I know has this awkward combination of being hypercritical, but when it comes to being criticized, he deflects it.
Someone says he's bossy, he tells them it's because everyone else is so lazy, and if other people would pull their weight, he wouldn't have to be bossy. 
If he's called out for being controlling, well it's because he just wants people to do things the right way.
He gets told he has an anger problem, and decides he doesn't have anger issues, no it's that everyone else just lacks a backbone.
The problem is he deflects criticism like he's afraid of it. As if he's afraid to admit that he's not as smart, or well-rounded as he wants to believe he is. In addition a lot of the criticism he deals out, tends to reflect on himself. For example he's quick to call out people he believes are lazy, and yet he's one of the laziest people I know. I mean when he actually gets motivated to work, then yeah he'll work non-stop, but aside from that, he barely does anything aside from his job, and even randomly takes days off, just to stay at home, and play on his computer.
So, other ESTJ's how do you approach this behavior from an ESTJ?"
1813,estj,"According to your description I actually doubt that he is an ESTJ, and the reasoning behind my suspicion in brief would be that no matter how we tend to approach things or how unhealthy we sometimes can get, responsibilities always come first in our lives. However, this should be a minor concern for you at the moment so I will not dwell on it.
So back to your question: how do we approach someone with such behaviors? Personally if this person is nothing but a liability, I would simply avoid engaging in anything of importance with him. However, if he's not, if I couldn't avoid him (especially if he was my manager or someone of equivalence), I'd try to protect myself first- as in, try my best not to let him throw me under the bus when I don't have time for it, be careful around him and still do what I have to do. Strike him down, even, if the time is right. 
Or you could try to change him into a better person. The choice is always yours but I will say this: You know this man is not pleasant to be around (to say the least), and of course he has problems he's oblivious to that need to be fixed, but it's not always your job to do that."
1814,estj,"I recommend a walkabout. Send him to a place he's never been with $200. Tell him to come back in 2 weeks. 
In all seriousness, he won't change is mind because you tell him, he needs to see it on his own. Experiencing his innerself is the only way for him to understand what you are saying. A healthy outlet is really important for achieving this. "
1815,estj,"That is probably not going to happen. I'm not saying I wouldn't try. I'm saying he would not. This is not a 15-year-old kid who needs to find himself. It's a 50-year-old, man who thinks he has all the answers. His wife always makes the excuse that he's stressed. She says his behavior is because he's so stressed. Except I've met other ESTJ's who manage their stress quite well. An ESTJ girl I know, had a bad breakup, and is now a single mother, of two boys, to me that would be stressful, and yet aside from a bad day here, and there, the sort anyone would have, she keeps a positive outlook."
1816,estj,15 or 50... if you act a particular way your age doesn't matter. Your ESTJ girl sounds like an adult. Help your friend find an outlet so he can get in touch with himself and you will see him get better. 
1817,estj,"I'm am making characters based on MBTI. I have already designed ENTP and one of my main goals was not to make a character that was just ENTP stereotypes and I've decided to do the same with other types so I have a few questions. 


What are some stereotypes to stay away from when making this character? (I am aware of the Not identifying with ESTJ stereotypes post I will use it but I believe that question is broader allowing for different answers)


What clothing would be the most appropriate for an ESTJ character?


What are/were your main goals and struggles in your life that define who you are?


How do you interact with ENTPs? (The ENTP character and ESTJ character interact a lot)


Thank you for answering and I'm an ENTP by the way. "
1818,estj,"

A lot has been said in the said post, so I'm just going to drag a few things out from the top of my head. a) We aren't downers. We don't get in our group of friends and be dead serious. That doesn't happen. b) Not all of us have the essential qualities to be respected by everyone. You might want to beware of how you portray others when they're around the ESTJ character. c) We don't isolate ourselves from people if we're healthy. Quite the opposite, in fact. d) Remember the extroverts.


What clothing would be the most appropriate for most people to wear in your world setting? And what clothing would be the most appropriate for the character to wear based on their background?


I strive to be one of the best in my professional field and every struggle along the way shaped me up.


Needs to be more specific. What is the relationship between the two? How long have they known each other? What significant incidents happened that could have influenced their behaviour around each other?

"
1819,estj,"Sorry for being too vague
Pretty much regular clothing comparing to what you would see people where today. The character is a female, in a government job but I would like top know what would be best when I am drawing the character when she is in casual dress. 
They are coworkers. Her job is pretty much a mixture of managing covert ops/being part of it sometimes. She was hired to basically look over him and make sure he doesn't do anything that would fuck with anything. The reason why they don't fire the ENTP is because he is a valuable asset. 
They both are around the same age (early twenties). 
They have known each other for about 3 months now. She was aware of the ENTP before she became his supervisor though. 
They haven't been through many life changing experience that I guess would have them bond. 
I believe a better question would be how would an ESTJ interact with an ENTP with these traits. 


Understands authority but when he has a want to do something that isn't allowed he will either just go and do it or do it secretly (this happens every so often though).


Isn't overly talkative until he feels a need to.


Will tease and argue with her for fun but knows when to stop (although knowing when to stop won't stop him necessarily, he will keep going if he feels like she deserves it or if he is trying get something out of it). 


He dislikes planning to an extreme amount. If he feels like he gets the gist of things or knows the broad plan. He will go on his own and just adapt, especially if something that part of the plan he ""read"" didn't say anything about it. 


A weird mixture of being cold and not caring much of the feelings of other and how his actions effect other with a loyalty towards his friends and an ability to help them with their problems (when the ENTP feels like it or is just bored). 


He is either really focused on something that has nothing to do with the job or can't focus on anything while doing the job. 


Even though he is a dick every so often he will give her a break and do something nice for her. 


Tried to be specific for you (it was hard) anyway thanks for your answers and I hoped this helped. "
1820,estj,"Sure! 
Casual as in go-to-grocery-shopping-look? So she would be in jeans and white shirts tucked under. Or dresses or skirts that go over the knees and not above. Or go business casual if she's not feeling too 'plebeian'. Don't go with cardigans too much, they're the easiest go-to for most people, but for her would be a tad droopy.
So she is basically an assistant for him? Personally I would say that the chance of those two not despising each other is quite slim. We like it clean when it comes to work, and we like to have things perhaps not completely in control but at least in an orderly fashion. And nobody, I repeat nobody, at least no real person, likes their boundaries to be pushed because a coworker thinks that they deserve it. And so there's got to be strong adversaries here.
She might not care about his personal life, how he treats his friends or how cold he is as a person etc because we generally don't do that to someone at work.
This one is from myself as a person and might not be applicable to all ESTJs, but if someone at work tries to do something nice for me out of nowhere or for no reason, I wouldn't appreciate it. Instead I would try to recall what I did wrong to make people feel like my work is being too much for me and that I'm not competent enough to handle it."
