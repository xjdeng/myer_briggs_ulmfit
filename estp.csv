0,estp,"How did you guys deal with people you had developed feelings for, but for one reason or another couldn't make it work at the time but never lost those feelings? Did you force yourself to move on and find greener pastures or find a way to overcome the roadblocks in your way? "
1,estp,"Basically realizing why I felt the way I did, where it went wrong, and if it was even avoidable or not
I then tried to better myself and not look back. I guess the emotional baggage for me has kinda dropped off because I'm a completely different person in nearly every aspect of my life. 
I know the same thing wouldn't happen again today unless it let it. Other things could happen but I know I have bettered myself in one way for sure.
Tldr: Basically tackle your insecurities and you won't feel insecure "
2,estp,"I’ve had that sometimes. It sucks, but I tend to look at it as a benefit because if it would work out and I never realized something that didn’t, then we would be fighting and that’s not good.
I know relationships aren’t perfect and yeah I can still have feelings for those that didn’t work out, but I just suck it up and say I will find someone better someday that will really “get me” and be open with.
To numb the sadness, at night I just drink a lot, blast some sad songs on my earphones (November rain by Guns n Roses) and eat some comfort food and then sleep and hang out with friends the next day. "
3,estp,"They all formed in high school. We all moved to different places for university and to settle down so for me there was just no point in trying to make something of any of those crushes. This is probably a more apathetic response than some of the others you may get, but I still very much think of them when I stumble upon one of their posts on social media."
4,estp,"Yes! I am a fiend to please, especially when my sexual partner says something in particular gets them more excited. For example, one will only have sex if I’m wearing my work heels. Easy demand, I say yes every time even when it’s not hotter or easier for me. I sometimes wonder if I’m a pushover for agreeing to this but it’s like .... the demand is easily fulfilled, why risk my chances of getting laid ? 
There’s a few crazier things in the bag I will to try with a partner when they receive my suggestions positively. "
5,estp,"i dont have any fetishes but im really kinky and am really open to a lot. only things i wont do are anything with kids, corpses, animals, feet, vomit, or scat. otherwise im essentially an open book and will definitely try anything at least once"
6,estp,"Hi Folks,
I'm female ESTP and just figured out my bahaviour when I'm really pissed off. The fun fact is this is really rare 'cause I'm not that emotional. Nevertheless, sometimes I'm really pissed off - and nobody wants to be near once I have this state of mind. 
It's really hard to say why I'm angry, this is like ""snap"" and here you go, I'm really angry and unintentionaly, awaiting for anyone who bother me so I can really snap at him/her. I figured out that I can be pissed off once someone won't take his responsibilities seriously or someone is pinging me and asking about something trivial - and I set my mind into complex issues. Normally, I would gladly assist (if it's within my scope) but if I have a lot questions like that and I see that someone doesn't want to learn then I'm really agressive.
To calm down I need my space, 1 or 2 hours when no one is trying to ask me anything. If someone asks ""hey, something wrong?"" - I will definetly snap, but I never bring personal details in quarell, only competences/skills/facts - or rather lack of skill. I always hit where hurt the most.
Are you also like me? I'm becoming more introvertic (don't want to have contact with people, don't want to interract), at the same time i'm short-tempered, I will snap and give everything I got just to silence someone so he doesn't bother me. 
I don't have any trouble to explain situation after I calm down and say sorry, nevertheless I'm thinking if there is any possibility to control this behaviour?
Do you have similar experience? Any advice? "
7,estp,holy fuck this shit right here. The last thing I want to do in this state of mind is to have to explain to some dipshit why i'm so pissed off. just fuck off and let me sort this shit out on my own. 
8,estp,"Yeah I've got the same.
It sucks, on normal days I have no problem in explaining what's up. Even without someone asking.
However, when I'm in a bad mood, I really need to try not to snap, stay calm, and find a way to explain what's up.
What works for me, is to try and think of the consequences of what I say and how it influences my reputation towards others.
Most of the time I already know what I want to say, and how I can say what I think in such a way that the message gets across, without other people looking down upon me."
9,estp,"nah man. if someone ask me what's up and I'm not angry at them im not gonna snap. I just say im good and leave it at that even tho im obviously pissed. I just dont feel like talking about it but i appreciate them checking in on me and let them know that. Unless it's one of my really close friends who I know understands me.. Then I may vent a little.
honestly whoever I'm angry at, (I'm getting better at this) but I don't like to express my emotions towards them unless it's love type feelings. Like expressing my infatuation. If it's anger, I don't speak to them at all. I'm more think over what I should do and then I act. There are no words most times. But a lot can be solved by talking about things which I'm learning now even though I neglected it in the past. I'd rather throw punches than argue 
BTW I sort of just skimmed ur post. If I didnt answer ur question whatever i guess. hope this helps"
10,estp,"Thank you so much! :) 
I don't have any trouble when I can just go freely - normally I'm trying not to unleash my blind rage, but the best way for me to calm down is going at the gym. But I don't always have the possibility to do it.
Nevertheless, as you said - I think the best way is to realize that I'm like that - that's always a step :) "
11,estp,"I am a enfj to the fullest. Estps are strange creatures to me.
 I had this huge thing written out and realized you all won’t read it so here is the tldr version.
For ten years this guy has texted me (short and to the point) and called me. Tells me he’s in love with me when he’s drunk. Hangs around me like I’m a bro, doesn’t flirt with me but will flirt with other chicks. So I get a distinct not interested vibe unless he’s drunk and confessing his love for me. It’s been ten years and he still checks in on me with an occasional drunk I love you call. When not drunk he tells me I’m gorgeous and the best he’s ever had. 
So is this estp playing me or does he have feelings for me or what?  As an enfj i don’t understand any of it. "
12,estp,"I've been flirted with by an ESTP, even after telling him to stop (he didn't actually notice he was doing it), when he was having a gf which he really loved, and to whom he confessed after getting drunk. Soo...  
Not to extrapolate too much, but if you feel like it why not give him a little encouragement and see if it ends well. 10y is a loong time"
13,estp,"oh, geeze. Do you have feelings for him is the important part? If so it sounds like you're going to have to force the issue with him to get the truth out, sounds like he's into you but too socially awkward/inhbited to actually admit it... doesn't sound like the most emotionally mature person though! I'd be careful."
14,estp,"You sure that's an ESTP and not a Se-ISTP? ENFJs and ISTPs are in relations of ""duality"" in socionics, which is the ideal type match, which could be why he's been loving on you for so long in such inexplicable ways. Se-ISTPs are sometimes easy to mistake for ESTPs."
15,estp,Hey I'm a girl too and I have trouble even admitting to myself that I like someone much less telling them. Do you want him to like you? Would you like to be with him? I guess your actions depend on that :)
16,estp,"Yes, 
So because I am so nice, when I first met him I thought he was an asshole. But he’s grown on me so much. And he tells me things I need to hear* that all my happy girlfriends would never say. I kind of like that, I know he’s honest. We live across the country from each other but still fly to places to see each other, plus our parents live in our hometown. He has talked about moving here because he likes my location (the beach) over his."
17,estp,I am curious to know if any of you have been in a relationship with a depressed person and how you have dealt with it. What do you do to make them feel better? How do you not let their depression effect you?
18,estp,"People who are depressed can't be pushed pulled or guided out of it. As an estp who has suffered from depression.. (i ended up very alone due to me being an ass hole when i was younger... and stuff happened and now i am better off. End of story.).. just be honest. 
""I don't get why you are down... i just know you are down... i don't know how to help you, or if you want help.. but i care about you...  if you ever want to visit a doctor about this, i will go with you... or whatever you need... ask. I will do my best.""
Mean while make her laugh, figure out if you are dealing with an introverted or extroverted person... allow this person what they need to recharge. Dont burden them by expecting them to help you recharge if they are introverted.
Just be there... this is one of those moments thst can be hard for our type because it requires you to do... nothing. Just listen.. don't fix or move mountains.. just be still for them."
19,estp,"I may not be in a relationship with someone who is depressed but I'm engaged to a woman who has moderate anxiety. It's not crippling and she doesn't really have any major episodes or anxiety attacks but it can be difficult for her at times. I guess I would just say be open and mindful of other people. I know everyone thinks ESTP's are ultra selfish and can't empathize with others but I don't find that to be the case for me.
While I may not understand because I don't have anxiety it's still possible for me to put myself in her shoes and help her through tough times. "
20,estp,"I've been teetering between ENFP/ESTP so I guess this applies to me. I had an ENFP partner sometime last year, their emotions were very volatile hence the sudden highs and lows and in a way I suppose they were depressed but wouldn't want to hear it from anyone. I think the way to make any depressed person better is to ensure they know you're there for them emotionally and that you love and care for them (but ensure they don't take advantage of that factor). Allow them to see you as part of their foundation but not their entire foundation. I think the latter can be answered by reminding yourself but you're a person too as much as they are and there's honestly a limit to what you can do or how you can help."
21,estp,"I never really have. I find depressed people annoying. I've always been confident and self assured, and never afraid of anything (except spiders, of course) So I get easily frustrated when a depressed person doesn't even try to help themselves. Some can't help it, and they need professional help, but most could at least try."
22,estp,"Hi r/ESTP, I'm in my early twenties and have recently begun to tutor a middle-school-aged ESTP girl, in English reading and writing, and Math (she's told me she performs much better with Math than English reading and writing). She's very intelligent, sharp, patient, empathic, has an understated curiosity, and also deals with ADD - I do as well, but we experience it with very notable Ne-Si vs. Se-Ni differences: my inattentiveness is often around different streams of ideas or thoughts racing through my mind and competing with one another, which displays itself as sometimes jumping from topic to topic, switching between metaphors, and pausing between words or sentences to refocus my mind on whatever thought I had begun. Her form of ADD (some of you may not need me to elaborate here) centers around her dominant Se - easily distracted by what is physically around her (specifically sounds and movements), can forget what she hears moments after hearing it, finds reading challenging because her mind doesn't like processing minute details (E.g., was shy about reading, and reading aloud, as she had to go slowly and would skip words or misinterpret them, and found words with many consonants and foreign roots/origins, like 'ballet' troublesome to read and spell). She is also very self conscious of this, especially since today was our first session, and is sensitive to correction, which has made me avoid it on occasion because I was afraid of hurting her feelings and she often can find her mistakes on her own if she double checks her work (though she seems to not either like doing it or forgets, or some combination of the two). I'm also relatively new to tutoring, or at least am highly out of practise - the last time I found myself frequently giving help to students in middle school or high school was when I was attending them both, as a student. I feel very nervous working with her as I can easily slip into giving as much an encyclopedic background as I possess (which I quickly became mindful of with her), when explaining concepts, like a particular rule of grammar, which I'm afraid possibly tests her patience. I can't read her expressions or body consistently (never sure if I am right or wrong), and she isn't very vocal since she's shy. On top of this, Ni isn't the kind of function that is willing to explain itself at length or in depth, so it's hard for me to gauge her thinking process to help her where needed. 
In terms of strengths, she thinks very clearly and quickly, and has that great hyper focus ability, so when she engages, she does so fully. She has also had tutoring for several years (though she may not have had an INTP), and so far seems relatively temperate and eagerly takes instruction. Again referencing hyper focus, her memory and ability to absorb material is also very strong, so long as her attention is engaged - for example, even though she struggles with reading and pronunciation, she retains the ideas presented in the material and can easily answer questions on what was mentioned in the passages (I am a bit of the opposite). 
Any advice? Individual differences despite personality 'type' aside, what are some teaching and/or occasional correction approaches that you have responded well to and/or prefer? Assuming I'm a more or less a blank slate, what are some important things I should know or consider about building trust with and taking on a teaching role with a(n) (young) ESTP, or simply interacting with one, in general? How should I go about handling detail as someone who can frequently and unknowingly get borderline pedantic with details, and how could I use that to somehow benefit this student and help her grow intellectually and academically (from your opinion/experience)? Are there methods and strategies I could pass to her, that may help her better manage attention to little things, like spelling and grammar, or in other academic areas? (One thing I tried was asking her to follow lines on the page with her pen, as she read aloud, to help keep her eyes from jumping sentences, which seemed to help a little bit, until she forgot to do so, as she got caught up in the actual reading process.) How could I establish better trust and/or make her feel safe enough to make mistakes without 'feeling dumb' or 'incompetent', in order to focus on growing past them? Any input at all would be greatly welcomed and appreciated; and thanks in advance. (Also, if anything I mentioned needs further clarification, please let me know.)
Also - sorry about the length. "
23,estp,"You should hold off on the typing. She's just a kid who gets distracted easily. It doesn't mean she's ESTP also you should focus more on trying to help her.
Where do you tutor her? Make sure there isn't a lot of distractions around you. Try a library or reserve a study room. When correcting her try not to point it out but stop the lesson and ask if there were any mistakes just now. Do it frequently so she can get the hang of going back and correcting herself. This also makes it seem like you're not stopping her at every mistake, you should also stop her when she's correct. When it comes to being self conscious when reading, try reading out loud with her. Go at her pace or if you want take turns reading to each other so she isn't so uncomfortable. Let her know that it's okay to make mistakes. Try to make the lesson more interesting or take frequent 5 minute breaks or less. Add games to the lesson and make sure to interact throughout the lesson so she isn't distracted or gets bored.
These are all basic tips from when I used to be an English tutor. Hope it helps."
24,estp,"Haha! Wonderful post, well written and organized. It shows the INTP in you.
As advice, if you can find a way to make her curious or interested in the subject it would be the best, but otherwise praise her when she does well and to challenge her to stimulate her competitive instincts."
25,estp,"To help her focus. Let her move and hyper focus on things. So if she is reading out loud, let her pace or walk as she reads. Play some music in the background that has no words, just a sick beat. Toss a ball back and forth while talking about the subject at hand. 
Walking about, tossing a ball.. all things that engage the distracted parts of her brain, the part that instinctively needs action. While letting the part of her brain that is involved with higher more critical thinking, do other things."
26,estp,"I am 99.99998% sure that Mortaldeadking is not a bot.

^(I am a neural network being trained to detect spammers | Summon me with !isbot <username"
27,estp,"Oh jeez. 
I'm not gonna lie. A lot of new generations are pretty fucked up in general for a lot of reasons so it's like learning basic consideration and communication is real hard but it's something we're just gonna have to teach other in the end, or tell potential SO's thats it's not just a standard, but a requirement. ESTP, for how stereotyped they are to be extroverted party animals, I've found need a good amount of space. Everyone does tbh. It's a pretty normal thing."
28,estp,"We need a break too, a lot goes on and unwinding is essential. Sometimes I just need people to fuck off and go away so I can catch a breather for a minute, for me individually I've had months at a time where sleep is my only alone time and I share that with my puppy, so it's hardly relaxing (not to blame him, but cattle dogs gonna cattle dog)
I mean I love a nice night as much as the next guy, but after any big scene or story or something at a party I'll usually step outside on my own for a minute to get some air and then dive back in, and I can sort of status check my own drunk ass, slow down and get my feet on the ground before launch again. I think that's more of a military and self preservation mindset though, I don't know if other ESTPs do that"
29,estp,"Ah. I've seen that from the outside, pretty stupid. I wasn't allowed to join a raid group because the leader's gf didn't want another girl in there. And a different guy wasn't allowed to join my current one (or any for that matter) because there are girls in it /legasp"
30,estp,"My one ESTP friend is super cagey about people knowing where he lives and his apartment, even his closest friends, because he doesn't want it to become a fucking play house for his other friends to come over and spend lots of time in-- Especially considering that he's one of the only working one of them. He's also told me for a lot of years of his life he's tried to play the cool stoic dudes but he just couldn't because it wasn't fun, haha. Seems like he's bad at it, goes against his nature. So I guess it makes sense for alone time to get scarce, if one is so outwardly disposed and involved. I'm one of the few he's trusted with the location. 
Perhaps more of the mature ones? The one I know is pretty mature, has seen some hard shit, real hard worker. Very developed human being all around. I may have potentially met one more since typing people, and... he was not going through hardships, much at all, and was essentially a very young fuck boy. Aside from that, being able to check oneself sounds predictable of my ESTP too, provided adrenaline or some other rush hasn't completely taken his mental wheel. I know he has the potential for that (self-admitted), but idk how much it would take to get him there. "
31,estp,"Honestly I was the same way. I separated my private life from my public one, would never host parties at my own place. I'd definitely host them, but with my best friend at his place. I now live with my other two close friends, neither of whom are into partying. I definitely don't tell anyone else where I live
I like to think I'm pretty mature for my age, but I'm definitely still a kid and have a long way to go. I had great parents and have had an... interesting life. A decent amount of forced maturity "
32,estp,"Hmmm... that may mean a lot of interesting things for my relationship with my ESTP, if he too keeps his private and public life separate. 
My dudes got a bad family history, not a lot of support, and has been homeless, and is not afraid to be again. That said, he is not yet thirty, and is pursueing acting so he can eventually pursue directing. I'ma support him as much as possible. "
33,estp,"I mean that in the sense that my personal space is mine and I want it to be controlled exactly how I see fit, it's the one time where instead of going with the flow, the flow goes with me. I get to be alone at home, I get to focus, I get to space out and disconnect. I don't mean that like I'm two different people or something "
34,estp,"No I get it. I have similar shit going on. People make me lose focus a lot, and I have to get rude to make that not happen. Need privacy to unwind and all that, get in touch with emotions. Dw dude that stuffs normal, no one would think you're two different people lol. "
35,estp,"I'm in school right now so I haven't started doing any jobs that have to do with my degree, but I've done similar things and I love learning about my degree. I'm studying kinesiology, and want to do biomechanics or bioengineering. I'm also open to teaching and coaching, which I have done, and I loved that
Otherwise I enjoy working with my hands and a relatively dynamic workplace environment. I enjoyed the military, and I've been looking into a lot of blue collar careers recently "
36,estp,"Dietitian (Nutritionist) for a public health org.
I started out wanting to be a food anthropologist like Anthony Bourdian, travel the world, eat cultural foods, etc. but then reality set in and I chose a career that will always be in demand with decently good pay. Although I work in a heavy bureaucratic job, I like the structure it provides and I can bounce wildly with my plans within those parameters. I like knowing the rules so I can find ways to make things more efficient or know how far I can push the envelope before my boss starts pumping the breaks.
Pros- Get paid to think about food all day and help others find tasty food that won’t kill them.                                         
-          Get to create empowering health messages and graphics.                        
-          Theres always a ‘fire burning’ and my action-oriented thinking gets the ball rolling.                                         
-          It’s a health center, so lunch walks or happy hour 5ks are encouraged by management- this helps me from getting burned out from being behind a computer all day.       
-          Standing desks <3
Cons- constantly thinking about food.     
-          Congress, legislations & policies"
37,estp,"Wow!! Thank you so much!! This was very insightful, and I really enjoyed reading it. I’m definitely going to be thinking about this a lot and absorbing it for the next couple of days. It was so refreshing to hear you talk about it. "
38,estp,"Sometimes I notice that when I'm relaxed and having the most fun with life, all of a sudden a small crowd will have formed around me and will be smiling also. Then, afterwards people will approach me and try to get that to happen again. Almost as if they are looking to me to make them happy or to fill some gap. Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm imagining all of it.
EDIT: Wasn't sure if I should put this here or in /r/adhd."
39,estp,"And I'm not being a bad ESTP or mistyping myself when I say I want to get away from that and help those who help me and others?
EDIT: ESTP is definitely the type I relate the most too, in my head. Once I think people are leeching off of me it gets agitating and I just want to say to them ""Dude, I'm not your fucking savior. I have dark days too. I want to be left alone sometimes."""
40,estp,"No, it gets old, and ESTP are generally somewhat selfish. You help people who help you because you know it's not a waste, and in your investment, you have something to gain as well. I can go from being part of the life of the party by choice to saying ""ok fuck it, I want to do my own thing"" very quickly"
41,estp,"Sometimes I just don't vibe to parties
Fuck em, they're usually strangers so what difference does it make? If your friends don't like you for leaving a party or doing your own thing low key, you probably need better friends"
42,estp,"On a side note one of the first weekends I spent with what is now my closest group of friends, I was given some cash and told to go to the bars and have some fun because the environment they were after was a lot more relaxed than what I was after. They saw that I didn't. They knew how better to handle me than I did at that time."
43,estp,"Do what your rank/position can handle. If you can handle telling them to fuck off, especially if this is off the clock, there's not shit anyone can do about it. If it's on the clock and has gotten to that point, if someone reeeeeally wants to make it a problem, so long as you have a case for yourself go for it"
44,estp,"What do ESTP's generally do to go after a girl when you see one you like? I read that you guys act bold and make it obvious that you're interested, but I'd like more details. How do you act? What do you think? How long do you take to ask her out? What's your approach & attitude? What's your procedure? "
45,estp,"What do you want to know, specifically? It depends on the partner. The more patience and malleability in thought and humor the better. Do you need a breakdown of what I found to be admirable traits in multi-year relationships past and present? 
Judging from your post history, you're female. My perspective might not be tailored to your needs. I'm not sure if the menfolk here will give you the courtesy of obliging in explicit detail. If you're expecting some long-winded, tearfully-framed expulsion of an ethereal sonnet, whether it be from a male or female ESTP, you're not going to get it. Jokes, touch, inviting you along for the ride and, if you are highly regarded platonically or romantically, protectiveness.      "
46,estp,"Edit: I'm thinking now I mistook his type and he's an ENFJ. I give up.
Thank you. That was already pretty helpful. I guess I was being lazy and didn't really know what I was looking for/didn't want to reveal my reason for asking.
I am assuming based on your remark that you are also female? Your perspective would help me regardless of gender I think.
I'm not 100% sure of my type yet but I'm somewhere between INTP and INFP I suspect closer to the former. The one I figure is an ESTP is puzzling to me. He has so many seemingly close people in his life (I don't pretend to know his reality) and I wonder how he truly regards me and how I can know if I am adding value to his life or draining him. I wonder this because I have few people in my circle and I am very readable so it's hard for me to imagine other ways of operating. I am trying to figure out how I should approach the future mentally and I'd rather do that with a little more bearing on the situation which may be impossible. 
At this point I can't ask him and don't really want to. I want some mental peace and I know I will think about this for much longer than I should if I don't at least try to explore it. I know his responses to me well and though he's open about a lot of things, I don't perceive him as being completely forthright about how he feels about me. I know what his answer will be and it always seems like a sidestep to me. Maybe that's a giveaway.
It's highly possible I'm wrong about his type and this is pretty individualized I guess but I wonder more about how you express love?
How do people you love fit into your life? What are your biggest challenges in a romantic relationship and what are the things you do well?
Do you put up with people you don't enjoy or are you very selective about your circle?"
47,estp,"Actions in the moment, attempting to be thoughtful, or with improvisation. Essentially... you can tell when a estp wants to spend time with you because they keep spending time with you!
Commitment is a challenge. That doesn't mean i'm constantly tempted to cheat... it means i'm constantly tempted to end the relationship for no other reason than to avoid commitment.
The things i do well are entertain and problem solve.
Both. I will tolerate people i do not enjoy and i am selective about who i engage meaningfully with. So the nuance here is that i'll take attention from anyone but i'll give attention only to those i enjoy."
48,estp,"I'm super fuzzy.
At this point I'm very convinced he's an ESFP because the people I see on YouTube have the same energy as him and ESFP's in relationships is exactly how he was. It also seems like an unbiased description of how he really is without my biases and projections. He comes off as an ESTP sometimes but mostly just if he's in a big group and is manic (he is bipolar). I thought he was an ENFJ because the descriptions of their minor traits on Reddit are very him and he loves cuddling and affectionate words. But watching them on YouTube he's not at all like them.
I feel I got what I needed just out of trying to figure this out. I realized I won't figure him out but I also realized how people really do experience things differently. I can validate my experience without trying to make his the same as mine or getting upset because it's not the same. It took a lot to figure out my type and now I'm certain I'm INFP. I super idealize so this helped me to let go of that with him. I think ESTP was on one end of my idealization and ENFJ on the opposite end."
49,estp,"As a ESTP, I was too busy talking with everybody to even consider that someone might like me.  Multiple time I needed to basically be hit over the head to notice.  In retrospect, I think this is more a boy thing than an ESTP thing..."
50,estp,"I got my ESTP by walking around with no pants at Burning Man.  He'd get distracted by other people and then see the lack of pants again, and before we knew it we were inseparable.  This is good, because I'm an INFJ and I'd rather eat nails than approach strangers.
It's been 17 years and we're pantsless even now."
51,estp,"Funny! I'm an INFJ and happened to meet an ESTP by meeting up with a mutual friend, he was there, and we went on a nature walk. It was hot that day so I was wearing short shorts and a tiny tank top. Since that day we have spent every night with each other. It's only been a few months for us, but I'd like to say we will also be pantsless that far down the road, lol."
52,estp,"that's awesome!  I hope you guys have a long and wonderful pantslessness. :)
I get along best with mine when we're out in nature, either roadtrips (we just got back from camping and visiting Mt. St. Helens) or ski trips."
53,estp,"That sounds incredible! From what I have gathered so far ESTPs seem to love adventure/spontaneity. Unfortunately we are in the Midwest and there isn't much out here that is as exciting or beautiful as Mt. St. Helens, but perhaps I can convince him to go on a road trip with me soon. Or spend a day wandering downtown."
54,estp,"Try looking up interviews of these guys and gals: 
Se-ESTPs & Ti-ESTP."
55,estp,"Of course you can change? That's like saying you were same person now as you were 20 years ago.
Things happen, experiences like life and death situations can make massive changes to our personalities.
I also think people change more the younger they are but as they get older they become more 'cemented' in your ways.
This is just my opinion obviously..."
56,estp,"There might be a chance you'd switch within the same function group. But switching functions is unheard of without major brain damage or some drastic change to your personality.
You'd have to pretty much be completely different and unrecognizable.
More likely you've just mistyped one of the times. Since mistyping is incredibly common."
57,estp,That's what I believe too! But I get told off about it a lot... I personally feel that ESTP represents me as a person much better than ENFP and I identify with it better but most people believe that it's impossible to change your cognitive functions... :/
58,estp,"Well, I know for certain that I'm an ExxP. I thought I was Ne because I've been intuitive and told I was in many situations in which I choose to focus at the big picture and in turn used my F function to gauge other people's emotions. I used to be a visionary who envisioned but never put into practice. But S because I became more pragmatic and practical, no longer jumping from idea to idea or trying out new ones but more often than not choosing to stick by the book. F because I used to allow my volatile emotions to influence my actions and in turn wasn't typically objective, was also very expressive & sensitive to others and myself. But nowadays, I use more rational thinking and thought process, in turn I've become more blunt/tactful but yet not as sensitive to others. I also have a hard time dealing with people who are emotionally charged because I feel like I can't relate as easily as I used to."
59,estp,"It's hard to say without more info.
But looking at the ENFP/ESTP function stacks, they are practically opposites. Ne-Fi-Te-Si vs Se-Ti-Fe-Ni.
It could just be a matter of having been an unhealthy ESTP (which would appear as an ISTJ, using your shadow functions) and accidentally typing as an ESTJ. Or alternatively being an unhealthy ENFP (appearing as an ISTP) and then mistyping as an ESTP.
I'd say go look into the functions and see what describes you.
Were you 'healthy' personality-wise earlier? Were these serious events bad or good? Having gone though a lot of shit might have thrown you into shadow functions. Meaning you are just an ENFP in a rough time. Alternatively the opposite could have happened (an ESTP getting into a healthy state).
Given the typing issue is between ENFP/ESTP and you mentioned serious events, this sounds like the case. As for what exactly happened, it's hard to say without more info. But you are certainly one or the other and simply mistyping due to the events going on. Alternatively it could just be plain old test mistyping which happens in a lot of people, as there's an N/T bias in the tests."
60,estp,"I guess in the previous years I was in a more precarious state (eg bad family background) which has toned down over the years, a few of my emotional disorders also has become less severe over time. Recent serious event would be a breakup a few months ago which has left me a little displaced emotional wise. And yeah I've noticed the S/J disparity."
61,estp,"Yeah I’d say he is ESTP. I definitely relate to how he approached his early financial struggles and what he wanted to do with his life. Even if it’s illegal, you do what you have to do to survive. His idea about things that could have been done in the future (BMX videos online) is another thing I relate to. I also related to his mannerisms of speaking (and so with the interviewer). I felt the interviewer might be ESTP as well because I’d ask the same questions and reply the same. They both seemed to have a lot of chemistry and know each other’s game and respect each other equally."
62,estp,"Alright cool. If you mean the first one then that's DJ Vlad, he runs the largest channel of hip hop related interviews on youtube, so they basically speak the same language, but I think you're right, Vlad looks like an ESTP too. He keeps up with all the current events, his moves are well calculated and he is known for controversial interviews."
63,estp,"Y'all. I live in one of these places where everyone hangs out with the folks they went to Kindergarten with and don't communicate with strangers or in the workplace etc., and as a fresh transplant from the hyper-social south, I'm totally lost. Anyone live in a place that's super, super antisocial yet feed entirely off of human interaction and conversation and banter?
How do you do it without putting a bullet between your eyes?"
64,estp,"Im an INFP. I moved from Florida to Michigan, in college... I swear people would clutch the walls and slink away just from me saying Hi. Like no one had ever just said ""Hi"" before!?!?? I eventually made friends with expats. We ate dinner at each other's houses every night of the week. 20 people. A different culture and meal almost every damn night. Fuck the social retards.
It's been almost 15 years, and I'm still friends with those people!
I moved back home, moved away and went back home again more than a handful of times. I've lived in 11 different states. I always made good, deep, fast friends. But not in effing Michigan. I went to mass daily, went on retreats, threw myself out there... it took six months for me to meet one really awesome Jamaican chick. 
Good luck!!!
I can only imagine how frustrating that must be for an ESTP."
65,estp,"Well I don't like being around people who are MORE extroverted than me because that's overwhelming, so yes, I do enjoy introverts as well. I want to date a chill girl that balances out my club lifestyle "
66,estp,"I just got off work... I didnt want to go in but I knew a lot of other wouldnt be in... Stress free day.

69,estp,"his character from nerve, which judging by your username you're a fan of, is probably an ESTP or maybe ENTP, but that's just me being optimistic.

70,estp,"Has anyone tried to channel their inferior Ni by using Ni eye movement? Ni eye movement is basically the eyes oscillating between 2 points while what I can only assume is some idea that is on your mind. I've experimented with it by simply performing it during classes and such but eventually I just get tired or get eye strain, however, I've seen people like my uncle who is an Ni dom where he displays the eye movement so casually where it doesn't feel unnatural at all. Any thoughts?"
71,estp,"It's funny. Ni is my fifth or sixth function, so I don't know that I make the eye movements at all. I have tried to consciously make the movements. It doesn't do much for me beyond making it difficult to think. :) Before you feel the eye strain do you think that your cognition itself is impacted?"
72,estp,"I recommend watching c s josephs YouTube channel for a better understanding of type and functions. Maybe its possible to «trigger» a function by a specific stimulus, but you are probably better off understanding how to gain knowledge from your different fjnctions/ sides of your mind. How to best utilize your functions, and in which mindset that is healthiest.Rather than thinking only in terms of one function at a time. -Ive spent a lot of years reading about Mbit but c s Joseph is actually the first that really goes in depth with personality types, in my opinion and in an understandable way.-fellow ESTP "
73,estp,"Any object in the environment.  
It’s called pointed toggling while an Ne user brushstrokes.  
Se/Ni has a tendency of “locking” on to one or two things whereas Ne doesn’t fix its gaze on anything and just moves on its own.  
For actually using Ni, sit down and visualize something.  I usually don’t think about anything consciously and that’s when I’m in flow.  "

76,estp,hook ups/fwb relationship are done for the purpose of sex when sex is more important than having serious committed relationships or just no time for the later. if sex means little then why be in a fwb?
77,estp,"ESTP sx 8w7 here 
I don’t know if it’s the sex for me, most of the time, it’s the person. I’m just never interested in long term commitments in general. I never cared that much about relationships; friendships absolutely, relationships rarely. I also never felt the need to tell the person I’m not looking for long term because often times my actions are starkly obvious. I’m just not that into you!
Love & commitment requires softness, vulnerability and a level of surrender; none of which sound appealing to me. My worst fears in fact!"
78,estp,"Well, personally the occasions in which I have any emotional attachment to the person I have sex with just just rare. I love sex - but I don't associate it to any warm fuzzy feelings that lead to anything more than sex "
79,estp,"ISTP here. A buddy of mine that I work with is definitely an XSTP of some kind(leaning towards ESTP), and today we got into a conversation. Without dragging this out, I basically asked him a question that he couldn't really give me a solid answer to(he tried explaining it, but the pieces weren't adding up, to me), so I decided to read into the topic a bit. We met up about an hour later, and I had a bit more info on the topic, so I brought it up again, and he kind of jokingly rolled his eyes and said, ""Dude, you're going too deep. Nobody cares about this stuff like that."" Basically, the dude was saying I was overthinking it. 
To me, I was just asking some basic questions to gain some understanding, but to him I was going too deep. Do any of you guys think this about ISTPs, or have you gotten that impression from the ISTPs you've met? I ask, because I figured Dom and Secondary Ti would see eye-to-eye a bit more, and he'd at least get where I was coming from, or understand what I was trying to do."
80,estp,"ESTPs tend not to dwell on topics for too long, they would rather move on quickly to something new and exciting. One of the Differences In the ISTP and ESTP stacking= 
Ti-se vs se-ti.
Ti wants to understand things, explore the details. since you have that as your first function, and he Se  it makes sense :)."
81,estp,"Ok so from the other comments, your ESTP buddy is into hunting and guns, and the conversation is about why ammo is sometimes in caliber vs mm.
​
TLDR: You're trying to make Ti out of a swamp of historical baggage.
Read this entire thread and see  how convoluted the whole caliber vs mm thing is.
Eventually you get to this comment
​
​
and this one replying to it
​
​
So now we're tangled up in whether the caliber is the actual measurement or a marketing carry-over from the 1800s.  Seriously, read that whole thread and see if you come away with any kind of coherent system.
​
I don't know shit about ammo, but the only info relevant for Ti & Se is:

""The caliber tells you the diameter of the bore of the barrel that the cartridge is designed to work with.""
""Usually, the bullet diameter is just a little bit larger than the  bore diameter, so that it will engage the rifling and make a good seal  to contain the gas evolving from the powder reaction.""
""Imperial measurements go from land to land, metric from groove to groove.  illustrated here ""

​
That and maybe the shit about melting lead and making your own bullets, is the only information that is more than just trivia/manufacturing logistics.  Unless you've got plans on stocking a Westworld armory or something.
​
You see him as not deep, he sees you as picking your battles poorly.    Is that really what you want to spend your time analyzing?  Bullet diameters? Not ballistics? Or shooting? Or hunting?
​
Your friend is right.   Once upon a time there was a system, but now its buried in a clusterfuck of street names, regional history, and marketing.   Go down that rabbithole, and at best you come out an armchair gun ammo historian.   He sees that this is a dead end and is trying to save you wasted time.
​
( I, on the other hand, jump at any opportunity to throw  a rabbithole at my ISTP buddies.  paging u/trippin_daisies  )"
82,estp,Maybe your buddy just wasn't interested in that particular topic. I think any type would  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 if they were interested enough in the topic discussed.
83,estp,"Yeah, you do! Still need to parse out the intermingled themes that your relay of Saint Ignatius as a conduit to Jung's observations of his meditative constructs within Western theology and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Byersian Algebra in terms of Mandalas throws me for a damn loop. Also, haha. Yes, almost had me going full Carpenter when it intersects with Kurosawa and Kubrick. I'm really not sure which path you want me to glide down on this one. 
Anyway, having read this exchange, seems familiar to a saltwater fishing anecdote among ESTP/ISTP. What angle are we tackling this from? Just a matter of ""checks and balances"". ESTP and INTP, and to a lesser extent ENTP, knows where the informational battery is best put to use, and who slips seamlessly in-and-out while operating in the undercurrent of it all. Calling out a mulligan on ISTP's linear bullshit is welcomed from an ESTP or INTP. In exchange, you get the sphinxier fuckwad working on your behalf. 
On a little more serious note: If we're talking about the unconscious aspects of Fe and Ni in both, there's just as much to confide in each other. The mutually humbling aspect that we both come to terms with is there is no absolution in terms of humanity. Do the best you can, for who you can, at whatever juncture in you find yourself in. Actions over rhetoric."
84,estp,"Good stuff, dude. Yeah, it sounds like a mess. It seems like thats due to a mix of different regions, different manufacturers, different times and competition.
As someone who has some general knowledge of ammunition, I was mainly trying to find some kind of shortcut to learn the system better, rather than just memorizing, ""x bullet goes with y gun,"" and then going down the list. Also, I was wondering if the reason they don't use a universal labelling system, could tell me anything about ammunition in general. Like I said, his response seemed like it was missing something. ""Its easier to sell,"" didn't make sense, because to me, it'd seem easier to sell under a universal system. Now I know its just a culmination of different systems that ultimately, leads to no system.
Ill admit though, its not the most practical question. It was more of a shower thought kind-of-thing, that I figured he may have an answer to. But Im not going to ask something like, ""can you tell me about hunting,"" because sitting in an office, that crap is going to go in one ear and out the other. Id rather go hunting and learn through experience, than talk about it."
85,estp,"It was actually part of something that he's interested in. Basically, he's pretty into hunting and guns. I asked about ammo and why certain ammo is referred to by caliber, while others go by mm. He gave me some answer like, ""its easier to sell,"" which doesn't make a ton of sense to me(based on my research, it seems like a regional thing, but I've got more questions). He knows all about which guns use what ammo, how its fired, etc.
Looking back, he probably didn't have an answer because he is an ESTP. Being Se dom, knowing the answer to what I was asking didn't really matter, because it doesnt really contribute to actually using or manipulating(Se) the weapons. Its just terminology to him, that facilitates the weapon's usage Se
As a Ti dom, I want to understand the system, so I dig when something doesn't make sense. I cant understand the system as a whole, until I understand its parts. Hes basically just saying, ""Why do you care? That's not going to help you use a gun."" Different perspectives. Different function order. 
With Se as my secondary, I get where he's coming from. Having said that, without actually being out there shooting or handling this stuff, Im in full Ti/Ni mode. Hes still an Se dom, so he probably lost interest pretty quick."
86,estp,Reminds me about when people ask me about programming languages and stuff. My opinion is that languages doesn't matter and one should focus on solving problems. The estp probably saw you as a beginner and wanted you to learn faster by focusing on the important stuff.
87,estp,"As an ISTP, I can think back very quickly to many times I found ESTP's I've encountered in my life the absolute bane of my existence, and it's not uncommon for me to resort to removing myself from situations with them to avoid it escalating into brawls. 
I was wondering-- Is this is a two way street, or is it just me? Do ESTP's also find ISTP's as aggravating as I find most ESTP's to be, or is there any type that grinds their gears at all? If so, have you ever had any consistently bad experiences with said type, and might you share it? Any trait in particular you hate, regardless of types?
Personally I've found ESTP's hit every single nerve I have on all of the typical ways you can annoy most introverts; By being loud, obnoxious, in your face, bossy, entitled, invading space, distracting, ect. It is made all the worse when you're an especially bullshit-resistant person that doesn't like to take anything lying down, whether it was intended to be an attack or not. "
88,estp,"If you're not directly affecting me by attacking me physically or someone I know, being obviously obnoxious or just plain weird, you're most likely background noise to me. I tend to get along with everyone I know."
89,estp,"I don't type other people, I have no fucking clue. I give everyone a first chance where I let them try to be themselves for that entire social interaction's duration for as long as possible before they piss me off and I cut them out, or until I've decided I like them and just stop trying to analyze them and go back to enjoying my life to its entirety, instead of just 99% of it"
90,estp,"I have a great relationship with an ISTP. I manage his business. But we will often sit and shoot the breeze and we really enjoy each other's company. However, if I had to actually work with him regularly, I think some of his qualities would annoy me. BUT that is only because they are so like mine. Really, the main difference is that he is a bit more intellectual than me. 
tl;dr We get along pretty well."
91,estp,"I know of three ISTP-ESTP marriages so it definitely doesn't always go awry. They must have liked something about each other to stay together long enough to get married. One of these couples runs a restaurant business where she (ISTP) manages the budget, finances, and the food provisions, and he (ESTP) does a lot of the 'heavier' work and cooking.       
It might be more difficult for two male or two female STPs to coexist in the same space without competition. I'm watching an ISTP-ESTP argument unfolding on another forum right now, both are girls. The ISTP picked a fight with the ESTP because ESTP was annoying her by being so scattered and superficial with her statements, while ISTP has a need for more order and deeper understanding with her dominant Ti. They've been going back and forth for a couple of days now, switching between arguing and trying to find some middle ground. But it's like the moment one of them gives way, the other tries to claim victory and the other doesn't want to concede and let her have the last word, so the argument just re-starts."
92,estp,"I've found the best people for me to work with, the ones that compliment me, that actually understand me and can in fact be similar to me, although in a reserved way, are ISTPs. 
Two of the most important people in my life, that I depend on, are ISTP. I love you and I'm sorry if you find us annoying sometimes, we don't do it on purpose.
I know you are the more quiet, reserved types but when we work together all the pieces just fall into place. Ying/yang. "
93,estp,"I've only met 2 Istp in recent years I'm sure about. Two females. With one we didn't know each other really well but we had great conversations through and through. Deep intellectual and psychological explanations. Using both our ti to unfold our ideas. She was great! The other one is super stuck in ""robot mode"" haha she's super stiff and talks with no emotional tone at all... 
We don't really hang out, but same group of friends so we have to smile at each other. Even if there's no big love there haha (more indifference than anything else) 
But yeah, in the end we are pretty similar with Istps they tend to have a bigger brain than ours (more intellectual less down to earth) so it depends on the person in the end "
94,estp,"I've known 3 ISTPs that I'm certain about (all guys). The first two I thought were absolute dickheads; inf Fe was incredibly apparent and I'm pretty sure they were both immature/unhealthy. One was a neo-Nazi, the other just an ass. The last one though I absolutely adore, we get along very well and I enjoy his sense of humor a lot. So it's not always a fail or anything like that.
As for other types, not that I don't like them, but I find a lot of feeler types somewhat exhausting to be around."
95,estp,"Wow, all of that is so interesting (and i mean that in the least sarcastic way possible). As an ISTP I would love to observe that for greater understanding, as it's easier to understand why people react to our behaviors from an outside perspective, and then in turn understand them. 
Though the concept of ISTP's that like order baffles me. Who is this mythical ISTP woman and how does she exist-- then again I'm not sure I've ever met another ISTP before. We can like systems we can understand, thats for sure, so things that seem nonsensical for reasons we can't understand or don't make sense will definitely irritate us. "
96,estp,"This is very true. I may just not have met anything but the worst kind of ESTP, aka the really loud over aggressive macho frat boy type. P sure no one likes them, but at times it can be pretty hard to discern. "
97,estp,"Lawl, you're great dude. Def the first ESTP I think I like. I suppose it really does come down to the individual doesn't it? And no worries, you don't have to apologize to me but thank you for explaining anyways. This is something I always have to remember with all extroverts, not just ESTP's (it's just that ESTP's, in my own flawed experience, seem to be the most reluctant to stop doing shitty bothersome behaviors, and can be stubborn about stopping. while other extroverts can be talked to and typically seem to understand more/try to settle down a little bit if you just communicate with them.)"
98,estp,"My apologies for those unhealthy ISTP's. I am definitely not one of them but I can very well see how one can easily become that way if they haven't had enough necessary experiences in their life to teach them skills to better deal with their bullshit, or better control themselves (that inferior Fe is super important to develope. When it gets developed you'll find we make p decent people, have better communication skills, because we recognize people as important. When it isn't developed, that's when you might come across the more quiet yet very blunt-asshole types of ISTP's. They'll hurt people unintentionally with their behaviors (they dont know how or why to curb it), then they'll isolate and hate themselves more for it, which, is super unhealthy, for everyone involved. If they keep isolating themselves and refuse to understand Feelings in general, they'll become more and more fucked up the more importance they place on getting their way and implementing their own values in reality with Ti+Se, and then consequently getting their asses handed to them when they don't/refuse to understand why thats shitty and you can't do that. They may blame others or blame themselves, but ultimately if they isolate themselves further instead of learning from it positively, they'll develop real badly. 
TLDR; They need to care about people more and care about understanding people more, and understand why it's important. 
During my teenage years I figured out it was important and then spent a large amount of private time into researching human issues and also taking acting classes and learning how to make friends and communicate better, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that if I hadn't done that, I'd be incredibly worse for the wear because of it. "
99,estp,"Some of the frat type ESTPs are actually incredibly nice and sweet I've noticed. It's just the larger than life personality and looks makes some assume something else, but once you get to know them, there's someone really nice inside. 
As an estp myself I've learned not to judge others just by a few seconds, the good thing about estp is that within a few minutes you'll know who the person is because they'll tell you. With some introverts, you can go months and not know who you're dealing with. Now that's a waste of time and disappointing. "
100,estp,"Does anyone else here have a problem with knowing what to think of stuff?
In political things, for example, I tend to take statements by politicians and other debaters at face value, and I don't really consider any implications beyond the surface. A lot of the times when I try to do think of implications, I end up finding out I was way off and no one else thought of it. I tend to rely on allies' interpretations of events in politics,--and they often tie the actions/statements to other political issues and other political statements/actions--and I'm usually pretty good at doing this and arguing my allies' points. But sometimes it just leaves me feeling kinda dumb, like I can't think of anything on my own.
Anyone else have these experiences?"
101,estp,"You’re not alone.
I am kinda the same way as well, feeling like I can’t form arguments of my own. Usually what I do is that I try to look into both sides’ opinions, evaluate then come up with my own conclusion. Not specifically in politics though. "
102,estp,"I'm currently a police dispatcher, but that was getting boring so I've just accepted a job as an operations coordinator at an international airport. I also was a volunteer ambulance officer and disaster relief worker for 4 years."
103,estp,"I work in a warehouse job that I really hate because it's the same shit everyday. If I didn't get to move around all day (I walk an average of 10-12 miles a day at work) I would seriously have to quit immediately. But I'm always late, I kind of do my own thing there and my manager just kind of lets me do whatever. It's weird but whatever. I also have two businesses I do after work and on the weekends that makes me way more money than my actual day job does. I also train Muay Thai some nights a week and produce music as a hobby. "
104,estp,"I manage the counties landfills, I have an engineering degree, which was hard to get through, but seemed the most logical degree for me. I hate my job, for the most part, lots of stupid rules, horrible bureaucracy, and I work for people I don't respect. The good things about the job: somewhat autonomous, buying expensive equipment, lots of little things to learn about, and landfills are quite the necessity. 
I'm always wishing for a different job. For me the optimal job would be something that would allow me to learn something new on a regular basis, was rarely repetitive and required a lot of problem solving and hands on work. 
In my free time I rock climb, mtn bike, snowboard, fly fish, roast coffee and like to pick up new useful skills if I need them for a project. "
105,estp,"I hate working a little bit and I hate chilling or pre drinking or whatever.
​
I get depressed. For me, chilling or working a little is the same as not doing SHIT. When I party, I party to the limit and same thing when I work.
​
I'd rather party once every 2 months and spend all my money there and get completely destroyed, then party every weekend."
106,estp,"preach. that said, getting destroyed each week at university was a hell of a laugh."
107,estp,"16 Personalities calls ESTP The  Entrepreneurs. I take the site with a grain of salt, but how many of you are actually  entrepreneur? What do you do for a living, and do you love the way you can live your life being an  entrepreneur?"
108,estp,"I have a ""day job,"" but I have also managed a laundromat on the side for about 5 years now. Also had a very successful, independent pet-sitting business for a couple years. I'm a hustler more than an entrepreneur. But I consider them one and the same."
109,estp,"Estp and someone who is striving to be an entrepreneur atm... i was let go from my day job 2 weeks ago (corporate restructuring) so in the process of interviewing for new stuff. 
As for the entrepreneur side you have to start looking at it as having another job and therefore dedicate yourself to it if you’re serious about making money. Aka Saturday Sunday roles around ur working lol."
110,estp,I solve problems as my current line of employment.  id really like to get into sales as my next conquest.  you ever buy a car from a shitty salesman?  goddamn does it suck.  i think i could do better LOL.
111,estp,"I switched my courses to online and taking it at a steady pace because I need to be able to have time to make money too, so I get how restricting school can be, even taking online classes can be more time demanding than driving to school."
112,estp,"I actually work for the dude that owns the laundromat and yes, he owns the vending machines too (which I stock, weekly). Yeah, I would recommend owning / stocking your own vending machines if you have the time to do it. He saves all the vending machine profit and uses it to pay for his plane tickets every summer (he and his wife always go somewhere exotic)."
113,estp,"I currently finishing my first year. I like art and design so maybe I'll go into computer graphics? Computer security sounds cool too. Lol i honestly have no idea. It's too early to tell, I've only just completed some intro courses and I have a long road ahead of me! 
What about you OP, what do you do? Haha"
114,estp,"Aaah I'm a massage therapist. I also do freelance work for a drop ship company when they need my help, and I do copywriting. Terms of services, new oil company books for employees, I help break it all down. This summer I will help teach yoga.
I've had quite a few jobs, but these are the most recent."
115,estp,I love to analyze the different types and their collective behaviors. It gets to be really interesting when you can predict what someone is going to do in response to something just from knowing their MBTI.
116,estp,"I have been OBSESSED since I was put on to it - hold up in a room for a week during hurricane Sandy. At this point, I can fairly say I have a pretty good handle on it. (sometimes I think moreso than a lot of the more simplistic ""type sites"") 
I think a lot of people/sites/tests tend to mislabel people which causes a lot of confusion. I noticed very often people are too literal and more focused on the result of someones actions as opposed to their motivations for their actions which is ultimately what the test is about.
Ill tell you straight up the BEST test BY FARRRRR is https://celebritytypes.com
Its not as nice or built out as some of the other sites and it lacks the marketing/design element that many of the other popular MBTI sites have. BUT I find that they are more informed and have a much better test with better results. "
117,estp,"Oh sure, I'm not saying everyone with the same type is exactly the same - interaction is necessary on a more personal level if you truly want to get to know someone, but I do find that the MBTI is a decent guideline to follow."
118,estp,"I mainly stick to the ESTP/INFJ duality section, toss in some socionomics. Someone posted a meme saying she was INFJ. Got bored Googled it. Took multiple tests. Found my type. Have probably logged a good 50 hours of research at this point. Still not an expert."
119,estp,"I try not to get too into it actually for that reason, I like being able to do that naturally and find their direction of thought and whatnot through like interaction with them as opposed to checking back with what I know about MBTI"
120,estp,"I agree, a lot of people take it to heart and use MBTI as their reasoning for everything, and that annoys me, especially as a person of action
I look at this stuff as a very generic way to categorize like-personalities. Nothing more. There's far too much individuality for it to be anything but that in my opinion "
121,estp,"So my best friend is an INFJ and this whole MBTI stuff has been amazing for understanding each other, not to mention the other half of the population. Because you only experience 4 of the 8 characteristics, you dont really ""understand"" the other 4 and you dont know what you dont know.
I think its most useful as an incredibly effective tool to understand how best to communicate with other people, especially if you are someone in a leadership position. It has enabled me to generally be much faster in recognizing where there may be a communication breakdown and how to remedy it asap."
122,estp,"Yea I mean thats basically the gist of it. lol
But knowing the MBTI stuff has helped us understand each others thought processes so we (mostly the INFJ) dont really get as frustrated anymore. Even with the help of all this, we still look at each other like the other one is an alien from another planet."
123,estp,"Intj here.
Just curious about estps and their emotions, and whether it's cowardice or just not giving a fuck that makes you guys just a stop caring about people all of a sudden.... 
I don't understand you at all............ lol "
124,estp,"Hey there, I'm a strong ESTP in college and I am really struggling to stay focused and pass classes. Everyone else just sees it as lazy, which I totally understand but its the routine that is making me crazy. I feel completely down all the time now. Need some advice on sticking it out and finding ways to feel in-the-moment again! I love negotiating and tangible results but college gives me zero opportunities to feel like I'm getting anything done. Any other ESTPs struggle in college?"
125,estp,"Look at the competition around you. The challenge is to beat as many as possible. I cannot stress this enough that it needs to be approached like a game of ""fuck off"".
Also you're going to need to get into the habit of finding your work ability. What do i mean? You can work for how many hours before you hate life? Don't take loads of breaks... you set out to have maybe 5 hours of work and you can break in the middle for whatever it takes to get back on it mentally.
What do you do to lift yourself up?
If you don't lift up and refuel your Se then you'll eventually just hate studying. So when you sit down to study just reiterate a few times in your head... ""it's only for a while and when we're finished here we never have to do this shiht again"".
Cos that's the goal. Get the qualification and use it. Preferably not studying.
But while you are still studying ... manage your Se and feed it responsibly (i.e. don't feed it with party when you've got shit due).
It takes maturity to keep yourself happy and study. It's a challenge. But the flip side is that it gets easier the more you do.
You are feeling to urge to find a new thing to refuel that Se. That's what slows you down. But feed it responsibly, right. You can't be bored and you need to lift that tension.
2 hours of work 1 hour of practise or practise and regain that focus that you're talking about. It needs a happy Se to work properly. I actually dance a lot because i like music. I don't care if someone see's me dancing away my sexy body.
People always gave me a pep talk. It doesn't work tho. This is easily discarded theory. No it's about managing your Se. Find things that you can do to really get back into thhat good place... these things need to be fairly brief distractions.
When you are working you will build up some bank. That bank is valuable to you even if it's a bit painful.
Also exercise is great for getting me refocused. I'll come home from work most days and get back into happy mode by listening to music and doing a few pressups and situps. It just makes me happier.
Cos i'm a beast (who apparantly is compelled to edit typos."
126,estp,"By the way don't do those things i linked you if they're frustrating.
Find something you like and can practise. Change it if it gets tired.
Change it if you get obsessed with it to the detriment of study.
Don't play a lot of video games. Go out if you're gonna waste the day."
127,estp,"Does your college put you together with folks from your cohort in your major? I made good friends with some other extroverted biology types when I was in school, and we would study (read: 50% study, 50% chat and party) for hours together. Kept me appropriately focused when I had to but also made me feel like I wasn't just brain-stressing when I WAS working on things.
Another thing that really helped me was tutoring and assistant-teaching in basic level courses to keep my brain strong in the fundamentals, cause I have a tendancy to cram and then brain-dump after exams. Repetition, repetition, repetition, as much as we hate it. 
I also made a lot of really funny and filthy word-tricks to remember vocabulary and concepts. Something about making them interesting with foul humor or curse words made them stick better. 
Also, don't lose track of the fact that ESTPs can often be kinetic learners. Draw pictures or schematics of what you're studying, bounce a ball, anything to engage that need for movement or fidgeting while you study. "
128,estp,"May I ask what you're majoring in? Are you surrounding yourself with people who might be a negative influence and goading on indulgences? I found that studying in a group kept me more disciplined and focused. 
I lost my scholarship after my first year in college. Not that I would unjustly lay complete responsibility on the people I was surrounding myself with, but they were a catalyst for bad behaviors. Once I returned to healthier socialization via clubs and intermurals, I had a more positive network to lean upon and dole out the much needed discipline that I was severely lacking.    "
129,estp,"Nah but seriously though. I’d describe myself as Charismatic, funny, optimistic, and laid back. I tend to think of myself as very lenient. I think I’m not so good in the strength of will department. I can adapt to many things and think I’m pretty kind to people and forgiving generally speaking. I love to talk to people and even in spite of all I’ve gone through I’m still not giving up "
130,estp,"As a teen I liked A Series of Unfortunate Events. Sad endings have more depth. Enders Game was cool, as I could picture it in my head. Holes, Kite Runner, Metamorphosis and Maus round out my top 'forced school reads'. In college I liked ethnographies- mainly how cultures are structured and differences  between societies. 
I read non fiction about 80% of the time. I like books on finance, public health/science journals, or about psych/societies.
The last 5 books I bought/read: 
-The Latinos of Asia: How Filipino Americans Break the Rules of Race 
-German/English Visiual dictionary (to keep my limited german from floating away. Use it or lose it)
- The Big Letdown (How western soceity ruins breastfeeding)
- 5 love languages (quality time/touch)
-Obama: The call to history (Dope timeline, tons of pics. Goes well with my other political book from Colbert)
Noteable favorite: All my friends are dead"
131,estp,"I do yet I'm quite picky
Mystery, Horror, SciFi, Paranormal, Gore, Thriller are some genres I really love
I dont have a thing for romance, not that I despise it but I show 0 interest
I've read books such as the Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, and Miss Peregrine. As a kid I'd read Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys
But if I had to pick between novels or movies- I prefer movies more"
132,estp,"Hmm. ""Game of thrones"" is fun. I like :the wheel of time"" series. 
Maybe less known ""name of the wind"" and ""the blade it self""
But my favorit autor is Haruki Murakami. ""Norwegian wood"" beeing number one. With ""wind up bird"", ""1Q84"" and ""Kafka on the beach"" tied for second
Ninja: words"
133,estp,I picked The Haunting because it was on a shelf in B&N and I wanted 2 dollars off of my Starbucks drink. It was a great choice. I am reading Coin because an artist I like just released a song by the same name. I can't say I prefer anything in particular. 
134,estp,"Couldn't tell you, I'm awful at favorites. Probably Ender's Game, I had the most vivid mental images of reading it
I also for whatever reason remember Mortal Engines really well, and then Artemis Fowl and Pendragon"
135,estp,"Lol, I don’t know precisely. I thought it would be funny and ironic to say this because INFJs due tend to like books generally, if not more than ESTPs lol. But I don’t like reading personally. I like watching videos because I personally like the Visual and audio aspects of watching them and I get lost very easily reading books. I can watch documentaries forever, but not read them. Same thing with novels, I love watching there movies, but I will get lost reading them and so I will get bored. So it’s just my personal preference . I’m a visual and audio learner, so if I’m reading instructions off paper, it’s just more difficult to understand, unless the instructions where on video, it would be so much more easer for me to understand hearing someone explaining what to do audibly and hearing there tone of voice and when they are giving an examples doing what should be done visually. Not to mention I’m dyslexic too lol. My mother has the same issue, she likes learning things visually and audibly as well, but she will get lost reading something and she doesn’t like reading novels either because she gets bored too. She is also an ESTP."
136,estp,"
Started reading Murakami after a trip to Japan 10 years ago, instant love. 

His writing style, it is slow and easy, but he paints the world just enough that you can fill in a lot. So imagery. And the storyies he writes is weird, but he has å lot of ambience. The plot is cool because it feels like real life, but like something weird happend. 
Norwegian wood is the only book that is set in ""this world"" and not a slight paralell world. And it is a beautiful love story with twist.
Edit 31 not 1"
137,estp,"I don’t have the problem you have mentioned above, but I do have an Autoimmune disorder that causes a lot of different psychological issues like OCD anxiety misophonia and more stuff that inflicts on your brain. It’s called PANS. I’m still in adolescence, but as 15 years of age, people my age should enjoy reading by now, but I don’t, my mother has the same the issues and she still does to this day about reading. She doesn’t have that same problems you mentioned above either, but she does also has PANS. PANS again gives different symptoms to different people, so someone may not have the same symptoms as me, but all the symptoms are usually psychological. It’s a rare condition though and it’s  pretty controversial. So the older doctors may dismiss PANS, but the newer and more modern doctors with accept PANS."
138,estp,"I hope you get better. 
I used to have OCD too. Also bulimia. Though I do not know what PANS is, I was diagnosed ADHD.
I know it is hard to live with such a condition. As long as you can enjoy other things, I guess you'll be all right.
Peace."
139,estp,"Thanks, and that’s very true. I just keep telling myself it could always be so much worse like starving in the middle of a third world country. So with that comparison, it kind of shows how great my life is pretty easily lol."
140,estp,"Well considering a 'real' MBTI assessment is based on the participant's responses to hundreds of detailed questions asked by a psychologist, I don't think they compare in the slightest.
Horoscopes are blatantly useless as they have nothing practical to use as a means of assessing a person's personality.
Also MBTI types are a spectrum; we can barely even say that we are a single ""type"" like a horoscope.
Finally, if you just think about it, why would you ever expect hundreds of millions of people who share a birthday range to exhibit such similar traits? And I'm really surprised to hear this belief/notion/thought experiment from somebody who identifies as ESTP, because typically we are said to feel unique and self-superior which directly contradicts the entire concept of horoscopes.
MBTI is already bullshitty/wishy-washy and I think it only serves to discredit the system when people compare it other things which do not form conclusions based on real observations."
141,estp,"Extremely active by nature, you like to get around, meet people and do different things. Very restless, you just can't seem to stay put. You need to be involved in several projects at once in order to keep your mind stimulated. You like to read books and to write letters and to talk -- constantly. Seemingly ageless, you will always appear to be much younger than you really are. Very adaptable and inquisitive, you are always open to new ideas and experiences. A ""jack-of-all-trades"", you are lively and versatile. Because of the high nervous tension that you always seem to have, athletic activity would be a good way for you to burn off energy. But be careful of a tendency to experience things only superficially -- try to dig in and absorb things at a deeper level. 
Extremely sensitive and emotional, you absorb the emotions of others (whether positive or negative) like a sponge. You are at your best when you can structure your environment in such a way that you are surrounded by positive, upbeat people. You are very helpful and understanding of the needs of others. Indeed, at times this can be a disadvantage, because you can be a sucker for anyone who needs help. Shy, dreamy, romantic in nature, you delight in retreating into your private fantasy world. Just be careful that you do not get lost in it! Trust your intuitions -- you may be quite psychic. 
Your feelings are very intense, never superficial. You tend to be either very angry or very sad or completely and totally happy. Your moods are deep, extreme and not always completely understood by yourself or by those with whom you have to deal. Emotionally, you tend to prefer to live at the cutting edge of life, pushing your reactions to the ultimate extremes, even if the results are dangerous or upsetting. You are easily jealous and very suspicious -- you require a great deal of emotional reassurance. A good detective, you are very curious about deep and mysterious things, especially human nature and motivations. Be careful not to be ruthless, tactless or too overly frank or you will meet with much resistance from others. 
This could literally be about 50% of the people in this sub. I just entered in some random birthday. Astrology is a bunch of shit."

144,estp,"Okay so Ne users tend to have two elements of it. One is that they chase a feeling of possibility. They ""feel"" like if they do something, more potentials will come. Or something big will happen. You probably relate to this heavily and we'll get to that here in a half a second. There is another element of Ne. Specifically it's thinking in terms of connections. Zebra-
​
Se dominants, on the other hand, chase sensations. They focus on high intensity sensations, and they do things that they perceive will lead them to even greater sensations. An example would be if I put a blanket that looks INSANELY fluffy near them, they would be motivated HEAVILY to collect the sensation of touching it. They want to feel it so that they can stow it away in their memory. This being said, there is also the connection element to reference. If Ne users have connections, and Se user's don't, what is in its place? Rather than connections, what is the other element of Se that you experience cognitively?"
145,estp,"Se helps someone deal with the concrete reality of the situation, by using metrics that can be easily observed and measured. So than rather than needing connections that only exists metaphysically, we can use a more “real” strategy based off knowing what is the most practical thing to do. You are sort of correct about Se users wanting to store experiences in their memory, but it is only so that in the future we know what we are dealing with in the case we encounter it again. Connections made through Ne-Si algorithm are likely to not go through with a higher Se because they probably are perceiving a more concrete solution that yields better results"
146,estp,"Your correct that we chance the sensation of somthing. However, we collect the sensations as experiences and we start to make connects and while in the Se mode we draw on the Ni polarity. We get a feel for not just our bodies but also our environment. So the Se is very kinesthetic and as we stock up more experiences  we gain an arsenal of tactics and strategies. As those tools become more defined they become applicable to many different situations. Those would be the connections. When in a given situations we will know what needs to be done right then and there."
147,estp,"We're also incredibly aware of our mechanical surroundings, and perhaps that is a form of connection making in itself. For example I can, far more often than not, accurately predict the outcome of doing or manipulating something in my immediate physical environment. I make connections when I realise that doing X resulted in an undesired Y, and maybe next time I should try Z instead. It sounds simply like learning from one's mistakes, but what is ""making connections"" if not being able to understand that you have and how you have made a mistake.
Conversely, my ENFP (Ne dom for clarity's sake) boyfriend will habitually spill his coffee every morning, sometimes far worse than others, yet is incapable of or unwilling to learn that the way he always picks his coffee up results in him spilling it. He doesn't make the connection of X = undesired Y, therefore find a different way from X. And I can't even begin to explain all the ways this pattern repeats itself (with plenty of the ENFPs I happen to surround myself with). I absolutely adore the way his brain works but he is incapable of making connections between his actions and his physical environment. 
And this is why we can't have nice things."
148,estp,"This should be the case for all extroverted functions. They actually have an incredibly memory database volume.
I'm still not sure I understand. Like...Ne users are making connections but what do you mean metaphysically? Skunk and zebra are connected by white and black. Those aren't really metaphysical traits."
149,estp,"I mainly use it unconsciously, usually as a stream of input for my Ti. It's hard to explain because unlike what gets written stereotypically, ESTPs do spend a fair amount of time thinking as we're acting, constantly analysing what's going on around us - we just never tell anyone. We also use it to just do things - I often get strong physical cravings and have to satisfy them. Doing things in the real world is much more fun than being stuck in your own head.
Mind, Se isn't that much better for dealing with responsibilities than Ni - sure we get more done but we aren't always doing the right thing."
150,estp,"Ni is horrible without Se or Te. It will drive you crazy, but when you use it along with Se it will make you a social machine and also less of a procrastinator. Basically balancing overthinking and taking action."
151,estp,"Oh ok, well, I don’t know how to explain it, but I just do it. I don’t really think about taking action, it just happens, usually without me thinking things through. But if I’m really stuck/not motivated: writing lists (prioritising) and setting dates as to when I HAVE to finish them by. "
152,estp,Make a 5sec rule: 
153,estp,"Most MBTI tests give me ENTP, yet this one test gave me ESTP, So I am wondering whether there is any test that's really reliable.
This is the only test I took that typed me as ESTP, all other do ENTP: http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm
Unfortunately for it, it didn't exactly type me right, seeing as:
Basically says Se could never be my thing considering I usually don't lock eyes when talking to someone, except when I consciously notice someone."
154,estp,Some people I would have pegged as ESTPs actually end up identifying as ISTP after I coax them into taking a look at MBTI. I think that's one of those 'state of mind' or 'time of life' situation where you can kind of be both all in a day.
155,estp,"I just took an MBTI test for fun a little while ago and it typed me as an ""ENTP"" instead of ESTP. It's generally agreed upon that the tests are inaccurate due to stereotypes and that functions are where it's at when it comes to typing yourself correctly. That all being said, I think mistypes happen a lot between ESTPs & ENTPs. Especially, with the test-taking route."
156,estp,"When I was a kid, I was always trying out new things, but I didn't handle failure very well.  After a whole lotta failure, I decided ""Well, I'm just going to expect to fail at everything, because then I can't be disappointed.""  This basically put me into a state of paralysis, uselessness, caused by the Ni grip (fear of failure).  Even my INFJ best friend was trying to get me to do shit, which is sad because I was always the one trying to get HIM to do stuff.  Eventually, I understood that this is a terrible mindset, because that negative expectation poorly affects your performance in the moment.  I'm still learning to confront failure though...
Did anybody else go through this stage / are in this stage?"
157,estp,"Im currently going through it now. Know what you're saying. Pretty dark and fucked up. 
What triggered it for  me Is similar to what Jordan Peterson is talking about in this video. 
The analysis paralysis was triggered by something similar to this.

158,estp,"I’m in it now, in regards to finding a full time job post graduation. What keeps me going is knowing I can change my mind and any decision I make will be relatively as good as the second or third. The important part is to make a decision rather than be stuck in the analysis. Cheers "
159,estp,"Personally I randomly stumbled upon something I was naturally good at, which gave me some confidence in my abilities, and from there I was just like ""huh, your perspective influences your performance in the moment"", so if you expect to fail you are setting yourself up for failure.  So yeah its just all about developing perspective, which is hard.  "
160,estp,"Im quite good at absorbing information & making connections in academic fields such as Psychology and Philosophy, and then explaining them.  Lately, though, I'm more focussed on action oriented stuff like Skateboarding & drawing.  I'm pretty decent at sketching."
161,estp,"Whoever says military, no. Definitely no. The idea of military is cool and all, but in execution, god no
Sports related things, at least for me. I'm going to school to be a teacher and a coach or do research in biomechanics depending on what I want to do with my master's"
162,estp,"I loved being a bicycle mechanic in college. I got payed well and did a lot of different stuff in a day. I sold bikes, chatted up customers, test rode the bikes I fixed, fixed the bikes...
It was cool! You also learn a hard skill that makes you respect other people who are working with their hands for a living. "
163,estp,I went to school for computer science and now I'm in a QA Automation job at an investment firm. To be honest I really enjoy the finance/stock market side of this job just as much as I enjoy programming. 
164,estp,Server then become a bartender. If you are a true ESTP you will excel in the restaurant industry. You get to multitask and make money talking with people. Plus you leave every shift with money. Who likes waiting to get paid? Not ESTP's! 
165,estp,"While I agree with not joining the military, it's mostly dependent on the person. ESTPs tend to be leaders not willing to be bound or confined. From my own experience the military doesn't work for us. YMMV"
166,estp,"What did you become aware of or what were you told that made you sure you weren’t ESFP? Surely these two types are more similar than the stereotypes seeing that their two middle functions are balanced. Also, with the introduction of jumper types by Dave powers there’s supposedly Se- Te users. Thank you!"
167,estp,"Mostly because I didn’t give a shit what people said. Their opinions didn’t matter unless they were close to me. I may not be one for conflict, but I also don’t like to be the center of attention—I just find myself to just be in it. Didn’t need to exert a lot of effort.
But also I didn’t have the impulse to please everyone I met.
I’m happy to do my own thing, didn’t need to be validated."
168,estp,"I use a tremendously amount of Ti. (To the extent I can't really stand Te-based reasoning)
Also no Fi in me anywhere. Idk what those youtube people say but judging functions should be immediately observable "
169,estp,"When I first got into mbti I thought I was an ESFP, after more research I knew I definitely was not. ESFPs need more validation and care more what people think of them it seems. I also knew I definitely was not a Feeler as I am super logical and emotions are very foreign to me and finding someone I am romantically interested in is virtually impossible for me."
170,estp,"Hi,
I have a few questions to you ESTPs : 
-How do you feel about texting and phone calls? Do you text a lot?
-Can you hold a texting conversation or do you often forget to reply etc? 
-Do you prefer short or long texts/conversations? 
-Do you handle small talk? 
Thanks!"
171,estp,"I forget to reply to text messages a lot. My phone is on me maybe 50% of the time, if you need me call.  Also I handle small talk well because I just love talking to people. It's nice to finally see some activity here. It's much needed. "
172,estp,"I like short text messages, and I rarely forget to reply. If someone wants to get really detailed, I will just call them and work it out. Much quicker. I hate talking on the phone, but I hate long ass text replies more. "
173,estp,"Hi, I hate texting!
I prefer calling, especially if it's in response to a wall of text.
I don't do small talk, or asking about people's day. I much prefer to talk one-on-one or call. I am notoriously bad at replying, especially to texts like: ""Hi, how are you"". Bleh. 
I do however, like to message my friends when something funny or dramatic happens :) I always have my phone on me though."
174,estp,I find texting to be bothersome after a few. I frequently forget to respond... Multiple times. I will pick up the phone and cal for brief needs. No point in taking 10 minutes instead of a 2 minute phone convo. I dislike small talk. I avoid perfectly nice people I know so I don't have to have small talk. 
175,estp,"This has been on my mind for a good while now. I absolutely hate texting. It is impersonal, and you never get anywhere conversationally. I reply immediately and I never have time to wait around for people to respond, so conversation is always stuck in small talk (which I hate).
Last year I was in a relationship that was text-centric. We were always texting - and it was horrible. Conversely when we spent time together I always had to deal with her problems (which I don't like doing, but being a good boyfriend I did my best) so we never got anywhere deep conversationally.  
sorry for ranting. TL;DR Texting sucks and I hate it but do it anyway "
176,estp,"For example, me and my friend are both ESTP's but for some reason, it seems like we werent blessed with the same skillsets. He is very good at seducing women for some odd reason , (I think maybe its solely on his looks) while I'm just average. But I'm better at charming people and a better leader than he is. Whenever he tries to lead something,he does ok but it dissipates very quickly whether its group, campaign or small businesss, but me on the other hand I'm very good with all those things. Is there a reason why were good at different things? nnecaus eI find it a bit odd.. and yes I am positive we are both ESTP's,... he also took the test."
177,estp,"People are not robots off a production line. So there's individual variation. Mbti doesn't have any way to account for personal experiences.
You are different people. What did you expect?
I reckon it takes about 6 months of daily practise to get competent at guitar. Good enough to sing a song and play the chords. This is from total noob to playing and singing. 6 months should do it.
If one of you did that and the other didn't you'd consider it a difference of personality?
Or a difference of focus."
178,estp,"MBTI isn't everything, for example with your friend other woman can find his personality just more attractive, also his facial features. And the thing about being leaders you probably are more focused then he is,it might also be a more developed Ti internal thinking."
179,estp,"I don't know about this tbh... the cognitive functions of these two types are super different. ENFP is Ne-Fi-Te-Si, but ESTP is Se-Ti-Fe-Ni. Even if you believe/think about shadow functions (when in stress), the priorities of the functions are a lot different too. 
Maybe you'll find someone with the same situation as you though, hope you find some answers."
180,estp,"I am 17 years old and i consider myself an ESTP (atm), I have not been reading a lot about how this personality ""system"" works, all i know is that everytime i take the tests (on the internet) i get different results. In April i was ESTP, in May i was ESTJ, in June i was ENTJ, and in Juli i was ENTP, and in august i was ISTJ, and now in september i got my results as an ESTP again.... Therefore i consider these tests, and theories irrelevant... I enjoy reading about the different personalities and try to find out who i am.... I know that i am only 17 years old and still in ""development"" but i love extremesport, money, and doing whatever that pops up in my head... 
2 days ago i traveled across the country purely out of fun. I also joined a random class at a random school, said i was a new student, everyone belived me and i was just fucking around, got a lot of new friends and leaved after i got bored
 I love adrenaline, flying and im going to get my parachute sertificate next month... I have been hustling for the last two years, and had a job i didn't really like... i want to become a stockbroker or a grunder as we call an entrepreneur here in norway
But in the end, im only 17 so I don't really know.... sorry if my grammar is bad, school is not my thing... hehe
The fun is when you learn how the MBTI tests works, why you get the results you get, and then try to manipulate it the next time to get different results, like i have been doing the last couple of hours..."
181,estp,"Actually, yeah. I took the test for the first time back in middle school just because and got ENFP. Took it again a few days ago and got ESTP. In retrospect, ESTP makes a lot more sense to me because of my level of activity and my learning style. I always have to be doing something, and in my family, I'm always the first person to try something.
Granted, the test said I had a 5% preference of T to F, but that's because my parents raised me to not be an asshole, so I'm not as blunt as others because I usually watch what I say. I know I'm not a textbook ESTP, but I still agree with it more than any other type."
182,estp,"I've typed as ENFP before. EP's have a lot of the same tendencies. I analyzed my family dynamic/nurture growing up. 
Dad - ENFP 
Mom - ISFJ
Sister - INFP
Brother - INTP 
I score high Ne because I've been around it my whole life, but not as high as Se. I was the black sheep so I basically know I'm a sensor. I can handle a lot of Ne for a bit then get irritable, that's how I know I'm not N. 
As far as F, being a girl T is a little weird, so it took some time to realize it, but I've definitely embraced it. And am happier for it. "
183,estp,"I'm an ISFJ dating an ESTP. I feel like I bore him wanting to talk about hypotheticals with our future, and irritate him when I downplay my actual emotions so I don't seem like I'm overreacting. What else grinds ESTPs' gears?"
184,estp,"Don't talk about the future too much. We think in the now. And try not to hide your feelings. Honest communication is key with us ESTPs. Also acting immature, not being a good listener, and being overly dramatic don't exactly float my boat. "
185,estp,"I recommend not always wanting to do the same thing, making sure you are direct with how you feel, and doing spontaneous little things like going for a drive after dark to get ice cream or something. And compliment him, we ESTP's like compliments 👌🏽"
186,estp,"Thanks! This was insightful. As for hiding feelings, it's little things such as being at his place but not telling him when I'm hungry, bored, etc. Basically, when I want something I don't ask. If it were you, would that annoy you?"
187,estp,"I thought you guys would like this.
Me (INTP) before studying 2 things:
Pfft! Communication isn’t that hard!
Me after studying 3 things:

Pitch Anything (Book)
MBTI
States of Mind
Once you understand pitching via functions and pitching in general, put them together, you are a beast!
You’re able to win almost every pitch! It takes practice, but it should be easiest for ESTPs.
MBTI Example:
When you’re trying to appeal to say..an INFJ, trying to appeal to their third or fourth function will end in failure every time. You want to appeal to their Ni and Fe.
Now, for pitching basics...


Pitching is not the same as salesmanship. It’s an everyday skill. It’s useful when teaching, trying to get someone to do something, and simply in everyday conversation.


You’re not pitching to the neocortex..well at least directly. You’re pitching to the croc brain. The croc brain is the part of the brain that’s well..in a nutshell “What’s that?! Who’s there?! Ooo! Shiny!”


When you’re pitching, if you make one wrong move, you’re done for.


Finally, concerning states of mind...
There’s several states of mind, but to save time, I’ll focus on the main ones.


A state of mind I like to call the “Super Saiyan” state of mind.


Lucid dreaming


A “Doer”, present-oriented state of mind. In this state of mind, you can start doing anything with virtually no resistance as long as you want to. Ex. Typing on phone Wants to read a book Instantly throws phone at wall and picks up book like they suddenly lost all interest in phone


These links explain how to achieve #1:

188,estp,"No. I had no involvement in the making nor publishing of the book.
For states of mind, you can look that up online. The problem is it can be difficult due to the massive number of bad online sources.
I was going to explain it to you if you want. It’s pretty simple.
There’s products regarding lucid dreaming, but you don’t need to buy anything. In fact, I’d suggest not unless you’re desperate.
I DID write those blog posts, so I don’t have to spend 30+ minutes writing several paragraphs on every “I need help.” post I come across. The blog isn’t monetized, though. If you want, I can show you.
My motivators are helping people, helping people reach their full potential, the enjoyment of teaching, and doing what I can to repair what the education system has done and continues to do as well as the education system itself. (ex. If people aren’t interested in a 200 page novel, yet you make them read the book, you’re conditioning them to read less/think they hate reading)."
189,estp,"I didn't, I dropped out. I then went back to community college for a semester, dropped out again. Worked in food service for two years and then back to community college for two semesters where I am about to drop out a third time. I have no idea what I am doing with my life, I have a fair amount of debt, and sometimes I just don't want to deal with any of this shit anymore. "
190,estp,"I got through college by taking a practical software design course, instead of theoretical sciences. Along the way, I made friends to help get me through the times where I would feel bored, so in a way i was accountable. 
Then I went to university, struggled to make friends and attempted year one twice before I gave up. I just couldn't get past three months without being unbelievably bored. Went into work and I've been there ever since.
I have a decent life and wouldn't change anything, it was a great learning experience and it was only after I quit university did I take the personality test and discover I was an estp. Everything made sense after that, and it's helped me make good decisions about life situations. 
There's no such thing as a wrong choice, take the positive out of everything and learn from it! "
191,estp,"I'm fighting through my last year of uni right now, 7 weeks left- the home stretch! It's really hard to stay focused and get my assignments done but if I do a little bit of one thing every day its less overwhelming when I am trying to finish the night before. I'm going to college in the fall after this (in Canada its more practical work than university) so I'm really excited to actually get to DO things. I can't say I really remember much of the details in my classes but I love my subject and it's opened me up to a whole new way of thinking. "
192,estp,"I dropped out of college when I did this test and was an ESTP, but I knew I didn't want to be in college even before I went. I took time off (7 years) and now have been back for a year and half, but re-did the test and now get ENTJ every time. 
So, according to the test my primary ""extroverted sensing"" changed into ""extroverted thinking"" and the sensing went to a tertiary. 
What does that mean? I don't know, probably nothing for sure. I think it means I joined the military and learned that college is worth it after I was getting paid to do a job I hated fighting in a war with a lost cause. At least, as long as you believe you're pursuing something in college worthwhile, I believe it increases likelihood of passing by a large margin. I needed to challenge myself/prove my own worth, so I'm pursuing an engineering degree. 
I think the estp in me learned about the world enough to know that I, an average white guy from an average middle class family, needed to focus my energy on something sustainable and fluid enough to keep my interest. How exactly does all this technology work? Well, might as well find out and enjoy solving problems and learning about the laws of the universe that only a very small percentage of the human race has ever understood and applied to bettering the world.  "
193,estp,"""If the ESTP has decided that something needs to be done, then their ""do it and get on with it"" attitude takes precendence over the rules.""
This. I've always been a terrible student and an excellent learner. My parents were relentless in making sure I strove for good grades. When I began middle school, they told me I needed to come home with a 3.0, so I said screw the rules and did whatever it took to avoid punishment. I may not have been smart, but I certainly wasn't stupid either.
My biggest thing is turning in completed assignments, no matter how sloppy or blatantly half-assed they are. Bs and Cs beat a flat zero any day of the week. I remember writing five-page papers one hour before class in junior college, and have turned in plenty of assignments late. In almost all cases I've been shrewd enough to talk my way into no reduction. Hehehe
While I was an undergraduate, I spent copious amounts of time ruminating on what made my peers better students than me. In the end, I can say I learned a staggering amount from them, but enjoy relaxing too much to work as hard as they do. We all received the same degree anyway ;)"
194,estp,"Ha i dropped out too! I left college sophomore year due to a great business opportunity. It wasn't an easy decision, but one that i don't regret. I tend to feel very restricted in school settings, which led me to slack off and party too hard, and due to the nature of my sorority, my grades were slipping, my blood alcohol level was rising and i felt like i was heading nowhere fast. On a break back at home i met an employee of my father who's parents needed marketing help for their design company. Marketing is a natural ability for me, so after long deliberation i decided to leave school and join their company. Best decision i could have made. When that fomo starts creeping up every now and then i just tell myself that I had enough fun in high school and that all that alcohol that i would have consumed had i stayed would have only caused me wrinkles later in life. :)"
195,estp,"Just did the Myer-Briggs test and came up with ESTP, reading the description of an ESTP seemed to fit well, but reading other people describe themselves on here made me doubt that I'm actually an ESTP. I read the other personality types and none of them really describe what I think I am. 
Why I might be an ESTP:
I get bored easy, but love problem solving, I deal with reality and don't care too much about theory's, I have a crass sense of humor, I hate rules just for rules sake, I would much prefer to do a sport/activity than watch others do it, but get bored when I plateau at the sport/activity, I hate monotonous work
Why I may not be an ESTP:
Despite having an okay IQ (130) I've never excelled at anything, I don't get along really well with others (I'm too offensive for most people) so I've never been popular.... I did just enough to get through high school and college (2.76 gpa), I don't really give a fuck what others think about me, yet I can take things more personally than I ought to. 
I'm also interested in learning about careers that ESTPs find enjoyable, I am working in local government supervising 11 people, completing state reports about the landfills, doing requests for bids on equipment and services and I hate my job. I also work for 2 people that I have little respect for, one thinks is probably an Intp that loves to throw out bizarre ideas and expects everyone to understand his wacky ideas, the other is probably an ENTJ that's loves to be in control yet doesn't want to learn anything. "
196,estp,"You sound so like me as an ESTP. Crass sense of humor and not liking rules. I work at a tech ""startup"" now. I spend lots of time solving problems and there really aren't many rules at all. I decide when I work and how I go about it. I recommend that environment for us."
197,estp,"Look st Dario Nardi's work connecting mbti and neuroscience. It's the closest thing to empirical proof of the system however personality is much more complex than 8 function descriptions and mbti doesn't seek to explain behaviour learned through experience.
In terms of brain activity in specific regions Dario's work goes a long way to provide some form of empirical testing.
The Barnum effect can be applied to anything with synchronicity. And it's nice that this word was also part of Jung's work. In any case psychology is never really empirical despite it all being a result of observation."
198,estp,"Well yeah, I mean all of the personality stuff is pseudoscience
Realistically there's probably some actual grounds to what they're saying in personality tests and a few of the other popular pseudosciences, but no, none of it is technically real"
199,estp,"I roll up enough here lol. I guess i dont get what strain I want, but this is all medical shit and cheap AF. I also get cheap wax and have made wax a couple of times so that's never an issue for me. I like the life tho I live in one of the 2 democratic voting counties in a small town. Live like a king with very little money. "
200,estp,"As an INFJ (probably more of INFJs too) we would live on our inferior for a while, which is Se, and so becoming more like an ESTP by wanting to have fun and not stay in our heads because its messy when stressed.
I was wondering, do you ESTPs become more like INFJs when under stress? Do you withdraw from the outside world and action and become more of an introvert? What does happen and what do you do?"
201,estp,"It's frustrating. Fuse shortens, kind of a bad mood, it's like a light depression. You just are endlessly waiting for a moment to step away from everything and decompress, do a hard reset. After that, everything is good again "
202,estp,"When I’m under a lot of stress, I try to find a solution to the problems that are stressing me out. I think a lot of ESTPs like myself view most things in terms of problems that can be fixed and solutions (AKA results) that will fix them quickly. Needless to say there aren’t a ton of things that will stress me out. 
However, when I have a problem that there’s no immediate or feasible solution to, I’ll get frustrated and irritable and a little short with people too. I’ll kind of withdraw back and become more quiet than I usually am and go into “observation mode” as opposed to my typical “action” mode. "
203,estp,"I do get tired and tend to become more introverted. I start to withdraw from everything and push people away. But, I also go further into my Se; in usually unhealthy ways. I use external stimulation as a way to mask my problems or to avoid facing inner turmoil. For example, I'll go to a lot of concerts, shows, busy my time with people that don't really add to my life, reckless behavior, etc. I try to have as much reckless fun as I can as a distraction. But now I'm more aware of this and have developed my nearly non-existent Fi a bit more, I'm more self-aware to not revert to this unhealthy pattern of overstimulating Se anymore. "
204,estp,"Not at all about understanding yourself or finding purpose. It's like having a really heavy backpack full of your life and stresses, and you've been carrying it forever, you're finally tired and feeling a bit suffocated and want to set it down for a while. Once you've rested you just pick it up and keep going again "
205,estp,"Don't try. Never try. I get it, I always end up trying too, but just don't. If it works it works, if it doesn't then it was never meant to be. But also don't try to not try lol, just let yourself have as little control as possible."
206,estp,"How do you guys motivate yourself to finish college?
I'm trying to finish my BS in computer science but it's just so damn hard. I don't see the point in continuing taking all these stupid classes that I don't care about (Calculus 1-4, Chem 1-2. [anything not related to my major here]) but is required for me to PAY FOR and to SPEND TIME on. I can't fucking do it anymore.
I'm honestly contemplating dropping out because I'm just bummed. I'm taking summer classes and it's been eating my soul away for the past 3 months and I just hate college. I know I'm bitching and being a pussy but when you overhear about ""connections"", people getting jobs without a degree, internship 
I don't want to trigger my parents but I don't know man. How do you guys get through all this mess? I searched on ESTP reddit about motivation and all I get is a bunch of ""yeah I dropped out of college lol"" and it's demotivating lmao."
207,estp,"I just finished my bachelor degree in engineering: computer science and mechanical.
I don't know how far you are with your degree currently, or if you've made the right choice studying what you are studying. But from my experience it's better to stick to your ""bad"" decision. As far as I know, the future does not promise much good for unskilled labour.  And having a STEM degree will always gives you an edge. However, I'm European, so I'm definitely not in the same situation as you are with your student debt.
I had a ""rough"" couple of first two years in college, while my friends were on holiday and partying I spent my two entire summers studying. What helped me a lot is stoicism. It's a philosophy that should feel right for any ESTP. Learns you to only worry about issues you can actually change and have control over - I highly recommend it. For now I would just focus on your short term goals and only once they're finished you can possibly review your long term plans.
I have a pretty nice life right now: I have 3 months of summer holiday, including one internship and cheap holidays with my friends, plus I'm going to study abroad next year. All because I stuck with my decision, I kept my focus, kept working and fighting in my previous years."
208,estp,"""I'm studying something I don't want to study... And I'm paying for it... To get a job I probably won't want... What do?""
don't do it lol. Not like you will be happy doing that for a living. Quit sooner than later, take an off year, think about your life a little"
209,estp,"Do you have any links or advice for me to train myself to be stoic?
I wish I had your life right now, but I'm doing terrible. I've been skipping class here and there and I'm not going to take the exam today because I feel like I'm going to fail regardless. I try to numb the pain by doing activities like going outside and buying landscaping items and moving them around to make the yard look nice so I feel accomplished. I just don't know, I was supposed to transfer to a higher level university and planned to graduate in 3 years time, but it got worse when my classes for next sem I got kicked out of the registry since I forgot to pay for when I was pulled from the waitlist. Now all my plans are ruined and it looks like I won't graduate in time. 
Sorry I'm just so stressed."
210,estp,"Perhaps start with this: https://dailystoic.com/new-start-here/
And if you like it you could buy a real book - I read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.
The past is over and the future is unknown, so focus on the present and what you can do right now to change your situation. You are still young and have plenty of time to turn the tide. And you're probably in a better situation than most people of your age anyways.
It took me two full years to get back on the right track, so it will take time, but it's worth it. You will be more confident and stronger than you were before.  And in the end, it's just a game, so don't kill yourself too much. Just remember that as long as you do your absolute best, you have no reason to blame yourself."
211,estp,"hi all, 
i live with conservative immigrant parents who expect me to adhere to certain cultural social norms, this includes early curfews and not being allowed female friends. This is really hurting me because as an ESTP i crave social settings. 
I am forced to decline invites or attend and leave early.
This is having a feedback loop effect, where now it's affecting my social confidence... which makes things worse.
I am still living with parents because i am an undergrad and am unable to financially support myself. 
Can y'all suggest ideas ? "
212,estp,"I understand the difficulty. I used work (at a bike shop) as my opportunity to make friends and be social. Doing sales let me talk to girls and met cool people. Fixing bikes let me learn new things and feel like I was helping others have fun. 
I recommend it! (Or something like it)"
213,estp,Hello intj here simply wandering around the different subreddits learning about people and types. How do you guys process information? How do you make decisions? How do you deal with people? What makes you you? Anything really that provides insight into what it is like to be in your head is what I am looking for. If I need clarification I will ask and anything helps. 
214,estp,"Obviously I can really only speak for myself, but any ESTP who replies should have similar answers.
I process information logically, in a sequential order, and will be mostly fixated on that information until I have processed it sufficiently enough to either come to a conclusion about something or some other reason that is useful to me in some way.  An example would be a rumbling I heard in my car once.  I knew it wasn't supposed to be rumbling, so until the problem was solved, if I wasn't busy with anything, I was thinking about the rumbling.  If I was busy, it was still in the back of my mind.  Always.  My thought process was: ""Ok, I know this isn't supposed to happen.  Where is it coming from? Sounds like underneath the car, so probably not an engine issue.  When does it happen?  When I'm accelerating in 2nd gear usually, and then it stops.  Hmm, maybe something with the 2nd gear? It sounds further back than that though.  Maybe something broke and it resonates when the car is going specifically that speed?""  Sure enough, part of the exhaust system had rusted through and was rumbling from the vibrations when I was going that particular speed.  I didn't have the ability to fix it myself, though, so off to the shop!
How do I make decisions? It depends on what the end goal is really.  If it's work, then my decision is based on the easiest and fastest way to get the job done.  If it's just a personal decision, it's usually based on what will be the most fun.  I think in general ESTP's are geared towards fun.  Like in the work example, I think I want to get the work done easily and quickly because the sooner it's done, the sooner I'm finished doing work and can get back to having fun.  It's like persistently the end goal to anything I do.  Not to say work itself isn't fun, as long as it's stimulating, I usually enjoy it.  That's another thing about ESTP's.  We need a lot of external stimulation.  I get bored very easily and when I have an idea or want to do something I want to do it, right now, in it's entirety, and if I can't I'll probably get pissed off, or at least a little frustrated because some external force, outside of my control is preventing me from experiencing what I want to experience right now.  This can lead to destruction in some way a lot of times because the motive is generally to do or experience or create something, and when restricted, that sensation still longs to be filled, so anything that will provide that stimulation will have to suffice.  That's video games are awesome! It stimulates the mind without really being too destructive (as long as you can control how long you play).  That was a lot on our sensing aspect, not a whole lot on decision making, but I think I gave you a good idea of out decision making motives haha
How do I deal with people?  Pretty easily.  I don't have much problem conversing with people or working with people.  It bothers me when people can't carry on a conversation.  I asked someone the other day what kind of music he liked, and he gave me a smart alec response, and it was funny, but he didn't expand at all afterwards, so the conversation was over, and we just sat in silence the rest of the time.  I just give up when people do things like that.  It isn't worth my time to try and continuing to talk.  I love social settings where people are having fun and there's a lot going on.  That actually reminds me of settings like concerts or parties.  That somewhat chaotic loudness helps me think more clearly I think.  Again the sensing aspect at play.  In those situations, I am almost more aware of what is going on around me than usual because I have the external sounds and experience stimulating my senses, so my brain doesn't have to be as busy constantly thinking about things to preoccupy me so I'm not bored, and this leaves my brain more free to actively think about my surroundings.  Meetings? Super boring.  Fire drills? Emergencies? Any event that requires immediate action? Bring 'em on.  That's what we're made for.  While other people are running around freaking out, we had analyzed our surrounds thoroughly already, and are jumping to action to save the day or ensure whatever the objective may be is completed fast.  That's a segue to another aspect of ESTP's (sorry for going off topic, but I think I'm giving you what you want here).  While always focused on the objective, it's also very very easy for us to shift mindsets almost instantaneously.  Not interested in doing this anymore? No problem, move onto something else.  I was making something in the garage, but I think I want to go play guitar now.  I can just get back to what I was making later.  Guitar would stimulate me more than this, so obviously I'm going to go play guitar!  Even in sports, I loved playing, but I ever really cared if I won or lost.  It was the playing itself that I liked.  I like playing basketball, playing golf, playing lacrosse, but winning any of them doesn't really matter much to me because I had fun in the playing of the sport.  Once it's over, the winner can brag all he or she wants, I have to go do something else because  being the winner or loser doesn't interest me at all; it's a waste of my time.  Time that could be spent doing something else that's fun!
Doing things is what makes me tick!  I've gotten envious of coworkers who were asked to do certain things because what they were asked to do sounded fun, and I was left to sit in my seat writing up some report or something.  When it comes to something needing fixing I will always try to fix it myself because ""it's fun, it's doing something, it stimulates my brain, and I guess it solves the problem, but that isn't as important as the experience of fixing whatever it is""
I hope this was some good insight! I could probably go on with other questions, but I think I answered yours sufficiently!"
215,estp,I know it's been awhile since you've posted this but I get really mad at myself when I can't explain my thoughts/feelings. I also have a very hard time committing. I'll start a project -work really hard all day on it- then the next day I'm bored of the project. I've started so many projects that end in failure. 
216,estp,"Holy crap that is probably the most extensive response that I have seen thus far. Yes that helped out a lot, it kind of sounds like you are extremely extroverted. I am on the other end of the spectrum it takes very little outside stimulus to over stimulate me. According to most things that I have taken I am the 1% introvert, sounds like you at least are the exact opposite."
217,estp,"It's remarkable when you find something like this. Just encapsulates the mindset... i used to think everyone thinks the same way. Call it naive or the product of 'sample size = 1' but i never really grasped that people were wired so differently. It made me assume that other people (who might suck at problem solving) were actually a bit stupid.
I really enjoyed that bit where you mention a conversation killer. Especially because it was asking about music lol. Yeah. The whole thing kinda encapsulates my experience."
218,estp,"This was well written and a lot of it describes me (I'm an ESTP, with a type 8 Enneagram). I have a question for you - how do you study? I find that busy atmospheres like parties/etc actually help me concentrate, but only on the non-studying task at hand (like attending to guests). However, I can't study in a loud atmosphere; as a matter of fact, my procrastination dictates that I hardly ever want to open my textbooks. What are some study tactics that work for you?
Thanks!"
219,estp,That sounds like a lot of the P's that I have talked to. I know what you mean though. When you start a project it is exhilarating to think of all the cool stuff it will do when you get done but then you start it and it is just kind of like hmm this is way less fun than I thought it would be.
220,estp,"Thanks! I think this stuff is really interesting.  When you come across it and find your type, I feel like there's always an aha! moment, and you finally understand that you aren't crazy, just a XXXX type, and that's why you're generally this way vs another.
In school I would get in trouble for not paying attention in class, or was even failing for most of the year because I never turned in my completed homework.  It's not like I was a bad kid or didn't do it.  It's just that I'm an ESTP, and whatever the teach was teaching didn't really interest me and it was more important to me to daydream, or talk to other students because it was more stimulating, or because I could learn something more important to me by not wasting my time listening to the teacher.  As for the grades, I knew I had to do my homework, so I did every night.  And to me that was accomplishing the goal.  I always did well on my homework, and I knew I did, so any steps further than that was useless to me.  ""I don't care if the teacher knows how I did on my homework, I already know all of this stuff, what do I care what she thinks of it?""  Haha I also got in trouble a lot for not showing my work for the same reason.  Teacher knew I wasn't cheating, but it definitely looked like it since I never showed how I arrived to an answer.  To me it was just saving ink or pencil lead, and not having to write as much because the writing part was boring.  ""I already solved the problem, what do you care how I arrived there?"""
221,estp,"haha actually not on the extreme extroverted end.  I took a course on this my last semester in college, and for each letter it went 30 points either way.  for E/I I was around 10 points towards the extroverted side.  What I said about talking to people is true, but I also value alone time when I need it.
Extroversion vs Introversion is also more about where you get your energy from too: from the Myers-Briggs site  I think a lot of people confuse it with being outgoing vs reclusive, but I don't think the case.  Sometimes it lines up like that, but I know plenty of introverts who are excellent conversationalists.  I imagine they just like to be alone at the end of the day to regroup and collect themselves.  I on the other hand, at the end of the day, would really look forward to a party or getting together with friends.  Is that introversion description close to you in any way?"
222,estp,"Haha I know! It's awesome finding people with the same mindset more or less.  I used to kind of think that way about other people.  So many things just come so naturally to us, and it's pretty much always obvious, so when other people don't understand, it is incredibly frustrating!  ""How do you not understand this!""  Other people aren't stupid, though, they just have different strengths.  Those that aren't ""problem solving smart"" might be better at administration things or hospitality things.  We probably wouldn't be to thrilled with those because they sound really boring (although you may be, and if you are, great!), but we need people like that because that's how a lot of things get done.
For the music thing, yeah, it's just so irritating.  Is it that hard to just keep the conversation going?  I don't know, maybe they just aren't interested in keeping conversations going.  For all I know my asking him that could have been the most annoying thing in the world to him, and if that was his way of ending it so he wasn't annoyed any more, oh well.  I don't get it, but that's okay because I can just move on to the next fun thing haha"
223,estp,"Hey, thanks for asking!
I totally agree about the busy atmospheres.  I concentrate easily when there is chaos around.  It's almost peaceful in a way.  For me, I had to study in a similar environment.  I couldn't study at a party or concert or anything because obviously that would be the more fun.  If I had to sit down and do homework, though, I would always have music playing and would be jamming to at the same time.  The way I see it was if I had to do something as boring as homework, I needed to passively stimulate other parts of me so I wouldn't begin to seek stimulation elsewhere (basically procrastinate in any way).  I never wanted to open my textbooks, that is the complete opposite of fun.  Honestly, I never did open my textbooks unless I actually needed them, as in I actually needed it as a reference for homework problems.  But studying for a test or quiz? Nope.  I couldn't/wouldn't do it.  It would never concern me enough in the moment to study.  The thing is, I hope it's an ESTP thing and not a me being a jerk, but I never needed to study anyway.  I always did well in school without really trying at al.  Well math and science mostly.  I wasn't the best in history, but I always did well enough to pass, which is all I cared about.  Literature was okay, sometimes it was fun so I didn't mind.  
Funny story: in my physics class in high school, the teacher said we had a test, which apparently everyone remembered except me.  My first thought was ""oh crap.."" and I asked the girl next to me ""we have a test?!""  She said ""uhh yeah, we've known since last week.""  I realized shortly after ""wait.. I already know this stuff.  Physics is easy.""  So of course I say to her ""I bet I still do better than you on this.""  She said ""yeah right.""  A week later we got our tests back, and I did score better than her (90/100 or so).  The point of that story isn't to brag or anything, it's just to say that that's what ESTP's do.  I think they're just the naturally smart type (probably the other ST types as well, not too sure exactly which though).  In fact it's really difficult not to come off as a jerk sometimes because we are usually several steps ahead of most things.  Often I find myself finishing people's sentences, or knowing what people want done before they can really explain.  That's something to keep in check!
Anyway, I went off the main topic there, sorry!  I'm not exactly sure what studying tips would help you the most.  Maybe if you gave a little more insight about yourself?  What are you studying?
I graduated in 2013 with a degree in Civil, Environmental and Infrastructure engineering, so that was really homework intensive.  That's what I was talking about earlier, I actually had to solve a bunch of problems for homework, so I needed my textbooks for that.  Since I had to do it, I always had music playing.  Are you in a similar field?
Oh, I just thought of this, but don't feel like going back and editing.  I also wonder when you say ""my procrastination dictates..."" is that your way of saying you seek stimulation elsewhere?  Also, does loud atmosphere refer to people being loud? I think for ESTP's, if there are people around, then that's always gonna trump something like homework.  I sometimes did homework in the common area while people were over, but I never actually got very far..."
224,estp,"It seems like you and I process information almost exactly the same way. People get so frustrated with me because I can't focus on one thing for too long. But I don't see it as a burden or inconvenience, I see it as a way for me to learn about all of the different things that there are to learn about! Its refreshing to hear that I'm not insane. I sent your original comment to my girlfriend so that maybe she can understand a little bit better why I always need to be doing something, even if that thing is totally by myself. Do you have trouble being on time for things that aren't necessarily ""important""?"
225,estp,"Yeah pretty much. Another thing that introversion and extroversion has an effect on is how much outside stimulation you need to be at your optimal level of stimulation. For introverts it is relatively low and extroverts it is higher. This makes a lot of sense when it comes to the energy thing as well. Think about it kind of like this if you are constantly taking in too much information all day long, don't you think when you got home you would probably want to just chill out and regroup? For me it only takes a group of maybe 3-4 people to be too much and will drain me to where I have no energy by the end of the encounter. Extroverts need a higher level of stimulation to feel aroused, thus there level of stimulation before they get overstimulated is higher, but it is possible for them to get overstimulated and need time to regroup as well it is just a lot more rare. That was one explanation I heard, I thought it was interesting so I remembered it. "
226,estp,"Haha I used feel confident for exams, but the tests scores came back and I usually bombed them. I graduated in 2015 with a degree in biology, and I've put off studying for my MCAT exam till about now. Medical school applications open in June and test scores take 1 month to come out. As it is currently, I plan to take the exam either in the beginning of June or the middle of July. When I was in undergrad, I never really studied or cared for my base science courses (like bio 1/2, chem 1/2, physics 1/2, orgo 1/2) because I figured that I'd prove my worth via test performance on the MCAT. Considering I almost never studied for those base classes, I'm surprised that I even passed. I don't think that was such a good idea because a lot of these topics seem so foreign to me that studying for my MCAT feels like an extremely time-consuming & monumental task (I have to pretty much relearn everything), and that is kind of discouraging.
Yep, when I mentioned ""my procrastination dictates,"" it was just a way of me saying that ""I know I have to study, but I find other things that are fun, so I go ahead and do those fun things."" Loud atmosphere can be loud people, a coffee shop, or a fast food restaurant. I can't study in those locations because I often think ""oooo look a distraction!!""
I think I simply need to kick myself into getting this studying down pad. I've done it for psych/A&P/other classes, but those weren't cumulative exams."
227,estp,"Haha awesome, let her know there are other's like you!  Do you know what your myers briggs type is?  Are you an ESTP as well?  I'm guessing that's probably how you found this post! You were subscribed to this.
I don't usually have trouble being on time for things, but that's more because I place a high importance on punctuality.  I know how valuable my time is, and I wouldn't want to waste someone else's, even if I don't think it's that important.  If I agree to do something or be somewhere, I'll be there, unless there really is a reason.  Well, I guess not always, sometimes I will make up an excuse, but it's probably because I really don't feel like dealing with someone's BS.  That's not being late though, that's just cancelling...
What some people might say I have trouble with (although obviously to me it doesn't even matter), is paying attention to ""important"" things.  I tune most unnecessary details out of a conversation and just click back in when something important registers, or I remind myself to pay attention."
228,estp,"Yeah I think that's pretty true.  I find that when I have too many planned things is when I get worn out.  if there's a schedule I have to follow all day or all weekend, I might as well have not had a weekend then.  That's when I would really just want to chill out and people to leave me alone.  That way I can just let myself be spontaneous and do something I want to do as I please.
I'm guessing you like to have a plan, and like having things organized too right?"
229,estp,"oh haha yeah exactly! If you're in a loud atmosphere like that, studying is not gonna happen... Too many more interesting things going on.
Dang biology, good for you man! That was always a little tougher of a science since it required so much memorization.  I assume that's part of the issue, you actually do need to study, not just remember a few equations to be able to find that answer to anything.  That's awesome you're doing that though! I'm sure it is extremely monumental, but how rewarding will that be when you pass!
I think that's what it's really gonna come down to dude.  Really discipline yourself and make sure you learn all the information! It's not a field where you can just solve things on the go, you absolutely need to know everything.  
What part of medicine do you want to go into?"
230,estp,"It is not so much that I like it, but I automatically do it. I just come up with a plan and when I have one I like to follow it, if I don't follow it I get anxious and it just feels weird. Thankfully I don't have to worry about that because I always have a plan even after the first plan is scrapped I just come up with another one and another one and so on and so forth."
231,estp,"Does anyone else have a really bad memory?
Sometimes when I'm having a conversation with someone, I'll lose my train of thought or forget what the conversation was even about later that day. Or I'll go into a room and forget what I was going to get. Or forget where I parked.
However, when it comes to tests my memory is on f*cking point. I'll study the day before or of the test and pass with flying colors.
Is anyone else's memory like this?"
232,estp,I think this boils down at what each person's brain find important information and what's not. So someone might find one conversation important to keep while others you won't. Same with certain detail throughout the day.
233,estp,"I have an amazing memory. I remember the entire layout of the house I lived in when I was 2-3 years old, I remember specific moments like when my grandparents (whom I lived with) brought me outside to show me a rainbow. I remember the exact spot on the gravel road leading to the house where my grandma and I pulled over to look at a tarantula in the road. I remember the smell of the pot my grandpa used to smoke and where he would sit as he smoked it. I remember infinitely more than this, but I'd say, no. I definitely don't have a bad memory lol. I may not count anymore though because I'm getting slightly different personality test results after the last four years of school."
234,estp,"My hubby is an ESTP. He appears to have a terrible memory, but it's not really his memory that's the problem although he does have a tendency to forget a lot. For him, it seems to be more a tunnel vision type of thing where he gets distracted easily. He'll be putting dishes away, then gets sidetracked and never finishes what he started. It's very frustrating for me since I'm always cleaning up after him, lol.
But he has a great memory, when he focuses on something. It seems his mind is limited in what and how much he can hold. The more he's forced to remember the more he forgets and acts scatter brained. Or what he thinks is important. I'll ask him to do something, he'll agree, then forgets and thinks the conversation where he agreed never happened. Even if it was an hour prior. He won't believe it unless it's proved via video or written, which has proven to him this is a problem of his. He just makes lists, then doesn't read them, lol."
235,estp,"Yeah I do that if I'm not interested or don't care for the person. I'm bad with names but I'll remember plenty about the person and faces for sure. I can go over everything I know about someone but wouldn't remember their name for shit if it's been too long
I can only ever study up to 36 hours before something, but it sticks like white on rice
When it comes to remembering an experience I'm usually on point, but moreso I remember them in more Se ways like how it felt physically, how I felt physically, vivid static images or gifs of memory essentially, perhaps a key sound, etc"
236,estp,"For some types it takes more effort to access what your brain knows or what you've seen. Memory is an ESTP's strongest ""weakness"". In times of real need, it may not be so troublesome for you to remember what you need. But you'll usually tend to be reluctant to stop what your doing and access memory because it's inefficient and takes too much effort to dig into the archives - other functions get the job done too and those are your strengths that don't take much effort."
237,estp,"I think its normal to stop listening to someone if they are long winded and you can already figure out the consclusion. Yawns I find that I have better memory when I'm doing something tactile while listening (writing, chewing gum, twirling hair).
I dont think its a memory thing since you never placed their words into memory in the first place, which is why you (and probably other estp's) have a hard time recalling specifics from conversations. Our love of gainig knowledge allows us take tests without much stress."
238,estp,"My gf is a ESTP and I think she has a horrible memory. She can rember things about her chialdhood like she went camping every summer but she cant really elaborate on what she did while camping.
 It is very frustrating trying to have a conversation with someone who cant rember anything."
239,estp,"Mine is awful. I never remember if I've told someone something or not, and I feel like my memories are locked away in a weird safe in my brain that I have to actually try to access. It's really frustrating. "
240,estp,"I learn by doing  if I try to memorise something someone said to me I have zero chance at all. If I'm able to learn something first hand by doing it I'm a million times more successful.
I will pretty much forget people's name as soon as they tell me. It really is in one ear and out the other. "
241,estp,"Now that you say it, I do remember quite a bit of my childhood. I remember making cookies with my aunts, going to the movies, watching airplanes take off in her backyard and the layout of all the houses I lived in from age 3 on. I guess it's just my short-term memory that is sh*t."
242,estp,"I can relate a lot to everything you said.
Whenever my dad tells me to do something I'm always like ""YUP"" and never fucking do it.
I bought an agenda for this semester. Haven't even opened it and we're like a month in.
And I always get sidetracked whenever I'm doing anything. It's rough being an ESTP xD."
243,estp,"I can really relate to that. When I'm remembering an experience I truly feel like I'm ""reliving it"". For example, whenever I remember how high the spot I bungee-jumped from was, my body almost feels as though I was there again."
244,estp,What are my strengths? One thing I've noticed is that I don't even bother trying to remember where I parked my car anymore. I literally just go through the entire parking garage because that feels more efficient.
245,estp,"I hadn't noticed that I may retain more stuff if I'm doing something. That's probably why now that I have a gum addiction I've been getting better grades than before.
Pertaining to your last sentence, you're saying we basically cut out all the fluff and only retain the main idea? Because I can totally see that..."
246,estp,I have the same problem. I'm always asking what I said when I'm messaging people on snap because I truly have no idea and always get what I said mixed up with what I was going to say before they replied.
247,estp,"The samething happens to me. This semester I rushed a fraternity and the #1 tip they gave us was to try to remember everyone's names. But no matter how hard I tried and even if I really connected with the guy, I was not able to recall his name. It would go in one ear and out the other ."
248,estp,"Thanks for letting me know. I thought those were mostly ESTP related. :)
Do you also forget ever having the conversation where you agreed in the first place? 
My hubby always did this. He spent tons of money on whatever planner to get organized and never used it. But he finally started keeping a note app or to do list tracker on his phone, which can coordinate to his laptop. Think he's using Microsoft OneNote these days. It's the only thing that keeps him doing what he's supposed, but only for his job. He doesn't bother with anything household related. Might be helpful."
249,estp,"(best and what saves your butt in a panic) Awareness using your five senses (as opposed to memory, mulling over for deeper understanding, or brainstorming for possibilities), (second best and you always combo this with the first) making your own logic that works for the issue at hand and going with the flow, (relieving to use and you're good doing it but not the best) understanding harmony of the emotions in a group, and (have struggled using this in the past but eventually you'll be good enough to use it) mulling over for deeper understanding"
250,estp,"Hello, infj here!
So I'm looking for some insight from the estp men of this subreddit because I'm caught in the middle of a tense friendship/love-hateship between my two best friends, an estp guy and an enfp girl. Here's the sitch, both of them started off really great friends, they are both fun loving, spontaneous individuals. Over time though, my enfp best friend (lets called her Amy) realized that estp (let's call him Jim) could not satisfy her emotional needs as he did not like delving into deep abstract subjects the way enfps and infjs (myself) tend to do on a regular basis. Nevertheless, she started developing feelings for him. Jim, being someone who enjoys physical pleasure, also developed an attraction for Amy from all the constant hanging out, and one night a few months into the friendship they ended up kissing and Amy confessed her feelings to him. Jim, being the non-committal type accepted this but basically friendzoned her. In the months following, Amy recounted to me episodes where he would act strange around her, being physically flirty with her when they were alone and things like that, but always saying he could never be in a relationship with her because she was one of his best friends and he didn't want to hurt her. Meanwhile, Amy still have strong feelings for Jim but is keeping it inside until a few months after that when she confessed again, and still got the same reaction. Jim continued to act the same way, being flirty one minute, then pissy the next, basically giving off mixed signals at all times. Then about two weeks ago, Amy couldn't handle the treatment she was getting from him, especially since she has been trying desperately to move on from this person who obviously couldn't make up his mind, and decided to have a sincere talk with him about their friendship. Lo and behold, in a moment of weakness and vulnerability, they ended up making out and nearly hooking up, but it didn't go that far because they both wordlessly agreed it would ruin the friendship forever. Fast forward to today and the three of us go on a day trip, and I being very observant, noticed Jim acting his usually flirty touchy self with Amy but with a very fidgety, tense attitude. It was like watching a middleschooler be mean to a girl but everyone really knew that he actually liked her, you know? This was what my intuition was telling me, even though Jim has stated numerous times that he had no feelings towards Amy. What gives??? Can any of you guys relate to any of this or at least have any idea why my estp friend might be acting this way??"
251,estp,"They will likely talk past each other when they feel differently about something.
My sister is ENFp and i am ESTP. We can get on really well - when being productive we offer a lot of complexity together due to the vastly different perspectives.
Often due to similar temperament we reach similar conclusions but from completely different places. This is a sibling relationship so we have had a great deal of time to work on it.
ExxP
The ESTP can dive into deep abstract concept that are related to reality. Okay... what does that mean? I have no problem debating theorhitical physics, political philosophy, economic policy, video game meta, guitar technique...
I guess the difference is that some people consider hese things abstract and the ESTP doesn't.
But this is part of a challenge for the ESTP in personal development. Seeing things through that he may not be particularly interested in is difficult.
I know why the caged bird sings.
The ESTP wants to fuck but respects that the ENFP wants more than that so he doesn't push for fucking unless the ENFP is understanding that they can't (and he doesn't want) to change their current relationship too much.
Fucking does change things. But if there's no false pretense it could be okay for both parties.
Unfortunately the female will likely not understand what the ESTP considers falsse pretense due to Fi and the way it wantts to build relationships. The ESTP is sensitive to the use of Fi but finds it controlling - he is compelled to act or behave in a certain way and doesn't enjoy that.

I should add at this point that i've dated ENFP. I'm relating my experience. I tried to end it after two weeks because i could tell it was going to go bad.
Edit; No regrets. But please notice how i said ""i tried to end it"".
First time round didn't do the job.
These signals are not mixed. ""Want to fuck. Not want to be more than friends"".
I think we all know it's true here but we like to pretend it isn't true. Essentially the ESTP likes this person. But they don't want comittment because ESTP's are quite sensitive to ""turf"" and ... well ... their environment.
This is not weird. ""How else do you politely tell someone that you're okay with fucking but not okay with love and strings and emotional needs?""
But this is the problem. The ESTP values freedom above most things. Se dom and Ti creative.
The ENFP values possibilities and creativity above most things (Ne - i don't know). Ne dom with Fi creative.
The ESTP wants superficial because it's more fun.
The ENFP wants more meaningful because it's more fun.

Treatment is a pejorative terms here. But you have to acknowledge that they are talking past each other. One keeps saying ""i want meanigful"" and the other says ""i like you enough to have fun without getting hurt by meaningful"".
Yeah probably. The ESTP knows that the ENFP will never get over it. So in call him a decent chap for not putting his dick in when opportunity presented itself.
But i would also probably do the same thing and try to avoid ruining the friendship. But ESTP is an impulsive type. And like... if the opportunity keeps presenting itself it's only a matter of time until carpe that fucking diem.
Well as i mentioned the ESTP likes this person but doesn't want to be controlled by the social engineering that we call ""dating"".
That doesn't mean they can't have a relationship but the ENFP must be willing to give up the traditional idea of relationship and comittment and understand that building a relationship with an ESTP requires that you keep feeding the Se and not put it in a cage.
The female sex role works like a filter. You guys reject men who are not worth the process... And you accept the ones that meet your personal criterea.
But that naturally leads to a mentality that is caged and controlling.
The ESTP will never walk into an emotional trap. He's too sensitive to emotional environment. And that Fe is the relief function. It's terribly stressful to have a choppy emotional environment.
Why is that a problem?... trust me... ENFP can manipulate emotional environment.
ESTP ENFP relationships will be challenging but both parties stand to grow a lot. However i do find that Ne-Fi suggestions are not always particualrly helpful or easy to implement for an Se-Ti user.
There can, however, be a great deal of curiosity between these types. Similar temperaments but totally different functions.

""I Want to fuck. But i don't want to not be friends afterward.""
The best relationships are where you stay friends anyway. The very worst thing the ENFp can do is say that the ESTP took advantage of the attraction. It takes two to fuck. If it happens and the ENFP doesn't get a relationship comitment she may be tempted to manipulate the emotional environment - which would immediately ruin the friendship. The ESTP see's that as a betrayal of trust and truth."
252,estp,"Hahaha I'm a little amused by your first line just because my estp friend and I are so incredibly different and not each other's type at all, we became friends because of our mutual enfp friend. The reason why I was there for a lot of this and I know this much information is because first, my enfp best friend and I tell each other EVERYTHING and I know everything that happened between them even though i wasn't physically there for a lot of it. Second, we work on a lot of creative projects together and my estp friend and I are roommates (so i can't really escape). The thing is, he has always outright verbally rejected any accusation of liking my enfp friend, but his actions speak otherwise to me. I'm just trying to help her figure this out because whenever estp and I hang out alone we get along great, but when we all hang out together he becomes very passive aggressive and fidgety, as if her presence is affecting him somehow. I really appreciate your response though! Everything you said was totally valid. The thing you said about estps being masters of their environment is so interesting, and eye-opening for me because my estp friend is really good at controlling what goes on around him to his liking. I just love my both my friends very much and wish that whatever is between them could be resolved. "
253,estp,My cousin is an INTP and we have a few things in common. I think how INTPs think of themselves in their own heads are what we ESTPs are actually like in real life. INTPs think too much and we ESTPs do too much. Both types represent the need for constant activity- one mental (INTP) and one physical (ESTP). We’re both problem solvers by nature. INTPs think deeply and come up with many awesome solutions to problems in their own heads but they seem to never bring those thoughts to life in the real world. ESTPs (like myself) come up with great solutions too but we don’t put anywhere near the amount of forethought and planning into it.
254,estp,"Was close with one intp for a couple of years and he was extremely intelligent and the most knowledgeable person I have met and I learnt a lot of things under him as a mentor but he seemed oblivious to my se a lot and I found him to be extremely isolated and dark in his perspectives when I dint resonate with what he said , he seemed to get angry and very sensitive when I disagreed to things and he seemed very narsistic and also had a grandiose vision of who he was in his mind , are you guys extremely blind to SE ? Or can you say anything about it . 
As a estp I find some aspects and parts of the intp to be completely retarded and not at all grounded in reality. I feel they compensate the use of Ti and Ne to compensate for the lack of Fi and Se. Is it true ? "
255,estp,"I like them or dislike them about 50/50, I can't stand how detached they can be from social spheres or really anything other than their little world, and overanalyzing things to the point of defeating common sense. Those two things can be immensely frustrating but I keep that in mind going into my interactions and usually I can work it out and kind of unravel things for them"
256,estp,"Honestly it depends on the individual INTP. Sometimes you meet one and think wow this individual is really get example of how you successfully integrates your functions and they dont have a stick up their ass. We can have insight and meaningful conversations. But on the other hand you meet a lot of unhealthy ones on the internet and it's a fucking nightmare to deal with. Cannot have a reasonable conversation nor anything really. But the most part the ones I know are cool with me and in turn I'm cool with them, but if you try to shit on me, I'm going to shit on you. But that goes for all types "
257,estp,"These are so funny to read. 
I keep coming across about Se blindness for INTPs, honestly. That’s not an understatement. Personally, I fail to acknowledge the world around me. 
That thing about mistyping however, that just shouldn’t be allowed to slide. Clearly if that person don’t have enough info to type the other person, then they shouldn’t. 
And I forgot why I was writing...
The limited ESTPs I’ve known have been interesting and entertaining. Would recommend and try again. 
You guys really hate the idea of people being loners/detached? It just takes a hell amount of effort for INTPs to do something out of their comfort zone. Like 300% more effort than things we want to actively do.
And I forgot the rest of what I was going to say...
High Ti! Yes. That’s fun. 
I think ESTP and INTP can have great relationship between them, all they need to do is not be stubborn, open up a little and not use their personality as a excuse."
258,estp,I find them to be really aggressive/ indifferent when you bring them totally new information  or experience through Se and they tend to only appreciate and acknowledge new information and experience from my Se when im expanding their already existing ideas in a positive way . I think they are blind to Se it being their polr ( blindspot)  it tends to get annoying and similar to how you described so  I tend to stay away from them for this very reason itself. What is your take on this ? 
259,estp,"Met an intp who was oblivious to my se and typed me as a infj saying im stupid and blind , he argued for 10 hours and got very agressive and pushy.  I don't even know why he got so serious even if I was totally disinterested, he dint even seem to notice my indifference towards him. Basically seemed like a retard who's too much into his head. "
260,estp,"Hey, Batosai_, just a quick heads-up:
agressive is actually spelled aggressive. You can remember it by two gs.

agressive is actually spelled aggressive. You can remember it by two gs.
Have a nice day!

262,estp,"So since they are blind to our Se , are there chances that they might notice only our Ni and Fe in chat ? Since the Se is connected to Ti predominantly and they are blind to it ? 
Cause a intp typed me as a infj saying I have good Ni and Fe.  Can the blindess be that bad ?  "
263,estp,He claimed im basically a infj who's taking on the belief system of a estp to pretend.  Are they that blind to Se ? Also why do they mistrust reality so much and question it to this extent. Sounds mad. 
264,estp,"I'll try my best to explain. They are so fixated on the possibilities of the future and they are so blinded by these goals that they lose sight of the world around them. Dont get me wrong it's an admirable goal, just one that is paved with ignorance to the reality of thing. And that causes a loop with their functions in this never ending hate "
265,estp,"Lol he got mad when I told him the same thing , saying Im dumb and started questioning me using his Ti that was his  personal logic that was too deep to even understand let alone Answer.  Estps have a subconscious Infj mind and he seemed to constantly look at the subconscious mind and see it's working using his Ti Ne to type me as an infj and  find the hidden meaning of what I was  rather than seeing and understanding that with estps what you see is what you get and it mostly ends there since we are open and direct . He also got pissed when I was talking to him using a linear narrative to explain things."
266,estp,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
267,estp,"I just talk to people. Small talk is triesome if it becomes predictable (i.e. regular small talk with teh same person).
But i will talk to anyone about anything really. Talking small is a precursor to a deeper communication... however on a day to day basis most people do not care to engage deeply ... and you can tell."
268,estp,"I make small talk pretty often with random people. It's just a way to get to know strangers. Who knows they could be really interesting people, or they could be your next best friend. Making small talk with people you'd see again is good, so you'll have a springboard or rapport to build on the next time you see them.  "
269,estp,"Hi, I'm doing a little research on personality types and conspiracy theories and if different personalities are drawn more towards certain conspiracy theories or if its just a completely individual thing to follow certain conspiracy theories. It would be great if you in the ESTP community could respond to me about if you follow any conspiracy theories and if you dont. Thanks!!"
270,estp,"I hate to leave you hanging, and I certainly hope someone can come in for the assist. In retrospect, I'm positive that my first boyfriend was INTJ, second ENTP and my husband is XSTJ. I'm not sure if I could possibly help, since I don't think I've ever had a significant romantic relationship with an F. 
What I will say is, when I read through some of these threads, it makes me thankful that I was introduced to MBTI at age twenty-eight rather than eighteen. It seems like some people entrench themselves in the caricatures detailed here, and the overall population might be on the younger side. Maybe roll the dice a little?  "
271,estp,i didn't date one but i did have a no strings situation with one and it was an utter nightmare afterwards. he painted me out to be such a monster for not having feelings for him and he questioned if i was even a human being. he believed in things that i found laughable. he was too idealistic for my liking. i was blinded by how good the sex was. i never respected him as a person. 
272,estp,"On what basis are you saying he was an INFJ?
Doesn't sound like an INFJ thing to do. INTJ, maybe. INFJs have quite a developed Fe which would stop them from doing crap like this.
INTJs, however, have tertiary Fi and are more prone to doing shit like this. For example, Gregory House (from House, M.D.) at the end of season 8."
273,estp,"That's the F style manipulation. It doesn't reference reason. If logic is involved it over-ridden by the feels such that the person just does what feels right... and in this case i guess it's mixed in with the social norm where the guy wants to make the move.
People take rejection in different ways too. I genuinely believe that high F users do not take rejection very well."
274,estp,"It helps when you have the connections and resources to implement solutions after the ideation phase, but I'm down with the notion that I like to think about global problems with the aim of solving them using AI and technology.  
For those interested here's a more technical video I've done you may find interesting.  
https://youtu.be/UcupVZ0fMuE"
275,estp,"Aww.  I would share it even if you were also promoting it more heavily.
Because you've got something unique that I don't see much of in the world, and I think it's worth sharing.  Especially with some of the more niche audiences that it might resonate with better."
276,estp,"Ok. I’m 30 and a female. I have dated and been in a 7 year Relationship. I never thought love was an actual feeling. I dated an intj. I figured it was just a mutual bond of friendship. And before that, I was married for a few years. Which I randomly left because he turned into an asshole.
Ok fast forward to today. I started to actually crave a relationship last year and fell inlove with an INfp. I use to think I was an intp because I was a hermit due to my social anxiety. But I’m an extrovert and recently found that I’m an Estp. I love adventure and risk within in my life. Ok off topic.
I met my ex in October. We got along and we dated. He was the first guy I’ve ever dated with such a tender soul and so much love. Fast forward to March and I noticed I fell inlove. I got this feeling that when he was around, my life would just feel right. When we kissed, it felt amazing. He made me comfortable and I felt like we were unbreakable. This made me change. We were suppose to move in together and I started getting nightmares of him leaving me. As if he never truly knew me and that he would just leave. I internalized this fear and never told him. I suppose it’s the imposter feeling but with the relationship. Anyways, we had a falling out and he friendzoned me.
I couldn’t handle being just friends since he was my first love. I had to break that off. I regret it every day. It’s been 4 months since the breakup. 
Have you guys ever experienced heartbreak? How long did it last? I started dating an enfj(I’ve realized I prefer a feeler after the INfp) and we seem to click well. At least we were clicking well. We have been dating for a month. At first we couldn’t stop texting each other, than he said he’s busy with moving and work and hasn’t been able to text me that much. Than last night, he didn’t even say goodnight. I think he’s ghosting me. Idk. I don’t feel anything for him so I don’t really care. "
277,estp,Time heals all wounds. You are afraid of being alone and you crave a partner. This has nothing to do with types and everything to do with being human. Your nightmares reflected your fear of losing the one person you love. Now you seek a partner to soften the blow of being alone after losing him. My advice to you is to learn to be alone. Strengthen yourself. When you aren’t looking you will find someone meant for you. You are more than capable of anything. You will heal and things will get better. I predict that soon things are going to turn around for you and great things will be on the horizon. Just heal and grow and you will be ready for those things.
278,estp,"Aww. I know what you’re going through. Although after a 5 yr relationship w an INFP I can say...that’s a challenging relationship for an stp. 
I felt that way after our break up and they (infps) really can help us grow but eventually you will double down on what you really value and it may not be HOW they value things. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes....we thrive in chaos. Sometimes in stress we start to contingency plan which isn’t natural....what is hurt but a feeling? And we can always handle those...fuck it. Get back in the game!!!"
279,estp,Still loyal to the mf who broke my heart. Been 2 years now since we broke up. I see him at the gym some times. And I know I can't go back to that. Dunno why I still feel this loyalty. I don't think too much about it though. It's just there...
280,estp,"I feel you. My ex had my loyalty for a long time too, even if he didn’t necessarily deserve it. Whether he deserves it or not, that loyalty is still there. It’s a learned response, something we’ve conditioned by repeating thoughts and actions to reinforce it. Counteract it by reinforcing loyalty to yourself and who you are—what you will and will not accept from others. You deserve better than this, and you know this.
Sometimes, we just have to feel the pain and then process it and let it go. When someone we love hurts us, it shatters the reality we had and our sense of trust in that reality. Don’t push the pain or betrayal away. Feel it, acknowledge it, and set it free. Don’t wallow, though. Get out there and bask in the beauty of existence, experiencing each moment. There is no expiration date on the finish line. Someone else out there will appreciate your loyalty and reciprocate it. Hang in there!"
281,estp,"Met an ESTP many moons ago, loved his energy and mannerisms, his clear strengths in social situations (met him while he was bartending), but also his ability to offer new perspectives and explanations for patterns in the world, not as well as myself but... not too shabby either. He has a strong intellectual side. Just an interesting human. Ended up being so enamored that I gave him my number (very unusual for me, just thought he was so great). To provide some context here, I was also 100% sober. So yeah, enamored!
We talked over text for a while & went on a date. I wasn’t sure how it went since I’m introverted & I was super nervous. Didn’t have alcohol to help me because I don’t drink. 
After the date he listed future days he’d be free, told me he thought of me as exceptionally smart and pretty, asked me what I thought of him, and seemed to want to keep things going.
He kept mentioning grabbing coffee & then rendezvousing to Bloomingdales to help him pick out a new winter coat. He’d literally been talking about it for days and called me the day of to set up concrete plans, but then called me to say something came up — a “meeting” that sounded more like “bar with friends” to my ears. He works in the music industry, so it could very well have been a legit meeting in a casual setting, but it seemed off to me. 
I was disappointed but tried to be understanding. I had already gotten ready. He gave me the option to meet later that day when he could get away from his other stuff, so I set that up & waited for hours for him to show, thinking he would follow through since he was texting me updates. He never did.
When the first thing out of his mouth the next day wasn’t an apology but a bunch of excuses that very much sounded like lies, I ended things. I sited not being able to see someone casually or otherwise who doesn’t respect my time & energy, and who can’t apologize with sincerity when they are in the wrong. 
I really think he thought I’d be cool. But the inconsiderateness (and probable dishonesty) got to me. I think he thought he could do whatever he wanted that day and then talk himself out of the situation the next day. It killed my attraction to him overnight. He tried to keep in touch with me & I stopped texting him.
Edit: Damn. Didn’t realize that was so long before I posted. Guess I had a lot to get off my chest.
TD;LR: Met a cool ESTP, thought things were going well, ended things because I was concerned with his lack of follow through and inconsiderateness. I guess I’m looking for insight? Or just commiseration. 🙃"
282,estp,"I feel guilty because I've totally done this. He could just have trouble actually following through with plans. I can totally relate to that. Sometimes I just kinda don't feel like going out, even if I've made plans. I'm not going to do something if I don't feel like it at that time, but I do feel guilty when I flake on plans. Planning things out isn't really my thing, although I really can't speak for other ESTPs. "
283,estp,"He may have had other obligations come up that ran over time.  He may have felt meh about going shopping as the day went on. He may have lost track of time. Could be anything. 
It wasn't a date with dinner reservations.  He called you the day of, told you there was  a change of plans, then texted you updates and called you the next day, and tried to keep in touch after.  How familiar are you with the type?  Sticking to social plans is  exactly  the opposite of what we're known for."
284,estp,"I'm married to this type. He went out of his way not to be like this . . . on my birthday. The other 364 days of the year, all bets are off.
They seem to be spontaneous and flow with the moment. It's great if they're with you and you're sharing the moment. He taught me to be happy, so it was worth the annoyance, for me."
285,estp,"What type are you? This happened to me, too, but not on a date, just as a friend he bailed on me. Said he'd be at a certain place at a certain time, then when I texted where is he, he didn't respond for days or months. He just says whatever he wants, then doesn't follow through. Wtf is up with that? That's so stupid. He has charisma in person, but there's no point being friends with him if he can't even follow a plan, like wtf, that just kills his whole reputation. I've seen him as a liar in more than this just one instance, too. Is this an ESTP trait, or just some shitty cultural trait? Like saying you'll do something when you're there with the person, just so you won't have to say ""no"" to them, as if that is supposed to spare their feelings, yet actually does the opposite and makes it even worse when your trust is betrayed. "
286,estp,But would you flake on someone you want to get to know better sexually or romantically? On someone you’re interested in? I have a hard time believing you’d do that. Which is one of the reasons I called things off with him
287,estp,This is 100% me. I’m guilty and I feel bad when I flake but not all girls want to go on a spontaneous date if I feel like it at that moment. This leaves me cancelling plans bc I just don’t feel like it when it leads up to the date :/ 
288,estp,"The last time I took the test, INFJ, but I’ve also typed as INTP. My F/T and J/P are close. I relate to both types when I read through the literature. Enneagram 4 wing 5. 
So... grain of salt. Don’t know how much that will help ya."
289,estp,"I don’t so much have a problem with people who aren’t great at managing time (not the best myself) as I do with people who stand others up, knowing full well they’ve agreed to be somewhere & someone is waiting. When we’d rescheduled & he was texting me updates, he knew I was already at the agreed upon location. Running late, fine, never showing up, not fine. Not communicating that he wasn’t coming to join me, not fine. Making excuses the next day instead of apologizing, not fine. 
That’s a new level of not sticking to social plans & I wasn’t going to excuse it. Seems more like immaturity than a free spirited ESTP guy being free spirited."
290,estp,"I guess, too, that when you love someone it mitigates the annoyance of the thing. But I am curious, was he like this when you guys first started dating & does he now ever bother to compromise with you over this on a non-birthday day? This situation was obviously a deal breaker for me, and it still annoys me if it comes up in my thoughts and I brew on it too long. 
I wish I could’ve been more chill about it cause I really would’ve liked to see where things might go because he’s so unlike people I’ve been interested in in the past — I also felt happy and even uncharacteristically playful around him, shared sense of humor and all that —  ... while simultaneously being certain that I made the only decision that’s in alignment with what I’m looking for. Dating (sometimes) sucks"
291,estp,"Sure. And I could just as well have posted this in r/relationships without mentioning MBTI. But I wanted the perspective of someone who types similarly to see if they think I misunderstood the situation or reacted appropriately to it, etc"
292,estp,"I mean, I was taking it seriously if taking it seriously means carving out time in my schedule to spend with him & expecting the hang out to take place barring extenuating circumstances.
The date itself — coffee & shopping — is rather casual. The reschedule was a park, which is also nothing fancy.
Maybe something I said made him uncomfortable? I can’t pinpoint anything out of the ordinary. Maybe my general vibe just seemed too excited about the date (but I thought I was playing it at least somewhat cool 🧐)? Would that turn you away from someone you’re interested in?
I’m at a loss.
Regardless, if he was feeling under pressure I wish he’d communicated that. I may not have been so quick to call it quits"
293,estp,"I have absolutely done that. ESTPs aren't that great at being tied down or committed. I'm not saying that we'd cheat or anything, we're just independent and value freedom. Plans I've made last week can be really restrictive to me tomorrow. Sometimes you just don't have the energy or mood to be fun and flirty. I wouldn't take it too personally. 
One thing that I'm working on personally is following through with plans, even if I don't feel like it at when the time comes. Until maybe a year and a half ago, I never really thought about how it would bother the people I flaked on, because when someone flakes on me I get it. Sometimes you just gotta do you."
294,estp,"More than once I canceled a date, because I feel, that the other person takes it to fast or limits my freedom. I'm not romantic person and I could say, that I'm afraid of relationships. Definately I don't feel comfortable in it. But that changes with time. I think, he just needed a little time off. "
295,estp,"special talent of estp is to read your inner thoughts and actions. basically by giving him your number and then dealing with his bullshit of not going through with the date, as well as continually listening to what he ""wants"" to do (which in a sense is just as good as doing the activity itself) instead of just saying yo stfu lets go right now, he could tell both of your energies didn't and wouldn't match enough to sacrifice his time with whatever he was doing, whether it be bar buddies, meetings, doing jack-shit, etc.  
theres a lot behind ""too easy"" i suppose."
296,estp,"I also value my freedom, very much so, but I’m good at following through on time spent with my friends and romantic interests. I feel it’s the best way to show I’d like to reciprocate and keep up the relationship. I also see it as a matter of respect. I actually think strong relationships enrich the freedom I have when I’m just doing me. So yeah, even if you don’t feel the same I think it will bode well to work on following through with your interpersonal commitments regardless of the whims of the day. Good on you.
As for ESTP guy, I couldn’t help but take his flaking personally, and I feel certain that I made the right decision for myself and what I’m looking for atm, but reading through what you & others wrote made me reconsider closing this door entirely. I think I’d be open to try again if he contacts me in future. At the very least I’d be open to his friendship."
297,estp,"I don’t think he & I were a good match to begin with if what you’ve described here was the case. I don’t want to have to hold someone’s feet to the fire just to get them to do things with me. Takes the fun out of everything, ya know?"
298,estp,"So that's how they think. Fuck, that makes me think I'll never be worth it to them because of how much energy I'd have to put in just for a simple casual encounter. Yet in person they are charismatic and act like they like me and stuff, but then don't wanna make any time for me other than if we randomly run into each other by accident. "
299,estp,"i have an ESTP friend, and i had a blast hanging out with him today? the way he just blends with the enviroment and is confident in interacting with it is so fun and refreshing!
his reflexes and enviroment awareness were really impressive too!!!
i think a difference between us is that, im better at interacting with people if theres a goal (e.g getting into a club, ordering something etc), while hes way better if its just for the sake of socializing
so i want to know what ESTPs generally like and about ENTJs, and what they generally dislike, so ill have a better picture of our relationship!"
300,estp,"Not about a goal, ENTJ just wants ego and money. ESTP gets it as a byproduct. 
Many of my best friends and people that have annoyed me with their stupid frigid rules are ENTJ. We have fun and they clean up gladly, they just care too much about how others view them.
Good and bad. 
One of them the Muslim boy who deflowered me and wouldn't marry me because I was no longer a virgin. Fuck him. He knew it was all bullshit but his desire to please and follow stupid rules is too much. Coward. "
301,estp,"too black/white thinking, ENTJ chase success and get friends as a byproduct, ESTP chase friends and get success as byproduct
that sounds more like ESTJ, and ironic since ESTP care more about making friends for the sake of it, which implies they care more about their social image
ah so a muslim entj manipulated you into having sex with you? damn thats rough. i guess because you have Ni inferior you couldnt see he would leave you after deflowering you."
302,estp,"We care more about adventures. People gravitate toward our antics. If we wanted to please others, we'd be EXXJ. 
I like having fun and don't give a fuck about what people think. I liked a boy so I fucked him. Little did I know he cared too much about how people perceive him. He still does. He even told me himself, he is not living life for him but for others. Now that's sad."
303,estp,"What the fuck!? 
The ESTP forum seems to mostly contain ESTPs! But the ENTP forum has somehow attracted types such as “INFP” and “ENFP”!?
Imma kill those infiltrators! 
Then again...I’m being one right now....😐"
304,estp,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ESTP personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
305,estp,"An ESTP is the salesman/executive who is extremely charismatic lives his life fast and can convince you to do a lot of things. As an ESTP I have a great sense of humor and I love a good debate, but warning they do not care about feelings FACTS only. 
Very Pragmatic, if you want decisive action and quickly an ESTP is the person that you should ask,"
306,estp,"This exactly. My problem solving seems to be based heavily on intuition. My solution comes out instantly, wrong or right"
307,estp,"INTPs are often some of the most fascinating people to me. My crush for years growing up was an INTP and I'm currently dating an INTP and he's the only person who I've been able to actually love as an ESTP. I think INTPs are very raw about who they are and from my experience show very little interest in anything unless it's beneficial to them. Because INTPs are more insensitive and open about the truth but not flashy about it, this similar trait attracts me to them. Their reluctancy to reciprocate or develop acts of kindness, which comes so easily to me (and from what I understand other ESTPs) causes a lot of issues in our relationship because I feel like I put in so much effort while I have to convince my s/o to do something because it'll be in his favor for one reason or the other. Outside of how real they are, when an INTP cares about you or is interested, you can tell. for me, I'm really good at a lot of things and really interested in a lot of things but I wouldn't say I'm a master of anything. INTPs on the other hand pinpoint things their interested in and they learn all about it and dedicate time and passion until they master it. A trait I think is over looked that I've seen in four INTPs. That's another reason they're so attractive to me.
Two of my closest friends are INTJs. One of which is assertive, the other, very turbulent. Until I met them I had no idea what an impact these descriptors had on someone. They both seek a sense of validation from authority figures and their shared unwillingness to take risks and make quick calculations is something I had to get used to. My assertive friend, lets call her A, is confident and comfortable with herself. Although she's aware of her imperfections and mistakes she takes them in stride. A is anything but a show off. A comfortable person who enjoys learning. She can be overbearing, but I admire her to an extent. My turbulent friend, T, really tries to be comfortable because he, like A, is self aware but T realizes that his discomfort is showing and that is what sets him off balance with A. T tries very hard to fit into other types and develop traits that aren't his that emulate someone that he thinks looks comfortable. This made him develop a lying problem that drove people away and made him seem cocky and self centered and self righteous. The INTJ that people complain about online. But once he met A through me, T saw himself in her and he's been getting comfortable with who he really is. I would say INTJs for me are a coin toss either great or terrible.  "
308,estp,"Annoying in a sense. I can't fathom how you can be that involved in emotions and other people and feelings and looking into things in depth and creativity, etc. 
It's like a ""can't be bothered"" kind of thing. That being said, my SO is either INTJ or INFJ, so I guess that's just a case of opposites attracting because we click damn near perfectly"
309,estp,"My brother is an ESTP. He has borrowed thousands of dollars from family members without ever paying it back. He does drugs and drinks and lies about it. He enjoys violence. I don't talk to him anymore because I got tired of being manipulated into giving him money and doing favors for him. My mother and I are basically raising his children so that he can spend his money on drugs and Gucci clothes. He has weird aggressive conservative views about ""people on welfare"" and yet he doesn't mind cashing in those disability checks because his enjoyment of heroin makes him ""disabled."" He  rants about gays and blacks and Muslims at family dinners while drinking double martinis in front of the children. He's the poster child for ESTP douchebaggery and I am ashamed of him."
310,estp,So I'm on the bench of rather I'm an istp in their WTF years or an ESTP who's stuck in a Ni grip. There's good reasons I think I'd fit in either one but I think I'm more of an ESTP whos in a Ni grip or even a neglected Se functioning. I don't wanna get all into it so if someone could just explain what would happen if an ESTP neglected their dominant functioning that'd be great.
311,estp,"We can tolerate a few days of not talking a lot to people, like weekends where we want to just chillax on our own. But then we start getting bored easily and want to talk to people and hang out places. This is where the bad stuff comes in.
It's the same as if you force an ESTP to stay in the house all day. We get angsty and want to start doing things to appease our Se. Whether that means running up and down the stairs, eating something, pacing, playing multiplayer games online with voice chat, etc., we need to be doing SOMETHING with ourselves/others or else we start getting easily irritable and annoyed. We might get into angry bursts of frustration, because ""something/someone"" is holding us back from being able to do what we want to do. We might start getting depressed too. Honestly, we just feel like a dog with their leash stuck to a pole outside. We see a lot of interesting things out there, but we are somewhat held back by an invisible force that causes us to get angry when someone comes near us and tries to mess up our mood even more. Mind you, this is after long periods of not being able to socialize. We start hating people around us and we become easy to anger. We get all argumentative and might even contemplate suicide because we don't find enjoyment in our lives. We start getting philosophical and all that.
Until this ""invisible force"" is gone, we are able to call our own shots, and we have chilled out after the frustration of prolonged isolation, that we become ourselves."
312,estp,"Lol honestly you sound JUST like one of my (extroverted) Estp friends. Just gonna throw that out there.
Oh and ISTPs find action scenarios engaging, but usually have a calm and quiet demeanor when engaging in them. Think Jason Statham in the Transporter series"
313,estp,"In the most abstract way I can put it: This video
The spool represents my brain, the chain represents my happiness/tranquility, and the hole represents lack of social contact"
314,estp,"Hey, ENTP friend of a chronically sick and in pain by movements ESTP. Can't be there in person, so contact is kept over text. Everything you said extended to an extreme applies to the situation my friend is in. Is trying to shut me out even, I assume it's unbearable to hear my encouragements after a year in bed and with incompetent doctors, now believes I have some ulterior egoistic motive and try to press my ideology on their life. Either that or my suggestions get disregarded completely. I don't know what to do anymore. I would like to visit or support any way I can, I don't expect something back, but it's hard for them to accept that.  What can I do? I'm close to distancing myself because there's no ground for a healthy friendship if I'm talking against a wall of Ni-grip. I told them I'll be there if they need me but I'm also pissed at how they disregard or even mock my values, experience and ideas, which I also share to help them out."
315,estp,"Hmm that definitely sounds like what's going on with me. My current job and living situation actually makes it incredibly difficult, time wise, for me to go out and do things. I have felt that tied up dog like feeling. Even got out of a depressive cycle were I started getting way too deep and emotional. Now I just find myself drinking, pacing, and constantly doing push ups if I'm not on reddit, and I live halfway across the country from all my friends and am not sure how to interact with locals in my area as they seem to never wanna talk which has taken a toll on my confidence (rural to urban)"
316,estp,Yeah I know honestly I deal with the over thinking and paranoia a lot myself so it makes sense. I also used to be really social and did sports as a kid till I dealt with a crazy home life and got bullied a lot in school so maybe I just have a lot of social anxiety and my Ni takes over to justify things or help me work through it. Idk I fit both the ISTP and ESTP really well and everytime I take a mbti test I get either istp that's borderline extroverted or straight ESTP with a lot of extroversion. 
317,estp,"Okay I'm not calm and quiet in action scenarios I get really animated and loud, especially if I think it could lead to a fight. Never saw transporter I don't watch much TV I'd rather be active than sit around. "
318,estp,"Yeah man I think he is in Ni-grip. From what you said, I'm guessing he is annoyed by all your suggestions and you feel hurt because he doesn't want to take anything from it which I understand. I would get annoyed too if someone kept on trying to be nice to me when I need some time to think my own problems through and be myself for a while. Honestly, reminding him every day that he needs help or giving him advice just reminds your friend about how helpless he is which is why he gets angry. I would just write something like 
""Hey I know you are kind of annoyed by me, but I'm just going to give you some time alone since I don't want to bother you. If you need help with your problems, just talk to me."" kind of text.
​
The only way for him to get out of his shell honestly, is to find some fun activity or place to crash, so he can stop mellowing on his problems. Like text him ""Hey man wanna hang out at [insert cool place] and [insert fun activity] at [insert date/time]?"". If he's up for it, that's awesome! If he does manage to meet up, don't remind him of his problems, just let him figure his own problems by himself, because if an ESTP really wants his problem solved he will tell you. He will probably even vent out his frustrations or something in the middle if he finds you a person of comfort. 
I had the same problem with my ENTP friend when he was depressed. In the end, I just left him along because he hinted from time to time that I acted like his mommy and texted ""Yeah thanks mom"" everytime I gave him positive advice lol. I don't bother him now, and it looks like he is slowly recovering by figuring himself out. Best of luck fam"
319,estp,"Thanks a ton! I can see how it can be annoying, though I got told that not texting/distracting them would make it worse for them. It's hard for me to tell when one thing is chill to say and when it is not, but I think with your feedback now I'm able to see the difference between ""yo I'm trying this out and it doesn't work and I'm hurt and clueless pls help/offer perspectives"" and ""yo listen me out this is how I'm dealing with my life, don't mess with my business, I'm a tough person and this is exciting"". It's blurry though, so I'll be more careful. Anyway, it seems like my contact has been blocked now after some heavy miscommunication, so I'll leave it be. Best wishes to you and your friend! From the entp side, laughing about what we go through but also maintaining/establishing trust in you for supporting us is what helps in tough times of friendship. "
320,estp,Honestly I found most sports boring except soccer I loved at a young age but yeah sports were pushed on me but soccer was a choice. And I take my tests on 16 personalities but I have an interest in psychology and research the cognitive functions of many different types. From how many websites and videos explain xSTP's I definitely match one of them. But I seem to have an equal amount of extrovert functioning to introvert functioning depending on my state of mind. 
321,estp,"INFJ here, I don't think they are the terms I would use . I would say that ESTPs can lack self awareness and do not like to admit they have problems like everyone else does.They are good at living in the moment which I admire, INFJs tend to live in the past/future.They also don't take life too seriously which is something I wish I could do, but perhaps this easy going attitude might piss off more serious types at times?"

323,estp,"INFJ
Unhealthy ESTPs can fall into that category. I know some amazing ESTPs, they're in the now mentality can be wonderful and freeing, but It has to be balanced. 
Unhealthy ESTPs are obnoxious though. I know a particularly bad one that manages to come off as selfish and insecure. I think it's really damaged Fe. Unhealthy ESTPs live too in the moment, don't keep up with tasks, and get mad when everyone doesn't live 'like them'. Or 'I don't want to do that with my life' to responsibilities. "
324,estp,"I think people think of the ESTP frat boy stereotype automatically. Careless, douchey, life of the party, live in the moment, doesn't think of long term consequences, etc. I think they are also seen as the ""dumb"" thinkers because of this.
Out of any type I find ESTP to be the most charming and fun; you guys are good at reeling us in and keeping our interest. We are as interested in seeing what's going to happen next with you as much as you are interested in seeing what will happen with us. You guys deserve a lot more credit."
325,estp,"I admit that I have found estj's/estp's to be assholes, but that's only bc I'm comparing their behavior to what's important to me. I value good manners and being tactful, so seeing someone that's blunt and abrasive may raise my eyebrows. However, I understand that not everyone is like me and some people just can't help their natural personality.  On the flip side, some estp's might see me as weak and passive. I disagree , as I just see myself as not feeling the need to be blunt and ""in your face"" with everyone. It's all about different perspectives. "
326,estp,"I have literally said ""I don't want to do that with my life"" so many times. Great insight from an INFJ, my favorite type to talk to. :) 
After living with myself for a long time, I have come to the conclusion that I am self-aware, I just like to put it out there and see what happens. It's not great. We need to develop more foresight and tolerance for repetition.
Oh- ESTP here. "
327,estp,"Hey there! I really enjoyed your response -- I am an ESTP male dating an INTJ female (2+ years), and my boss at work is an INTJ male. I love the way you INTJs view the world! The description of your coworker sounds like me at my worst, although I'd like to think I have a bit more moral integrity than her on a day-to-day basis. She kinda sounds like a bitch, tbh. ESTPs think big, so if she's trying to move up the ranks, no doubt she'll do whatever it takes to make that happen (""GO, WIN, DO!""). We tend to focus and thrive on action, and INTJs are tenacious visionaries oriented toward action, so maybe just focus on action somehow? Ricky (ESTP) and Julian (INTJ) from Trailer Park Boys seem to have a pretty good thing going on. My lady plans and I execute. Just be careful what you say around her as she doesn't sound too trustworthy"
328,estp,"Yeah, ESTPs can be wonderful. I went kayaking this weekend with a family member-ESTP and it was great. Not too much of a plan and we even jumped out of our kayaking in the middle of the river to swim for a bit haha.
I understand the ""I don't want to do this with my life."" But you can't use it for everything. You have to compromise somehow. Or at least don't say it towards responsibilities you need to do regardless (paying bills, chores, etc)
I'm glad you're self aware! =) I think all types need balance. & ESTPs are one of my favorite types too (I mean, we are the same functions in reverse haha.) "
329,estp,"It may depend on how well developed their Se is. Ti is the dominant function for ISTPs so we're usually much more physically reserved than ESTPs. Now I could be physically aggressive when I'm in the banter-y mood, but it rarely happens to the point of the stereotypical ESTPs aggressiveness. ^not ^bashing ^on ^estp, ^they ^still ^cool 
Enneagram could be playing its part here though. Personally I'm 9w8 but, don't know too much about E5's to disprove their behaviour."
330,estp,"""Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression."" (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)
A price of freedom? ""Glorious"" capitalism; crazy feminism! (What do you think?)"
331,estp,"When you are feeling too emotional or down, unlike your typical ESTP self, what is your outlet to get back to normal?  
I love being carefree and fun, but lately I keep getting in dramatic emotional pits that are unlike me. Does this happen often to ESTPs? "
332,estp,"I always think about people who have had a harder time than me and had more serious problems. I have finals now and whenever I think my life is hard I think about the boys of my age who were fighting a war and saw their friends die in front of them.
Helps me put things in perspective and not feel sorry for myself. I'm a male though, so perhaps you will relate more if you think about women through history who had it rough, or someone you look up to. I always like thinking about JFK and Churchill (both ESTPs btw) during their most difficult times like the Cuba Missile Crisis or when GB was under siege."
333,estp,"I distract myself with friends, or activities that takes me completely out of emotionally down times. But I feel the inner anxiety deep down from doing that for too long. Gotta be sad every once in a while "
334,estp,"I just kinda get over it. Go on with my life and it'll resolve itself. That kinda didn't work as well as I thought it did though, and sometimes it catches up to you so maybe that's what's going on with you as well "
335,estp,"I think about what I have/can gained/achieve by going through the situation that caused the emotional letdown and, for the latter case, go about making the achievement. This helps offset my feeling of being at total loss and helps me stay positive. "
336,estp,Honestly I just deal with it. I talk with people I know won't judge or belittle me for my issues or if it is serious enough I seek professional help. If I can't speak with someone I'll just take a walk or stretch just something physical to help me get back into my right state of mind. And some times I just eat something nice and watch a good movie or whatever I can do to help me get out of the stupor I'm in. In my experience it is better to just deal with the issues instead of bottling them up or out right ignoring them.   
337,estp,"estps you guys just amaze me!, im talking about the unhealthy ones that is lol
unhealthy estps are sooo hardcore, fearless and doers!, most crimanals are istps and estps by statistics. and when i was visiting the hospital one time, i saw this estp women, walking, with 9 policement behind her, she was in chains, but the way she walked just amazed me! the fearlessness
i know alexander the great was an estp and he also had that charisma, that confidence and being a doer without fear!
opinions?"
338,estp,"I am working with a possible ESFP. Very similar to me. Been through a lot. Overcame them. But... I think, the main difference that I notice is... she seems to actively want to be the center of attention. Extremely confident and great social skills. Contrary to stereotypes... my co-worker is surprisingly smarter than people make her out to be. Or maybe I'm just biased cause I prefer street smarts over book smarts. So what have your interactions with ESFP as an ESTP been like? And how do you spot them? Thanks"
339,estp,"My partners in crime!! Oddly enough I have some of the best deep conversations with ESFPs. It's like, with other types it becomes too pseudo intellectual and fake deep. But with these guys we can just talk about real stuff and relate on a personal level. "
340,estp,"Hi! I have a couple of ESFP friends, for many years. We have a lot of fun and activities together. They really love to be the center of attention; and does not hide the fact that they like it.  At work they can get on your nerves, or if you live together. any time you have to spend more than your relaxed «playtime» could cause friction;just because estps and esfps are so similar ; messy, impulsive, etc .. We never have really bonded in a deep way; conversation mostly will stay on a surface level with most ESFPs I have known; of course with some exceptions. "
341,estp,"Yeah! I think they could be fun to hang out with... but I was friends with one... I'm sure before I got into mbti. Always kept the attention on herself. But had some of the realest conversations I've ever had with her. Now, this girl at work... does the same thing. Lmao! It's all good. I think, I can't hang out with them for too long a time though. I kinda get the sense that things can get competitive with them especially concerning attention."
342,estp,"ESTP and ENFJ are supposedly in what's called ""benefit"" relations in socionics where ENTJ is benefactor to ESTP. It's attractive for both types and great for friendship, but relationships between two logical extroverts can get too one-sided and complicated due to deficiency of feeling."
343,estp,"I took the MB test today and this time I'm ESTP. I am definitely a doer. No question that I do a lot of stuff. I'm outgoing, problem solving, a project person- not a long term job person. There's some stuff that's me. But not loving theoretical discussions? Or being poorly suited to higher ed?  I'm on my 15th year of full time college education, on scholarships all the way and will be called Doctor very soon. I hate that there is someone deciding I'm anonymously not good at this (I see now that my hatred for that is very ESTP).  And we're not good at long term relationships because we crave excitement?  I've been with my husband for 20 years and could not imagine wanting anything else.  Is this bullshit? I hate that I took this test. "
344,estp,yeah lots of ESTP stuff is bullshit cause people dont really understand how we can be such powerhouses at pretty much everything. its them rolling out the old trope where you cant be cool and smart at the same time. just ignore it.
345,estp,"Well, the test result apply more to the younger people, you get more well rounded with age.
There's also an N-bias of sort, since we are the majority online. See how this sub isn't very frequented ? Now, compare it r/INTP. in terms of subscribers.
Another thing is the shallowness of the descriptions. ESTP aren't against theoretical discussion, they just like solid, observable, verifiable facts more. The theory behind is is based on the 8 cognitive functions (www.cognitiveprocesses.com) So, facts and observation would be your Se. And if they say you dislike the theorical, it's because of your low Ni. Some types that appreciate it like INFJs or INTJs could consider you shallow, since you read between the lines too much, or you don't project yourself in the future too much. What they miss, however, is that you don:'t precisely because you saw the chaos out here, the possible stuff, all the variable to consider, so you don't like summarizing it abstractly ? (Most descriptions also ignores your Ne, which is considering multiples possibilities)
Anyway, it kinda makes sense when you dig it out a bit, and the bias isn't going to get fixed if you never give your perspective. "
346,estp,"Theoretical discussions are fact based, not feelings based. Talking about feelings is “useless” to solve s problem. That’s how you should consider it.
Excitement is also very subjective. It could mean you’re craving the wildest sex with everyone and nobody, or that you like to do sonething spontaneous with your husband. Maybe try that restaurant you’ve always wanted or go on a holiday to a place people may not say right away.
The test is basically so you have an idea what you are. But that’s not the only thing that shapes you. There’s so much more. But it’s especially good to know if you want to know what stresses you out, or what causes you to move etc."
347,estp,"There are a lot of younger folks that take this test and it shows. I'm also in a long term relationship and have 3 degrees. As an older estp,  some things I read are so cringworthy. It's probably cuz I'm female and most of the descriptions of estps are male-focused. Then I realize the person writing it probably isn't an estp and try to brush it off. It baffles me how we can be labeled as go-getters and complete failures at the same time.
As I've gotten older, I've found it harder to find people who are excited for life (i.e fun) and have stability. Most of my friends from college have not progressed as much as I have and I'm not about to hang with fuddy duddys. What a life."
348,estp,"Hm, why would it say not liking theoretical discussions? The T is right there.  
But anyway, the descriptions either come from studies involving a lot of people or straight out of someone's ass, depending on where you took the test. Inaccuracies happen. You don't even have to accept the label if you don't want to. No one will link you to those traits if you don't tell them about it ¯(ツ)/¯"
349,estp,"I cant really say that I want to hang out with them again. I appreciate and can never forget the good times we had, but if we no longer have the same interests, its pretty easy to let the relationship fray away.  I used to have a bunch of friends but now I have a handful. As I settled in my career I'm not going to bars, spending money on junk, going on long road trips, doing legally reckless/risky things. No shame in what others are doing, but thats not my jam because the pros don't outweigh the cons for me. 
Its also me low-key judging them for not being productive as I think they can be. Now I meet people in the other activities I do (sports/through other friends/hobbies).
​"
350,estp,"Thank you! This is almost an exact copy and paste of my life. 
It's nice to know this frustrates other ESTP's. 
I do a lot of socializing through discord and Meetup groups outside of work. I'm in a language learning group for Japanese and I'm also learning to program. "
351,estp,"I find that I am a person who keeps my opinions, and especially motivations, to myself. This is probably due in some part to being perceivers with auxillary Ti.
With that being said I feel there are times where this behavior gets out of hand, to the point of arousing suspicion.  Sometimes the information I'm hiding isn't particularly of importance, just normal stuff that transpires in the flow of a normal conversation between friends or a partner, so I'm not sure why I'm so hellbent on witholding it. 
I can only speculate that I'm someone who has trust issues or is paranoid, and as a result have subconsciously made it a point to never show my hand unless I have to. 
Would appreciate some insights on this matter, from any type. "
352,estp,"Lol that sounds very similar. I find I keep things to myself so much that it starts to arouse suspicions in other people. I've been called ""paranoid"" by others - but the source is not fear. I've been 'under' a few times so it's not like I'm fretting for my life, next to never scared of my own nightmares, neither a fan of conspiracy theories. I've traced the root source down to an excessive need for control, and following up the chain - power. Playing your hand too close is a great way to ensure that you stay in control of any situation. If you're doing this excessively, it's a signal that the need for control has superseded normal social needs and give-and-take between people. Breaking out of the pattern requires letting in control and allowing some chaos into your life. One technique to do that is visualizing yourself as a brush that the universe uses a paint a canvas, a passive participant used by fate to create a particular story or chain or events.           
This private behavior does have a relation to MBTI's Ti and is more typical among ESTPs of Ti-subtype."
353,estp,"Not wanting to share opinions and motivations is Fe. It's conflict avoidance and a striving for social harmony.  Say for instance, if you were to open up and share your political opinions in a crowded room. Someone is likely to get upset or think less of you. So Fe doesn't want you to share and you feel a certain resistance. 
Fi handles conflict directly. It digs its heels in when a value is violated. Something like this. lol 
Fi is low in your stack, in position #7. It's exhausting to use a function in position #7, if you can even consciously access it. This gives you the motivation to avoid conflict, and using you tert Fe is easy and enjoyable anyway. Tertiary is said to be the playful, or energizing function. So yeah, Fi feels bad, and using Fe is satisfying. 
Ti is ofc an introverted function and it's resistant to sharing its thought process. Ti doms are known to struggle with expressing their ideas as well. For Ti to put itself 'out there' and be used externally (thinking out loud) isn't natural or easy. 
Generally people do not recognize how much thought ESTPs put into everything they do. You guys are sometimes misperceived to be impulsive actors, when nothing could be further from the truth. 
That's my take on it. I don't have any advice. I don't know if extroverted functions can be used to help with this or not. Maybe. I'll leave it to your capable Ti to figure something out. :)"
354,estp,"For me I keep my deepest motivations for doing anything and everything secret. From really everyone. Doesn’t really cause any strife - people don’t know what or that I’m withholding anything, really. Just keeps them from totally understanding how I work and why. "
355,estp,"I have read somewhere that ESTPs might play games like that, kinda pressing bottons, to reveal someone's true person. Is this true? 
And what are some signs that an ESTP is doing this to me? 
Especially ignoring and treating me differently than before. O
r is it just that the ESTP does no longer like me? 
I don't understand, help!"
356,estp,"He seemed like wanting to be friends with me. He used to smile and makes jokes around me and wants to see me laugh. But when I started to get closer him, he started avoiding me, not looking at me at all. It's like he is saying ""You are not anything anymore""
I don't understand him. Btw I am a boy but with no friends and that's why it's a big deal to me. "
357,estp,"Yeah... when I feel people getting a bit clingy, even just a hint of it. I tend to back away. I don't know if it's the same thing with your friend. You probably should try to make friends with other people, expand your circle. He'll come around."
358,estp,"Prolly pressured by the emotional aspect of it. It's not about because you cared for him... it's because he prolly doesn't know how to respond emotionally? We're T. Like, some of us suck at emotions or relationships. For me, I back away cause I don't know how to handle the emotional obligations of a ""relationship"". I'm better at keeping things casual. I push people away that get too close especially when I feel pressured to respond emotionally. Then you say he's your only friend. That's going to be hella pressure if I were in his position. I dunno, someone else might explain it better."
359,estp,"My BF can logically order what I say, in an intuitive conversation, and he'll acknowledge that I can tie it all together, in the end, but he has very little patience for intuitive conversation.
Just wondering if that's something that needs to be developed or if it's something I should stop trying for 🤓"
360,estp,"I have an INTP SO. I love having wild conversations with her because her imagination runs deep. she might start in the middle of an idea, but eventually she gets to the beginning and end. I like doing the things she thinks about a lot. 
She will get bothered when I challenge her at every point. However, I only do it to see where she came from and where shes going. It helps me understand the idea as a whole.
I think ESTPs (me anyways) get a high from acting on an idea because its cool. My INTP gets a high from thinking about the idea in a million billion different ways that are really cool.  "
361,estp,"ENFP speaking for her ESTP dad here - Yes, he goes all out with the philosophical and abstract conversations that I have with him. We often talk about the future of the planet, of humanity; what might exist beyond the realm of our perception, beyond what we can see/touch/hear etc. How many galaxies we share our immediate universe with. And it doesn't stop there. We cover a plethora of topics in depth (his Ni goes into depth and my Ne keeps it moving) and I can see that this conversation enriches him as much as it does me. 
He is nearly 60, is the boss of a huge company, has traveled the world multiple times over, and has more life experience than almost anyone I know. He reminds me of my INFJ best friend at times, but he's still very much an ESTP in all of his action-oriented glory. 
I did also subject another ESTP friend of mine (before I knew anything about MBTI) to a spiel on atoms and vibrational energies and stuff and he did genuinely listen to the whole thing for a good two hours or so. I think it exhausted him though, but tbh I would have bailed on that conversation myself, thinking back.
Awesome guy. ESTP's are some of my favourite people ever and deserve way more credit."
362,estp,"We've been talking about moral law, invincible ignorance, what's a sin and what isn't... actually, since I posted this, we've talked quite a lot!
One of the things I love about my SO ESTP is that he's so open minded! But... yeah. If I start day dreaming, and rambling, he just sits back and laughs at me 🤓
Thank you 😊"
363,estp,"~Optional introductory bio~
So I've gone throughout my life thinking I was meant to be a STEM type of guy. That I was going to be that technician or whatever because that's all it seemed like I would fit into.
Cue college. I majored in computer science, it ended up being a very difficult major that I just couldn't find joy in a year in. The only reason I survived that major is because of my last two years of college involved taking kung fu classes on the side. It was something I really enjoyed and still self teach three years later. It was something I was deeply saddened by for having to leave following graduation. Anyway, I can't really program or follow a lot of computational stuff. I have some understanding, but I've yet to get a job in the field. 
I tried going back to school two years after the CS degree (worked for a theater, climbing to assistant manager in that time) to get a degree in mechanical engineering. However, that ended up being a far worse match than computer science. I was not able to function in classes. I was too stressed to look at half of my subjects if I could understand them, and my grades couldn't get up. So in the end, I came to the conclusion that STEM really isn't for me. So with that personal bio out of the way for context, let me get to the main part.
~Question~
I'm considering looking at blue collar jobs instead of white collar since I seem to be running into constant compatibility issues. I don't think I'd enjoy sales either as I'm not exactly the most pleasant person when someone is flat out wrong. What kind of blue collar jobs do you fellow ESTPs do? What drew you to it? What qualifications, if any, do I need? If applicable, how did you manage to move out of your area?"
364,estp,"This is the constant questioning of Estps when it comes to more technical and abstract jobs...
I'm still a student but I'm in a abstract field (cognitive psychology and communication), and theory sucks ass.
But,  we can turn the tables, using this genius brain of ours to make it fun ;) 
Blue collar jobs might be as boring as the rest, it's pretty much on you to find a way to morph it into something you love.
Or else, boredom will be found EVERYWHERE.  "
365,estp,"This relationship is pretty new and we're both coming out of terrible relationships. He says it was love at first sight. I was attracted to him right away. Aside from the immediate physical attraction, I was attracted to his charm, confidence, friendliness and his charisma. He'll help anyone out with anything they need and has the biggest heart. 
I feel like we are complete opposites, he's very social and out going, I'm a little quiet and prefer a quiet evening at home. He's confident in everything he does, I'm full of self doubt. He's good at everything he does especially anything physical, I'm more of a deep thinker and I'm pretty clumsy. So you would think that we can't be compatible. However, I adore his strength and he loves my humility.  I think hes attracted to my soft gentle nature and my sense of humor also, my dreamy imagination. He also likes to take control and take care of any need I might have.
I can see that control becoming an issue, he wants to have a hand in every aspect of my life. When we first met i worked as a sales rep for a calling center working 6 days a week up to 13 hours a day. The pressure to make sales really stressed me out and he wanted me home more so we could spend more time together. He told me 'let me take care of you.' So he convinced me to quit my job (I'm kinda a push over) now he wants to spend every minute together. He even takes me to work with him helping at the job site leveling houses. Do ESTP tend to get obsessive?
I see some temper in him too. The other night at a friend's house some drunk guys were there trying to grab my butt and being just gross to me. He didn't even hesitate to throw the guy on the ground and punch him repeatedly. Sure the drunk guy was being a douchebag but I don't want him in jail. Is temper something I have to worry about?
I'm madly in love with him I would just like to know what other ESTPs have to say and if you have had any experience with an INFP woman and what I should look out for. Any advice? Thanks!"
366,estp,"You should be careful with this relationship. Doesn't matter what the MBTI says, all of these traits seem to scream manipulative.
You said you could see control taking over the relationship and him even offering to take care of you - abusers will try to isolate you (make you stop hanging around friends, make you quit your job so you're always at home with no income to support yourself without him, etc..) 
The aggressive behavior sounds like he's possessive because he could have simply talked to the guy or just removed you from the situation calmly, especially at a party. "
367,estp,"Hey, something seems off about this to me too. You mentioned control, obsession, and acting out on feelings of jealousy, (instead of talking about it). One of those behaviors by itself could be attributed to a bit of immaturity or a personal development issue, but this combination could be something more serious. I read everything you posted so far. 
Consider individual or group therapy to help you sort this out. A psychologist with a PhD or anyone with an interest in scientific research is probably your best bet. A book by Lundy Bancroft: ""Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men"". I believe the author is also an INFP. And stay employed. More than just an income, a job serves as an anchor for your health and well being in many ways.  "
368,estp,"Thank you for your insight. When I said I just got out of a bad relationship, I mean that he was terribly abusive. I don't see any signs of an abusive man in him. A little infatuated perhaps. I've met his ex in laws and they have nothing but good things to say about him. I have met his whole family who say the same. Although I can see why it seems he may be manipulate by my description of him. He's just a big personally who makes grand gestures."
369,estp,"I gotta say I agree with wiccedgazing. 
ESTPs love to jump headfirst into things, and definitely can become obsessive, but we get bored VERY quickly and want to move on to the next new thing. Personally, the more obsessive I become, the quicker I get bored. 
If an ESTP is telling you ""it was love at first sight"" it usually just means, ""for now""...until his next ""love at first sight."" More developed ESTPs usually wont say stuff like that because they know themselves better than that.
At best it sounds as though he doesnt quite acknowledge how fast things are moving in the ""honeymoon phase"" (love at first sight) and at worst, these behaviors absolutely sound obsessive, manipulative, and overbearingly controlling. 
Also, 
Uh wut? 
Unless you're embellishing, this behavior should alarm you. This is not a ""normal"" response of a level headed rational adult male. It's one thing to tell someone to watch their hands and be protective, its another thing entirely to immediately throw someone to the ground and pummel them. 
I have a lot of experience with INFP. My dad is an INFP and I have a few friends that are as well. In my experience (not always, but often) they are not always the best judge of character when they are impressed by and/or attracted to someone. They tend to overlook fairly obvious red flags that other people would probably notice.
I sincerely hope your situation isn't as demonstrative as how you describe, but if I were you I would probably try to be a bit more cautious moving forward in your relationship. 
Best of luck to you."
370,estp,"I appreciate your insight. I do tend to overlook someone's flaws when I have strong feelings for them. A true idealist i suppose. I think I have tendency to attract overbearing, controlling men. As I said I was married at 19 to a very controlling and abusive man. I stayed 10 years, not fully realizing my dire situation. The first 5 years he was just obsessive and controlling, as a timid nature person, I suppose I got used to it. Then he became physically abusive. I left him 3 times and he found me the first two times. This time I divorced him in March.
Your insight is very helpful. I sometimes don't realize my own patterns. My dad was controlling towards my mom. I promised myself I would never let that happen to me. I don't understand my need for man who takes control."
371,estp,"I'm an INTP and I'm really starting to believe this guy I've been having a crush on is an ESTP. He has tested as an ENTJ and ISTP before but looking at his personality with my mbti knowledge I've come to the conclusion that he's either ESTP or ESFP. Most likely ESTP because of this massive Se-Fe loop he had last summer when he was depressed and alcoholic.
Either way, I'm curious to hear what you think about us INTPs and if we're a good match at all in your opinion!"
372,estp,"I think I'm ESTP (strong Se but tests keep on telling me that I'm ENTP which I don't think is all that wrong either.. Really unsure whether I have stronger Se or Ne, although I'm leaning heavily towards stronger Se the more I think about this MBTI stuff) and my best friend's an INTP.. I like the fact that he doesn't require constant attention from me, which means I get to forget about him without feeling guilty or anything. He's like a low maintenance friend who can actually entertain me with intellectual (and actually logical) statements and somehow understand the rules of my own world and where I'm coming from."
373,estp,"My on-off boyfriend is an INTP. He's the only man who has kept my interest. He's clever, witty, intelligent and single-mindedly passionate about his hobbies. He's very insular, and we fight a lot, but he's better than anyone I've ever met.
INTP's are allgood in my book! "
374,estp,"Haha yes, I have a habit of losing interest in people pretty quickly. I'm not a people person in general and to me ideas and information are far more interesting than social relationships. I've known this guy for nearly a year and my interest has yet to subside.
Maybe that's what I like about him. He's bold, straight to the business kind of guy. No nonsense. I admire the way he can observe his surroundings and react to things at lightning speed. He's very rational and logical but still down to earth, he can think about things without losing his touch with reality like I tend to do. I envy that."
375,estp,"Hey people!
So, i took a personality test yesterday and i got ESTP as a result.(Took one a few years back and got INTP) This result kind of surprises me. I can relate to many things in the results, such as being adventurous and always wanting something new to happen but one thing i cannot really understand is how i got the E. 
In would not really say that i'm an introvert, i enjoy being in other peoples company, but being described as being the center of attention feels nothing like me. At times i need to retreat and just be for myself for a while (which i generally think is a trait of the Introverted?) Also, i dint think i notice small cues at all. This is not all the points that i disagree with from the results but im not gonna list it all. 
I simply just want to ask, how much do you people differ from the results you got? Is it spot on, or do you have some things that you cannot recognize either?
I feel ESTP is the most fitting for me, but i still do see alot of differences :)"
376,estp,"a lot of times people get hung up on the first letter, because that's one of the more easy to determine.
Realize that you don't have to be 100% E and 0% I.  it's a continuum...you might just be 51% / 49%.
Everyone needs some time to themselves, just as we also like to be in some people's company...the question is what's the situation?
For you: it's the end of an average week, you've been doing work/school/whatever you do. You got a full night of sleep last night. It's now Friday night and you have the whole weekend to yourself. Would you rather go out to a bar with a group of 6 friends; or, would you rather meet one friend at a coffee shop?  An E would probably naturally gravitate toward the bar, whereas the I would rather do the coffee shop. Do Es go to coffee shops and hang out? of course! Do Is go to loud bars? Yes.  But let's say you had to do it every night. The I would not be happy having to do the bar every night. The E would feel bored in the coffee shop.
ESTPs don't have to be the center of attention, but they want to be near it for sure.
I love going out to the loud, crazy dance party; a honeymoon spent rafting/ziplining/paragliding sounds great; teach a fitness class is fun.  However, I also like to have one great conversation off to the side of that party; while on the honeymoon I also want to lay in the sun next to the ocean for a little while listening to beautiful music; and I like to be a student in the back of the yoga class without any attention."
377,estp,"Also, I clicked on your name to look at your recent posts...you certainly give off the STP vibe: focused on details of the game (colors, speeds, etc) - S, not focused on feelings (stating ""I disagree with you"") - T, playing the game as it is (not concerned with records) - P.
that's a simplistic analysis, but it seems to line up."
378,estp,"This explains me much more i think. The I/E situation in my results was pretty close, something like 45/55 i think.  But i definitely can recognize being NEAR the action. Whenever i'm going out, its the more people, the better. I guess i never really looked at it like that before though :)"
379,estp,"there's a course you can take called Speedreading People that comes down to learning how to identify MBTI types by how people speak, dress, body language, etc. But words probably make up 80%+ of the typing."
380,estp,"you're a little tougher to read.
Since the majority of your (recent) posts are almost always short and deal a lot with stats, or tangible measurements/events, I'd say the S is clear. SP because your humor seems to be a little out there and you seem to make a comment and move on to the next one (as opposed to SJ).
Can't really pick up on E/I or T/F...based on your comment to me I'd say either ESTP or ISFP? What do you think you are?"
381,estp,I usually teeter between extravert and introvert when I take the MBTI. Feeling seems more appropriate based on the description but my test resulted in ESTP (which is how I found this page). I can't remember what the skew was for T/F. Thanks for the analysis!
382,estp,"I thought of asking you to indulge me about E/I.
Extraversion in a Jungian sense(what MBTI is based off) means that your focus is outwards, towards the world, towards objects, including people, not the subject(yourself).
Introversion means that you spend more time focusing on yourself, not in the selfish kind of sense, but rather you simply process things internally.
All of us exhibit both, but again it is determined by preference to which one the person is focused on. I'm clear on being INTP, not because I'm awkward and socially inept, but because I truly do spend my life inside my head thinking, rationalizing and ordering things. I expect you do the same to an extent, but to a slightly different end.
STPs in general are action focused. But as expected ESTPs are more outgoing and friendly, loud as well, ISTPs are more stoic and seem more judgemental. But for the ESTP the focus is on the experience and conquering it through understanding, the ISTP more concerned about the process of understanding of said experience in order to master it.
This should give you a clearer picture on the matter. If you aren't sure, just reflect regularly in a few days and see. Even mistyping would still bring you closer to your real type."
383,estp,"I'd say I am. I became aware of it at a point because it was getting instinctive. I'd exaggerate or even plainly lie as a habit, due in part to my own wishes for acceptance among others. After doing it for so long it became fascinating to look at when and why I would do so. 
Its not really a case of being a lying, cheating wanker, just slight moments and techniques to make life a bit easier. In another time and place I could have been a decent lawyer, but now I'm a safety rep with decent negotiation skills. "
384,estp,"While I'd say that there are plenty of types capable of manipulation, I think that in some ways, manipulation may be ""instinctive"" or ""easy"" for ESTPs, especially given their constant situational awareness from their dominant Se function.
They say that ESTPs are great body language readers; in this sense, ESTPs can constantly be scanning their conversational partner for certain cues to take advantage of or work off of (it doesn't always have to be manipulative).
I think ESFPs and ENFPs are also great examples of manipulators. These types share the dominant extroverted perceiving function (Se/Ne) and are thus constantly engaging their environment. It is my personal belief that the secondary Fi function (introverted feeling) can compel them to use their dominant function in crafty ways to get what they want. "
385,estp,"Definitely! When I first realized how good I was at it I was getting kind of scared, but I feel a little bit of pride in how well I can read people. I find myself doing it a lot to get out of people being disappointed/angry with me. "
386,estp,"I'm absolutely terrible about this. I don't realize that I'm doing it but the fact that I can't hide anything has almost conditioned my girlfriend to not ask me to do things I don't want to. She says the faces I make when she does make her feel like shit. I don't realize I make faces but it sounds like me so I believe her. That may sound amazing, but honestly it's something that I feel bad about because it is a way that I've basically trained someone, and that's not fucking cool. Also do other estp's also swear a lot? "
387,estp,"yeah. From what i have noticed it doesn't seem like you guys are that into the whole long ranged planned out manipulation. it seems more like of the moment stuff, like i don't want to get up and grab that water on the shelf ill try to talk this guy into doing it for me. "
388,estp,"I agree with a lot of this. esfp's are definitely manipulative. my mom is an esfp and she is manipulative in very subtle ways, it can be really annoying. I don't think enfp's are that manipulative though they are usually scanning their environment for possibilities, possibilities could be ones that only involve them though. that being said they are usually very perceptive of peoples behaviors, because they value observance generally. I don't personally know any enfp's that are manipulative though. "
389,estp,"My little sister is an ESTP and this is exactly, exactly it.  Even as a toddler she could always get almost anything from my parents and get away with almost anything, not by brooding intensely for a long time to scheme but just by spontaneously following her instinct in the moment, getting the other person to crack a smile, etc.  As an INFP I think I find it so entertaining to watch.  I just can't do that."
390,estp,"Mmmm. Well as an ESTP I think a lot of people underestimate us. I think people fail to notice that ESTP's are some of the best body language readers there are due to our main function being Extraverted Sensing. As well as we can be ""organized introverts"". "
391,estp,"Oh what he said. We get underestimated a lot. Since we are such adept readers of people we usually end up being the hardest to read of the personalities. 
 
 
Also most people will think we lie when we boast so much about being adept sportsmen, outdoors men and overall badasses. We read environments as well and fast as people meaning we can make those split second educated calls that can both save lives and propel us to greatness.  Most of the famous ESTPs come from military fame, and we'll back up anything and everything we say so if you challenge an ESTP to a match of physical prowess you better bring your A game.
 
This makes us extremely cocky. But you know, flattery will get you everywhere with us."
392,estp,"Hello, my friend and I, (ENFP, INFP respectively) recently typed our buddy as ESTP. We want to get interact with him as good as possible, so naturally we came to the source! Can you help us with some things?
-How to deal with attention-mongering
-Dealing with him ALWAYS having to be the center of attention
In general, we just want to communicate and become closer friends. Please give every tip you can think of!"
393,estp,"I'm not sure how to deal with attention mongering, it's really something one seems to learn over time as it's pointed out or when you reflect upon situations. I've noticed that when I feel excluded, like when other people are going on about sports I know nothing about, I sort of switch into 'observe' mode (begrudgingly).
My advice is to let her/him feel completely expressed. Let them talk over an issue or idea 10 times if they have to, eventually it becomes burnt out and the excitement turns a little sombre. Bring it up 10 times so they'll have told you everything they can tell you about it ('it' being the concept or idea monopolising the conversation).
You could also find things they're good at and put them in a position to 'show off' how good they are able to do that thing. In my experience, when people are watching my successes it makes me feel less pressure to get everyone riled up with a good discussion on the things I want to talk about.
Unfortunately, you're dealing with a group of people who lose interest very quickly for things that aren't 'my idea.' As such, I'm struggling to finish this comment and am instead thinking of just deleting the whole thing because it doesn't really matter anyway.
I'm not usually one to advocate taking drugs or anything, but I do want to mention that taking a large dose of Psilocybin mushrooms completely and permanently changed my awareness to this issue you're bringing up. I can't explain it, but for years since that one time I did it I still have moments of internal monologue during group conversations when I think about that experience, and it's something like ""What are you doing being so yippity about this thing you're explaining? Just settle and let other people have a turn to participate."""

395,estp,"ESTP, outwardly, look like the person that fear nothing and all cool. But for sure there are deep insecurities deep inside of you just like everyone.
As an INFJ, I think my top insecurity and which I thought of right away is my thoughts and them being not accepted or put down. I think this has to with Ni-Ti.
For ESTP, my guess fpr your insecurity would be how people perceive you and how fun and nice they others think of you, because of your Se-Fe. "
396,estp,"Being hurt or betrayed, especially by people close to you. It's the #1 on my list of insecurities, so much that I don't even notice that I'm constantly evaluating people for their trustworthiness. I have plan b's for everyone in case they turn on me, regardless of how well the relationship is going. I always want to be ready to fight back in case someone turns on me, and sometimes it gets overwhelming. "
397,estp,"probably that below the friendly, outgoing, light and charming surface, I feel a whole lot of nagging emptiness in myself that I'm afraid to be face to face with. I don't want to go to my inner world much myself, much less let anyone else get in there- makes it difficult to have deeper relationships though"
398,estp,"the majority of my friends (and most of the girls I’ve been interested in) are INFJ’s.
So I’m very used to them and we typically balance each other out pretty well. I get them to lighten up, they help get me in tune with my inner world by having such complex ones themselves "
399,estp,"Hey there, ESTPs (and non-ESTP lurkers)! A few months ago, my good friend /u/ashirviskas developed an MBTI Relationships Survey to determine which MBTI Types had the best relationships with which types, what each of the genders rated their ongoing/terminated relationships, how their intertype friendships fare, etc.  By chance, I happened to see this guy post the survey in /r/intj asking for some input for the presentation of his results, and so I’ve been helping him out with it since then… and this is what we’ve come up with (so far)!  We invite you to tell us how your relationship with your Duals, Mirrors, etc., fare in this relationship survey! 
  
 
Link to Survey
Link to Survey Data
  
 
About the Survey:
All together, the survey is going to ask you about 1-2 romantic relationships (current and former, as well as duration), and 1-3 friendships.  It’s okay if you haven’t been in a relationship! We’d still love to receive your feedback based on your friendships/relationships with other types… if you’re not 100% sure about your friends’ or past/current S.O. types, try to give a best guess as to what their type might be (unsure is an option for friendships, but this isn’t as useful for finding correlations in the data).  
  
If you’re not confident about doing this, maybe try asking the person to take the test (a good quality cognitive functions test, rather than “preferences” tests that can be rather inaccurate), or read about the 8 cognitive functions… and see which ones the person most likely uses as their dom/aux configuration; an assessment on the inferior (which can result in the “grip”) or your “stressor” function might be useful as well. 
  
 
Personal Biases and Stereotyping:
Try to remove personal biases that you may have regarding other people in your current (and past) life! It’s not helpful to us (or to you) if you stereotype or inaccurately categorize people (i.e. “I dislike Person X because they’re so literal; they must be a Sensing Type”, since Intuiting types can be prone to such behavior as well), resulting in a lower rating for a given person/type.  
 
 
Be honest with yourself, even if this results in a rating that contradicts your initial beliefs/biases in the system; the truth is what matters the most in the end!  If you think you’d want help judging on what someone’s type may be in your life, I can try to help you out a little bit...  but, try to decide this for yourself/do good quality research and analyzing first! Some stereotypes that should be eliminated:
 


Not all Sensors are poor at (or can't handle) abstract or philosophical conversations, and not all Intuiting types are unrealistic, impractical, and disconnected from reality.  There is simply a preference for one or the other (and perhaps an imbalance in some)! And, on a related note, not all smart people are Intuiting types, and not all dumb people are Sensing types (or vice versa)!


Not all Feelers are illogical and irrational, and not all Thinkers are cold and detached.  For instance, being irrational can involve absurd, inconsistent logic, and sometimes being reasonable involves a practical and fair approach that requires considering other people's feelings.  A reasonable person will use both aspects to make sound, balanced decisions, but will typically prefer one over the other in a ""tiebreaker"" between the two. Not considering or actively disregarding one or the other is not superior in any way; this is just immaturity (in some regard) expressing itself!


Not all extroverts are loud and obnoxious, and not all introverts are antisocial recluses that never talk.  Being sociable isn't always the trait of an extrovert, and being socially anxious isn't always the trait of an introvert.  Also - some extroverts will not find conventional social affairs very energizing and stimulating; it can depend on the group of people for extroverts just as well as introverts.  Look into the cognitive functions!!! I cannot emphasize this enough.


Not all judging types are overly rigid, rule abiding, and ""stick up the ass"" kinds, and not all perceiving types are chaotic, lackadaisical, and scatterbrained fools.  We all have judging and perceiving functions, all of which can be prone to a form of narrow mindedness or disconnectedness.


  
  
The cognitive functions are supposed to educate us on how people introspect/reflect on things (introversion), and also how they interact with the environment (extroversion); how is a person interacting with their environment, and what kinds of biases do they try to mentally remove (introverted functions usually try to eliminate environmental biases, and extroverted functions usually try to eliminate personal biases in their respective domains)? 
  
  
Remember: we're all going to have traits that are introverted, and some that are extroverted in their expression! It's a matter of which ones will be this way... this should also be used as a guide to eliminate any ambiguity with regard to this orientation (thus, people start believing they're an ""ambivert"" - a term I personally cannot agree with).
  
If your family members are being considered as one of your friends for this survey, that’s fine too; any relationship will do, provided that you know them on a personal basis (since strictly going off of someone’s “professional” face may be not only counterproductive for this survey, but detrimental in your personal relationship(s) with that person[s] ).

Final Notes:
Some of the changes that we want to make aren’t yet implemented in the Google Sheets version - but hopefully this will change soon enough! Survey Participation, feedback/general commentary on the results, etc., are all highly sought after! We’d love to hear from you!
  
 
Current roles for this project:
/u/ashirviskas: the original survey developer and secondary google sheets maintenance
/u/snugglybearsama: primary google sheets document 1-(wo)man maintenance crew (data organization, formatting, formula developer, etc.)
/u/kun42: performed a wilson confidence interval on the survey data, and has a lot of statistical charts currently available on his blog for the survey data.  Check it out! https://www.man42.net/blog/2016/11/mbti-relationship-stats/
  
 
If you want to PM any of us regarding a given topic, use these roles as a general guide.  Currently, I’m the most active and involved of the three, so if you want to talk about other stuff with any of us, I'd be the most available!

400,estp,"3. Feedback Sought After
We are currently (and very actively) looking for some feedback, including ideas/suggestions on new data points that are simply not listed or unintentionally omitted without an explanation, data points that could be compiled that aren’t (as of yet), etc. 
 
 
Charts
 
This is one of the main things that will need a good amount of time to implement.  There are plenty of charts found in the excel version that I have in my possession; however, Google Sheets didn’t render them properly (surprised? I’m not).  As a result, the entire charting process needs to be taken back to the drawing board… I had some really cool double-sided bar charts for male vs female comparisons made and everything.  What a shame!
 
 
Mobile Users
As of 1/4/2017, this document isn’t very mobile friendly; this file is TREMENDOUS.  There are a lot of calculations being done on this Google Sheets document (I mean, thousands of them on the “General, All Types” tab alone, not to mention the “individual type analysis” tab...). Eventually, I would like to make a more mobile friendly version of this, which would simply import a lot of the data instead of doing the calculations directly on the document (if that would make it faster… I’m no programming expert!)
 
 
Sexual Orientation
As of 1/1/2017, I haven’t really done much to perform calculations on the basis of sexual orientation.  This wasn’t a very high priority for me to be honest (my apologies), since I thought that for now, having the genders was sufficient.  The calculations required for this were attempted a while ago along with gender and types, but they became overwhelming and very intense, making the document nearly impossible to open and maintain.  
 
 
I’m unfortunately not well versed in excel related things such as pivot tables, which would make this (along with other data points) much more attainable.  If anyone is able to create something like this for the survey data [or could share some really good pointers... does google sheets even have this feature?], that’d be splendid (and I’d love to learn)!
 
 
Volunteers
For the most part, I’ve been doing this stuff by myself (since /u/ashirviskas has a lot of school work, and /u/kun42 focused on doing statistics for his blog on this survey)… I’m sort of in over my head at this point, and I’ve slowed down on implementing the content we want on there considerably due to how overwhelming the work I’m assigning myself can be.  
 
 
If anyone wants to actively participate in making changes, suggestions, etc., I’m all for ideas and such! I would really like to work on getting well over 1,000+ (aspiring for over 2,000+... let me dream) responses on this survey (easily achieved), and implementing some charts.  I think there’s a lot of interesting data and insights that can be found in the results… I’d love to have someone to collaborate with on a regular basis about this stuff! I don’t bite, I promise… PM us if you’re interested (I know I am!).

Survey Responses
The raw survey responses - self-explanatory (hopefully!). Contains filters for the purposes of debugging, as well as examining data not organized into one of the other tabs of the document.
 
 
Overview (in the works as of 1/1/2017)
Gives an overview of Gender, Type, Socionics, and Temperament survey results. Includes a vast majority of the charts on the document [charts not readily available on Google Sheets version - import from xlsx wasn’t so streamlined and nicely executed]. Compiles information from the “General, All Types”, “Gender”, and “Temperaments” Tabs, and presents them in paragraph format.
 
 
Introduction_References (in the works as of 10/25/2016)
Gives a general overview of the concept of MBTI/Socionics (and will also give readers a general idea of the extent of knowledge/competence we the composers have), as well as explaining various things throughout the rest of the document.
 
 
General, All Types
Summarizes survey data on the basis of individual type; mostly consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data. Is used as a reference for other sheets, particularly the “In-Depth Analysis” and “Overview” Tabs.
 
 
Gender
Summarizes survey data on the basis of each gender for the types; consists of semi-organized and compiled, yet unrefined data.
 
 
NOTE: The issue of gender-type-relationship duration configurations was separated from “General, All Types” due to the calculation intensive output that would have occurred if each rater-type-gender-duration and ratee-type-gender-duration calculation was performed; this resulted in a table that was well over 15,000 rows long, and made the document excessively slow in a previous version (not to mention extremely cumbersome to navigate). Thus, the creation of the Gender Tab came into existence! We apologize if an intensive gender analysis is a highly sought after data point…
 
 
NOTE 2: There is a gender assessment being worked on, and has been included in the “General, All Types” and “Overview” tabs…! Not yet implemented in the individual type analysis tab.
 
 
Temperaments (in the works as of 10/25/2016)
Summarizes survey data on the basis of the various temperament groupings presented in the “Introduction_References” Tab.
 
 
Individual Type Analysis
Summarizes survey data on the basis of the individual type selected. Will be more type specific (and eventually more intensive as a result) than the data presented in the other tabs. 
 
 
NOTE: This tab hasn’t been updated in awhile, but will eventually include a temperaments and gender based analysis such as what is found in the “Overview” Tab...!

403,estp,ESTPs: You're currently very grossly underrepresented in the survey data as of right now! We've only heard from 3 of you as of 1/4/2017... I'd like to hear more from the other side of the fence! I'd appreciate your candid feedback on your relationships with other types... the results are highly skewed as they stand.  Thanks again for stopping by! :)
404,estp,"Generally speaking, these are current distributions for the different temperaments for those who rated romantic relationships [as defined by MBTI). As you can see (as of 1/4/2017), some of them are grossly underrepresented (there seems to be some rounding errors/deviations here... keep that in mind)!
 
 
Kiersey (NT, NF, SJ, SP):
NT | NF | SJ | SP
---|---|----|----
38.0% | 31.5% | 14.1% | 16.3%
 
Perceiving (NP, NJ, SJ, SP):
NP | NJ | SJ | SP

There's an exaggerated/skewed number of introverted intuitive types; we're attempting to collect more data on the types listed above! But, of course - all types are more than welcome to partake in the survey; we're just in high need of certain groups for a more fair representation!"
405,estp,"hey homies. Just got chewed out by one of my ExxJ friends of 3 years and basically was called out on the fact that I ""won't commit to plans 2-4 days out"", but at the same time, if it's with someone new I'll ""have something all ready planned with new person"". I agree with this - I love focusing on new people and can often lose my focus on people and friends I'm all ready comfortable with until I'm done figuring out the new person.
My argument is that I honestly have no idea what I'm going to be doing 1,2, shit - 3's aggressive, days from now; sure your plan sounds interesting, but what if something better comes up? I'll include you, but I like to keep my options open and plus, I don't know how I'm feeling till that moment on if I'd like to do said plan. The focusing on new people is true and probably not the best quality, but I LOVE meeting new people!
Curious if this is a common trait among us. How do you handle committing to plans you're not 100% sure about? As well as friends getting angry over you focusing on new people from time to time?"
406,estp,"If it's just hanging out or some party, I will keep my options open and decide on the spot. Just like you I also like to change groups, even if I have one group of really close friends I will always return to. If it are serious plans like a trip or something... you gotta commit. If you don't you're just an asshole. 
But yeah I would say your friends are mostly jealous."
407,estp,"This is why I love my ESTP bro, neither of us give a fuck about planning to meet up, we dont speak for months, and then we're like yo you wanna talk in like an hour, and its all good, other types hate this. This is the best part about our relationship, we don't care about not committing to plans till the last minute, in fact, thats how we both prefer it 😂"
408,estp,"True. Find this even harder if they keep going over the details of what will happen at said event. All interest gone if the planning is over organized, sucks the fun out of things. I don't plan that much and end up having a better time than most anyway. Agree on the old vs new people. Old friends have their same lives, what else am I supposed to discover? Good thing they understand my need to explore and are cool with it. Also if the people I'm with aren't active but couch potatoes or a little dumb I'm out of there asap. I like to do and learn things, some get pissed off because I dont want to veg out on couch watching endless Netflix with them. I want to go somewhere and do stuff. "
409,estp,"I'm the same way. I tell them explicitly tentatively yes if I might be able to, and be sure they know it's subject to change 
I also do the thing where I focus on new people. A lot of jealousy comes out of that "
410,estp,"I try to schedule different friends for different times. I have a group of friends that likes to get together in the late morning and hang out til mid afternoon, and another group of friends that likes to chill from mid afternoon to night. I try to fit new people in to different days altogether. "
411,estp,"Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!

414,estp,"Whenever I do it people either treat it as a joke and ignore them completely or berate me for idk... being too forceful? telling them what to do? and that I therefore don't deserve to have my boundaries respected.  
How do I do it right? It looks so easy when you guys do it :("
415,estp,"I don't know, I tend to hang around people that I don't need to set boundaries to. The exception being my mom, and my plan to her is to just escape and stop being dependent on her support. Short-term tactics is not tellling her things she doesn't need to know, and sometimes straight up pointing out that she is disrespecting me.  As an example, I was skipping my physics lectures because I fell behind and thus a waste of time going to lectures. taking or skipping lectures is none of her buisniess, so to set the boundary I pointed it out in the moment and the reason for me setting up that bondary, and she seemed to understand.  What boundaries do you need? Might be easier answering your question with a particular example."
416,estp,"You set them by being consistent and also by knowing/following through with the consequences of them not being respected, not just for yourself, but for others. Why is the boundary important to you? What will happen to you if you don’t stick up for yourself? What will happen to others if they don’t respect your boundary? Don’t think of consequences as punishing others, but as protecting and valuing yourself.  No one cares about your right to say no if you can’t or won’t do anything about it. And if people are used to seeing you as a pushover or harmless, you’re going to have to work that much harder to change their minds about you."
417,estp,"Yeah, I learnt that as well, that sometimes not telling them anything is the best way.  
My mom is one of those that treat them as a joke. She got it into her head that I absolutely neeeed to own a couch and no matter how many times I say No and Stop asking I won't change my mind next time we meet she'll ask again.
Or when we were having family friends over and they were asking about my health (I've got some chronicle problems). Everyone's looking at me, I have been asked after all, yet she butts in to tell the story. When she isn't even present for 99% of the time and only knows what I told her. I said directly afterwards that I wasn't ok with that and that it hurt and once more per text that night because I was still upset. What I got back was ""Sorry, wasn't my intention 😘"" And ofc she did it again some other time. It's tiring. 
I can give an example for the 2nd type later, I feel like I ranted enough for one comment..."
418,estp,"Yup, gotta try my hardest! I think that's part of the problem, that I'm changing and am half standing up for myself and half still behaving like a pushover.   
Thanks for splitting it up like that. The consequence part is the hardest, I fear the potential retaliation if they do see it as punishment and I guess I always saw it as punishment as well. I'm gonna have to redefine this"
419,estp,"Why are ""Enegram"" & ""Big 5"" test not as popular as MBTI?
I think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the ""Enegram"" or ""Big 5"" test.
What do you think?"
420,estp,"I disagree with the principle point and consider it open to interpretation.
Big 5 is used in public sector social services and mental health fields. But MBTI is not because it is a rational model and lacks empirical proof - plus it's not so hot at predicting behavior.
However in the private sector 80% of the fortune 500 companies use MBTI to build teams and manage staff / resources.
So it really depends on how you define ""popular""."

Dominant for ESTP and ESFP
Auxiliary for ISTP and ISFP
Extraverted Sensing most clearly resembles the descriptions in the following pages when it is in the dominant (first) position. In fact, these descriptions are based on input from people for whom the process is dominant (ESTP and ESFP). But even with Extraverted Sensing in the first position, what you observe will vary noticeably depending on other factors-particularly whether it is paired up with Introverted Thinking or Introverted Feeling in the auxiliary (second) position. 
In order to draw a complete picture of the “essence” of Extraverted Sensing, one must use bits and pieces that cannot individually demonstrate “pure” Se. Like the splashes of color in an impressionist painting, however, the bullets in this chapter, when taken all together, reveal a vivid portrait that will enable you to recognize Extraverted Sensing when you see it. Knowing what the process would look like if it could be separated from other influences is the foundation of process watching the practice that will quickly take you as far as you want to go in understanding personality.
Extraverted Sensing is an information-gathering process. It focuses on the current objective, external world to fully experience the details of the environment through the five senses. Se draws energy and enjoyment directly from people, objects, and events.
KEY FEATURES
Extraverted Sensing

Has an outer focus on acquiring information through the five senses.
Is the only perception process that is not influenced by associations from the past, present, or future.
Is aware of and connected to the current external environment.
Quickly notices objective facts with all the details.
Relies heavily on unusually accurate visual perception: seeing is believing.
Values the object itself, not one’s personal reaction or relationship to it.
Seeks the full sensory experience of the environment in the moment.

WHAT’S GOING ON?
Extraverted Sensing

Looks at things objectively and sees what is physically there.
Gathers pure, unfiltered sensory information from the external world.
Takes in the current environment as a collection of discrete bits of detailed information.
Constantly seeks variety and novelty as sensory experiences change from moment to moment.
Needs the immediate sensation of an external object, person, or event in order to have an experience. There is no experience without active involvement in the environment through one or more of the senses. Appreciates vivid details: colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. Seeks raw, unsorted, unaltered experiences in order to feel alive. Is energized by the current experience.

When people are using their preferred Extraverted Sensing

Their awareness is entirely focused upon the here and now.
Virtually everything that can be detected by the senses gets noticed.
The trigger for perception is the current external environment.
The world consists only of what can be perceived by the five senses right now.
Detailed visual perception is particularly important.
A level of attention is sustained that would quickly put others on “data overload.”
They do not want to miss anything.
They value practical, hands-on experiences above all.
Memories from the past and possibilities for the future are not very important.
They are acutely aware of what is.
Their perceptions are verifiable.
Everything is a new experience. No two moments or situations are exactly the same.
Anything that is tangible is interesting.
Immediate sensory experience is what life is all about. It defines one’s existence.
Life is one continual sensual experience.
They are enjoying life to the fullest, living for today.
The current experience itself has intensity.

FROM THE OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN
When we experience people who are engaging their preferred extraverted Sensing, they

Seem to need almost constant external stimulation or they quickly become bored.
Seem to miss nothing and overlook no detail of the immediate environment.
Can be prone to repeating mistakes by failing to anticipate what is going to happen in the future as a consequence of what is happening now.
Can be reflective, but the reflections are tied to the current world.
Often have difficulty doing the steps of an operation in an orderly sequence. They prefer a random, “take it as it comes” approach.
Possess practical, hands-on skills.
Are very down-to-earth, realistic, and pragmatic.
Speak about objective facts: what is there, no more and no less.
Talk in very literal terms using concrete, sensory, and descriptive present-tense language: “I smell, I hear, I see.”
Often show attention by focusing their eyes or tilting their ears or head toward you.
Sometimes can be seen darting their eyes all around the room, observing everything.
Listen at first to people telling of their experiences but do not have a need for, or a high interest in, hearing someone else’s stories. Want information from others but not in too much detail. They cannot experience the world through other people’s interpretations. Often listen with intense, focused attention. Their eyes lock on you, following your every gesture. They may move closer or lean in. They are focused on taking in information that they may show no reaction to what you are saying. 
Pick up on other people’s body language and other signals and will often automatically mirror them. Tend to use and need nonverbal communication, such as a smile, a wink, or a touch.
Appear to accept life as it happens. Seem to relate easily to people, to enjoy being with people. Appear to accept people for who they are – to have few illusions about them.
Can be perceived as shallow because of their outward tendency to “go with the flow.” Are always interacting with the environment.
Tend to be quick to assess data and to size up a situation. Do not seem to feel a need to conform to what others think is acceptable, assuming that people simply have their own unique styles. Are usually active, restless, and adventurous. Sometimes seem like hyperactive children. The immediate environment is constantly stimulating and distracting them. Are engaging, fun-loving, and social. Are very spontaneous and react quickly to changes in their environment. Can blend into almost any culture, environment, or situation.

FROM THE INSIDE
Paraphrased descriptions of what it is like to gather information through one’s preferred Extraverted Sensing

I need to actually experience something in order to understand it. I need to either look at a bicycle or at a picture of a bike in order to assemble one. Then I can duplicate what I see. Written instructions are not very helpful.
I personally hate history. I figure if it’s already happened, then who cares?
I need to see and experience something before I believe it. I’m the classic “doubting Thomas.”
In a restaurant, I can be completely attentive to the conversation and interaction at our table and also know everything that’s going on in other parts of the room.
I let life happen rather than trying to control it.
As a child I had to touch everything. I still do. The textures and colors just grab me.
I love to be outside, feeling the sun and the breeze, hearing the insects and the birds. I love the feel of soil on my hands, planting flowers, and pulling weeds.
The first thing in the morning, I look outside to check the weather. Then I turn on the news to see what’s happening in the rest of the world.
l never watch a taped game or event. If it has already happened, what is the sense of watching?
Other adults seem to constantly be telling kids “Don’t touch!” “Don’t put that in your mouth!” But I can relate to the young child’s fascination with exploring and experiencing the environment.
I don’t do lists, not even grocery lists. What I buy is what catches my eye.
I walk up and down the aisles looking for items that look interesting.
I can be observant at the expense of imagination,
If you want to get my attention, tell me a story with concrete images.
Give me the information I need to do the job, and then let me do it.
I show people that I care about them by what I do. Actions speak louder than words.
Enjoy it, use it, or put up with it.
What you need to know is right in front of you.
I tell it like I see it.
I value my autonomy and flexibility. If any rules interfere with that, I’ll usually just ignore them.
I like school, but would enjoy it more if we could change the daily routine. It’s boring to always know what is coming next.
I got into trouble in school for talking and moving around a lot. To this day, I have a hard time sitting still.
My style of organization is my own, for example, it’s hard for me to use someone else’s filing system.
I’m impulsive, and I have a hard time listening to advice from others.
Everything I do is fun. If it isn’t fun, I probably will not do it.
I don’t worry about the future. I deal with stuff when it happens.
Often I do what I do to get reactions from others. It makes life more interesting. 
I tend to jump into the deep end of the pool without thinking.
I’m like the Energizer Bunny: I keep going and going. Sitting still wears me out. If I sit still for ten minutes, I fall asleep.
When I hit the bed at night, I immediately fall asleep.
I am at my best in a crisis. Sometimes if there is no crisis, I will create one.
I tend to put everything off to the last minute.
I’m in constant motion. I need to move.
When looking at a tree, it is not so much like seeing the tree as a whole but seeing every leaf, all the shades of green, the shapes of the leaves, the texture and details of the bark.
I usually know the time of day, within a few minutes, without using a watch. I guess I notice environmental cues like shadows or the angle of the sun.
In choosing a career, I find I need to actually experience it by watching a video, going to a job site, or even trying it out. A written job description does not interest me or provide the information I need. It is not tangible enough.
I get a lot of joy and energy from little things: flowers, clouds, smells. No detail is too small to be a potential source of excitement and delight.
I can give you directions to all sorts of places quite easily. I can tell you how many trees you’ll pass and the color of the roof on the house at the corner.
My closet is organized by color. If something is not in the right place, color-wise, I have to move it because it is not pleasing to my eye.
I just could not do the workshop exercise. The colors of the objects we were working with clashed. It was too distracting.
I have never liked tomatoes. However, every so often I have to try one. Since each time it is a new experience, I just might like them that day.
I cannot sit still if something is going on. Open space schooling was very difficult for me. I couldn’t tune out the activities that were happening all around. I heard everything that was going on in the classrooms next to mine, and they often sounded as if they were doing something more exciting than we were doing.
I have never needed to return a clothing purchase because of a hole or defect. I notice it in the store before I buy it.
I rarely need to buy a drink when I go out. I always know someone soon will. Before the night is over, I’ll know almost everyone.
Often, if someone is wearing clothing that clashes, I find it very distracting and cannot concentrate on what the person is saying.

VIGNETTES
Scenes from the world of Extraverted Sensing

If I’m boating with friends, I’ll be the one who is really enjoying the moment. I will be talking to everyone, feeling the wind, hearing the sea gulls, jumping in the water to see how it feels.
In a “type-alike” group exercise that involves describing an object, our group is usually the first to finish or will divert into other activities before any other group. There is only so much concrete data in a simple object. When you finish saying how the object looks, feels, smells, sounds, and tastes, you are done. There is nothing more to describe.
Visiting an art gallery with friends, I realized that no one else saw the details in the artwork that I noticed immediately. In a painting of a house, for example, I saw the tiny key in the door. My friends had not noticed it and were amazed that I had. On the other hand, * I can’t remember what I wore yesterday and have only a vague recollection of what I did.
I like to smell, touch, taste, or even listen to produce before buying. To decide whether fruit and vegetables are fresh and ripe, * I tap on watermelons, smell cantaloupes, and taste grapes. I usually prefer to determine whether milk or food in the refrigerator is fresh by smell rather than reading the expiration date.
I can go back somewhere after being away for years and negotiate the streets effortlessly. However, if some key feature has been changed, I get confused and lost. I navigate by landmarks or objects, never street names.
I visit my daughter every week. One day I drove past her street. I had to turn around and go back. For ten years, without knowing it, I knew where to turn because of a mailbox on the comer that was made from an old stove. When it was removed, I just drove right by her street without realizing it.
In a restaurant, it’s difficult to order from reading the menu. I often order based upon seeing or smelling food from another table: “I’ll have what that guy is having.”
After an exercise involving the use of apples, the virtually identical apples were collected and mixed together. A man with a preference for Extraverted Sensing was able to instantly pick out not only his apple but those of the people on either side of him as well.
At a wedding, I could not eat for fear that I might miss something. I had to be up walking around and talking to people. I only knew four people when I arrived. By the end of the reception, I knew almost everyone. I was even invited back to the house with the family, for the opening of the presents.

422,estp,"ISFP here... WOW, if the mbti tests had had the paraphrasing and ""Scenes from the world of Extraverted Sensing"" it would have made it so much easier to understand! i can relate to so many of these :D and when i'm shopping i kind of go around ""tasting"" each food in my mouth to see whether i want it or not. (are the tomatoes a Se thing or was that an example ahaha, because i hate them)"
423,estp,"I need people to be sane, but they have to be the right sort of people. A Jolly stranger is sometimes better for me than a miserable friend. 
I do try to do the right thing for others, but I do have a core of selfishness that I will pull my kids into and lock the door when things get to much and the world gets too needy. I have a need to help others but if they won't help themselves they irritate and exhaust me."
424,estp,"I know that I'm awesome. I have people frequently telling me that I'm 'one of a kind'. People are drawn to me because I'm fun to be around and I'll always find something exciting to do. I don't act in any sort of cocky manner, but knowing that I'm fun, intelligent, and on top of that, beautiful, means I won't stick around for someone that isn't worth my time. "
425,estp,"Try to do something which is applicable to the real world.
I studied biochemistry at first, but dropped out due to it being too abstract. I switched to Biology, more practical and easier to focus, since a lot of things you learn by hands-on experience."
426,estp,Hey! Right now I’m an account manager for a food vending company in San Francisco. I enjoy interacting with my clients and handing day to day operations. I’m studying accounting because I enjoy the logic and real world applications. One day I’d like to manage my own firm or run my own business. 
427,estp,"Hello, I am a UC Berkeley English Graduate and a hard ESTP. Don’t think I would have gotten my degree without my father’s (INFJ) planning and persistence.. At least not at the age I did. I am a manager at an In-N-Out Burger and while I do enjoy the work (fast-paced, structured, people-oriented), I do not enjoy the schedule (days, nights, weekends). I just passed the English CSET multiple choice tests and am waiting to hear back on the two essay tests. Eventually I would like to be an English teacher, first High School, then Community College. I’ve learned to love school and am terribly excited at the prospect of returning. I plan to tutor English whilst there, as well as run some bar karaoke nights, a part-time position for which I have been offered, but cannot commit to due to my schedule."
428,estp,"I’m ESTP, currently working in advertising, being trained in entrepreneurship by a boss. The advertising industry was the perfect industry for me, because it gives me the option to work in a creative area, or a strategic area depending on how I’m feeling. "
429,estp,"Man i m studying machine learning and thinking to build a career in it and have a computer degree. As an ESTP, i im into mid life crisis and finding it very difficult to choose a forward career path. And even in my head pops some noise as ""something leadership"" always from time to time. ESTP has pursuasion word written all over it and even my dad is sales manager. It also embaffeles me to huge extent that although i watched many netflix shows like GOT, Fargo etc but why do i from time to time just watch sherlock again and again and again and even never get bored. Even
I just want some advice from other fellow ESTP's man how they are approaching life paths and keeping options open.
I just dont know what to do!( and it really goes into my veins and head these thoughts of wasting time)
Also how is maths for ESTP, i mean deep maths because ML and AI is all maths and how we are into field of research.
I also find studying about entrepreneurship fascinating but if at time we dont have ideas popping how to be one.
I also think ESTP are psychopaths or sociopaths.
Grateful for any tips about choosing careers!"
430,estp,I think I'm going to go into law. Currently studying advertising. I'm not sure about my career yet. I've gotten bored of the things I used to be into with advertising so law might be a good path for me.
431,estp,"Hey, thanks ! I do expect there to be some bumps in the road tho, especially to start ;)
Have you thought about management of some kind? ESTPs tend to be good at management, but getting there can be tough.. gotta make it through a bunch of menial grunt work. Doable tho, especially if you find a company whose morals line up with your own !!"
432,estp,"I have a lot of university projects, and from my experience: Effort spent in to projects have diminishing returns. So you can spend regular effort and get a C or B or try to perfect everything by working twice as much and get an A, or you'll end up getting a B anyways because the one assessing it didn't like it. By not working so hard I have time for myself so I can be fine mentally and all that."
433,estp,"I am no expert, but ESTP people aren’t known to be perfectionists. (We) are quite the impatient bunch really. xD
EDIT: Just for clarification, competitive and perfectionists are two different things for me. Perfectionists are trying to perfect the things they came up with. ESTPs usually are the structure demolishers... 
Competitive is “beating that one person/group”, but that group/person is always shifting. “I want to be better than Bob...” “Now I am better than Bob, I want to be the best in my department”"
434,estp,"Not at the moment, no. In the past I have cared about the outcome of things that were important to me, but that was when I was my most unhealthy self. Now I literally just wing everything and think ""meh"" and think that as long as the outcome works and does not affect me in a negative way, I don't really care."
435,estp,As an ESTP software developer I'd like to say it's easy for me to do something and I usually do things close to perfect but I don't care to make it really perfect. If it works so it's fine just give me my money for my job and fk off.
436,estp,"Used to be when I was in school, let all of that go once I didn’t have papers to turn in anymore. now, as long as something doesn’t inordinately effect my life in a negative manner, I don’t really care"
437,estp,"Become a hyper aware paranoid who asks ""why"" o every single external stimuli from blue sky to that man that sneezed and try to fit it into an internal framework of how the world works. 
Lol in reality Ni in ESxP types is already developed but is rather subconscious without you knowing you are using it. So idk what your question really is"

440,estp,"Sorry guys, I really need to vent.
​
I just visited my transfer university and damn, haha! Is it boring...
So is this it, is this the college experience ™  that I pay 35k a year for? Just study, walk hecka, go to class, walk back, dorm, repeat?  Man, I’m not about that fucking life, fuck that for real I don’t want to spend 2 years of my life being a lonely, broke ass nerd in a diploma mill / adult daycare. 
I want to work, make money, do something big, travel to places, camp outside, make deals, build things, shake hands with important people, just do REAL things. All these classes are PREVENTING me from doing it all and they're stressing me out. I'm really fucking tired of all this complacency of the people around me. All I'm seeing is just a bunch of fucking nerds that don't share the same soul or pure anger I have with how everyone is just FORCED to be OKAY with all of this shit. I honestly don't give a fuck about you knowing the cross vector product of some random ass particle, like who gives a shit dude. What a fucking waste of time that you have to spend, knowing all those useless things, when the job is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT!!! than the education you pay for. 
Damn just hire me already am I right? Hahahaha. There's a reason why on the JOB TRAINING exists. I'll tell you straight up, I'm not a fucking dumbass, I can easily learn the ropes of any job and I don't need to go in debt and waste years of my life and hard earned cash for learning useless, unnecessary shit. Like I'll definitely learn what I NEED to know. Don't force feed me things that I don't need on the job dude. Just stop.
​
I'm really about to lose it. It's getting to the point where I want to experience ""REAL"" things to replace this emptiness I have inside being forced into all this bullshit. I'm getting the urge to drink and smoke again, and I know that's not good. I tried exercising, hanging out, playing games, but it all just seems like a temporary distraction and it just makes me more angry. The only reason why I'm still in college is because my parents are paying for it, but I'm an adult now and I can do what I want. 
I don't want to be forced to do things I don't want to do, and that I know that I don't absolutely need to do. That's not living dude. I just want to enjoy my life. Fuck this."
441,estp,"School is an ends to a mean. The people were cool and my major classes were fun, so that helped. But the 'fun' didn't start til junior year when the Gen Ed's were out of the way. Your parents are paying for it so please don't  throw this opportunity  away. 
I find estps to be lifelong learners. so find a major/something that's always changing so you can't get bored."
442,estp,"Im only in school for the paper and credits. That crap is required for a lot of jobs. If it weren't for that, I doubt Id bother with any kind of schooling outside of trade or specialization(its a lot more practical).
Also, prerequisite classes friggin suck. Why do I need to take Humanities as a Fire Science Technology major? It serves no purpose. As if I didn't hate school enough, now Ive gotta waste my time with useless courses. "
443,estp,"My ex is estp and we had a very rough relationship. We are both passionate and it just felt like we had highs but they always followed by continuous lows. There were days where i thought he doesn’t actually love me. Anyway we broke up and now that i am moving on, he seems to be very hurt and that has actually caught me off guard a bit. I didn’t think he was that into me. Is his ego hurt and is that why he is reacting? He keeps saying ‘you never realised how much i loved you or i never knew how to show it to you’
I know this isn’t a popular sub so i would like it if you shared experiences of other estps you know."
444,estp,"I was this way to an extent with my ex girlfriend. We were together on-and-off for a number of years, I tended to push her away in resentment then pull her back in when the resentment faded, eventually I pushed too far and she left for good - and after 2.5 years I'm still not over her. She still has an attachment to me as a friend and I to her as a lover but our dynamic is such a a rubber band of pulling back in and pulling apart. I finally had to cut off contact entirely a few weeks back. I hope she's doing OK."
445,estp,"Yeah i think you are right. It wasn’t like he would never say that he loves me, there were days when he was really sweet and made me feel loved but the next day he was entirely different like to the extent of sounding almost rude. So the day he was nice just kind of lost value. 
I also felt like i had to walk on egg shells. If i was loving toward him, he would behave avoidant so it made me very aware which isn’t my natural style of loving."
446,estp,"Hmm i understand this. Hope you are doing ok too. 
The thing is when i met my ex he was having problems with his then gf. We had gotten quite close and she ended things with him and we got together pretty soon after that. So it felt like he could get over soon but now that i look back there were clear signs that he wasnt over her entirely and was just attracted to me so couldnt not be in a relationship with me. I used to feel like he loved or valued her more and i was the rebound. 
Do you think your style is avoidant?"
447,estp,"A bit, though I'm not sure if that's attributable to ESTP personality types or my ADHD. 
It's interesting how you brought up his past relationship and feeling that way. About a year after my long-term gf and I split I started seeing someone else but kept getting pulled back to my ex. It was a mix of my remaining attachment and her jealousy seeing me with someone else (irony being she had a boyfriend too, since shortly after we had split) and it led me to make a poor decision which ended my relationship with the girl I was seeing. We just have a toxic dynamic and the more I started realizing it is why I finally cut her off. Let's see how long it lasts. I haven't dated in almost two years now lol."
448,estp,"I am not the most confrontational person tbh but he kinda brought that out in me (being confrontational i mean) but then again i am most comfortable when i talk/explain in English. His english was kinda poor so apart from ‘love language’ i think we had a proper language problem as well.
It makes sense i guess to be avoidant with reason, i felt like he got like that sometimes without any reason so as to get more attention. He says he wasn’t stable at most points of our relationship so maybe that isn’t an estp thing. He was just unstable."
449,estp,"Aah i am glad you cut her off, seems like you are both better without each other just like me and him. 
So with the amount of research i have done on estps i feel like they physically move on soon, but mentally? Not so much. (Most of them and other disclaimers)"
450,estp,"IDK if you guys agree but a coworker (ISTP) and I (ESTP) were talking about what kind of life we wanted in the future. 
We ended up both agreeing on the premise of a simple life. House is paid, all debts paid off, retire early and leave work forever. Spend remaining time/money doing hobbies, hang with friends/family, and vacation/traveling from time to time.
We both agreed that being too rich and famous was stressful (people suing you, getting kidnapped for ransom, potentially losing it all, etc.) and being too poor was as stressful for obvious reasons. 
On the contrary, with some NTs I talked to, their life goal seemed quite extravagant. Either they want to be the first X to be on Y (ex with ENTJ wanting to make it to Forbes 30 under 30), or something along the lines of being the “best” of their respective field of interest. The simple life seems to scare them for some reason. IDK why, but only a few NTs seemed to agree with us (not a bad thing) whereas the sensor friends I have, all agree on having it as stress free as possible. If we could claim fame for what we do, we can, but it’s not like an important thing to us. Perhaps the best term is that NTs need to “innovate” something in their life to feel accomplished. I know a few that don’t care about that, again, just saying what I find common amongst my coworkers and friends, and if you guys relate or something.
TL;DR
What kind of life do you guys want in the future and why? Also state ur mbti type if you’re not ESTP (I see you INTJs).
Type stuff if you relate to title"
451,estp,"Yeah. I want to bust my balls doing high risk, high reward stuff when I'm young and make a nice nest egg, then go settle into a job I like. No kids, just go do what I want to do with my life (which is largely travel) and get into expensive hobbies for grown up children."
452,estp,"I'd like a life of no obligations like you. Plenty of money, not having to work for someone. Having time for fun, friends, alone time, time to pursue my own interests, learning, exploring and growing as a person. I think this relates to maslows hierarchey of human needs.

453,estp,"INFJ Male
Same here, the simple life. The sounds of nature to fall asleep to, a garden to cultivate, all the hobbies and reading im interested in, traveling, hiking. I want to build a life towards that. First step would be to find a female ESTP to build our lives, but I have yet to meet one IRL. DM"
454,estp,"I agree. I’m INTJ and I want to be the best at what I do. If I wanted to travel somewhere, if I wanted to relax, then I would make that my short-term goal, but time is a limited resource. If I relax for too long, my mind is always gonna think,”what’s next?” If every day is not stressful and there’s nothing to work towards, I might as well die next week. "
455,estp,A relatively-nice townhome in a low-COL city. I’m into cars so I want to get a sporty car like a Volkswagen GTI and have fun with that. Try to find a girl to share the rest of my life with and take it from there.
456,estp,"Kind of. I want to be some über-rich John McAfee/Nicolas Cage-type person and then spend the rest of my life as a human prank, spreading chaos wherever I go with elaborate practical jokes (like putting stacks of money on the streets as a bread crumb trail) and random appearances in public (showing up at a Dollar Store somewhere). Like Martin Shkreli, but not a complete pile of shit"
457,estp,"I'm very, very picky when it comes to films, and I find that most these days really don't hold my attention. The only films I enjoy are well done epics or action/adventure feel good flicks (my go-to film is The Mummy). "
458,estp,"Parks and Rec is very much a feel good comedy. The relationships in that show are unmatched in anything else I've seen. If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor! First season is slow, picks up at Season 2 Episode 2."
459,estp,"Hi fellow Estps,  I wanted to address one of my discoveries here. I recently understood the importance to getting in touch with my Fi. To understand my own emotions, process them properly,  then talk to them with closed ones via Fe (the infamous estp ""inner circle"") 
I would recommend the power of now from eckhart tolle and more specifically letting go by David Hawkins which explains the importance of processing the emotions and letting them go...
That helped me a lot get perspective in my life, stop running for the next shiny thing (enneagram 7 behaviour that reinforced this trait), but just enjoy the moment and saying to yourself that you're all good...
Have you had similar experiences? 
What is your relationship with Fi and your emotions in general?
I'd love to hear more about it! 
Ps: I still have lots of trouble dealing with high Fi behaviour, as I tend to annoy the heck out of them, even when I'm trying xD infp are complicated haha"
460,estp,"That's true. Fi is also about empathy,  nuances in emotions and identity. Construction of your personality etc...
Just saying that we tend to dismiss it quite quickly, obviously because this is our vulnerable function.
It does have value and I believe we can grow if we take it into account in ourselves and in others.
Just a pinch though, too much and it becomes unbearable :("
461,estp,"Well, Fe cares about the harmony, the external fire burning if you will. We want people to feel at ease, to be fine and what not. This is why Fe goes with external factors when it comes to reading emotions. Facial expressions is a big one, as well as expressing verbally how people feel. So we have a proof.
Fi on the other hand focuses on the internal fire. Everything is inward, they show real empathy (if you take the definition of the word) they can truly feel, with great nuances what you feel at the moment, because they might have felt the same at some point in their lives.
Therefore for us Estps to distinguish our Fi, it's almost a meditative state.  Trying to get in tune with the other's ""energy"" as weird as it sounds.  Shutting of our brain and trying to connect to them. It takes a while but it is doable, the big difference with common Fi users though, is that I'm positive we are not capable of understanding the nuances haha
So... With practice we can have this ""connection""  with people, and guess their general state, positive,negative, angry, guilty,  depressed, and all that shit..."
462,estp,"Fe can be about empathy as well - Fe versus Fi is more about the direction in which you express emotion and sentiment.  I believe you can find similar answers (and a lot less struggle) by embracing and accepting your Fe!
Try reading this: Fi versus Ti, Ni, and Fe"
463,estp,"My dad is an ESTP.
I go to the bar with him after work on Fridays, sometimes with co-workers, other times just the two of us.
If it's just us, there tends to be quite a few moments where I have no clue what the fuck to talk about.
~
His go-to topic is work, and we do talk about it quite a bit, but sometimes it feels more like a crutch than genuine bonding conversation.
Also, I try to ask questions, but they don't seem to engage much, like I'm not pushing the right buttons.
Soooo I just want a better idea of what types of conversations are most fulfilling for ESTP, maybe from there I can gather some new topics to bring up, or some new approaches towards our chats."
464,estp,"I like talking about some unconventional stuff. I like arguing with people. Not like fighting. More like convince the other one about my opinion. I'm not sure, if it's good strategy for your father, but that's up to you. "

466,estp,"I met an ESTP online a while back that i hang out with frequently.  He and I both feel like we need to take a long break to re discover ourselves and learn to have fun in life again so we are planning a 2 month adventure.  1 month in US and 1 month in Europe,  camping and backpacking, finding concerts and meeting people.
I just wanted to share this because Im happy i met one of you. Ive never known an Estp before him.  i hope this trip is fun as hell for all involved! It starts in 3.5 months :D"
467,estp,ESTP here. Sounds like an awesome idea honestly. Just don’t stress about doing something every single day as I think part of the experience will (and should) include days of just chilling and taking in the atmosphere. Stressing out about ‘what to do next’ puts a lot of pressure on us because ultimately we just want to see you enjoy yourself too. Have fun!
468,estp,"I’m an INFJ, and my ESTP boyfriend and I are planing a similar thing. Except not in the US. We both did the US before we started dating each other. But definitely Europe! Im excited and excited for you too!"
469,estp,"Hi, ESTP here.
I enjoy all aspects of the INFJ type.  If I did regret anything, it was dropping this INFJ.  She really was amazing.  I loved every second of it.  Yeah, that level of emotional connection was too much.  I walked.  Still sleep like a baby.  Were I to do it again, i'd not make that same mistake.  "
470,estp,"omg yay,  congratulations! i have to ask you something: are you able to ""spill your guts"" to your ESTP? or is there still a small bit of fun teasing/ withholding in the relationship? ive always wondered how estps view that :)"
471,estp,"It's awesome you mentioned this! I have some anxiety and worry very much about making other people bored,  so i'm always trying to do something.  He also told me we will just calm down and relax at camp on some days. That makes me feel better. I will try to not worry so much! "
472,estp,yes haha i am doing any required planning! but i also love his spontaneity and hope to learn.  i have a feeling to make a complete itinerary but we decided to go with his idea: just have a general area in mind and find the exact locations as we go. 
473,estp,"We have both playful and serious moments and I like to think we balance each other perfectly in that sense. He does love to tease me a lot, but he’s my best friend so of course I tell him everything. I recommend you read about duals! I think the infj/estp chemistry is the best thing ever as long as each person listens to the other person and work through differences that are bound that happen. "
474,estp,"Probably because we make our own ""right"" and ""wrong"". So, if the government doesn't agree with us we go to jail. 
I honestly don't believe this to be true anyway. I'm sure that each type tend to commit certain crimes. 
It's possible poverty might have a higher influence than personality type."
475,estp,"Do you think America's massive expenditures on domestic and foreign intelligence is of any use considering it is only demonstrated after the fact of major tragedies, rather than shared with relevant parties?"
476,estp,"You let me go into your mind and understand you. You let me find the places where we are similar even if you are my shadow. Basically, if we know you and not just your ego and we still like you, we'll probably start to trust you... That is if you can be consistent (very important), present, growth encouraging, open minded, and listening... Seriously though, time... Everything takes time with us. "
477,estp,I always get ESTP each time but I have a low E. Like in the ten percent range or lower. I took the 16 personality test which is very accurate multiple times. So should I call myself an ISTP? Even though I wouldn't say I'm most introverted because I don't get drained from social interactions however I'm a loner since I just never cared about making friends and dealing with the whole process of it. 
478,estp,"I've heard our type described as: ""He who runs fastest runs alone."" Social interaction is interesting and stimulating, but we do not require friendships as others might. With the ESTP charm and ability to make others feel comfortable very quickly, anyone can be made into a ""friend"" in a social setting, but that doesn't mean we will make the effort to maintain the friendship. Most people are only interesting for a short amount of time, then the game is over and it's on to the next person. "
479,estp,"I'm an ESTP and I have pretty much the same attitude. I dont avoid people or consider myself a loner, but I just dont care enough to put much effort into making friends or pursuing women, so most relations are sparked by someone else kind of making me hang out with them at first."
480,estp,"I am also curious if you put value in friendships/relationships based on how long they've lasted, and all that you've been through together.
I'm an ISFJ, so I understand being wired a bit differently due to dominant Introverted Sensing;; I greatly admire Se and its users whom enjoy all life has to offer and never appears to break a sweat! Someone who I look up to most in the world is an ESTP. I could spend forever getting caught up in the past and countless moments where I felt happy together. I'm curious if ESTPs ever find themselves thinking back on things, or maybe it's only when somthing is brought up? Sorry if my question is confusing or is in any way offensive;;"
481,estp,"I guess so, but only if there’s a trigger/if it’s brought up. Perhaps a photo, a certain scent or experience can bring me back to pivotal moments of the past, but I don’t think I would necessarily just sit there and reminisce about the past or feel nostalgic. 
For me, I place value on friendships and relationships on the role a person plays in my life, eg. Who will be the strongest pillars of support when I’m going through shit. The length of the relationship won’t matter, but the things we’ve been through would strengthen their role in my life. "
482,estp,"Not really. I don’t really like looking back, personally, as there’s no use to it. Nostalgia is a little different as I enjoy playing “old” games, watching “old” movies. Especially as you can see how the world changed from 15 years ago.
But personally, I hate to reminisce, or “crying over spilt milk”."
483,estp,"I sometimes feel nostalgic or reminisce about things, but the past is just the past and it’s never coming back. I live in the present and look forward to the future. 
I also don’t put much value into length of time I’ve been friends with someone. What I value most is authenticity, loyalty, and trust. If you break those 3 things, then I’ll do what has to be done. I recently cut off someone who’s been one of my closest friends for 22 years. The person was also an alcoholic, addict, and catalyst holding me back.. but you get the point. 
I guess you could say I take a more cold blooded/realistic approach to life, but I see everything as a moment of time. Friendships, relationships, items, etc. They’ll all be there for a certain amount of time, just some longer than others. "
484,estp,Usually when I'm on defense Ill start to look back to better or worse experiences in the past but it depends on the specifics of the situation I'm in but its not something that is particularly enjoyable or healthy for me
485,estp,"Yes I do, but not because I want to.
​
I had one friend who I knew for about 8 months, and we ended so abruptly. She comes up in my dreams, the other day I imagined she shouted out my name, songs she showed me play n I think of her, and when I see her, my mind wonders what her life is like now.
​
I dont let her faze me too much tho, i know what's done is done and better is coming. all i can do is appreciate the past now:)"
486,estp,"Ooh I'm always very curious, wondering how ESTPs may come to feel their emotions, what that experience must be like for them or if it may just be a bit uncomfortable;; I understand that Extroverted Feeling is a bit lower in the stack, but don't mean at all to continue pushing a negative stereotype or the wrong idea! We are all just human after all.
If you wouldn't mind, may I ask about this kind of topic? Although if it's at all something you don't wish to share or expand, I appreciate your initial response and hope I didn't in any way offend, and am terribly sorry if I did so happen to;;;;"
487,estp,"My goodness, this is exactly what my ESTP friend is like whenever I pop into town! It's just so curious for me to think about, because he always started the conversations, talking about something from the past or ""Remember when...?"" And it made me wonder if he spends time like I do thinking about these sorts of things, but when reading through most of these responses, I'm just realizing it's more likely that I'm just the trigger for it;; 
Personally, my personality is just deeply rooted in ""the simpler times""; it's something that makes me very fond of Extroverted Sensing, because I can become too blue when I reminisce too much, start missing a lot of things;; Se is so wonderful at creating new memories and moments to be happy about, in helping me realize that feeling is never lost. I wish I had more of you in my life, I love the feeling being around this personality type gives me, and the way you are, they way you make me feel good about myself and driven to do more, get out of my shell.
I hope you find yourself with your friends time and time again! I believe there's nothing better in this world than the connections we all make, the hearts we touch and good moments we get to share with one another. ☺"
488,estp,"Thank you for the detailed response and answering all my questions, I very much appreciate it! ☺
When creating this post, I was beginning to wonder more about if my close ESTP friend likes to daydream about memories just as I do, or what our friendship means to him. I worry about distance a lot because I cannot be there for him as much as I'd like to be; in recent years, life has been unforgiving and I've heard of unfortunate things happening for him time and time again;; I wish I knew how I could better give support, even if it's just messaging him out of the blue that he's on my mind and I hope he has a great weekend.
It is odd for me to think about, that when we do see each other those rare moments now, he's the one to bring up a bunch of past memories, so I was very curious how often this happens for ESTPs because I always thought it was more of an Introverted Sensing trait! Maybe my presence is simply just a trigger enough? 
Your insight helps me a lot though to try and better understand, although I know that as people, we are all still different in our own ways and may have our own reasoning or behaviors that will still differ from one ESTP to the next. It still means a lot to me though, thank you. I wish I knew how to portray all the gratitude I have for my friend; sometimes I can be a bit mushy and very open with my feelings, so I hope it's never a weird thing for him as a Thinker;; "
489,estp,"Aah, I know I don't personally know the details of your relationship, but just reading this small bit makes me suddenly feel a bit of sadness; I can understand that kind of feeling. I don't mean to perpetuate the stereotype that ESTPs are constantly looking for the ""next big thing"" or that they have no problem letting something go, but your response did genuinely shock me to read; I wasn't expecting it. 
Would you agree with the saying, ""Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.""? There have been moments with others I have to try and force this idea on myself, or else I could just be blue forever;; Although I don't wish to be inappropriate or ask to you to talk about anything that makes you uncomfortable to feel or share, I'm very sorry if I'm overstepping at all!!
I wish you all the best in your future endeavors, and that you'll bump into someone who will always leave you feeling happy and inspired! ☺"
490,estp,"Very kind words. :) 
When I am on my own I find it to be a very useful intentional practice to find the joy in all things- knowing that it's always there if I look hard enough.  
When I am in a group it seems to come second nature to me to maximize fun + joy for myself and others. Comes with being able to read a room, picking up on non verbal cues, and always having things (in this case old memories) to fall back upon that are guaranteed to evoke good and nostalgic feelings. "
491,estp,"Thanks! Some advice, if you're interested...
I am not good at sitting down and studying for any period of time greater than 15 minutes, and this is a common theme for ESTPs. I set goals for myself to help. 15 more pages and I can get a snack. 5 more pages and I can check reddit. Things like that. I also take lots of little breaks to do push-ups or jump-rope to keep from falling asleep. Good luck to you! Stick with it and it will be work with!"
492,estp,"That exam was a challenge for me because my learning style caters towards a more focused exam that I can study for two days before the test. I bought a set of books and pre-divided the areas I was going to study based on how much time I had left before my exam. I had a notebook at my side so that if there was a topic that either 1) I never learned or 2) I knew I didn't have a firm handle on, I wrote it down. Then in the 2 wks before the exam, I just read through my notebook notes a dozen times, did flashcards for the physics equations, and took some Benadryl to pass out the night before and I was gold! Reading through my shorter notebook of notes was more my learning style, so I still incorporated the way I learn best with a huge, comprehensive, multi-topic exam. Of course I motivated myself to study with treats or lattes too :)
Good luck to you! "
493,estp,"Yo, I'm an ENTP and I have kind of a difficult time with flirting. I'm not afraid to tell a girl that I like her or anything, and women tell me all the time that they find me attractive... I guess my problem comes with closing the deal. I feel like I flirt, the girl starts to like me, but then I just hit this brick wall where it becomes a cycle. How do you guys go about closing the deal with someone? "
494,estp,"Keep it simple, fun, casual.
""Hey! You're cute, Let's a grab a drink!""
Edit: Actually after rereading your post it seems like you're situation is to how to keep the ball rolling? Ask more questions about her, if it feels right initiate playful physical contact or give her a kiss on the cheek."
495,estp,"Any ESTPs relate?
It's like when people tell us specifically NOT to do something (Don't miss a day of class! Don't put your hand on the mouse trap! Don't try to swim in canals!), it's like it's holding us back from actually knowing why we shouldn't do it? 
It almost gives us a rush to go against what people tell us not to do. And when we do it, (and we survive), we say it's not so bad... or if it does backfire hard, we accept/respect the rule and never do it again.  We do know there are absolutely stupid things that you cannot do, but there are things that we think is possible to do, so we see if we can do it.
Like, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of what I'm told not to do, and when I do push the boundaries I  actually learn more than someone simply shaking their finger at me and saying ""No"".
This behavior seems to help us for future things, like assessing levels of risk, also giving us endurance and an optimistic attitude.

496,estp,"For me it's also funny seeing them freak out over little things that don't matter. Like jumping over a wall, teachers yell and scream at me because ""I could get hurt!"" When it's not even ten feet off the ground
People need to chill out sometimes lol"
497,estp,Why not hang out with people or play video games or do literally anything else than post on this sub. Only time I browse reddit is when I’m doing something like waiting on an oil change or sitting in a waiting room...
498,estp,"I'm assuming Etypes just like to be busy. Not idle browsing stuff, but actively doing things. My boyfriend is ESTP and when he's using the computer he's working on a project, answering emails, contacting friends on Facebook messenger or posting for his movie on IG and reddit."
499,estp,"I'm out doing things or talking in person with someone. I find that many subs tend to be refective, which ESTP's either don't feel the point/need to reflect or have nothing to add since we are direct.
When I'm online, its more of a means to an end(of finding information or sharing info) rather that sharing or exploring my opinions.
Even when I search for an answer, once we have 1 answer and comfirm it, I accept it and move on to the next topic.
Moves on to next topic"
500,estp,"There are fewer Extroverted Sensors found on the internet than some other types. The stats on Personality Cafe typology forum showed that INFP was the most common type, was like at 18% so almost 1 in 5 people you bump into there is an INFP, and that was closely followed by other INxx types like INTPs and INFJs. You'll hardly find any ESFJs, ESFPs, ESTPs, and ESTJs on these boards."
501,estp,"Some interesting thoughts in here, here to add mine. A lot of the most active MTBI subs focus on emotions and how they feel about things. As a generality, we ESTPs aren't always good at recognizing how we feel about shit, less have an inclination to talk about it. I personally know how I would typically react to something through actions, but don't know what I would feel. Shit, sometimes I don't find out how I felt about something until weeks after the fact "
502,estp,"I'm a computer science major which is probably the worst choice for an ESTP so I'm always on the computer at school or when I'm interning, and when I mean work I mean browsing Reddit while trying to look busy."
503,estp,I'm kind of a computer nerd but I definitely try to have an active life and I'm not the stereotypical gamer persona. My friends tend to be very busy around this time of year so I'm more likely to spend time alone on Reddit when I'm free.
504,estp,"Agreed. There was a few times I wanted to post a new thread on this sub, but didnt find anything important enough to talk about and I suck at asking questions. I dont know what I dont know, so I have no clue what to ask sometimes."
505,estp,"I mostly watch cat videos and browse other subs for things I'm interested in like sports teams, locations, or video games. I should be learning, but I don't do much learning. Probably 5% learning (Stack Overflow or online courses and programming) and 95% wasting time."
506,estp,"Hm. Very interesting. His browsing usually consists of his interests. The Simpsons, film making, and documentaries about anything and everything. I think I've only ever seen him idly looking at stuff for no more than 15 minutes. He listens to documentaries while he's working. I've never seen a more productive human being. It's fascinating to watch him... Like the energizer bunny."
507,estp,"PSA: turkey is delicious with ketchup.  I had never considered mixing the two until last night.  My tongue is still all wonkey this evening from last night so....
Anyways, have a safe holiday tomarrow, and thank you.
It isn't as delicious as on and slathered all over chewy and well done steak.....but what could be?  Was awesome.  Accompaning crispy or crunchy steak is so so so so good.  
Happy Thanksgiving"
508,estp,Married one and absolutely adore her. Been marry to her for almost 10 years and don't regret it at all. She is very silly and loving and makes me think of things differently than I would have had. She has made me a little more open-minded about things that don't have hard facts attached to them. If you have anymore questions you would like to ask me feel free to ask.
509,estp,"I posted this in the ENTP thread not long ago. I'll re-post it here for you.
I recently had a rather negative experience with an INFP girl. Very privileged upbringing. Only child. She was ""caged"" by her parents as she described it. International student new to the US. Extremely fascinated by the depth of her own Fi. Highly self-absorbed. Definitely very entitled and a tad narcissistic. Basically she used me as a sounding board because I'm a pretty receptive guy. Our conversations were 90% about her: her feelings, struggles, aspirations, etc. Maybe only 10% was about me or topics of mutual interest. I should have put a stop to it earlier, but I thought to myself that INFPs were very sensitive creatures and setting her straight would have caused too much damage. I drove her around to a few places and did some nice things for her over the course of a few weeks. Never once did I get a ""thank you"" for my efforts. I actually had to remind her to say that. Turns out I'm the one who got hurt. She was just using me as a blank canvas. The conversations we had were her art. She didn't care about me as a person at all; the respect wasn't there. So I cut all ties with her. I think it's for the best.
I have concluded from this experience that INFPs absolutely must, must, must have a creative outlet and/or be of service to others. Otherwise the Fi builds up this incredible reservoir of feeling that completely crowds out everything else, including space for other people and even empathy itself. Seems hard to believe that a dominant feeler could lack empathy, but actually they're no more or less empathetic than thinkers as it turns out. Kind of like how ENTPs go antisocial if they don't have enough stimulation or variety or aren't taking in new information and letting their Ne roam free, INFPs without an artistic outlet ultimately become self-absorbed, uncaring, manipulative, and tyrannical, not to mention the usual inferior Te of maintaining false beliefs in the face of contradictory facts and evidence.
For the record, she took the MBTI and always got either INFP or INFJ, but I had her take another type test and we ended up figuring out she was an Fi dominant. We looked at this video together. She identified very strongly with Andrew Garfield and stated emphatically, ""fuck Carey Mulligan."""
510,estp,"Absolutely excellent. Above all the competition. Way more intelligent than ESTPs, however difficult that is. Sexy as anything. Just, all round most excellent.
Oh sorry...you wanted ESTPs to comment...
xD
(hi btw ;P)"
511,estp,"I have an INFP sister as well as numerous INFP friends. My INFP connections always show me cool new music and TV shows, they are very authentic and loyal when they decided that you are worthy of their friendship.
It's kinda annoying when I'll try to get you guys to actually do something rather than talk about things and idea's tho. We will definitely try to make enjoy things that seem thrilling to us,  and completely stupid to you.
To conclude, you guys are pretty cool, and it's really fun to stress you out by doing something we shouldn't.
Sincerely, a narcissistic ESTP."
512,estp,"This is very close to an INFP girl I know, including only child and international student, as well as being wholly absorbed by her Fi (she is the Fi subtype: Fi-INFP, the Ne subtype is somewhat different). Very entitled, ignores people when they don't fall into her internal relationship framework, I could imagine her stepping over someone if they collapsed on the floor. Very tight framework of feeling that left no room to actual feeling and empathy. 
It's interesting that Carl Jung himself has written about this phenomenon whereas Fi looses all empathy, consideration, and feeling. Most people wouldn't suspect this of an IxFP.
""It [Fi] is sensed as a sort of stifling or oppressive feeling which holds the immediate circle under a spell. It gives a woman of this type a certain mysterious power that may prove terribly fascinating to the extraverted man, for it touches his unconscious. This power is derived from the deeply felt, unconscious images; consciousness, however, readily refers it to the ego, whereupon the influence becomes debased into personal tyranny. But, wherever the unconscious subject is identified with the ego, the mysterious power of the intensive feeling is also transformed into banal and arrogant ambition, vanity, and petty tyranny. This produces a type of woman most regrettably distinguished by her unscrupulous ambition and mischievous cruelty. But this change in the picture leads also to neurosis.""
""[Fi] Consciousness begins to feel 'what others think'. Naturally, others are thinking, all sorts of baseness, scheming evil, and contriving all sorts of plots, secret intrigues, etc. To prevent this, the subject must also begin to carry out preventive intrigues, to suspect and sound others, to make subtle combinations. Assailed by rumours, he must make convulsive efforts to convert, if possible, a threatened inferiority into a superiority. Innumerable secret rivalries develop, and in these embittered struggles not only will no base or evil means be disdained, but even virtues will be misused and tampered with in order to play the trump card. Such a development must lead to exhaustion. The form of neurosis is neurasthenic rather than hysterical; in the case of women we often find severe collateral physical states, as for instance anæmia and its sequelæ."""
513,estp,"My cousin decided to play match maker with us and got her to call me, I was busy at the time and couldn't call her. We talked for about a week on the phone before we met but I was already quite fond of her. Keep in mind that this was when we were in our teens, we are both in our 30's now, and was also before smart phones. When we met for the first time, at a park with a pizza pro pizza for date food, she said ""so what do you think"" and I said the first thing that came to my mind ""I love you"". I'm sure you can image that she was taken aback but she was only taken aback because she didn't think I would feel the same about her as she did with me so soon. Anywho, that's a rough draft of how we met. If you have anymore questions send them my way, would be happy to help."
514,estp,"I think INFP. I'll never know now since she refuses to speak with me, and I with her. :) 
See this:
http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2012/10/bob-dylan-isfp-or-infp/
She was very, very talkative. And eloquent. And good with language."
515,estp,"I would disagree. Level of talkativeness you are right is not indicative necessarily, but it's the kind of words they use and how they speak that differentiates. If you read that article I linked to, I think you'll be convinced. I've observed the same pattern in my ESFP mother. Loves to talk, but it's small talk. Loves language, but it's poetry that draws her. Loves hands-on painting, sculpting, drawing, and building models, but words are just used as an adjunct to those creations if at all. That's the Se-Fi. ISFP is just a short leap away to Fi-Se. It's the difference between the poet and the novelist. I don't think ISFPs enjoy verbalizing and ""weaving"" their ruminations into stories quite as much as INFPs do. But yeah...they can be talkative too I'm sure, just not in the same way. Thanks for the alternative suggestion."
516,estp,"Is it only me, or fellow ESTPs, but I tend to 

mess with serious types to make them laugh or smile, makes me happy when they end up smiling 
like to turn serious things into funny things (ex: laughed at a NIN track my friend made me listen to, because it sounded soooo moody/edgy that I find it stupid [The track was Closer by NIN])
tend to enjoy dark humor/ juvenile humor / ironic humor

People we don't go well with are people who are easily butthurt/take things seriously. As much as we try to explain ourselves and why we can't take certain things seriously, and why they shouldn't, they don't understand it? (I hear about ESTPs forcing things on other people, idk if you relate)
type stuff if you relate"
517,estp,"I can’t take anything seriously. I mean I can, but also I know that worse case I can just bugger off to the arse end of nowhere and live as a hermit. Kinda hard to take anything seriously when you don’t really give a shit. "
518,estp,"the ESTP store
Everywhere that people in general are (obviously), but places you'd find us more likely around include but are not limited to:


any job or jobsite where you are physically involved/work with your hands


sporting events and/or the gym


activities that are dynamic in some form or fashion like outdoorsy things or music


social environments


business related venture


the military


etc"
519,estp,"You'd also be surprised (given the stereotypes) as to how many you'll find in science and tech fields. It's not a huge proportion, but certainly more than the general population (thanks to Ti). So that could be another place to look."
520,estp,"Rarely will you find them in engineering. But boy when you do... you dun found yourself a gem. Just the way they bulldoze the awkward social settings, it brings me happiness. Wish there were more of my kind here"
521,estp,"ESTPs are pilots and police officers, some are into adrenaline/dynamic activities, and also they are highly represented in math and engineering fields. In business they prefer project-type ventures. They can be master illusionists, musicians or artisans. They can also be found in the military, and in sports that are technical rather than only physical. "
522,estp,"I actually think techies in film sets tend to more introverted. ESTP's are story-people oriented (Fe), so it makes sense to want to work with actors. Filmmaking is tough but can be glamorous (red carpet) which attracts extroverts in general haha. For example my crew:
Director - ESTP
Producer - ESTJ
Writer/Art director - ESFJ
Cinematographer - ISTJ
Gaffer - INTP? idk
Costumes - ESTJ"
523,estp,Wow. See I'm an INFP and want to be a film maker some day. Mainly because of my love for film and stories in general. I write a lot so that's probably why. I would definitely see ESTPs being great film makers. You have to be a leader. Which will be hard for me. Better try and get my ESTJ side out lol. 
524,estp,"Writers don't really take the lead, mine was also an art director! If you are just a writer then you just write the story. Producers are good as ESTJ's because they need to manage everyone.
I'm not a deep person, so this ESTP definitely thinks N's are better at stories lol"
525,estp,"Yeah I get that ESTJ producer thing. The thing with me is that I also have a lot of vision of how it should be shot, how the actors should be directed. It's a huge team effort so I've got to learn a lot. I think also just wanting to make sure that every thing goes perfectly to what the story needs. "
526,estp,"I think this will be a long story... but it’s mostly a rant. Throwaway account. The beginning is introductory. I’m sure I can make my story shorter, but still.
I’m 28, and about 7 months I had to do a mandatory professional personality test for work. They wanted to see what my strengths and weaknesses for the company were. At the time I was sliding towards a bore-out(burn out symptoms, but that’s because I was bored and stressed). I was working from home and moved to a completely different city on the other side of the country with no real close friends here.
I learned I had an ESTP personality. Before this I considered those tests bullshit. Funny internet gimmicks to get my money. But with the professional we went more into: “What work would suit you? What gives you energy” and I started to recognise more and more.
All those talks were work-related, but I started to recognise more and more traits in my personal life. I am social, open, enthusiastic and.. let’s call it intense. I can imagine I am the type certain introverts find draining. However, everything developed into a complete bore-out, lost my job because of it... and now I find myself wanting to say yes to all my impulses.
There are certain problems I do find with my personality. Sexually I am basically up for anything, as long as I am not the sub. However, that part also got me in trouble a couple of times. I need to experience it all. Met a cute girl on the other side of the world... LDR wouldn’t work out, but I still wanted to visit her to stay in her bed and leave... It’s so stupid, but I am -that- impulsive and have this hang for adventure.
I need people around me, but mostly people I can do real stupid shit with. I regret it every morning, but I have trouble saying no. I should learn how to, but every time I say: “That’s a problem for tomorrow”.
I feel I have no good way of releasing all my energy... so I turn to love, lust and booze. The whole selfdestructive shenanigans. How do you all channel the whole extraverted need for adventure?(I was told this fits the personality).
TL;DR: I recently got sick of stress and boredom and now find myself needing more adventure than I know is good for me."
527,estp,"jk I already figured it out I just want this subreddit to be more active :(
I do have like a thousand questions for you guys though but in consideration of your built-in ADHD: What keeps you in a relationship? You know, the things that makes it worth sticking around for, keeps you interested, etc."
528,estp,"I date an ENFP. I think we balance each other. He understand people and I can learn from him.
I like to date someone who can teach me new things, and that I can explain things too as well. My bf and I are always having discussions about all sorts of things, politics, science, pop culture, sociology, etc.
Be patient if the ESTP you love starts to ramble, if you ask them how their day was expect details.
Include some detail if they ask you how your day was.
It makes me a little crazy my bf says ""work was good"" or ""work was work - nothing happened."" I on the other hand give a blow by blow of atleast 3 events that happened at work including but not limited to personality types of fellow employees, analysis, and what I learned from the situation. "
529,estp,"Keep us engaged. Don't just let us do our own thing. I like to cuddle with my SO, so that's good to do. We do enjoy physical contact, and we're very in the moment. We're not planners, its a step-as-we-go kinda thing."
530,estp,"Be open to a change of plans.
Last night after dinner we walked to walgreens, while in walgreens I decided I wanted to go to the health food store. At the health store I decided my purchase was too expensive and we should go to target instead."
531,estp,"My ENFP is the messiest person on the planet actually, I'm the organized one, only because I'm becoming a minimalist. If I had more stuff I'd be messy too. I also have ADHD so I don't know why he's messy. 
Funny we are both diagnosed with ADHD. our ES create outward functions that make us seem easily distracted and with our thinking being internal we don't always seem like there is a lot going on. Couple that with a perceiving function of not always following the rules or making up new ones and it could strengthen the ADHD diagnosis. I'm not sure that I think that ADHD is real no one would guess that I have it now. "
532,estp,"That's funny, I am definitely messy, but he is MUCH worse. I think he genuinely has ADHD. Without meds, he cannot manage money at all, he's awful at handling responsibilities, etc etc. Maybe the ESTP type just exacerbates it. 
Thanks for some insight! "
533,estp,"This. In my early twenties and suddenly feel as if I’m really living my life. Used to feel suppressed by family environment and depression, but now I have the liberty to do whatever I want and build my career. Also became more willing than ever to experience and learn new things in life. Social skills improved leaps and bounds too."
534,estp,"About 18 or 19 I was like ""I really am the only one gunning for me, nobody else cares about my life or will do shit for me other than myself."" 
So yeah I got you there. That's why I feel like I (we?) are inherently selfish, because nobody else is gonna do it for us so we take our lives upon ourselves. That's where the leadership and social skills come in as well, everyone and everything is a potential tool"
535,estp,"Annnnd I’ve accepted I’m an ESTP,  however I do prefer to be alone mostly because people are emotional labor I can’t afford at the moment because I’m busy, however I do like to be around people briefly to recharge and then retreat into my solitude."
536,estp,"Interesting, I have recently heard that because of dominant Se the world can just kind of catch up with you one day. 
Due to Ni being repressed and Dom Se users reacting to the world in an immediate sense, but never really having that drive toward a singular purpose/ goal or fitting what they have seen into a (holistic?) map of concepts during reflective periods.
As an INFJ , how would you describe using Ni? "
537,estp,"How hard it is for you to spend time alone? 
I imagine it can be very difficult since you are extroverts and need a lot of stimulation but maybe I'm wrong?
What kind of things do you like to do when you have to spend some time alone for some reason?"
538,estp,"Alone time forces me to be introspective and to think deeply about one thing or another... because the alternative is boredom. 
If i am alone all those fun things will eventually get kind of stale. I will seek out people. But if i was stranded alone but ""safe"" and thusly bored and fat...
I guess either i would find a way to destract myself or end up doing alot of thinking... not all of that thinking would be positive... i might become moody and dark. Start working on project that dont really mean anything to me because i would have no one to share them with.
My best days would become those where i conquered something... but with out people to brag about it to.... the joy would be short lived. I am not so interested in mastering anything, rather proving that i could if i wanted to.
I know this because I had a tough home life and was forced to become very introverted for years In order to survive. I got depressed... it sucked... i am good now. i can for sure say now that solitude wont kill me, but it will make me a bit crazy. I was tough but it felt like i was dead Everyday And like i wanted to run away buy i couldn't.
I was never so emo that i cut myself.. but i became self-destructive in other ways. I got angry and a bit violent Or intense... even if inside i just wanted to be chill... but how could i be chill when i wanted to scream and beat the shit out of anyone in my way. "
539,estp,"I think that's to much of a generalisation. 
I do prefer to be around others but I'm just as content and comfortable being alone. 
I rank as highly extraverted but I do get tired of certain types of people. Alone can be preferable when the alternative is dull.. "
540,estp,"This is a very accurate description of my situation too. I'm very bad at occupying myself with indoors hobbies, so I started writing my thoughts into a journal. That book is a dark place filled with distrust in everything and everyone. "
541,estp,"I think I missed more days of school than I went and still graduated with high honors. Three fights on school property, we had a fight club in the soccer/wrestling locker room, and dress code was broken on a daily."
542,estp,"

Elementary:
Mom was PTA so I was on a short leash. Skipped school a couple of times. 


Middle school:
Honors classes. Slept through most of the day because of partying/sex the night before. 


High School:
President/Vice president of computer club, played basketball and ran track. We fixed teachers computers which gave us access to write our own hall passes. Talked with our Coach and he convinced the school to assignthe old teacher's lounge as our computer office. Moved in a shit ton of broken computers too. The best part, two private bathrooms. They used them as a storage area so no one ever came into our office. Can't count how many girls I'd taken in there. Such a sweet setup. 


Moved to another school. More college prep and more money. That meant less room to skate. The highlight for this school was me fucking a girlfriend during lunch in a computer lab with a huge TV. Didn't know it at the time but the classroom for connecting schools together. Like a teleconferencing type deal. Apparently the other school didn't appreciate the show we put on. Luckily her dad was a big deal attorney and nothing really happened. "
543,estp,"I went to a private school with a strict dress code. On days following report cards, we would get a ""dress down"" day (basically we could wear jeans) if we had a parent's signature on our report card. 
While this thrilled all of my classmates, I didn't like the idea of this reward system (it felt like giving a rat a piece of cheese for following a maze). Even though I got straight A's, I wouldn't get my parent's signature and would show up to school in full dress code. I would get off to the fact that I wasn't breaking any rules while still sticking it to school that they couldn't control me with rewards. 
TL;DR: I was a very angsty teenager"
544,estp,"Ditched geometry 13 days one semester, then scored the highest score on final exam in the school. Got my teacher to raise my grade from C (due to absences) to B, because clearly I knew my stuff.
And had sex in the school's darkroom (took photography and was editor of school paper one semester).  Good times..."
545,estp,"It's often said that Se-doms are the most extroverted extroverts, and I want to know if this holds true for any of you. Also, does anyone here consider themselves introverts or leaning more on the introverted side of things?"
546,estp,"If you met me in real life you'd probably think I was some INTP or something. I'm very introverted in real life because there are a lot of people I don't bother to talk to, unless they strike my interest or I need something from them. I can be the loudest person in the room if I'm comfortable, but usually I'm not because I like to get the feeling about the people around me first and adjust accordingly. "
547,estp,"I'm an introvert who's good with people. Definitely not extroverted, that's why I often doubt that I might be an ISTP. But all descriptions of ESTP just always seem to fit more for me than ISTP.
So either I'm either an extroverted ISTP or an introverted ESTP. All I know is that I definitely have Fe in 3rd place and Ni in 4th. Still not certain whether I'm a Ti dom or an Se dom.
I've seen quite a few people who are also struggling with deciding if they're ISTP or ESTP. "
548,estp,"“I'm an introvert who's good with people. “
this is actually like the best description ever, but i find myself to be in the same case at you except i think i fit more with ISTP, but there are many things that ring true with ESTP. I actually seem a lot more extroverted when people first meet me, but I retreat and often have to go “recharge my social battery” and spend some time alone. "
549,estp,"Grew up in the countryside, I love it and will do anything to go back
I live in a small city that's very isolated, is very agricultural and country, and it's spread out so it feels very small as well, retains the small town feeling. I love it here
Edit: not really into cities. Visiting is about all I'll do, where I'm at now is absolutely an exception"
550,estp,"It has to be the city. Grew up in the city (though it was technically the suburbs due to weird city borders, it was half an hours walk from the city centre) and went to university there - I couldn't face living anywhere unless there was something new to do."
551,estp,"live: suburbs
favorite place: country OR city
I like the country because of the farms and the fresh food and cool ass farmers markets. Also enough space for me to raise my fish and chickens and hang out with other farmers. Also not many assholes in the country. Con: Isolated, far drive to interesting areas, not much to see.
​
I like the city because I get to shop and visit cool and interesting places. I also get to meet with like-minded business men who are on the forefront of new technology or ventures. Con: traffic/assholes/crackheads"
552,estp,"He had mental breakdown bordering on schizophrenia. Started to believe that God is talking to him, that other people are his mind slaves the other very odd things like this. At that point he closed his YouTube account. I thought he was ISTP rather than ESTP, which is what he typed himself initially when he was active on Personality Cafe. He re-typed into ESTP when he left the military saying it was making him too introverted, but he'd complain about getting tired/wasted after spending time with INFJs which is classical ISTP-INFJ socionics ""activity"" relations. This is his facebook."
553,estp,"Why? The ISTPs I've known have all been about energy conservation; EJArendee was constantly bopping off the walls, much like many an ESTP I've known (Cue Paulie Malignaggi: https://youtu.be/WXtMgoCcOeo )."
554,estp,"It's up, you have to be logged into facebook to follow the link. Some thought he was trolling with the god stuff. But who knows. He seems to be able to take care of himself and continue with his life which isn't what happens to people who go crazy. Or maybe he was putting on an act all this time and then started telling what he really thinks."
555,estp,"Dating an ESTP and I'm having a hard time figuring her out. Sometimes she does something that I can interpret as romantic, but can also be interpreted as simply taking a logical course of action (especially after reading about you guys). She also seems to have a hard time catching on when I express subtle emotions. However she has given me these weird little gifts on occasion.
Anyway, do ESTPs really ever develop deep romantic feelings?
I'm an ENF/TP. So naturally I'm trying to figure you guys out and have feelings of emotional insecurity. Kidding not kidding."
556,estp,"Define ""deep romantic feelings."" :). I don't think I've ever felt that I ""couldn't live without"" someone. 
And I doubt she's not ""catching on"" - she just might not want to encourage your feelings for her that way. The gifts and her attention? That's how you know she's interested in being around you."
557,estp,"Yeah, we do fall in love. We're not emotionally insecure, but are relatively protective and aware of opening up, because being very realistic doesn't allow for the sappy love story and year long of honeymooning.
I've said it before as it's the same for me, however it is she feels, she'll tell you straight up with her words, on her own time"
558,estp,"Sometimes love is the logical course of action. :) If she's with you, then that's where she wants to be. 
You know the thing where people go ""I love you more"" ""no I love you more"" yeah, my husband (INTJ) and I joke that he loves me more, and that I'm possibly a sociopath. Dating I basically tried to mimic his romantic behaviors. "
559,estp,"Define ""deep romantic feelings."" :). I don't think I've ever felt that I ""couldn't live without"" someone. 
And I doubt she's not ""catching on"" - she just might not want to encourage your feelings for her that way. The gifts and her attention? That's how you know she's interested in being around you."
560,estp,"Theres no doubt that ESTPs are quite passionate people, so I could imagine they can develop these kinds of feelings, yeah.
In which way, however, is another question. My experience was... weird. I met an ESTP girl during student exchange, and she kinda flashed me (very likely because Im INTP guy). I liked her from the very first beginning, from the first time I talked to her - she was really unconventional in a way. I knew she had a boyfriend back where she came from though, so I knew that wouldnt work out. We just kept spending time together because we both had a very strange sense of humor, and Id describe myself as unconventional as well. I fell for her, I even noticed it, right after the first day we spent in town. The worst thing probably was that she played shed marry me to be able to stay. Another bad thing was she was touchy- so touchy actually that all my friends and even all the girls of my class kept thinking we had something together, even though it didnt ever go beyond one slight kiss. Id just be like ""girl, what are you doing?"", but thats probably down to the fact I live in Germany.
Even though Im sure she didnt fell in love with me, I know she liked me, as she told me very personal things about herself. We told each other wed stay in contact as friends.
Then she got back, and two days there, she told me she broke up with her boyfriend (shed been with him for months). I didnt know what to write, I tried something consoling. 
Right the next day, she told me she had a new one, about five years older than her (we were both 15). I felt betrayed, not because of that, but because she kept sending me pics with him in bed, while knowing I still had feelings for her. Obviously it was fun to her, so I stopped answering. I asked a few people, and many had similar experiences.
(Btw I also know she loved her family while showing everyone around her akward pics of her dad and claimed she hated her mom. Im a bit that way, but she went further than I ever would). 
After all? Yes, I think ESTPs can have deep romantic feelings, but as they dont care so much about what other people think, their crush will switch person as soon as they get bored. 
Excuse my English, please."
561,estp,"Like, NF feelings of soulmated-ness. Total obsession with and commitment toward another person. 
Not to say I'm that way, but I'm certainly closer to that on the spectrum."
562,estp,"Yeah...not gonna happen with me. Soul-mates? Total commitment? Nope. Not my thing. I'm plenty affectionate, romantic, etc. But under it all is the realization that if my partner died/left/whatever, I'm sure I'd find another one in fairly short order."
563,estp,"As an ESTP can I love someone who I will want to spend the rest of my life with? Yes. Do I feel like they are my soul-mate and will I feel like I can't live without them? No..
While I'l love someone and not want to lose them, my logical side seems to ""know"" that there will always be another person out there that will be compatible with myself."
564,estp,"Okay. I'm kind of coming to terms with my being ENTP instead of ENFP like I've always been told. And I might actually be more suited for that kind of relationship. 
Sounds very laid back and less emotionally draining than my previous relationships.
All I know is that we have really great no-fucks-given banter and never really demand anything of each other. It's bizarrely different for me but I think I'm kind of into it."
565,estp,"I'm more big picture oriented and put a lot of value into what I say, as it's my love language pretty much as opposed to anything else. So for me, relationships are partially effort to make sure everything is ok, but for the most part I'm just like.. ""Ok, she doesn't hate me yet and hasn't brought any issues up, I still like her and have no issues, I've told her how I feel.""
It's essentially like maintaining a status quo. Very laid back for sure"
566,estp,"I'm an INFP looking to ""create"" a gift for my ESTP husband (I'm poor lol). For his birthday, I wrote him a short story where he basically woke up on his own time, started a fire, drank coffee, and left his snowy cabin in the woods to go out and test survival equipment with friends. He loved that and he's not a big reader. He had me read it to him, which he generally likes better. 
I'm looking to do something similar--either another story or some kind of craft. I made him a blanket when he was on deployment in 2016,  which he loves. He's home this Christmas thankfully so I'd like to give him something meaningful despite limited funds. Do ESTPs generally like meaningful gifts? So many forums say the opposite. 
I know ESTPs typically like experiences too. But where to go for free in the cold? 
I also have a general curiosity about the relationship between ESTPs and gifts:
He's seemed to like the more craft-centered things I've done that speak more to his specific likes than things I thought he would find useful and like more. Ive asked about practical gifts before (like knives/coffee makers for the field/etc.) but he's very particular on the brand/type of whatever the object is. Particular to the point he can come off very mean when the gift isn't to his liking. He also hates giftcards that have only enough money to be used for one meal or at places he rarely goes to. He has said he would rather get nothing from someone rather than a ""stupid gift"" even though some of these gifts should, in theory, fit what he likes. It's strange to me, but his particularness makes me highly aware that my choices for him are often ""wrong."" Is this common among ESTPs? 
Thoughts?"
567,estp,"Hello, ESTP male here dating an INFP female. She bought me a very nice bottle opener with the coordinates of our first date and a little heart. Stays on my keys and goes with me wherever I go.. practical and meaningful — can’t go wrong with that !! I generally prefer receiving practical gifts, so if one can get me something practical with meaning attached to it, they win :)"
568,estp,"Hey! ESFP here.
Went on a great date with ESTP, wine tasting, bar, fast forward to great sex. Texted all day last Friday, met up on Saturday at mine, watched movie , more fun sex. He mentioned making plans for another activity : swimming and dinner, once he's back from oot. 
Its been a week and haven't heard from him- should I reach out and what to say? Something playful? 
I really like this guy, but I know estps generally like their space and don't get emotionalally involved very quickly etc. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I mean I realize this could be done on his end, and don't want to come off poorly. 
Thanks! "
569,estp,"There are two options. Either you do nothing and trust that he is indeed making plans to get together. If he reaches out to you, then good. But if not, then keep the attitude of 'someone who doesn't reach out to me doesn't deserve me'.  
Or you send him 1 short text to ask how he is doing or something playful, but do not mention anything about meeting up. He must bring it up himself whether it is immidiatly or after a few days. That way you can have some kind of feeling how much he likes you. If he doesn't make plans soon after you reach out, then I don't think you are his 'top priority' "
570,estp,"This is what I've been focusing my energy on lately. Got a chance to meet Starset in Colorado, when I first saw Dustin, i lit up and he said ""you made it"" and shoke my hand. nothing like meeting someone who already knows you, but only communicated through dreams in space and time.

571,estp,"Would you want to know if your romantic interest was reciprocated, even if a relationship was nigh impossible in the short term?
Context: ESTP (Enneagram 8) x me - mutual interest, and flirting (sort of - more like extra attention/kindness/respect and protectiveness from him and awkwardness from me) but never openly acknowledged; he moved to a different state and we didn't communicate for a year and a half -we didn't know each other very well, mostly just had mutual friends. I thought it'd be dead by the time he came back to visit, but he still seemed interested, only I didn't see the point in reciprocating since he'd be going back to his new state. I was rather put on the spot when he visited though and having thought it through I wonder about his intentions since he did seem to have interest in an actual relationship (not just flirting for the sake of it), but he pursued me both times in full knowledge that he was moving. I do want the relationship to happen, but I don't see how it'd be feasible, for at least another few years if he moves back after college. I don't want a long-distance relationship when I haven't been able to get to know him irl beforehand, we seem so different I think we'd need that basis.
SO the point being, is it a good idea to tell him straight up that I like him even though a relationship would be logistically difficult at best? Do you ESTPs like to know stuff like that, or does it seem manipulative (it's not meant to be, I'd just like to get it off my chest, and if he /is/ really keen it might be good for both of us)? Is it too late? :P"
572,estp,"since you guys have se doesnt that mean meditation comes easily to you guys?,since se is all about being one with the moment?whats your experinces of this?,and does living in the moment make you happier?"
573,estp,The present can still get to u i mean something happening in the moment that isn't cool can make us unhappy. Like damn I was looking forward to going to a water park today and it started raining! fuckkk! I was so in the mood for that.. Or damn I really wanted to go to chik fil a and it's a fucking sunday!! shit! lmao 
574,estp,"I would have to agree here, and elaborate further by saying that this would depend on several factors including how the person grew up, as in /u/FuckTheSooners case, and what mental illness a person might have. It's important to remember that the mbti has nothing to do with what a person can and can't do and everything to do with how they first think of any given situation, we ESTPs, for example, will always enter a situation finding the most straightforward way to deal with it and not let feelings get invovled, whereas an ESFJ would find a way to solve the same situation that everyone is comfortable with and stay within the confines of the rules/laws.
Now to answer your question, I'm not that good at meditation because it annoyes me to sit down for too long with nothing to do but have a  clear mind. I start to think of all the things going on in my life or things I could be doing instead of sitting there.  
Edit: damn autocorrect"
575,estp,"Good addition. 
For your second paragraph, ironically, I find a way to make it stimulating at least to me. If you're familiar with the chakras, I picture each one as a violent whirlwind of color, usually a deep red and black that emits its own light, and it's floating in a dark contained area like a room. I focus on clearing and calming that storm as I clear my mind, pushing it to a calm and wispy opaque white cloud
I love weather and nature as a trait of growing up in the country, so I find it fascinating to ""watch"" and the colors are beautiful, and it's cool to have an effect on it. That's how I do it, it keeps me interested without ever having to leave my mind, and probably the only time I ever spend any time committing that much energy to my mind "
576,estp,"Good thread. 
In the winter without a BBQ, I like the reverse sear: get thick steak (any good cut will do) season with salt, cook in oven on low (225F) until internal temp is 110F (~blue rare). 
Take out, pat dry, sear on extremely hot cast iron for about a minute each side to get a nice rare steak
You'll need a thermometer for this. I think it tastes better than sous vide or at least its easier"
577,estp,"I like it medium rare to rare with only salt. 
But I’m reading more about the environmental impacts that agriculture has and I’m considering removing meat from my diet, which sounds kinda insane to me. "
578,estp,"Just a suggestion, but look into Michael Pollan's book, 'The Omnivore's Dilema', it explores a general history of food, including modern farming and how messed up it all is. It's a really informative and eye opening book."
579,estp,You're welcome :D don't forget to lightly oil the cast iron. Season the steak with garlic powder and pepper if you don't mind a bit of burnt seasoning. You can also experiment with butter like the other guy said 
580,estp,"either or. Depends on how do you want your meat.
Want it with a nice caramelized crust to have a contrast of flavor? While cooking. This is best when the meat is the main attraction of the plate. You can mix it with some steamed veggies, a couple of small potatoes and maybe a broth depending on the weather.
If you do it as a marinade then i'd recommend you throw more stuff to the mix like a bit of sriracha and mustard. This is best when you are going to mix it with a fresh plain salad"
581,estp,"I generally am in a very good mood after I get new stuff like a new car / bike I love very much or even a phone or even small things I like. I feel they energize me and motivate me and I get super charged about life. 
I am a minimalist but I  am not entirely and think that sort of  life doesn't  suits me too. 
I am guessing this has to do with my Se mainly and it's need for new sensations as I get bored after I experience something for a while and need new things to experience to get charged . 
What are your thoughts on this ? "
582,estp,"Man, it seems nice to read this since I feel the same way and I’ve been hard on myself thinking that I’m a materialistic a-hole!
Nothing motivates me to study more than a new pen or a new notebook. Do I feel as if I’ve been slacking off from working out? I’ll just buy a new pair of gym shorts then I’m good to go. 
Of course I don’t constantly buy new things for motivation reasons but every now and then I need this kind of “stimulant” for my brain."
583,estp,I was hanging out with an intj friend and my isfp gf a lot for the past few years. Fuckers turned me into someone who is extremely minimalistic and I stopped wanting new things wondering how those two were happy even without anything new to stimulate them no wonder I was depressed as fuck all those years. 
584,estp,"Eh, ESTPs just aren't really the types for online social interaction it seems. I'm INTJ and of all my friends who are either not on fb at all, or who have profiles that they never use, I'd say like 95% of them are ESTP. And like 95% of the remaining 5% are SPs of some sort. They just don't seem to care overall."
585,estp,"exactly. 
lol is it that hard to figure out that someone who is a very social extravert that likes to be in the present doing high energy activities isn't going to want to spend time staring at a screen trying to carry on conversations with someone they can't look at in person while talking about inane abstract things? 
the only other place that might be more dead than an estp subreddit would be an estj subreddit"
586,estp,"Just trying to get some conversation started with my fellow ESTPs! What impressions do you get from other ExxPs and why?
ESFP: I jive with them well in social settings but can get impatient when they show a Feeling preference over what I assume is straightforward logic. I think it's mainly a difference between our Aux functions, my Ti picks up on their Fi and doesn't approve of how they arrive at their decisions. 
ENFP: Similar story. Fun to be around but I can tell when they're being manipulative, to me or to others. This rubs me the wrong way, probably because I'm capable of doing the same thing and don't like to see others doing it. Once again, their reliance on Fi can rub me the wrong way.
ENTP: Compared to the other two I get along with ENTPs the best, probably because of our matching Ti functions. I can appreciate how rational and logical they are as well as how adaptable they are in different situations. "
587,estp,"Thoughts ^(feelings) of an INFP -Fi dom ALLLLLL the Feels fuck logic
ESTP-Se dom. The right hand of the ESTJ CEO and infinitely more likable than the CEO. The ISTP is the ""cool kid"" who says and does nothing at all but everyone credits with awesomeness. The ESTP actually backs up their perceived coolness with actions and words. Can manipulate people easily like you said.
ESFP- Se dom Range from annoying to ok. Always performing and seeking attention. Generally decent folks but definitely my most innocently despised type. By that I mean their behavior annoys me, but is not harmful usually (looking at you ESTJs and ISTJs; lets all rigidly follow your rules and systems over seen by people with 0 empathy and usually anger issues.) ESFPs supply copious amounts of trivial pleasant interaction which sucks my energy and desire to be around them. 
ENFP- Ne dom. Rainbows, sunshine, and energy drinks. This type is just plain fun to be around. I get along super well with ENFPs because we use all the same functions. I gravitate towards Ns over Ss in general and I am much more entertained by our shared Ne than by Se (ESFP, ESTP). That said, I generally find ESTPs to be the more enjoyable Se user because of using fe. Any type that uses fe I usually get along with. Understand my barrage of fi damnit!
ENTP- Ne dom. Rarest type in my life at least. One word: Smarmy. Just google famous ENTPs smarmy smarmy smarmy. Smarmy and awesome! Take the quiet quips of the INTP and make it a full blown show and you get ENTPs. I like having discussions with ENTPs, INTPs, ENTJs, and somewhat INTJs because of their thinking dominance and the ""logical"" perspective. 
Final thoughts: In order from most liked to least (in general of course it varies by individual) ENFP, ENTP ESTP (tie), ESFP"
588,estp,"Well I just found this sub today and man is it dead. 
What do you do for a living? 
I am a aspiring movie director. I am very good at assigning people to their best position, and am able to know what needs to be done. I see myself as a realist. 
What ESTP qualities help you in your career?"
589,estp,Welcome! I manage a team of engineers and do network designs for large service providers. I have no idea if the estp traits help or undermine my abilities though. I have noticed a lot of stps are engineers though.
590,estp,"I work for a group contracted by the BLM to help with field work (i.e. timber boundaries, river cross-sections, erosion control, and other related odd-jobs that pop up). I absolutely love it. I am always doing something and love going off into the woods and working."
591,estp,"I'm a undergrad (half done 4th year woo!) in Anthropology minoring in Archaeology. I want to go to college next year to do Museum Studies and hopefully become a curator. I feel like being an ESTP helps me understand people and also think critically which is a lot of fun. Kind of like detective work, figuring out why people act or think the way they do :P"
592,estp,"Well, I'm a fulltime student first but my hobbies include DJing, playing percussion, and dance. In terms of studies, I love keeping up with politics. I also consider myself a realist. In leadership positions or when teaching others (part-time teacher), I pride myself on being able to explain things to others clearly. "
593,estp,"Hey guys so I’m sure there have been posts like this but I’d rather discuss right now
What kinds of hobbies do you all have?
What careers are y’all in? 
Do you like it?
Just want to start some dialogue"
594,estp,"I'm an entrepreneur/investor, more an entrepreneur. I am big on the gym & at sex. I also cook some good meals sometimes after the gym or sex. I travel sometimes to go have more sex. And yea man, that's pretty much my life."
595,estp,"Well, I absolutely hate sports (except for alpine skiing which I instead absolutely love). But I do like just being outside; talking walks, hanging out with friends... like most people, I guess. More specific hobbies are travelling, dancing, flower growing and linguistics. 
Working as a teacher part-time, also currently studying to become a teacher in history and in my native language. I guess I like it, but I've been doubting if this is what I want to be doing for the rest of my life..."
596,estp,"So I’ll start
I love sports but I feel like that is the obvious one
I desire heavily to be a coach and have a positive affect on people’s lives. 
For a career... yeah idk yet guys. I thought I wanted to be a PE teacher but now I’m leaning more towards being a realtor. I just don’t know anymore haha"
597,estp,"I am in Grad School and work as an educator in a Museum. I am a licensed teacher for high school history, and love history and teaching! I taught for a year abroad (london), before going back home (us) to get my masters in History (focus of applied history- museum studies).
I am always putting my neck out there for things I think should be done, even though I am ""punching above my weight"" a lot at work. I love teaching and find a lot of joy from helping others, young or old, discover or learn something new. I do find myself as a catalyst for a lot of goings on at work, but I always follow through on projects and get them done. I submitted 3 proposals for projects this year, and despite my boss and higher ups saying they would not get approved, I made sure they did. Not malicious or anything, just constant follow up, acquiesced to frequent requests and got it done. Blew everyone away, I shrugged my shoulders and asked why no one else works this hard. I love my potential career, as the position I am in right now I am an intern, I constantly make sure I am working on a publication, conference, proposal, project, or lesson for my work and my future career. 
A lot of my hobbies are handicrafts, i like to spin yarn, knit, do needle point or counted cross stitch. I also enjoy the outdoors, I like to fish, grow veggies and fruit. I enjoy traveling, but being in an LDR for the past 6 years has put a damper on travel as I need to travel rather than want to travel. But I do like to explore new places.  I also like to play video games, Fallout, Sims, guitar hero, RDR2, sometimes mario games but rarely play them after I beat them once. I just found out about this subreddit, and now I feel like I will spend a lot of time here.
Edit: added some stuff"

611,estp,"Reasonably interested, and lean libertarian (well more like liberal, but in the UK sense not the US). I'd be interested to know why ESTPs tend to be like that.

620,estp,"Small handwriting and like a typewriter, I guess. I've always been told that I have great penmanship. I also always have to correct people when they think I haven't signed or filled in a form until I point out my handwriting."
621,estp,Traveling alone to different countries. I went on two separate last minute trips to Chile and Japan by myself and had so much fun meeting new people and partying. Can't wait to choose where to go on my next trip!
622,estp,"For me would be storming the court (College Basketball) after my school beat the #3 team in the nation earlier this season. Was able to share the moment with my SO and tons of friends. 
Or skydiving."
623,estp,"I'm a CS major but I've taken quite a few EE classes (I'm more of a CE major really). I like EE a lot, sometimes I wish I had just gone into it. I find it more challenging than CS, but CS may just come more naturally to me because I'm a big math guy. "
624,estp,"Hello! I recently posted a survey you might find interesting. It would really help me out if you would participate!

625,estp,Anyone else get the sinking feeling that the entire world isn't right rn and not necessarily fubar but with a general lack of direction and the current state is sort of unacceptable and needs to be saved..
626,estp,"I think it's just always like that. Like really, when was it ever not fucked up? It can only be fucked up because people think it is. So, I'm not sure how wise it is to want to ""save"" the world. Just make the most of it, ya know?"
627,estp,"I’m INFP (F), don’t know if that means much. But given our functions are different, I’m guessing the way I’d interpret it, would be different from him. 
So the other day I met this ESTP, and I am insanely attracted to this guy.
And when we were in a group discussion I’d just look at him like straight in the eyes.
As he goes on about himself, I was just enamoured by him.
It’s a weird habit of mine when I’m super attracted to someone.
I couldn’t stop, and he’d stare right back and slow down his speech and it would end up us just looking each at other.
I have to force myself to look away or pretend to be distracted by someone else talking.
What’s going through your head in situations like these?
Do you take staring as a threat?
Do you think you’re being over analysed?
Or is he just simply attracted back? (how I initially interpreted it until I thought about it more)
Before he kept apologising if he ever came across as aggressive to me (we have collaborated on projects before).
So I don’t want him to think I’m judging him or anything."
628,estp,ESTP woman here...... I get extremely creeped out by in intense eye contact but my overwhelming urge to always be the power player in a situation will force me to maintain that eye contact despite my discomfort.  Idk if it's different for other ESTP's tho.  
629,estp,"Hah, that’s adorable. I’m gonna imply that there’s nothing overtly threatening about your stare, so they’re probably not too weirded out (unless your eyes are bulging open or something).
My girlfriend, who’s also an INFP, would stare at me occasionally before we were dating, and I was more flattered than anything, so I think you’re good"
630,estp,"I like when people make eye contact with me. It feels like most people feel uncomfortable with it, and I use it often to demonstrate my attentiveness toward someone. 
I would doubt he would take it as a threat, INFP’s are too sweet to be threats haha"
631,estp,"It feels good when a stare down is on, most people look away too fast, again speaking as a single entity maybe it's not for every ESTP but a stare down feels like you have that person's attention if not owning it😅😅"
632,estp,"Literally lol’d, I do this all the time.  It’s like a mini game to play during small talk. "
633,estp,"I have learned that many ESTPs, while perceptive of the ways others work, are not likely to give into a lifestyle just because many around them do or they receive pressure to. 
Do you think the general expectations society has regarding career, relationships, etc. ""cramp your style?"" How so?"
634,estp,"Hello, ESTPs, I'm an INTP. Me and another person were talking about how a lot of INTPs experience this, and which other personality types are more prone to experiencing it. I decided I'm going to go around all of the different reddits and ask. If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, basically it means you don't feel worthy of your successes, and you find it hard to be proud of achievements or accept compliments. You feel like a fraud, and that you got lucky to achieve what you have. You can Google it if you want to know more."
635,estp,"What is the difference in the way that an ESTP sees right through people as compared to how the INFJ sees through people? 
Also, this has to be at least 25 characters long to post so just ignore this part. "
636,estp,"ESTP's Se is able to see through people's pomposity because it's Se
INFJ actually does the same thing but it happens unconsciously and gets filtered through their dominant Ni so an INFJ is gonna be more like ""This person's probably a shmuck because I was talking to the trees and they told me so""
​
edit:  
More specifically INFJ's Ni takes a bunch of Se snapshots and finds a ""model of best fit"" for all of them while ESTP's Se just deals with shit directly"
637,estp,"If you want a deep insight on how an INFJ processes things, I'll give you a good read. Don't worry it's not too long and it's remarkably applicable to everything that might go through their heads.
INFJ is ""INFp"" or ""IEI"" in socionics, it's the same, just different naming.

638,estp,"Interesting question. 
I feel like in my experience I usually arrive at the same conclusion on people as my INFJ counterparts- but I usually can directly address the reasons from an observational point of view, rather than chalking it up to my subconscious intuition "
639,estp,"When you get stressed, tired, overwhelmed, or depressed, what happens?  What behaviors do you exhibit? Where does your mind start focusing on? What gets you back to yourself or how do you re-energize? "
640,estp,"I get way into myself and start navel-gazing and catastrophizing. I already have an anxiety disorder, but stress pushes it into the stratosphere.
I become myopic, I lose motivation, I can't/won't/don't do anything,  I think the (my) world's gonna end, I project way too far into the future and lose grounding, I dissociate. I fizzle out and lose my enthusiasm. My fuse shortens to about half an inch and I go from laid-back to asshole. When I'm in the shithole of my anxiety, I lose focus and can't pinpoint causes, and thus can't do anything about the problem.
It's paralysis.
I usually have to ground and yank my ass back into the present, even just by distracting myself, until I'm in a better place to face my demons head on and pick them apart to do something about them. "
641,estp,"Usually, being depressed in general means being stuck into an Ti-Ni loop. In this loop you just come back again and again on a single issue trying to rack your head around it to find a solution. But no matter how hard you try, it just seems to have none. Therefore, I'm just paralysed, I don't sleep anymore, I don't want to party, when I talk to people they can feel that I don't care at all about them...
So it's overall pretty bad, when we go in a bad place we lose all our light... 
The best way I've found to go over that is to get in touch with our Fi. As crazy as it sounds. 
I would recommend ""the Power of Now: a Guide to spiritual Enlightement"" by Eckart Tolle, and (the best one) ""Letting go, a Pathway to surrender"" by David Hawkins.
Basically, understanding your feeling and facing them, embracing your darkness to be able to consciously letting go of it..."
642,estp,"I get really sad and unmotivated to follow through my daily routine that I'm otherwise excited for like going to the gym, studying a bit, or helping my parents or s/o out. I like the sense of accomplishment. Sometimes I develop reckless behaviors and get pugnacious over nothing. Just talking to me sets me off the rails. I'm aware that the person doesn't deserve it, but I speak before I think when I'm like this and then I feel bad about lashing out, and get back into a cycle. I focus on myself and missed opportunities. I re-energize by reading, being around positive (and patient) people, and setting new goals for self improvement, like making a to do list. Without fail these things get me up and running especially being around positive people. I want to contribute to the joy. The to do list helps me organize an overwhelmed schedule and reading gives me a chance to put my mind on something other than myself. "
643,estp,"I'm an INFP dating an ESTP, and I actually came here for this exact answer.
I am pulling out of temporary PTSD. A feeler with irrational feels. My ESTP boyfriend was in his own personal hell, I'm sure. But he held me together, and fell apart once I got better!  Which is where we've been lately. I came here to ask this exact question for these exact reason. 
I can tell you what it looks like from my perspective... not sure if that would help. "
644,estp,"""Catastrophizing"" seems to sum up your response? Thx for answering.
I am trying to understand what symptoms are unique to ESTPs than typical symptoms of depression or anxiety. 
Do you know what type of activities, events, or interactions trigger what you wrote? "
645,estp,"This has been a challenging concept to grasp....Whether it's an ESTP in some loop or just some other type.
Ty. Will look into that. Do you think an ESTP should read this when they're stuck in the ""dark"" or the concepts in here come naturally for an ESTP? Hope that made sense.
Sorry random, but after a party, do you feel energized in general? What does ""energized"" mean to you?"
646,estp,"Sorry to hear this especially about your PTSD!
You guys seem to love each other deeply. The painful part of love we forget sometimes... It is somewhat a beautiful feeling not many have the privilege to experience.
I hope you find answers to avoid turning this into an unhealthy cycle. Your desire to seek answers shows your relationship will grow and become stronger than before. I am sure you already know this.
hugs."
647,estp,"Unmotivated, listless, motionless.
Most of the time it happens when I can't see myself moving forward, someone/something is trying to suppress my freedom, focusing too much on the future or past.
We're external people and stress makes us implode."
648,estp,"We never met a stranger. We've made friends, randomly, that I still keep in touch with! We went to a work convention... working a room with him was intoxicating. He was madly conversational, inclusive, exciting, funny, happy. We had side conversations between conversations. Everyone loved him. I was massively proud. It was just like meeting strangers at a bar... except more, somehow. I'm proud of what he does and how hard he works. 
He doesn't want to go out right now. He doesn't want to meet people. He's paranoid about losing his job. He has a wicked hard time staying motivated. He used to play hard, work less, but knock that shot out of the park, when he did work. Now he's working hard. And it's not this effortless ""knock it out of the park"" feeling. It's work. 
He went to FSU, loves FSU football. This year, if we were watching an FSU game, you wouldn't know there was anything different from one game to another. He's not excited, he's not happy, he's not screaming at the TV, jumping around, pulling his hair out, hurling insults, and then playing around with me. He's just... watching football.
In our personal life he still the sexiest thing on two legs, but it is so hard to connect with him. And it wasn't like that before. I don't want to go into too much about how that's changed… It hurts too much. But I miss him. I miss how much love and passion he put into every damn little thing. It was all significant.
I can feel his aggression, apathy, pain... he's not okay, right now. He keeps trying to muster it up and getting surly. Usually it's my fault, somehow. It's massively frustrating. I have to physically walk away, sometimes. I can't help it. He's so damn intense. There are only so many times a person has to pee!
He's disconnected. But sometimes, when he tunes in, it feels like the eye of sauron just realized you existed... other times, he just melts into me. Either way, there's no spark. He's not himself. And the more he focuses his aggression on me, the less I can do about him seeing me negatively. But I'm here! I'm trying. I feel like I'm waiting for moments to connect. But trying to manufacture them is a huge mistake!
There's precious little I can do about it. But I try. And he's fucking adorable. He's a big tall handsome teddy bear... that wants to occasionally eat my face off. 
I can't get him to go running. I can't convince him to play sports. He needs to! But he just won't. He'll say he will, that he'll go running with me, but he just won't. The more weight he gains, the less he thinks of himself.
Not sure how to go on.
He fucks with me. And calling him out just brings light to something I kind of deserve. He says I can't tell people when they're being an asshole. Shit no. I don't appreciate having to. If you feel like being an ass, have at it. I'm not going to get mad that you're mad. I'm not going to hold it against you for acting like an ass. That's between you and Jesus. I'm not goi g to make you work for it, either, it just rolls off my back. But I'm realizing this is both the reason we're able to reconnect, and a source of frustration, at the same damn time!
Anyway, I'm veering off course.
It's frustrating and sad. I need to motivate him to at least run. "
649,estp,"I can say that he's been connecting in really great ways, lately. He's doing a ton. He's really present when he's there. But he still isn't himself.
I can see a light!!! But his spark is still not easily there for him.
He's. Fucking. Amazing.
He's forgiving, encouraging, and massively helpful. He's self giving! Clearly!
And yet....
I'm taking as many opportunities to catch him at his best. Making me be present in the moment isn't easy. And being verbally (not written!) present is also hard... it's forcing me to change how I see things and interact. I don't want to make this about me. But I'm feeling like I want to defend myself and him. We're both doing a good job. We're both trying to reconnect. He's an exceptionally amazing man. Those were examples of how he's changed. I cannot express to you how massively he's grown. He's a good man. I love him something fierce. I would not be even a fraction as happy elsewhere, even on a bad day.
And that, I think, moves well beyond him being an ESTP. But shows the depth of the character of an ESTP.
He just walked in, put his shoes on, and left. With a weird permagrin. I see your eyes, dude! I'm going to tackle the shit out of him for that!!!
By ""tackle"" I mean I'm now folding his laundry... and He's going to be teased and steamrolled when he comes back to bed. And probably bitten. And I might get spanked. Hehehehe"
650,estp,"I was just wondering it it was at all possible that I may ask for some insight on a very dear person to me, being an ESTP?
​

For years, he's had the habit of bailing on people/plans without any notice, and when confronted, will always almost respond with, ""My phone died."" My friends and I even once caught him even one of us an excuse for not meeting up together like we had arranged, while simultaneously texting another member of the group about possibilities to see each other the following day. He's been given the nickname ""Snowflake"", unbeknownst to him, and it's at the point where nearly almost all of our mutual childhood friends are beginning to loathe him, and feel as though they can't depend on him to be there when they need. Is there any chance he at all feels guilty for these choices, or is he just becoming apathetic towards our friend group and doesn't care for them anymore?
I had a crush on him for a decade, and when I confessed my feelings to him suddenly out of the blue after years of no contact, we slept together because at the time it was the only chance we could be together before becoming distant for God knows how long. It was very romantic and sweet, but after seeing him in person not too recently, he was shy and sent wildly mixed signals;; While I was in town, he would message frequently first about the chance we could hang out again, or would ask me sexual questions; but if I tried to initiate, he'd almost freeze up? He would also touch me a lot and flirt with me, and while I'd try reciprocating and being more daring to show my intentions, he'd never go further;;  Once the moments were over and I'd be left feeling confused, he'd text me as if he might have wished to have done differently in those situations, than to freeze up? I apologized to him afterwards if I had ever offended him or came off too strongly, which he always reassured me that it was never an issue. But I just feel very odd, like I don't know if it's right or wrong of me to let him know my feelings, or if it's okay that I want to sleep with him. All the time, he'd tell me I'm gorgeous, I have a beautiful body, he'd sleep with me in a heartbeat. I don't understand why he might start something, but then pulls back, like he's unsure or scared? Anything would help, because I'm just very confused and trying my best to be understanding;; Like it feels like we went backwards since sleeping together and I don't understand, whereas there may be times I'm insecure or nervous about telling him something, and he says, ""I've seen you buck ass naked, dude."" Welp;;;;
And I just wish I knew of ways to make him happy. Our friend group is beginning to abandon him, no one wants to talk to him anymore because he's proven in difficult times to not be dependable or even present. I know he's having a lot of struggles with his family, close people to him turning to drug abuse. Friends he was close to are moving far away, or starting to become distant with focusing on their own lives and plans/futures. Even if it's just to randomly message him and tell him a good dream I had of him, or ask him if he remembers some fun memories we had when we were younger, or something made me think of him and I hope he's doing okay. I just feel very miserable thinking about his situation a lot. I won't lie, I've been crazy head-over-heels for him since the moment we met, but I'd also so much rather him just be happy. I'm scared he must feel alone a lot, he told me the other day he feels very ""stuck"" and a little hopeless. Is this just something every ESTP has to go through? What can help?

​
Thank you for your time! I'm sorry, I know this was a lot to read;; but anything at all, would mean the world to me to hear. I'd be much too embarrassed trying to ask him these kinds of questions, I don't want to appear confrontational or hurt/offend him in any way;;"
651,estp,"As an ESTP, I tend to disappear when life gets difficult. I get super flakey when I just don’t want to deal with life in general. ESTPs usually don’t think sex is a big deal so him pulling back could be him wondering if he’s leading you on. You guys have some history and a long friendship so he might not know how to proceed. It’s best to be straightforward with him and not push too much about his problems. When you hangout, keep the topics general and let him bring up the problems if he wants to talk about them."
652,estp,"TL;DR: Be less insecure. If he's enjoying himself, he is. Sex and love aren't the same thing as well.
I read this, and I can see you have a lot of questions. I can also tell you're not the confrontational type because I know very little about him in the end. You say a lot about stuff from your perspective and add your thoughts, feelings and insecurities to it, but nothing about him. So I have to make guesses here and talk stereotypical. Luckily, most ESTPs are also an open book.
""Is there any chance he at all feels guilty for these choices, or is he just becoming apathetic towards our friend group and doesn't care for them anymore?""
I doubt he feels guilty because he most likely does not feel like making a big deal out of it. He's the driving force behind a group and knows how to move people. The idea is that: ""The car is moving and the engine is working. It doesn't really matter why it had trouble starting""
When he's there, does he enjoy himself? If he does, he's enjoying your friendship. If he doesn't, or feel he's more comfortable elsewhere, he's not enjoying your friendship. This may sound overly simplified, but ESTPs are ""simple people"". I feel ESTPs are good at burning bridges when they don't want to anymore, and that bridge hasn't burned yet... 
Second point:
"" I had a crush on him for a decade, and when I confessed my feelings to him suddenly out of the blue after years of no contact ,we slept together because at the time it was the only chance we could be together before becoming distant for God knows how long. It was very romantic and sweet, but after seeing him in person not too recently, he was shy and sent wildly mixed signals;;  While I was in town, he would message frequently first about the chance we could hang out again, or would ask me sexual questions; but if I tried to initiate, he'd almost freeze up?"" 
Sex and love are two different things. Yes, when they mix it's the best feeling ever, but they don't need to. I like cola, and I like rum. I can drink them seperately without problem, but I prefer them mixed! That may have happened here as well. He enjoyed the sex, but might not feel the same as you(a detail you left out). Now that he knows you find it more difficult to seperate love and sex, he may not want to jump. He's keeping the social interactions online, ask how you are... make teasing jokes... only to realize when it's time to go it may not be right.   
You confessed your feelings, but what did he reply? Did he confess or kept his distance? That bit should be the most telling really.
""And I just wish I knew of ways to make him happy.""
ESTPs live in the moment, and are very easy to make happy. Go out for a fun day, have a good time. Have some good food. Go do something fun. If he has a smile on his face, he's happy. I don't know what makes him 'truly happy', but he'll always enjoy the experience. I went to a ""stargazing party"", most boring thing I went to! But I still very much enjoyed and valued the experience. Just wouldn't do it again.
""Even if it's just to randomly message him and tell him a good dream I had of him, or ask him if he remembers some fun memories we had when we were younger, or something made me think of him and I hope he's doing okay. I just feel very miserable thinking about his situation a lot. I won't lie, I've been crazy head-over-heels for him since the moment we met, but I'd also so much rather him just be happy. I'm scared he must feel alone a lot, he told me the other day he feels very ""stuck"" and a little hopeless. Is this just something every ESTP has to go through? What can help?""
My advise to you, don't talk about -your- feelings to him in regards to -his- situation. There are plenty of people that like it when people sympathize or tell them how stuff makes them feel, the ESTP people I know don't know how to deal with ""feelings"". Sure, they are expert at picking up when something makes someone happy/sad/angry/horny/whatever... but they focus on that action, rather than your feeling. This is a conversation that could happen:
""You did this, and that made me sad""""
""Okay, I'll never do it again""
""Don't you want to know why it made me sad?""
""What's the use in that?"""
653,estp,"Woah - woah ok. Back up. And I speak as an ESTP here.
""Be less insecure. If he's enjoying himself, he is. Sex and love aren't the same thing as well"". So let me say fairly categorically that this is a bullshit attitude and the OP has ever right to feel messed around in this situation because dude is messing her around. No, he does not have to profess romantic love for her but dude's her friend, sleeps with her and then ghosts her? I don't care how hard you find deep conversations, dude, that is not OK. If he is enjoying himself AT THIS WOMAN'S EXPENSE then it is not fine or legitimate.
And you can't TELL someone to be less insecure. In any situation but particularly in a situation where the guy is MAKING her feel that way. Christ.
""Now that he knows you find it more difficult to seperate love and sex..."" now this. This right here goes straight to the heart of the matter. He slept with you. He realises you have feelings. He maybe understandably, if he does not, feels a tad freaked - but instead of having an honest conversation with you about it he semi ghosts you, but then continues to make sexual comments towards you rather than drawing the hard line under such activities.
This dude also clearly only wants to interact with you on his terms, not on yours, OP; which is a sure fire dickhead move that is really unhealthy for you and I'm very sorry you have to deal with that.
You don't need ways to make this dude happy, OP. Trust me that you deserve better than this and than him - and look, I'm his type, I GET this behaviour and oh boy is it selfish, gaslighting asshattery to the tenth degree."
654,estp,"Urgh, I was pondering to put the TL;DR in the beginning. If my response was too... know-it-all... I am sorry. My idea was to explain the behaviour without condemning, which, in hindsight, I may need to have done some more.
We agree on the heart of the matter, I just tried to explain it from his side so OP may have some more insight in the guy his thoughtprocess. Is it correct that OP feels could feel like (s)he's being messed with? Absolutely. The remark ""Sex and love aren't the same thing"" can be considered an ESTP trait, and out of that idea I posted it. Should he have that conversation? Absolutely. Should OP distance him/herself until he does? I feel (s)he should.  
""And you can't TELL someone to be less insecure. In any situation but particularly in a situation where the guy is MAKING her feel that way. Christ. ""
This is the only part I somewhat disagree with. OP asks how (s)he can help him... but the only way that's possible if they are having that conversation. Now, that takes courage and confidence, but OP wants to know how to approach the person. 
Would I burn that bridge? Yes, I would. Heck, I even stated that that is an ESTP thing to do. I don't feel the need to enable that behavior from anyone. But OP clearly doesn't want to do that, for emotional reasons. So the remark: 
""You don't need ways to make this dude happy, OP. Trust me that you deserve better than this and than him""
is not what was asked for. But even if it was, to burn that bridge requires courage to do. To solve this, I would advise OP to think what (s)he wants, how (s)he sees their relationship now and in the future and act accordingly. This sort of behaviour from the guy is clearly not healthy... and even if OP wanted to help (s)he needs to act if she wants this feeling to go away.
Then again, that may be a super ESTP-attitude."
655,estp,"Wow, reading back I realise I totally just assumed the OPs gender. Massive apologies for that.
But yes - of course the OP doesn't want to burn that bridge because this is what this kind of emotional manipulation does. The give and take of things like, flirting sometimes, then being real distant, then reappearing again and then vanishing; that shit is literally like a drug. It hacks your dopamine receptors and makes you, essentially, hooked on that person. And that is then in addition to the real emotional attachment, which frankly this guy does not deserve.
""To solve this, I would advise OP to think what (s)he wants, how (s)he sees their relationship now and in the future and act accordingly. This sort of behaviour from the guy is clearly not healthy... and even if OP wanted to help (s)he needs to act if she wants this feeling to go away."" but yes, this is absolutely spot on and I entirely agree. And you are right - it is hard, and takes courage; but sometimes someone is behaving in such a way that all you can do is walk away. I have seen far too many guys like this dude; none of them are good...and frankly, whilst I absolute believe people are redeemable and have seen people change; they can only change if they want to. The OP isn't gonna be able to help or change this guy. It's on him. And again I am also speaking as an ESTP guy who can relate to some of the behaviour being discussed; and who has taken a lot of steps to ensure I have enough self awareness not to treat someone the way the OP is being treated. Which actually is not hard; but it requires you not to be selfish, as this guy clearly is. Deeply.
Anyway, I think I've trash talked this guy enough; on your post, yes; I may have judged you too harshly from your original post. I do not feel in these situations you CAN simply explain because explanation reads as justification, which this guy does not warrant; but I can appreciate what you were trying to do here."
656,estp,"Alright so, I got into MBTI stuff recently and been spending ours studying what the hell this is about and trying to figure out more about it until I understand how this shit works.. All the tests confirm me as an ENTP and I really do agree with the descriptions in general (I also feel connected to the people on r/entp as well) but when I started learning about cognitive functions, I thought I was more of an Se than a Te. Then I thought: what if I'm an ESTP?! And so I read on as many articles as I could about this type, and figured I really am an ESTP. Very objective about everything, apathetic about life, super outgoing yet insensitive and often blunt. My best friends back in high school did call me an asshole because I kept on insulting them apparently (I just wanted to comment on how horrible their hair looked). Also getting bored easily and what not, the typical ESTP stuff.
So here I am, seriously thinking that I might have been mistyped as ENTP. But one thing bothers me; I'm not an athlete nor do I work out regularly. Although I do love going to the gym and feel very refreshed after working out, I just lack the consistency just like with anything. The only thing that I'm obsessed about and use to kill my boredom is Starcraft - it's such a dynamic game that it keeps me stimulated, albeit mentally, and the fact that it's physically demanding as well (that 300 APM!) although I'm only using my hands seem to keep me going. So I was just wondering if you guys think my obsession of a video game is actually huge factor that may as well be a proof of my NOT being an ESTP. (Wow that was such a poorly phrased sentence).
Thanks all in advance <3
Edit: about traveling. As much as I love going to new places, I never actively plan a trip for myself because 1) I'm too lazy and 2) going by myself doesn't seem appealing at all. Like, the beauty of nature and what not doesn't interest me because I see no practical value in appreciating the landscape or whatever but if I'm walking around with some good people I'm totally down to travel. I don't know if that makes sense but yeah, I'm just adding this here because I think that tendency goes against ESTP."
657,estp,"That tendency does not go against ESTP. Who gives a fuck about landscape?! I can appreciate a great view and there's certainly a natural curiosity to discover stuff... but without other people around it would not be the same experience.
Edited because i was on a train earlier but there was more to say!
Maybe this helps to discern the different between Te and Se.
I find it easy to track what is happening in a video game and position myself or my team in a way to take advantage ... this doesn't require much effort / thinking. It's totally reactive - i'm not even very good at remembering things (in general) but in the moment i'll recall a solution / similar event and act accordingly to prevent losing the game or whatever.
Again - this doesn't require much effort for the ESTP because it is primary function oriented.
Yeah but you gotta appreciate that a stereotype doesn't control your life. If you smoked cigarettes for the past 10 years you're not going to be an athlete either... The stereotype describes a predisposition and it's not a guarantee that the individual will have engaged in stereotypical activities.
I contacted people who knew me 10 years earlier to ask them about physicality. Apparently i have always done bursts of working out when stressed - but simply didn't acknowledge this behavior.
I've also discovered that it is common for ESTPs who do not frequently engage in team sports to be keen on music (specifically guitar) or extreme sports. I can relate to this because i have picked up guitar, skateboarding and trick bmxing despite not considering myself 'athletic'.
You may also like to know that i played SC too. Up to high plat before throwing in the towel.
Edit 2; Take a look at this functional diagram. You can see that ESTP and ENTP have similarities but also you can see the best way to try and discern a difference.
Please note; MBTI is not proven scientifically and therefore many aspects of it should be taken with a pinch of salt (similar to how you might be skeptical of a horoscope)."
658,estp,"You sound just like me. You might actually be ESTP. (the attitude to gym, the gaming, the socialising, etc.)
Thing is. This test isn't very concrete and for a friend of mine the results for F vs T were equal, so we read both profiles and some parts matched and others didn't. This might be the case for you."
659,estp,"I've (INFJ) known an ESTP for many years: I met him playing WoW and he is far from an athlete (he hates organized sports, in fact). I think the thing that makes me sure he is an ESTP is that natural pragmatism without any sort of dogma attached. He just purely kinda knows what works, what doesn't, what are the direct steps to take to get to where he wants, and he'll take 'em without waiting around. He doesn't particularly give a shit about landscapes either (that seems more Introverted Sensing to me, honestly). ESTPs just naturally act like ""alphas"": strong, in control, charming, naturally loathe ""authority"", and ready to buy everybody a round of drinks. Really great at reading people and understanding just what a person can do at a glance.
This ESTP is also a programmer. Make of that what you will. ESTPs are the only programmers I've ever seen that can watch a movie, chat with 10 people, and bang out a ton of code all at the same time. "
660,estp,"Thank you!
About that last sentence - yes, I'm aware, and I have pretty much figured myself out a while ago; I'm just looking for a good-looking label to tell others haha.
Anyways, interesting that you mention music and extreme sports.. I'm a musician (not my major but a hobbyist), I play the guitar (lol) clarinet and piano, and I compose when I feel like it. I don't produce music though, that shit's just hard.. Haha. Extreme sports, I snowboard, and I was actually just getting into doing free terrain stuff... Because riding down the mountain bores me now. Doig tricks and shit looks hella fun, but then again, I don't call myself athletic. There are some parallels to be drawn between us, I guess?
I'll check the links after I take a shower! Thank you"
661,estp,"the test results do give me a very close call between N (55%) and S (45%).. And I really like to think that I have a well developed Se rather than Ne (I'm not the guy you'd come looking for fresh new ideas because, although I'm reactive I'm not THAT creative.. I'd rather be shitting on or improving others' ideas). But yeah, uh do you spend a lot of time online in general as well? Although my reddit activity is limited to r/allthingszerg and recently r/entp and r/mbti (rarely look at the front page because I'm not interested in things I don't care about.. Lol) I do dick around online a lot, and used to get on Facebook like everyday.. I don't go on forums or read them on regular basis but I do read a bunch of articles on Starcraft. I'm not sure what to make out of that.. Haha"
662,estp,"Ah, thank you, now I'm confused even further because both types are just so fitting for me hahaha ugh I just want a concrete label that I can possibly tell others just for the heck of it yet the journey is very tough..
Btw, does this mean he gets shit done? Could have some examples if you don't mind? Because, yes, if I am motivated to do something I won't wait for it and jump into it straight up, but I almost always half-ass it, as in I'm very invigorated at first but lose interest in like.. Idk a very short time."
663,estp,"Heh no worries - there's definitely commonalities here!
I expect the reason you prefer the solo sports is because you don't have to explain stuff to a team. If you fuck up in Starcraft it's inly yourself to blame - and it's not that we couldn't explain it to a team either... It's just that their feelings might get hurt!
The jock stereotype is just as misleading as the salesman one. Neither capture the essence of ESTP. be the underdog, live here and now, truth in logic, freedom in your own authority.
Also... You might not consider yourself athletic - but you should talk to someone who doesnt climb up mountains to ride a bike down it! I made the same mistake in believing the jock stereotype too much. After checking with old and new friends I realised I'm way more keen on physical activity than most people.
By the way. All ESTPs are legendary heroes. You can't fight destiny."
664,estp,Hehe well that is far more of an Se than a Ne statement.  
665,estp,"Sure. Yeah he gets shit done, but if it is a goal he wants. He's not busy for the sake of being busy (like some SJs I know). Also I find that he just jumps straight into shit without any premeditation, because he flies by the seat of his pants and it usually takes him places. That's sort of the nature of Se: scanning the environment and intuitively knowing where to go, BAM, like an arrow, you don't gotta think about it."
666,estp,"Well, damn. That last sentence of the third paragraph is so me haha
&amp; yeah, I can't do well in a team game, whether it's a physical sport or a video game. I hated League when I used to play it lol"
667,estp,Roclet league is ridiculous fun! Yeah I can only handle team games if people are talking over voice - otherwise communicating my point becomes a huge frustration. And I can only lead groups of people understand that I'm not trying to hurt their feelings!
668,estp,"Haha fair enough. Keep in mind that type doesn't fully ""develop"" until after 21 or so, so if you're kinda on the young side you may just need to wait a bit before your stack really shows itself.
From all your responses you strike me as more ESTP than ENTP, tbh. Both types are pretty sweet though, so you can't go wrong with either :P"
669,estp,"I have had a relationship with an ESTJ for 4 years now. we have very little trouble together. I was wondering if there are any others that have had this relationship work.
When I look at it on paper it doesn't seem like it should."
670,estp,"I agree that I think you probably meant to post this on /r/estj   ... however when it comes to thinking about compatibility with personalities, I really don't think you should approach it as ""oh I'm XXXX they are XXXX it says we won't click so this shouldn't happen.."" everyone is different and some people have really developed their cognitive functions that may be a weak spot for them initially. In my opinion, if the relationship is going, and going well, keep at it! Personality test only tell x amount of person, barely scraping the surface. I REALLY don't think you should base being with someone just off what some test says their personality is. A relationship, a good one, is about great communication, liking the person, accepting them, etc... TL;DR : don't try to base what relationships should be off of personality test measures -- personal experience"
671,estp,"Why did you think it wouldn't work on paper? ... You share all of the same functions. That means communication should be very good. That's practically all it takes for a healthy relationship.
Brief lesson on duality pairs...
ESTJ; Te, Si, Ne, Fi
INFP; Fi, Ne, Si, Te
Take a moment to look at the functions listed above... Take either one of those function stacks and reverse it. Then compare it to the other. You share the same functions. But your strengths are his weaknesses and vice versa. This is how MBTI says 'opposites attract' ... it really doesn't mean total opposites but complimentary opposites.
Neither of you are using Se, Ti, Fe, Ni (these are all the functions i use).
It's called a duality pair. It is meant to be a good match on paper because you compliment each other completely. There is nothing to conflict."
672,estp,"ESTJs and INFPs are polar opposites in all ways. I can't see it lasting past the honeymoon stage...you will get extremely frustrated with the INFP, they in return will probably think you are an insensitive jerk. You never know though..."
673,estp,"Not sure why this is in /r/estp but as an INFP in a happy 1 year relationship with an ESTJ, I'm glad to see your post. Like you, we also have little trouble together. 
What trouble there is is mainly due to us being semi-long distance, and well... I want to see, talk and be close to him more than he sees the need to, he's usually focused on work when apart. But recently, he admitted he loved me, so I feel much more secure about our relationship and thus seek out his attention less. 
We understand each other easily because we share the same values. Not exactly the same interests or goals, but the underlying attitude toward things. He still speaks in a concrete ST way and I still speak in a vague and personal NF way, so that can leave us scratching our heads or having to repeat things. But it's not the kind of conflict that would be a wtf moment. And somehow when he speaks, I feel as if I can trust him implicitly. "
674,estp,"I would never trash a relationship because of what it looks like on paper.  I was mainly looking for anyone else's experience with the type. I'm friends with lots of people "" I shouldn't be friends with"".
My roommate and I are stuck together unless there is something unforeseen that makes it otherwise."
675,estp,"Nice, thanks for showing that, it helped. You are right about all of that. We do share common values and we do balance each other out very well. When I look at the way he functions and reacts to situations we just seen so different. But your right the differences are complimentary. :) "
676,estp,"It can be brutal at times but our issues are few and far between. It is actually the best relationship I've had. I'm free to be myself , and both sides accept the others strength and weaknesses. 
Very orderly and regimented. Not me however and I like it that way. Gives me a headache to be that stressed over order lol"
677,estp,"oops. my bad, totally misinterpreted it cause I only read the first sentence and just went straight for it. ESTJ's can be cool. They annoy me in the sense that I wish their Fe was more developed. A couple of the ones I'm friends with come off as more managers than a friend."
678,estp,Well she is definitely a manager but luckily I like/ need that so. But she also gives me space and allows my quirkiness. She told me once she relaxes a lot of standard for me cause she knows how I am. I told her I relax a lot too.
679,estp,"... isn't it explosive after all? Both are logical thinking observers but when it comes to commitment the first one avoid it for any price, but the second one could forsake his own for her for the price of eternity. They share same purpose but divided by life coincidence - they have met in wrong time. When one is ready to be engaged and after it to be married and the other one believes that it will not become as a truth and if it will it won't take long time for ESTP for escape the cage. My question here: Is there even the slightest possibility for female ESTP to understand what INTP could give her for her everlasting companionship. And it must to be mentioned that INTP's aren't the one's that easily give trust and commitment (if they ever...) but if they do, rather hell freeze over then they change theirs mind. "
680,estp,"I don't see any problem with this combination. 
I'm an ESTP male. If i can understand it then i'm sure you can work out what your INTP has got going on.
But the reason i say that is because you are compatible. And after compatible communication it only really matters about the aspects that MBTI doesn't address.
Personal life experiences are the things that keep us together.
Especially for ESTP. You will be happy if you are enabled to do the things that you want in life. If the INTP holds you back then it won't work. However there's no particular reason why the INTP would hold you back... you would likely be leading them forwards and they will willingly follow.
But this can complicate the male and female sex roles. In other words the INTP male must be able to wear the pants on particular subjects - whatever matters to the INTP. If not the ESTP female will not respect his ability to protect and provide for her (the male has not demonstrated sufficient conviction for his responsibility to himself).
ESTPs are sensitive to ""turf"" but the INTP is not. So there can easily be complications in this area.
These male and female sex roles are basic instinct  - it can even get in the way of a good mesh in personality. This can be the difference between good friends and good lovers.
But it shouldn't be a problem if you are aware if it. And if you feel like your guy is a bit weak or you are not too excited about the long term benefits then i would assume your sex roles have become muddled.
The INTP should seek to improve. I would recommend that he start doing press ups because then you'll still find him an attractive companion for the long term."
681,estp,"You read too much into personality predictions. Rarely does a person fit so perfectly into a category, so don't worry too much about it. People have their own nuances and their distinct personalities. Relax and interact, then make your own judgements from there "
682,estp,"No. If you talk like you just made your post it won't work out. ESTPs do and are active and in their down time or brief instances of reflection they'd rather work on the emotional rather than an analytical point of view. 
Seems like nothing romantic has started yet, I mean to let you know women kinda know if some guy is trying to work them especially if she's over the age of 25.
(INFP)"
683,estp,"I have a couple of ESTP female acquaintances and they like men who aren't predictable and introverted. They like nonstop excitement and men who are alpha male types. For an INTP to play this role, it would be very difficult and exhausting for you. 
Do you just like the ESTP for her looks, or can you actually engage in conversation with her? "
684,estp,"I'm an INTP. I have an ESTP friend.
Friends are fine. If the ESTP is careful.
Not only are INTPs pretty much entirely incapable of fulfilling the relationship needs of ESTPs, the kind of pressure an ESTP will apply in response is the kind of thing that will break an INTP.
ESTPs will not understand why the INTP can't do the thing. And they won't be careful about offering correction if you don't maintain psychological and emotional distance.
The ESTP will end up disappointed and the INTP will end up in therapy."
685,estp,"Do you think that sex roles play such a large role? Does the male need to wear pants on particular subjects? Why is this? How overarching do you think this rule is? 
Also, I thought you were a girl for some reason. "
686,estp,"When does occur such settle down if you won't mind?  I'm the explorer type or in another terms adrenaline seeker which is not common among INTP. Have mind for logic debate, physiology, encryption etc.
But in the other hand I'm mountaineer, race driver, and in the near future associate academic. Does it might be boring for ESTP? Everything from list above always develop and I'm still stuck with her in mind (yeah it is more then problem to INTP).
Normally I wouldn't be stacked even for ESTP female (or for any) and just go on and let it behind but there is something that she admitted is true of me. I was the one who could understand her ideas without them being said out loud - soul mate thing for some.
I've learned through the time to predict responses from my interlocutors, there aren't always right but mostly accurate. And here is me point. Might it be that she doesn't want to live with a person that could predict her thoughts in advance in a ratio 50:50? I'm not telling that I'm not predictable. Everyone is except people with some funny psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and so far. 
Crazy it is as it sounds but no one dare to know what it is to be in love with a person just like you. Like reflection in a mirror, see it you can but it cannot make you have it."
687,estp,"In a matter of which you are speaking, we could easily communicate. When one starts telling his or her thoughts to each one, the second one finishes it. Are all of ESTP-female like this, or only that one? We both are intellectual creatures in a edge of extinction (I guess). And about this AlphaM-story I'm the individual who does not appreciate being in a center of attention, no not really - but I'm not avoiding contact to be clear, and as some suggests that male need to be wearing trousers, in a relationship I could agree partly with this statement. If you would meet me in a kind of street situation (small talk or bigger one) you would never ever tell that I'm INTP. Choice of words in my native language might be an indication that I am, but not my appearance."
688,estp,"My opinion is that this is the reason for modern marriage failure. Men in this day and age are not empowered by their sexuality. Woman are due to the agenda of progressive liberal activists.
This is why the manly men might become chauvinistic. It is a reaction to the perception of their sex role being under powered in social interactions (society).
Most definitely. The male should be able to defend the female. This is why i recommend press ups - it's base instinct to protect with your arms, it raises testosterone, and also conveniently they are the best exercise for a guy to get in shape.
Because of tradition and natural instinct. These things are becoming less important due to our social civilization. You can frequently see skinny, thin rakes (men) who are considered attractive due to their social value rather than their sex role.
Social value can eclipse the sex roles and keep people together. It's not always the definitive quality of a relationship - but it's a subconscious aspect that many people disreagd these days.
Especially because of equality. Look at the male body and the female body... the sexual dimorphism in human species is vast. Men are almost twice the size of women.
From a ""survival of the fittest"" and evolutionary perspective these aspects of male and female sex roles are prominent - almost as prominent as the physical differences between the sexes.
I guess you might associate the personality with female!"
689,estp,"ESTPs are sensory creatures, so they can read your body language very easily- whereas INTPs may have trouble in this area, so ESTPs may be filling in a weakness where INTPs do not have much skill. 
From what I know of my ESTP female acquaintances, I think eventually they would get bored of leading the relationship all the time after awhile with INTP types, also they tend to shy away from abstract, theoretical concepts, so eventually after the initial infatuation stage, there would be nothing more holding the relationship aside from intermittent sex. 
Just my observation! Your experience may be different. "
690,estp,"Hmm. What do you regard as social value? Like, trends and values and such that are en vogue? 
I've always been in relationships that have been pretty backwards, for lack of a better term, but then again I'm a female who is usually interested in other females, so it might be a natural gravitation towards feminine men. "
691,estp,"Fashion. Trends. Status quo. Yeah... that shit... More important than muscles.
Doubt it. Your perception is based on having a higher regard for social value.
Women are sexually empowered in our society and men are not. That makes women sexier by paradigm."
692,estp,"A question for my own curiosity...
How would you react if an alpha male made advances - we should assume that this person is either a stranger or aquanitence with no history and they are acceptable to talk to.
Would you turn down the alpha male and search for a feminin male or entertain the advances out of interest?
This is not a rhetoric question but I might have phrased it badly. Do you get me?
Essentially I wanted to ask if the alpha male is less attractive by default (as a result of social value)."
693,estp,"Whoa I totally forgot to answer this. 
Actually, alpha-type ESTP guy had a thing for me. I liked talking to him a lot (and still do as a friend) and I considered it, but he just wasn't really my type. Not much chemistry and we butted heads a lot. Ended up pursuing an INFJ guy then dating an INTP guy who I'm with now. I'll at least consider anyone, but I've definitely got a type. I think it works since I'd be an annoyance for most alpha males anyway. Saves us the trouble. 
Historically, my boyfriends have always been bisexual. Which is kind of funny since I'm a conventionally attractive girl, so we get assumed to be girl and gay BFF often. p; "
694,estp,"Ah that's really interesting and seems to correlate to the theaory i have read here
Part of my analysis of your situatioon was based on the conflict between these sexual tendencies and traditional male and female sex roles.
I find it interesting but i have to admit that i'm not inclined to speak for female ESTP. But i can speak for male ESTP. And this sounds fairly accurate to me considering what goes on inside my head.
But maybe i'm just a freak!"
695,estp,"That's interesting. My partner and I both fit into childlike, lol, and it's extremely accurate. We're very secretive and sort of intellectualize sex and romance, and the protecting quirks thing is also true. We value the weird. 
I think sex roles can be muddled by types and such. I think being a female ENTP makes me act a little less traditional. And NF/SF guys might take on different roles (in MBTI terms). Granted, physical strength and confidence can always help, but I think an INTP at his best will be different from an ESTP, for example. 
I do think that's why the ESTP pursued me, because I'm a little odd and generally disinterested, but I think we both understand it definitely wouldn't have worked, haha. I don't know if I've met a female ESTP, although I've met a female ISTP and she's the most badass person EVER. "
696,estp,"I've always been ESTP and relate to many things said here, but I've always been willing to do what it takes to succeed or climb the ladder, and I notice I don't have much guilt about most things, although some things I have done cause guilt. The only feelings I really get is jealousy and anger, the happiest I've been is when I left church camp and it didn't last long. I read about sociopaths and I have a few similar traits to the definition. My question is, does anyone else here relate to what is considered a sociopath? Do any of you have a hard time with feeling emotions or lack of guilt? "
697,estp,Guilt is a useless emotion honestly. I'd rather make amends or leave the situation be (because what's done is done). Reflecting and slowing down is not a strong point of estps; it needs to be developed to be harmonious with others. Our sharp tounge hurts feelers and life is easier if feelers arent rowled up.
698,estp,"Sociopaths have a very distinct vibe to them. True sociopaths are rare in the population and there are many more people of type ESTP than that, so while a few ESTPs might be on the spectrum the majority of ESTPs are not sociopathic. ESTP's feeling functions Fe/Fi are located in a vulnerable lacking zone for the type so ESTPs definitely have complexes in this area but this takes a variety of forms depending on person's identity and experiences and doesn't have to amount to sociopathy. It doesn't seem to be limited to type either, as I have met a female INFJ and a male ENTJ who were definitely on this spectrum.     
The definition of sociopathy is someone whose mind thinks almost 100% rationally and logically and does not or barely engages the emotional parts of the brain. Since emotions are an important part of any personal relationships, the sociopath tends to stick out like a sore thumb - his or her logical mind attempts to make up for the lack of emotional processing that they are incapable of but never quite makes it there. Typical superficial traits that sociopaths exhibit are 1) ""proto-emotions"" which are simplistic and simplified emotional reactions to what is happening around them, 2) boredom and listless activity, which can be constructive like being a workaholic, 3) certain inability to relate to others and to fully integrate themselves into society, as there is always something off about these people, 4) overrunning other people's boundaries, since boundaries are often communicated on an emotional level that sociopaths don't comprehend 5) vindictiveness, since the sociopath cannot comprehend why people act a certain way and cannot sympathize with them, which leads him to conclude that they meant him harm and he should vindicate it. Some sociopaths will share their secret that they feel that ""there is something is wrong with them"" though next to none make it to the full realization.     
Things like wanting to always win, to be one step ahead of others, or wanting to engage in criminal, destructive, and even deadly behaviors aren't the same thing as sociopathy. Some of these traits have other origins, like having an Antisocial Personality Disorder or inheriting certain genes that emphasize aggression, and being a sociopath only makes it easier to engage in these behaviors while not being intrinsically linked to them."
699,estp,"I don't know... Isn't the definition of sociopath being someone who lacks empathy? Neurologically speaking, it often also affects the amygdala and fear, pleasure/reward centers of the brain. Also, ASPD is typically considered to be sociopathy... "
700,estp,"Just curious. What has MBTI taught you about yourself and others?
What types do you find yourself most at odds with, and which do you find most relatable?
Are you still a lone wolf punk that hates when people tell you what to do?"
701,estp,"Too serious :/ too sensitive... They never let go.  Then they say I am sensitive and serious and never let go.
It's... frustrating.  And I can deal cause I like the challenge... but it's just not fun. She is turning sour... even as friends.  I work at Starbucks and she asked for my RMs number... I asked why and because I didn't just give you what she wanted... she says I don't like to help her.
She has come through for me in a big way many times and I have her back... but we had a little falling out and since then we've been distant.  So I wanted to help and I asked because I was worried... I care for her more than she knows. She just... is very hard to understand. "
702,estp,"No my RM. As in regional manager for my work.  She (the INFJ) was having an issue at another starbucks... asked for the number of my manager's manager's manager...
She probably had a good reason to want it. Still when I asked what happened and why she wanted it... boom suddenly I never wanna help her.
She (the infj) is my friend but I suppose it's important to note that she is also my ex gf. There is alot of ""stuff"" there. A conversation with her is impossible now a days.
She is an infj. She took the test a billion times and while I'm no pro I am pretty damn sure it fits. She didn't even know what It was about, I just was tired of hitting a wall with her and my bro told me about the test before so I got her to take it. I needed a few pointers. Something to aim me in the right direction so I could win her over... sadly my charming ways were not cutting it.
I'm no saint... I can be abrasive... thoughtless... Impulsive... impatient... so on.  I get that... 
But she was just being silly and overly intense. "
703,estp,"Yeah... she cares alot about me.... despite being broken up. She expects alot from me I think. Like I'm supposed to just KNOW her like she thinks she knows me... I'll admit she knows well...  and I know her too... but I'm no mind reader. 
I just know the ways she moves... her little moods... that she always has cold feet and that she likes moon stones and that she thinks she can predict earthquakes... her quirks and ... idk... just her. It's when she gets worked up over something that I get lost. Because she cares alot about stuff but doesn't say anything till its too late.
She looks cold on the outside... I once asked her if she was passionate because she looked so... unreachable and distant. Calm. I didn't know her well then. Inside... its crazy how much she cares. She is so intense... It just took forever for her to allow me to witness that bit if her. 
Her and I... We had something even I have to admit was special and I learned a lot.  But it's over and we both came out of it sore. She is the only one that can really get to me. "
704,estp,"Meh no need to be sorry.. We tried.  And our friendship though frustrating from time to time is still obviously important or we wouldn't bother. She really is amazing, damn shame we basically speak different languages. 
I'm sticking around cause I can tell I should, I have her back..  But I have no clue what I'm doing... so i feel more sorry for her.
I'm not worried and the frustration doesn't stick with me for ages like it does with her."
705,estp,"Can't say that I have read any of the post thoroughly or that I actually read every post on here, but man, reading up on 3 years worth of texts in under an hour is quite an experience. This subreddit really is dead, isn't it haha. (I get it, we all got better things to do, it's just that I was super tired today and had nothing to do.. It sucks that my school ended literally when all my friends are going back :/)
Anyway, to celebrate the occasion (completing a subreddit is quite an achievement imo), I got a question for you all busy people: do any of you enjoy being the ""clown"" in a group? I know that I for one like to play ""dumb"" and just come off as really nonchalant and innocent, sometimes ignorant, but nonetheless funny; but in reality I'm actually aware of everything that's happening, very observant and am noticing every detail of my friends' body language and such. I was just wondering if I'm the only one here who likes being seen as easy-going and nonthreatening ¯(ツ)/¯ "
706,estp,"As someone who leans towards ENTP sometimes, I tend to dominate most conversations. 
I still keep track of body language and be the clown, but I'm usually driving the conversation where I (or if someone seems uncomfortable, they) feel it should go. "
707,estp,"I'm not sure about being a clown, but I'm known as funny. I like making people laugh but I never dumb myself down. I also don't go out of the way to correct people's assumptions but I also don't hide how observant I am."
708,estp,"Mmhm I see. I don't exactly dumb down myself, but I guess it's more like ""smoothing myself out"" in a way that people can feel more approachable to me. And part of that includes not coming off as too observant or aware that might seem threatening to some people, if you know what I mean. "
709,estp,"This was precisely me in my adolescent years. 
Then I read a quote by Winston Churchill, a proud ESTP. And I'm paraphrasing but it was something like ""if you don't have any enemies then you've never stood up for anything in your life"".
Ever since then I've started enjoying conflict and the things that come with its to put it simple I feel more free. Having enemies feels natural and the good friends will really admire your observational skills- especially when it comes to picking up girls"
710,estp,"Eh, no for that banner. I get that we seem like daredevils ond hyper masculine to other types, but many totally negate our Ti since we're in our heads quite a bit. 
Maybe a picture of confetti? Cuz were amazing, but can annoy others if we stay around too long."
711,estp,"Agree with all of the above, but if ""stereotypes are stupid"" then what are you even doing here on this subreddit? Why even call yourself an ""ESTP,"" which is a label purely consisting of stereotypes? And besides, you represent 1 opinion. "
712,estp,"Why are you here, you're not even an ESTP? What do you care about the banner of a more or less dead subreddit? 
As little stake as I care to put in mbti, it's not just stereotypes either. If it's such a little deal, why do you care either? And shocker but if we're disagreeing on the picture, that's at least two represented opinions "
713,estp,"I don't know why you're putting words in my mouth; I never said anything about how little or how much mbti means to me in my previous post. and yeah, we have 2 opinions. I don't think that's a very large sample size, so I'm gonna wait for more people to have their say. That's how a democracy works. People can have different opinions from you and if you don't like that, then fuck off"
714,estp,"I posted a photo and you all jumped to crucify me. over a FUCKING PHOTO. So this is how you treat newcomers to the subreddit, no wonder it's so popular. 
Edit: I didn't come here to start a fight. I made a very simple suggestion, then someone attacked me, I retaliated to defend myself, and now you're all teaming up to bully me. 5+ on 1, Bravo. "
715,estp,"Why do you care so much about the life of the subreddit? Don't you think if we cared, we'd have done something about it? Don't you think people crawling out of the woodwork to tell you to go away is indicative of that, or that we don't want change or at least the change you're trying to impose? The only change we ever wanted was to ban discord invites, which we all came out of the woodwork to agree upon, and our one and only mod who isn't even an ESTP was down for that, and so it was. We like it how it is and will change it when we don't, go fuck with another subreddit"
716,estp,"¯(ツ)/¯ this dude is funny 
I can say anything I want in response and he comes up some paragraph or petty insult that I either won't read or don't care about, and just keeps doing it. Everyone gets off differently I guess "
717,estp,"I have the right to express myself by posting as much as I want, on any subreddit. It's called the First Amendment, ever heard of it? And read my initial response, ""Ok, thanks for the feedback."" YOU decided to escalate the situation by attacking me for my contribution. "
718,estp,"I didn't attack you, I told you that everyone has a different interest so nailing one thing to the banner won't make everyone happy which is a fact, and that stereotypes are stupid, which is my opinion. Notice how none of that is directed at you as a person, and how the fuck is that an attack? If anything it explains why I said no, which is more feedback than one word. You then proceeded to tell me that being an ESTP consists entirely of stereotypes, whereas when I broadened it to the rest of mbti, you called it putting words in your mouth meaning that everyone else isn't stereotypes, just us (me). You made this personal first lmao I don't see how you don't get that. It's right there. After I laughed your reply off, you called me autistic and told me not to reproduce. You, again, made this personal first and were the only one slinging insults here between the two of us. Get the fuck out of here with being attacked and being bullied, or at least have a leg to stand on if you're gonna throw that shit around "
719,estp,"Well ESTPs have Si as an ignored function. So while they should easily connect to their bodily sensations, it's usually subconsciously ignored for the sake Se or external stimuli. That said ESTPs are often very active and will be very brutal with their body without realizing it.
Be careful because you might pay for it when you're older."
720,estp,"Long post ahead :D
​
TDLR: I'm an INFP dating an ESTP. We were friends first, so I'm comfortable with him and can roast the fuck out of him without feeling guilty, and overall this comfort has helped communication. However, this boy isn't that deep (inevitable sensor vs intuitive dynamic) and I can't tell if he isn't deep because 1) he does have deeper thoughts but doesn't know how to articulate or 2) he's just not that deep. ESTPs, please help me understand you so I can understand him.
​
I'm an INFP in a relationship with an ESTP. We were friends for a few years first, and we kind of accidentally fell into a relationship. Because we were first friends, I was already comfortable with him and can be pretty blunt with him (relative to how I am with other friends), which has helped with communication (it was only after reading through the INFP thread that I realized INFPs in general aren't great at communicating…yay I'm not alone :))
My ESTP is super sweet, and I love him. However, he's still an ESTP - meaning there are inevitable disconnects when it comes to communication, handling emotions (I need time alone after a stressful period / argument, and he gets really sad), etc. While I do feel these disconnects can be bridged through better communication, one area I'm struggling with is the lack of ""deep"" conversations. I feel like he doesn't ""get"" me as easily as other N types. I had foreseen this and mentally prepared myself for an uphill battle, but I also feel like I don't understand him as intimately as I do my other friends, because he doesn't allow me to peek into his brain through deeper conversations - it could be he's not accustomed to articulating his thoughts out loud, or because as a sensor type, he just doesn't have ""deeper"" thoughts - meaning more intellectual thoughts, being more reflective / introspective, etc. We've talked about this, and as a first step, I'm trying to train him to be more reflective by having him reflect on his day to day to me when we talk at night. However, I feel like he views this more as a chore than as something that is enriching him…any ESTPs out there willing to provide a peek at an ESTP thought process? :)"
721,estp,"INFP dating ESTP. I think you just aren’t asking the right questions. ESTPs are super smart and deep, don’t let that bias fool you. One of the things I noticed off the bat about mine was that he simply could not be bothered to contemplate unrealistic what-if questions, and he’s not super interested in feely sensitive stuff. But if I ask him something about the complexity of reality, he can be very deep and precise to the point of sounding cruel, which is basically because he is describing how things work as opposed to how they feel. I’d say if you want him to learn to be more squishy and sensitive with you, then you gotta meet him halfway somehow (not just roasting).
Edit: one more thing, it might help you to rely on other friends for those N dominant conversations. ESTPs are basically exactly the opposite of us, which is what makes them attractive to us. However, it’s also betraying/devaluing their individuality/nature in a sense to ask them to talk/think like we do. Do you think you would really be as attracted to him if he was an intuitive? Also I’m sure he does think it’s a chore, but the fact that he’s doing it at all shows he cares."
722,estp,"Not an ESTP but an ENTJ (26f) dating an ESTP (28m).
What I’ve come to learn is that it’s not that they’re “not deep” or not “as introspective and reflective”— rather it’s that they are sensors. 
Their primary mode of living means they’re consistently living in the present and taking all the little details in, this makes them great athletes and survivalist. Their ability to navigate their environments helps them use a lot of their practical and social skills—that takes strategy but unbeknown to them. 
I wouldn’t confuse “deep” for “abstract” or “profound.” There is a level of meaning and depth in mentally living in the present—only their living it in the actual moment. 
This is just my observation, any ESTP can dispute this."
723,estp,"I know my ESTP is really smart, and he has provided interesting insight on various topics before - but you're right, they need to be asked the right questions. What kind of questions have you asked your ESTP? I'm struggling to find discussion topics to stimulate ""deeper"" conversations that is interesting for both of us. He can talk for hours about his sensory interests (food, wine, really nice hotels) and I listen but...it's not the most interesting topic for me :) I have learned a lot though!
Side note: I find it interesting that almost all of my ESTP's close friends are N dominant - maybe he was drawn to how differently they process things?  But he does complain that they talk too much about things that don't matter 
Also, for context, I bring up roasting to illustrate that I'm not afraid to be blunt with him (which INFPs can have trouble with), since I usually never roast / tease people like I do with him - I'm usually too sensitive to other people's feelings, so I rarely say anything mean, even jokingly. I roast my ESTP lovingly (and he knows it) :)"
724,estp,"That's an interesting way to look at it.
The thing is, I've been able to have more meaningful conversations with 2 of my other S-dominant friends (ESTJ and ISFJ), so I know it's possible. They're not dominant extroverted sensors though, so I guess that's the difference?
One of my ESTP's good friends is an ENTJ. He joked that once you remove an object from my ESTP's field of vision, it no longer exists for him (of course not entirely true, but true for most things)"
725,estp,"If I may be bold enough to say that it might be unfair for seek a quality or feature in someone that they are not highlighting as a strong suit.
You’re an intuitive looking for qualities of intuition in a sensor lieu of learning to appreciate the qualities that come from moment to moment experience and worldview. 
If this is a quality you seek it might be worth reconsidering your perspective."
726,estp,"I guess I'm more so looking for ways to connect with him on a deeper level - he's demonstrated he's capable of thinking beyond surface-level day to day and he's shared surprisingly insightful advice / thoughts before. I might not be engaging him correctly or asking the right questions. Or rather, I know of topics he's thought in depth about, but they're not topics that are necessarily ""deep"" (food, wine, etc). 
Another thought I'm debating - if certain traits can be ""taught"", like being more introspective / reflective, and to your point, if it's fair to want him to learn them. I personally think it's worth a shot, because as his gf, I want to meet him halfway. And on my end, I can appreciate his sensory hobbies more (e.g. learning about the different types of wine so we can enjoy and discuss together).  As an INFP, all we want are deep conversations :) so of course we want to have them with our SOs!"
727,estp,"I hear you loud and clear and I understand you have identified a need that appears to have a lot of value and reward for you, however I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that you're actively LOOKING for a quality and even considering what things you should improve (aka change) so that you fulfill this need. I get it, we all do it. We are creatures that get near honey and runaway from bees but this is exactly the point--you are getting to know SOMEONE ELSE, this means that they are DIFFERENT. Meaning you have to decide if those qualities will produce whatever it is that will meet your needs or maybe that person isn't cutting it. 
​
I also suppose my ENTJness is coming out and I don't mean to be so blunt but I want to offer advise that lets you see things differently, even if you decide something independently else."
728,estp,"All good I appreciate your input! In true INFP fashion, I’m replying days later heh (tho life has also been super hectic these past few days). 
I’ve thought on this and dug through the ESTP subreddit more as well. I’m quite surprised by how many ESTP/INFP pairings there are, and the INFP always brings up the same inability to connect with their ESTP partners. 
I suppose when I say “deep” conversations, I don’t mean conversations about abstract thought/theories/stuff that definitely wont interest him. I have this desire to understand my bf, and I equate that with talking about our perspectives, values, thought processes on reaching decisions, etc. Almost like thinking out loud. Talking about times we feel vulnerable. He doesn’t have to change to talk to me about these things - maybe it’s just something that will come with time. 
With your bf, what are some interesting things you’ve talked about? Have you reached a point where he shares more vulnerable thoughts with you?
Separately, I’m rather new to MBTI and this all just really fascinates me."
729,estp,"So, I am an ISFJ and I have been going out with an ESTP for a couple of months. But, I met him when he had just broken up with his ex-fiance (they lived together for 4 years) a year ago. It did not end well, since she cheated on him. At that time, he seemed fine and kept saying he was not feeling anything. Months passed and by the time I met him again, he looked like he changed a lot, but just superficially. Now he goes to the gym everyday, listens to some weird philosophy podcast from Patrice O'neal, anti-feminist to say the least, and says he doesn't want a relationship ever again. 
Truth is, he does. From the things he told me, he seems to be just trying to find a girl with the same bitchy and loud personality and appearance to, maybe, take on her all the things he could not do before. Or maybe he wanna find someone like her again and pretend nothing ever happened. 
I told him, what I think before. I've told him that the longer you stay not moving on from your ex-cheating girl the better she looks. He's not listening though. 
My question is: from a former ESTP, if you were in the  same situation as him, what do you think people could do to help you move on?
PS: We are not dating anymore. I am trying to move on as well. But I'm asking because I care, still."
730,estp,"What do you mean by former? This guy sounds A LOT like me.. I was in a relationship for 4 years, she didn't cheat but did some really shady stuff. Now it's been 3 years and I have basically sworn off relationships, go to the gym every day, and fuck around because it's fun. 
I know from my experience that outside people aren't going to ""help him move on"". As an ESTP, I'm not going to believe something unless I understand why I need to believe it; and a lot of times that comes from inside me.
Time and self-realization are his friends."
731,estp,"The issue with ESTP is that as long as you keep telling them to do something,  they will stir away from it.
Whatever you say, do not force anything onto him...
He seems to be lost,  which is fine and happens a lot. We love random philosophy,  life's advice etc...
If you have certain stuff in video/podcast form, easy to digest,  just send those random stuff.
Maybe he will take it the wrong way,but when he will be ready might even come back to you and ask for it..
So: casually dropping life advices would work in the long run. 
For those issues my favorite book would be :
-The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen covey (estp according to celebrity types haha)
-Letting go: a pathway to surrender by Davis Hawkins 
-The subtle art of not giving a fuck (maybe he's not ready for that one, itight comfort him in his behaviour xD)
Overall books/philosophy that strive to give a Buddhist approach to the world, accepting injustice etc...
Seems like he needs some Ni pump right now ;)
Question though:
If you don't date him anymore,  what would you help? Don't you consider its not your problem anymore? 
(I'm genuinely curious, and surprised,not judging)"
732,estp,"Sorry, I meant ""former"" as a formality only. English is not my native language, anyway. I just wanted replies from ESTP's.
Thanks I'll keep that in mind, but basically... you cannot see the appeal of having a relationship so it doesn't really matter who you are with... Does it? Maybe I should try focus on that instead. "
733,estp,"You're suggestions were very helpful! Thanks. That sounded exactly like him. 

That's a tough question, I'll try to be as honest as I can. I like honesty, straight-forwardness and spontaneity. I don't think he's lying to me about his life issues that I wrote here. That's why I would like to help. That being said, I understand that is not my problem anymore. However, feelings/love should be always unconditional, that's just what I think. And that's why, as long as I don't let this take over my life, I feel free of guilt. (this would never happen if we ended up baldy tho) 
"
734,estp,"Right now I'd say I'm in a irrationally selfish place in life. I know it's not the best thing, but I'm basically very picky and focusing on bettering myself while I'm young (almost 24). 
You know your situation better than I do. But in my experience, I needed space and time to myself to realize some big things. As hard as it may be to not want to help him, he may need this space too."
735,estp,"Thanks again! I am a 24 years old ISFJ tho... I guess it is harder for me to understand because I don't really think one need to be alone to focus on oneself. I mean, to me, self-improvement could keep happening if you let someone else inside your life. But I understand you might be very giving when it comes to relationships and that's probably holding you back.
Anyway, you guys making my ISFJ life much harder laugh"
736,estp,"Hi guys, INTJ here. I'd like some advice. I was reading this book about hiring others. The practice task it set out was that I should (a) list out the desirable qualities in a co-worker, and (b) write out questions that could help identify those traits easily.
So I've come up with a list of trait and I wanted to pick your brain to see if you could think up any good screening questions.


Sincerity/Honesty


Communicative or open to communication


Reasonable and willing to look at things in a new way


Supportive/Empathetic


Stable, not likely to quit a job at the drop of a hat


Thank you!"
737,estp,"Thought of a couple questions that may help:
How have you handled disputes between other coworkers and yourself?
Describe a time where you have had to compromise with other coworkers.
How would you interact with a coworker who recently lost a close family member?
Just some of the first things that came to mind"
738,estp,"My loyalty is in my family above anything else. I'll flake on my closest friends if I have a family commitment and I don't care how that impacts people around me. If I fight with my family, I'll have forgotten it hours later, regardless of how big the fight is, so I never stay mad at them. 
Also, I don't know how much of that is my family centered Hispanic culture or my personality type. "
739,estp,"They're the only people I actually like/trust most of the time. Even when they piss me off its like ""Well shit I'm stuck with these assholes forever so I might as well deal with it.""
That being said, they never usually piss me off. For some reason they listen to and do almost whatever I say. Probably because I'm like really smart and know a lot of common sense shit that other people don't. "
740,estp,"My ESTP friend did this very horribly to his wife (ENFJ). But yeah... she initiated it, and afterwards wanting to get back together was no option for him.
They both look horribly sad tho at the moment."
741,estp,"I believe I am in the same boat. I love my family, but not to the point where I have to talk to them everyday. I could go on without speaking them on the phone for over a week or month but still love them very much."
742,estp,"I only understood 20% of that comment before I had to look up the rest.
Ok, let’s get something straight; I ain’t cute. In fact, I’M THE TRUE PUSSY DESTROYER! 
Secondly, I ain’t into that “boku no pico” bullshit so you can fantasise about an ENFP if you’re looking for that sort of interaction.
Thirdly (which I know isn’t a fuckin word but neither is “UwU” it’s more of an expression)
If this in any way has to do with a sexual compliment...I shall accept it and declined all these previous complaints.
Fourthly, 
Please Take a seat. 
What are you doing here?
What were you planning to do tonight? 
Hi, this is Chris Hanson from Dateline NBC...."
743,estp,"I'm almost in the middle of ISTP and ESTP so take this with a grain of salt, but it takes a lot of pessimism and brainless actions to get me close to being angry. Threatening my well-being, in some cases, works too."
744,estp,"I’m questioning the “Stammering Comment”
Cause, if I’m right, I spelt everything quite fluently.
I did not respond by saying W-w-w-hat d-d-d-d-DO Y-YOU M-M-M-M-MMM-M-M-EAN!?
Edit; This comment took place 11 days ago.
I make use of my time. 
So “My” time passes by much more smoothly compared to your own “Doings” "
745,estp,"Really?
I can’t be as bad as some of the ESTPs on this subreddit?
I’m only 17!
^ I don’t know if that matters but I’m young...so imma use that as MY excuse.
Edit; now I see that the majority of the ESTPs are backstabbers....
Hmm, okay.
I can work with that..."
746,estp,"I'm a strong extrovert so I know what it feels like to be surrounded by people/ friends all day, but at the end of the day we can be reminded that we are truly alone in this world and that in it of can be a refreshing experience lol"
747,estp,"But you merely adopted the dark; I was born in it, moulded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but BLINDING! The shadows betray you, because they belong to me - istp"
748,estp,"If you aren't, why not? 
I'm curious to hear new viewpoints, as Ive always been in the middle about religion. Sure, I'll go to church with my family on the occasion and maybe pray to God while having a major breakdown, but other than that... I don't believe that God created us, the creatures and our world, etc."
749,estp,"Probably not common here but I’m pretty deeply religious. However the denomination I follow breaks it down in a very logical but sometimes cold way. 
I’ve made it a cornerstone to my life but that does not come without my doubts. I guess that’s why it’s called faith."
750,estp,Do any of you guys suffer from a terrible memory? I have a really hard time remembering things from a week ago. There will be events from a few months back that friends will tell me what I did like I wasn't even there. It's almost like 50 first dates all over again :/
751,estp,"I have an awful memory! Passing exams isn't too bad, given enough time I can force myself to memorise just enough info. HOWEVER my partner says something, I'm genuinely interested and I've forgotten later that day."
752,estp,My memory isn't nearly as bad as yours but I don't have the best memory ever. Sometimes it's like I'm watching my memories in blurry cable as opposed to HD. I still remember everything that happens it just isn't so clear. 
753,estp,"Sounds just like me. The only things I remember (extremely vividly) are major life events, my mushroom trip O-:), and details about girls that I'm interested in when I first meet them. Other than that, I think we're masters of traversing through life/conversations and have a natural script for everything so most things don't stick out... (If we're all as similar as I think we are)"
754,estp,"I remember always scoring top on the timed reading/context type tests in school. But ask me 5 minutes later what the story was about, and I'd forgotten all about it. I'm in university now, and I feel like I struggle hard to remember stuff from the beginning of the semester to the exam. And when exams are done, it's all gone. I prefer to cram the last week before the exam, and spend the rest of the semester outside. I hate it everytime,  but it always happens."
755,estp,Same!  I'm an expert at cramming for an hour before the test (occasionally with a little addy lol) then acing it but definitely does nothing for longterm memory...but when it comes to remembering my experiences with ladies I (mostly) never forget haha
756,estp,"I'm an English teacher in high school, and I wanted to know what to add to my lessons to make them engaging/interesting/fun for ESTPs and SPs in general. I think I want to add it as an activity at the beginning of the lesson as a warmup or maybe in the form of questions or activities throughout my lessons. 
I would really appreciate it if you could let me know what questions really get your minds going and getting creative. 
I was thinking that maybe I could start my lessons with an individual written activity or group work with a real-life scenario/dilemma and asking students to defend their position with a reason or explanation. 
What do you think? I've had students who say that we never do Anything, and I just don't get it. We are not in PE? What can I do to get everyone involved? 
I can get students to stand up and discuss with other students whom they normally don't talk to to collaborate with them, to interview each other, and to ask them questions to get different perspectives. Then, we can switch partners up to three times to get variety. 
What do you think? Please let me know what your teachers did in academic classes like history, math and science, and especially in English to get your attention and input. 
Thank you X1000!!!!"
757,estp,"I hated English lit, but am good at English, a definite crossroads. The worst part of it was literary analysis for me. I hated sitting there cross examining every little detail of something, trying to find meaning in stuff that may have been written exactly literally and that's it. Face value, nothing more.
We spent an entire class period analyzing one poem, and at the end I asked ""What if the author just likes sunsets, so he wrote about it?""
Got suspended for that "
758,estp,"Fantastic question.
I'm an ESTP, when I was in High School and had to do language. My teacher found out that presenting and debating was one of my best expertise, also time assignments. 
She used to do this thing when we had to do an assignment in 10 minutes or less. I found myself thriving in that environment because it was fast. You can easily engage me if there is something to persuade people with and if I need to do it fast."
759,estp,"To be honest I never read. If I felt like it I’d read summaries of the assigned chapters in case we would be assessed on it in class. Winged all but one of them with an A by just putting in a shred of effort here and there. That other class was an accelerated class that I just got through by talking to people I knew and paying attention here and there. Although it certainly helped that the teacher didn’t give a damn about how we behaved since she was leaving the next year. I could’ve put a bit more work into the class but I was dealing with a heavy workload from another class I was taking and took a pass on most extra credit opportunities.
As for discussion time, I was sort of involved. I’m just not very good in developing my thoughts in a flowing manner so I often felt reluctant to share in discussions for fear of being judged by others for what I said.
But to directly answer your question, the fun little presentations and mini-projects was what really made me feel engaged in the class.
edit- formatting and clarification"
760,estp,"That is interesting. So being kind and assigning individual/group presentations. Very nice. 
What types of questions got your attention the most? 
Who/main people/character analysis
What/plot analysis
When/time/sequence of events
Where/location/setting/culture/era
Why/analyze why characters do what they do/analyze motive
How/explain with facts how the characters ended up where they did. 
Thanks"
761,estp,"Eh, it's cool. My advice I guess would be openness to that mindset, as it really is difficult to think that way if it's unstated. Your ESTP students may have trouble with it.
Likewise, when I said I'm good at English, I'm good in a technical sense. Reports, resumes, instructional sets, functional things. I couldn't write a creative short story about what I did yesterday if my life depended on it. Another thing to keep in mind 
Our interest will be piqued by fiction or whatnot if it's something that they find interesting. That's how it is for me at least. Otherwise I couldn't care less
Edit: I wanna echo the interesting teacher point. It's great to see people who aren't doing their same song and dance, and that you can just tell they love what they do. Those have been my favorite professors now that I'm in college, regardless of whether or not I care for the subject "
762,estp,"I don’t like INFPs.
So, I commented in an INFPs post in the MBTI subreddit saying that “I don’t like INFPs” I got into an argument Blah Blah Blah. Next day I was banned for 30 days. And then it changed to a permanent ban for no reason.
So, I got pissed and went to the INFP subreddit to express some “disliking towards them” if you get my drift. And then....I got permanently banned from there.
Then! I went to the ENTP subreddit to discuss getting banned from those 2 subreddits in less than a day (which apparently counted for quadruple posting) So, I got banned for 7 days there.
(They also Muted me from contacting the moderators)
I then went to the ESTP and INTJ subreddit. So for the past day or two I’ve been lingering about here and the INTJ subreddit because I got nothing else to do."
763,estp,"1. ""Well, now I’m banned from the MBTI subreddit and the INFP subreddit."" 
2. ""I got permanently banned from the MBTI subreddit."" 
3. ""Um, I got permanently banned from the MBTI subreddit. 😐"" 
4. ""Well, it’s official...I got band of the MBTI subreddit for 30 days.""  "
764,estp,"
The INTP subreddit is run by an INTP. Oh wait, he doesn't ban people.
The moderator of ENTP is either ESTx or xSFx.
The one for INTJ is either stupidly thin skinned or INFx. Mind you, he'd be par for the course for those losers.
ENTJ's moderator is ENTJ and even one of the ENTJs that aren't revolted by ENTJ enough to leave for ENTP.

You know, all these stupid codes make it near impossible to read."
765,estp,"I mentioned in a few subreddits that they should ONLY allow the type of that specific subreddit to moderate the SUBREDDIT!  
I wouldn’t of been banned for 7 (3 days now) from my own home of “ENTPsubreddit” if an ENTP had been moderating it."
766,estp,"Smart, funny exhibitionists who let them do the driving, ime.  They'll call the number that says, ""for a good time call _"" just to check it out. ;) You can totally meet one at a swinger's party, or any kind of big festival.  Or skiing.  Dress hot but not high maintenance and don't play games: jump them when their blood is up or they'll move on.  They're not exactly sitting home alone all day waiting for Ms. Right, but Ms. Right Now isn't getting any judgment for being forward or fast.  Do not be a sourpuss, that's key."
767,estp,"Just broke up with a girl because, although very good-looking, grounded and a bright future, she was too damn boring. She didn't seem to have much of a personality. She didn't challenge me, never really wanted to do exciting things, never gave me butterflies, never took risks. You should really embrace the idea of doing & action to appeal to an ESTP guy. This doesn't mean you have to want to go for an adventurous hike or something every day, but just be seeking out new things and be challenging your partner. That's the biggest thing for me."
768,estp,"Oh snap! You're right... like i don't think i could even be jealous... i'd just be too god damn into that.
I want to help you out so here's some very broad ""unattractive"" qualities. This may not be relevant for all estp's...
Overly judgemental; this only really applies to negative judgements such as; ""i don't like xxx food"", or ""i'd never do this"". An estp is going to be more comfortable with someone who is excited to try new things. Or may take pleasure in getting you to try stuff... mixed bag i guess. Depends how it goes down. But outright refusal to play would be a boner killer.
Too fussy; i can handle most any situation... but if it seems like the purpose of an exercise is to evoke a specific reaction from me then i would consider it manipulation. Unless the reaction was super crazy good for me. But it's it was conceited i don't want to be controlled like that. Being straightforward about what you want from the estp is probably important (if you're not getting it).
So this was surprisingly difficult."
769,estp,Because I don't have time or care to sit around controlling other people and sitting at the computer all day. I'm out in the real world. DOING THINGS. No offense to these people - we need them. But I can't see a true ESTP doing that job. Very boring. 
770,estp,"it's been few months since I have been seriously studying MBTI types and now am at a point where I start to ""type"" all the people around me. So far I don't have an information of other ESTP out there, of course there are, but apparently not very close to me. I really need to talk to other ESTP's to better understand the type.
Before I found out about MBTI and and me as a ESTP, I was really always wondering why do I have such need to meet new people all the time? I even have a job that requires meeting new people constantly, besides most of the time I have to be the initiator of this meeting. Meanwhile, there are times when I don't talk to anyone and even in the busiest environment (party) can ignore everybody and just be in my own world.
All you, ESTP's out there, are you always eager to meet new people? Are there any here that don't feel like doing it and are good with the few they know?"
771,estp,"I rather like to stick to my circle of friends, I don't mind meeting new people at all, but I don't focus my attention on it. If someone new shows up, I'm glad to have a nice chat and consider meeting the person again in a more private setting if he/she turns out to be interesting, but I don't mind if I stay with the people I know.
But then again my E and S ratios are close to zero, so I'm really much more of a thinker."
772,estp,"I'm a strong ESTP, by that I mean I am very one-sided on all four categories. I do have a constant desire to meet new people, which like you, I do everyday in my line of work. Meeting shy, introverted people is particularly interesting. I take it as a personal challenge to get them out of their comfort zone in some way. When I succeed, they become boring and I move on to the next person. 
I relate with your second point as well. I can keep to myself in social situations if the mood strikes. Sometimes just observing my surroundings is interesting enough to keep my attention. Pair that with the secondary trait of introverted thinking, and often times my own thoughts are enough entertainment."
773,estp,"I'm apparently ESTP now even though in the past I've been ENTJ, ISTP, INTJ.
I'm a loner but I go out and meet people all the time.
Usually it's easiest to get to know the host of whatever that event is.
You go to a place enough and you'll end up being a regular.
I'm not going to advise on what that event is. You go figure out your hobbies.
(EDIT: I'll add a bit more. 
Once you hit regular status, it's a piece of cake to get comfortable with new people (in my case new women) that come in to the scene (in my case it's certain bar). It's a high chance that anyone who wants to meet ""new people"" are usually trying to date. It's like the only goal which people place incredible burdens and excuses upon themselves. I'm never really interested in ""Bros"" and ""need a wingman, make a gameplan"" types so if you are like me, you should find a good place and work on being a regular so that you can focus on people rather than people + territory."
774,estp,I have to meet new people and if I'm not doing it in real life I'm doing it on tinder or some shit. Or talking to old friends on Facebook. Granted there is a 50% chance I am esfp but we are both similar in that regard. But I'd say if I had a choice I'd choose a small group of always loyal friends over a large group of acquaintances which is what I have now.
775,estp,"I've been called a sensation addict but I don't see myself that way. It's more the rush of overcoming something challenging rather than the adrenaline. That's like a nice bonus to the after effect but not what I concentrate on. Like, I don't take stupid risks, at least from my point of view. "
776,estp,"As a matter of fact no, its not fucking true, and it'd annoying how big this stereotype is. Yes, I'm a ESTP but I don't do stupid shit. I get my Se from working out with weights or calisthenics, doing sprints, driving in a car and enjoying the scenery, eating food, drinking alcohol or getting high,playing video games, going on boat or Jet ski rides, shooting hoops, buying expensive clothing and technology,and mainly rollar coasters or water slides. But the big things that ESTPs are credited with doing fucking gives me anxiety, like driving fast and possibly hitting something then totaling your car and having to pay with money you don't fucking have, going sky diving, skiing down a mountain, driving a motorcycle then possibly getting hit and not being able to walk again or even function, jumping off buildings into pools below, etc. My biggest fear is being paralyzed and not being able to function or take care of myself or stay in shape and I think that's why I got these fears. In a weird way I'm kinda jealous of other dominant Se's, it sucks that I don't got that courage, I also have social anxiety at times so I appwar stand offish at times. I also got a short temper and get frustarted for not being capable of doing really daring and dangerous shit even though deep down I really want to, smfh. I should've been born a Entp, cause at least then I wouldn't feel like something's wrong with me"
777,estp,"sort of. 
I don't do stupid things though, like jumping into a pile of cactus or driving fast from a police car.
I have a tendency to drive too fast, or have the urge to go past a red light when i see I can make it through, but I don't do it. 
Idk personally it manifests in me trying new things (firing guns at a shooting range, driving by motorcycle, swimming laps, PKing other people on runescape). Also traveling helps ease my tension a bit.  "
778,estp,"Hahaha I just spent 3 hours ripping round Bangkok on a scooter, half the time with no helmet on. 
Also it’s not so much about the adrenaline as the focus required. When you’re trying to keep yourself alive you have no other thoughts in your mind. I can’t help it living on the edge is way too much fun. I can’t reach this kind of intense Se focus using any of my other functions. "
779,estp,"I agree, I have ESTP friends like this. As an adrenaline junkie, they only rated themself 6/10, but then I question all the silly shit they've done... we raised it to an 8/10.
I have other friend types that are more seekers of adrenaline than the ESTP, which is surprising."
780,estp,"I completely get it... I was able to overcome this fear though by watching people do crazy shit and not get hurt.
Think about this, all it takes is for you to jerk the wheel to the left/right on a freeway and you could die. All it takes is for somebody ELSE to do that and you die. But you still drive right?
​
Practice DOES make perfect, but other variables influence that perfection.
​
Watch somebody like ally law https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCagHkTCCSbohFMJln7JYqMQ an absolute MADLAD (lol) who could easily kill himself with one slip... BUT HE NEVER HAS!
​
I'm not saying go climb a skyscraper, in fact he even says not to do it with no exp. But you CAN work your way up to it... to where its as trivial as walking on the sidewalk. Just takes time.
​
Practice practice practice, because one day you won't be able to anymore (Old age if nothing else)"
781,estp,"I think there's a big difference between driving at 60 mph and climbing a 800 foot tall skyscrapper lol but I get what you're trying to say. I am slowly losing my fears but they're still there, in the pit of my stomach"

783,estp,"I think it’s just most of the time things Se enjoys are outdoorsy adrenaline inducing things but I just do it to flex the Se rather than for the adrenaline. The rush is usually pretty sweet though, when you do something gnarly and come out the other side having survived oh man, what a rush. "
784,estp,"I’m not too outdoorsy- but I do enjoy riding my motorcycle, watching or playing sports, and cooking (I run a food truck)- I think with all of those things (plus regular busy life) my Se stays pretty stimulated "
785,estp,"I personally find it sickening. There's so much hate, it's basically a guide to becoming a psychopath. Sure, if you want results with women it might get you there, but you'll become a complete jerk in the process. "
786,estp,"Im a fan of it. People in the 16-22 age range tend to not be. But you are older and more experienced and have seen divorces, cheating, branch-swinging, cognitive dissonance, ingroup bias, preselection bias, etc.... then you might enjoy it
I was a virgin at 19 and would have rejected theredpill's ideas. But by age 25 Id had many relationships and slept with 50 or so women, and you do start noticing patterns and differences between women and men. 
My friends who are in sales would have no problem with TRP and would agree with nearly all of it. My friends in software (who also are liberal / guardian readers) would totally reject it and see it as hate speech and something that should be banned
One of the main lessons that theredpill tries to teach is that what women want in a man and what they say they want can be total opposites. That can be hard to believe at first for many guys"
787,estp,"So... I've recently started dating an ENFP. When we're together, we're awesome. We feed off of each other and I could honestly see falling in love with this girl. But when we're off doing our own things she seems distant and erm... Uninterested?
I have already learned that, without pushing too hard, communication is a huge thing for us to stay on the same page, and we both feel better after.
But I guess I'm concerned that I'm barking up a difficult compatibility tree here.
Thoughts? Am I just over-thinking this? 😬"
788,estp,"I’m an ESTP married to an ENFP! I think what’s more important than our personality types are our goals and interests. We both have similar ideas of success and happiness, just have different approaches to get there. I think you could definitely be compatible as long as you’re both willing to work toward it. Of course you’ll have your challenges, but what relationship doesn’t? "
789,estp,"I’m also dating an ENFP and have been doing that for 2 years. 
It is going to be A LOT of work, but as long as you guys like and love each other enough and communicate really well, it can really work. My SO and I have been through some rough patches, but always came out stronger than before. We know each other really well and we discovered that it’s important for both parties to be aware of their differences. 
There will be a lot of misunderstandings, but as long as you solve them right away; you can really be compatible. It just takes more work than it normally would take, but if you are willing to put in that work; it will get to be a fullfilling and loving relationship."
790,estp,"Omg this is me and my ESTP boyfriend. In person we are so good together but when it comes to texting our conversations are so dull. I want to have a deep meaningful conversations over text and talk about the most random things we think of and desires we have for life. But we often just go back and forth about being tired, wanting food, and silly things happening at that very moment. I went off to Army Basic Training last summer and when I got back things were so different. We are close again now but it was really slow at first. Now I'm worried because he is leaving this summer for Airforce Basic Training and then onto job training and then I'm also going to my job training for the Army. I'm in the reserves but he's active duty so he could be sent anywhere afterwards. He seems like he is wanting to stay committed and has made many comments about wanting to get married and having a future with me, but it's just the long distance I'm worried about and not seeing each other in person. I sure hope our communication gets better before all that long distance stuff takes place.
Do you ESTPs think that the texting conversations with ENFPs are dull as well? Or is that just on the ENFP side? 
Lol I'm sorry, I just stalked this feed, saw this post, and had to comment😂"
791,estp,"Thanks everyone for the input! It's been really nice to hear other's perspectives.
One question I have: is this thing with her being slightly aloof a semi normal thing between ESTPs and ENFPs? Or is this something unique to my situation?
Thanks again! "
792,estp,"Hey guys! I'm currently interested in a guy at work who I'm fairly (but not completely) sure is ESTP, so I figured I'd come to you all for some advice. I'm having trouble determining whether he's interested in me or not - normally I'd go the direct route and ask him out or something, but this is at work so I'm a bit more hesitant and want to gauge where I stand before trying anything.
We only see each other at work, used to chat a bit online (he would always initiate, a lot of the time it seemed like he'd try keep the conversation going, but I'm not sure if it's just you ESTPs and talking a lot! haha) but that was more than a month ago and now we only talk when we see each other at work.
He used to jokingly flirt, make jokes about me missing him or would call me bae etc, but I think he does that with everyone. He hasn't done it the last few times I've seen him, but I'm not sure if that's enough to say that he's stopped completely.
Sometimes I feel like he treats me differently from the rest of the crew (he's really helpful in general, but seems to keep more of an eye out for me?), but I'm not sure if that part is my mind playing tricks on me.
Sometimes I just feel like I'm just another friend though. The other day he was scrolling through Facebook and just casually pointed out some girl he had hooked up with in the past. Would you guys take that as a big flag that he isn't interested?
Anyways, don't want to ramble on so feel free to ask for more detail/clarification. Thanks guys!"
793,estp,"Pointing out a girl that he hooked up with? No, this means nothing at all other than it happened to be on the screen. ESTP blunt and honest. It shows that he respects you enough to tell you right away and may actually have been trying to show off that good looking people want to do him!
Yeah okay he's likes your attention. So it's like this; he probably feels the same thing you do. It's work, right? He doesn't want to make a mess. But he's definately thought about it by now!
I agree with Flux
So it might put him on the spot and feel awkward if you just asked him out. I'd avoid that unless you're in a social environment and, like... you want that sexy time tonight, lol. If you want to ramp up the flirting then wait until he's hit on you and give him a sexy wink - it'll probably blow his mind :)
And it's mysterious. Or mischievous! I dunno maybe it's just me but if you're both holding eye contact a wink is a good way to send a message because it's kinda discreet. You can probably think of a better alternative way to show him because you know this person. I'm just rambling."
794,estp,"Personally, if you're mildly attractive you're almost there. I like being teased a lot as well. Other than that I just want someone to stare into the blackness and loneliness of my heart and still care.
That might just be me though. 
Based on the ESTP type it's very likely that he'll like the chase. Sure, someone that feeds are ego is nice, but I don't know if that lasts.
Be nice but not too nice.
If he likes you it'll be obvious. Wanting to do stuff with you, caring about your thoughts on things. Teasing too. That's a BIG turn on for me. If he's showing an interest, you should try and show interest but don't scare him away. Although I like straightforwardness it DEFINITELY gives over power. Be intriguing.. 
If you think he likes you, he does.
As for the comment, he probably didn't mean it that way. I've been told I'm insensitive. And it's a common thing for ESTPs to be unaware. I've made it a rule to stop talking about other girls around anyone that I might be interested in in the future."
795,estp,"As an ESTP, I struggle with settling for monogamy. 
I suspect this guy, if he is one, is in the same boat. 
Few things to know about us/me:
1)Highly flirtatious
2)Struggle with vulnerability to the point that we need to be told that we aren't opening up
3)Highly sensitive to someone if they are paying us extra attention (we know as soon as someone likes us) and probably try to impress them to keep the attention
4)Our actions reflect our thought process (if we like/want someone we will go for it. If we don't, we won't go for it but we might still flirt)
I recommend you take every bit of my advice with a grain of salt because ESTP's especially are very different. Some are cognizant of their Te functionality, some aren't and, some repress their Fe functionality while some are fully aware of it.
So, this ESTP could be charming but an awful boyfriend. Or extremely self aware - and he would likely go for you if that were the case.
Speaking as an ESTP, I know I have this deep feeling that I don't belong in a relationship until I figure out myself because I acknowledge my weaknesses(Fe specifically). So, be wary of us - we're a charming bunch"
796,estp,"My husband's an ESTP and I still haven't gotten him to understand that I don't like it when he talks about girls he used to sleep with.  I met him at work, coincidentally. 
I don't know if all ESTPs are like this, but he tends not to have a filter when he's in more relaxed situations.  He also doesn't pick up on hints very well, so you might have to be obvious about your interest.  "
797,estp,"Hey, she was actually really pretty! I think what you said might actually apply.
Anyways, yeah I'm not sure if he's ""obvious"", I personally don't feel like he is so I'm not too sure. I have quite a few upcoming shifts with him though so I guess I'll see. I'll keep what you've said in mind, thanks! :)"
798,estp,"Thanks for the input! 
I definitely see this in one of my ESTP guy friends; at the moment he's super hesitant about relationships because he feels like he isn't mature enough to be in one, and other reasons to do with his weaknesses. 
I suspect the guy I'm interested in could be the same.
Could you elaborate a bit on this point? Do you actually want to open up to someone but feel too vulnerable, or is it just the case where you don't like opening up? It sounds like it's the former, but let me know!"
799,estp,"Hahaha, it doesn't bother me, I'm just not sure if I should take it as a sign he's not interested. But from what I've gathered here, I guess it isn't necessarily a bad sign?
I think I definitely will try being more obvious! Thanks :)"
800,estp,"I definitely get the teasing, but I'm not sure if he does that to everyone. 
Also another thing - sometimes I get the impression he is trying to impress me, like the other day at work he called me over to where he was just to show me a smart thing he'd done haha. But again, not sure if that's just how he is.
Building on what you said about ESTPs being unaware, he's mentioned before that he's super dense when it comes to knowing if someone is interested in him. :') I also get the impression he's the type that takes a lot for him to be genuinely interested in someone...
Oh and, I'm INFJ. As for how I am around him, I'm half sarcasm half normal ahaha, I guess what you would call ""nice but not too nice"". I think I need to work on being obvious from my end though!
Thanks for your reply :)"
801,estp,"I suspect the guy I'm interested in could be the same.
Yes, I think a huge part of our functionality is we are social perfectionists. It's likely if he's never been in a long term relationship he has no idea how to do it but he wants it and it makes him anxious. Meaning that you might have to take the initiative in a lot of those steps. If you are looking for a fuck buddy or hook up then he will likely excel but that doesn't seem like what you want. 
Me personally, I love opening up. In social situations I've been known to open up too much and it leaves some Introverted people disliking/being intimidated by me. But when it comes to a relationship, I overthink it- I get scared of the commitment and, I keep them at arms length while I try to figure it out. While what I think you're supposed to do is relax. It's not easy.
The closest I've been to a relationship(3-4 weeks) was a girl who kind of guided it. I don't know her MBTI but I'm pretty sure she was ISTJ. 
1)She sat next to me in class - which motivated me to talk to her
2) I told her to come over to my place(to hook up)- she questioned my motivations which motivated me to ask her out properly(I loved the date and liked her more for it)
3) She told me we should wait till we have sex so it's more meaningful (should have listened to this one).
So to summarize, we don't know how to do relationships- it doesn't come naturally to us. But that doesn't mean we don't want it or aren't capable of being in one. 
So if you really want this guy(and he's like me). You're going to have to guide him towards the right steps for dating because likely he doesn't know them. I wish I could tell you how to do that -- I'd recommend not bluntly asking him out. But you're going to have to make it painstakingly obvious that he should ask you out."
802,estp,"I mean there's a certain level for everyone that I don't dislike. However if you can hold your own and make it NOT one-sided you'll probably have earned some respect.
I think that's a good sign for any type.
Okay, well I was just wondering. Because I think that INFP can be attracted to ESTP on some level-- but there is less likely a mutual attraction. I say this as a generalization of course. However, an INFP can tend to be too ""pleasing/eager/nice"" which is what I had meant.
With INFJ the type(of course generalization) tends to be more dominant. 
I wish I could help more. Good luck!"
803,estp,"I think I actually do do this haha, there's quite a bit of back and forth teasing going on I guess?
And haha, I know some INFPs and some INFJs can be similar on the surface, but I am probably an INFJ that is nothing like an INFP inside and out. My behaviour towards him definitely isn't anything eager, if anything I'm worried that I'm coming off too indifferent!
Thanks for all your input, appreciate it :)"

805,estp,"anyone got any tips? i'm hoping you guys will give some advice more along my line of thinking. 
I dont want a day to day friend, just someone to go adventuring with every couple of months or so, sharing airbnbs in different countries, that sort of thing. shooting the shit with someone on a friday night down the pub would be pretty nice though.
All my uni friends have moved away and got gfs so arent interested in going on holiday with me :(
so yeah, any ideas? thanks."
806,estp,"Right away make sure that person has similar availability and finances. Pick a hobby where you would meet people like that. I have a few solid close friends, but since high-school our careers have shifted so wildy from each other that it's hard to make such travel plans."
807,estp,"Join a community (a hobby you enjoy, classes to learn new skills) and meet people in that way. 
How to talk to people:
Start with a compliment, usually mine are genuine. I try not to force compliments LOL
Make a statement about whatever activity you’re doing, or the weather, basic small talk. Ask people for help with something, basically find ways to connect with someone. Ask person if they like dogs and show them a cute picture, idk whatever method works for u. 
Introduce yourself and get their name. Ask them about themselves. Ppl like to talk about themselves. Remember stuff about them. Make sure to make the connection the next time you see them (say hi, ask them if they want to see another dog photo) Voila, you have made a “friend.”
Get to know different people through this method and find the people you have something in common with in terms of wanting to travel to the same place or whatever, and bring up your plans. Ask if they are interested in going on a said trip with you. Plan trip together, book trip, and go.
Obviously not right away bc that’s weird and a trip is a big investment to go on if you just met a person unless you both really are just dying to go 
It helps to just do interest checks and keep who might be interested in mind to maintain a friendship with here and there in the event you get the chance to make the trip happen.
I make friends by inviting people to do things with me once I know what they are interested in. There might be people who have never hiked before. Ask them if they would want to try it out and make it happen (bc we’re very good at that)
I tend to get to know people more and build lots of rapport along the way of doing activities with them. (I like to go on food adventures and most people are down to try new food experiences) 
How to maintain new friendships: keep doing things with them once in a while, or what I like to do is just check in through social media every now and then, ask how they are doing and show interest in them as a person (again, building rapport even tho I might not necessarily be able to relate), send another dog photo while ur at it
Don’t forget to occasionally share a cool link to a fun thing in place you want to visit to entice new friend, and say let’s go ! 
Hope that helps ~
I used to be a socially awko taco INFP but now I stopped living in my head and I test as ESTP. Go figure. Also, as ESTP I am constantly looking for ppl to do things with just bc it’s more fun. I’m not sure about the whole wanting to do things alone bit for ESTP. "
808,estp,"Okay - novadays you have more options to meet people than ever. 
I'd recommend find a local groups on social media/forums/even here, based on your interests. Especially if you want to travel, first meetings were sometimes akward, but I always found people amongs bigger groups that suited me. "
809,estp,"I guess so. Every time I try to join a club they seem to get a bit annoyed at how sporadically I turn up rather than being a commited menber who turn up to every single event. Organised club events done really excite me either. 
I guess I'll give it a go though."
810,estp,"People who can't complete their basic job tasks. Like, you have one job. DO IT RIGHT. I'm not talking high up executives who's job is to take risks and develop. I mean people who are taking my order, or listening to what I have to say to complete a simple task. Like, JUST LISTEN AND DO YOU JOB CORRECTLY. "
811,estp,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
812,estp,"I think it would be cool for company's to do that so that they could hire based on their needs or by helping people by putting them with others that are similar so they could work more efficiently. But I do think it only benefits some types, in ESTPs I think this would benefit us but I'm not sure it would work for others."
813,estp,"I think that I experienced something very similar. I underwent a MBTI styled test for my first job, and like you, did not receive my results. In retrospect this could have affected my position, I was never considered for promotion. This was when I was very young, so my result was probably not 'ESTP' it was probably 'INFP' or something. 
As I became more confident in my abilities and as a person I probably developed into an ESTP. I took another job in the same field and was immediately offered a management position.
I'm not sure how relevant my comment is, but looking back, I do think that them typing me could have influenced (more like stunted) my progress in that industry. 
Hmm! Interesting question :) "
814,estp,so im an infp and am very unique and i often anoyed people i was very anoying because i only like to just ''shit talk'' i was never serious in convosation and just wanted to make jokes and talk shit as in absolute shit as in i qoute myself''when i smoke weed i can fly if i jump off a mountain'' but tho others get anoyed by this my estp friend in high school realy didnt give a fik and acted so himself?hence we become bnest friends?
815,estp,"According to socionics romantic style relations, isfj is a caregiver (parent) while estp is aggressor (not a child). However entp, enfp, infp and intp are classified as infantile (child).
These romantic styles are determined by the most dominant perceptive function."
816,estp,"I saw this on the ESTP Facebook group... were you reading that? I'd argue that the ESTP male would never resemble a child, but the stereotypical ISFJ female might desire to care for her ESTP partner in the way a mother would."
817,estp,"Istp and isfp are both lesser aggressors, their aggressive function (Se) being their creative or aux function. Greater aggressors are esfp and estp. I’d look into the description of each to get a full sense rather than base it off the term. Ni dom and aux users are termed “victim.”"
818,estp,"It should be pointed out that it's a pretty dumb translation, because the Russian word for ""victim"" is ""zhertva"", ""viktim"" is a neologism that is only used in the context of psychology"
819,estp,"I’ve been seeing an estp, without an explicit commitment for several years. Recently, I’ve grown tired of giving him the benefit of the doubt about the way he treats me on occasion. So I told him he didn’t deserve me and only then do I hear from him that he cares for me. 
I’m of the school where we treat those important to us with care and make sure they know we care for them. He doesn’t seem to want to express anything unless I’m upset and telling him no more. Any advice? Y’all seem to work differently, though I’m still not sure It would be reasonable for me to tolerate any more of this."
820,estp,"I would tell him straight up that you feel you're not getting taken care of. Just try to say it in a neutral manner so it doesn't escalate into a fight. For example, ""I feel like you haven't taken care of me lately"" rather than ""you haven't done anything to take care of me""
As an ESTP, I prefer getting told the straight truth calmly and factually, so I'm sure he would appreciate being told how you feel."
821,estp,"I was going to write something, but there's no tangible info to reply to. 
So instead I'll ask: Have you read this book.  Has he?"
822,estp,"Thanks for the suggestion. I certainly get the love languages- I think he does as well. My sense is that he keeps pushing people to see where their boundaries are and if they will defend their boundaries.  It’s not a behavior that works in relationships of any kind. Likewise, he doesn’t make plans easily, or otherwise demonstrate that he values spending time with me. However, when we are together, things are easy and a ton of fun. He’s affectionate and we have really strong chemistry. 
I ran into him leaving someone’s hotel after a night of drinking. So I called him out on it and now he is suddenly willing to say he cares for me. I can’t tell how much is him being clueless and selfish and how much is just him acting like a juvenile and seeing what he can get away with. Or if there’s another explanation."
823,estp,"Have a straightforward convo like u/sourlondon suggests. Tread with caution. Don't assign blame. Don't worry too much about the why of it, and just reaffirm to him that you still want it to work but you feel that it isn't."
824,estp,"Something I've learned about myself in addition to what you're saying is it's a lot easier to receive this kind of comment when you're both in good moods. 
Waiting for the feeling of neglect and then saying something will only devolve into blame games and accusations in the absolute; ""you never ..."" or ""I always ..."""
825,estp,"Thanks for the suggestion. I am familiar with the book. He just seems to push my boundaries until he gets clear resistance. He seems selfish, expecting me to always be the one initiating our seeing each other. I could go two months without hearing from him. And then when we are together, everything is easy and fluid and fun- like we just pick up where we left off. I just have no idea when I will see him again. 
He has acknowledged sleeping with a lot of random people, and I don’t think he’s ready to let that go. He seems to care about me, but he seems to care about himself quite a bit more. I can’t tell if this would change with reassurance from me, because he is afraid of real relationships, or what. 
Normally this is easy for me- there’s no place for someone like this in my life. I just feel something different with him which is why I’m even trying to understand him."
826,estp,"It sounds like you want to sit down with him and have a long conversation about where you both see this relationship going. Like u/gravitre mentioned, it could be you both are misreading each other.  
I would also suggest to sit down with yourself and really see if you think this is a relationship you want to invest in. Relationships are a two way street and if you're feeling that he's not putting in the energy to the relationship that you're putting in, make it known to him and see if he's willing to try and make that change. If not, it might be time to really consider if it's beneficial to your health and happiness to really keep this relationship going."
827,estp,"I definitely back the advice to be direct and reassuring, but there's a bit more to what that means.   He has subjective internal reasoning and his default will be to look for expressed feeling from you to figure out what you want, how serious you are about it, and what your boundaries are.
​
​
Are you INTJ? (This sounds like ESTP-INTJ, and you read like one)  Does he know about MBTI?  I ask because until I learned about MBTI, I didn't ""get"" introverted feeling (and still don't), and I didn't understand why the closest TJs & FPs I know were misreading me so badly.  You both may think you ""get it"" on the surface, but end up misreading each others needs and motives if you're very different types, have different ideas of what boundaries mean, etc.  If that's part of your dynamic and you don't make those things explicit, then no matter how direct you are, you'll be talking past each other and the problem will keep repeating itself."
828,estp,"I test INTJ often, but I think I’m more of an INFJ. I’m very oriented toward principles and am fairly tolerant of people’s differences as long as they are not hurting anyone. 
I don’t understand needing to see that you’ve hurt someone to understand that you shouldn’t have done something that most adults would easily realize is hurtful and highly inconsiderate. What is that like for an ESTP?"
829,estp,"I am so so so so so bored, all my friends are introverts who would rather stare at a wall than hang out (good people tho) and the city i live in is small, so i have little to no options. Anything will do, idc if it’s illegal, i have been bored my entire life and will probably suicide if this continues."
830,estp,Every ESTP needs a motorbike. Get that and just play around in traffic. It’s fun seeing how upset people get watching you have fun. Also you can join motorbike clubs but welters I live they’re just filled with lame 50 year olds :(
831,estp,"DIY publicity stunt? I usually make/buy a lot of things to alleviate boredom, but you seem to be more extroverted than me.
Maybe put a table in the middle of town with a weird sign on it, like “Donate to the Eat an Ass Foundation” with a change jar on top."
832,estp,"No. That’s not “Thought provoking”.
Well, actually it is; it’s thought provoking to think about how stupid that sounds.
You do realise he clearly is stating that there is nothing to do and you say “Do whatever the fuck you want?” 
Tell me, if someone had nothing to do and couldn’t find anything to do yet they do whatever the fuck they want, don’t you think that’s a little fucking contradicting? 
I’m assuming you just saw this post, read 1/2 of it and started to impulsively write...
I mean, I did that but I think I rounded the situation up much more effectively than you...."
833,estp,"Does anyone else feel bad when people you consider friends hang out without you and don't invite you to social gatherings? I feel like I have to invite myself over but I don't want to do that because its BM.  Its not that they stopped hanging out its that I guess they don't consider me to be a vital enough part of their group that I get an invite. I just want to hang out with people and have fun, but I guess I need new friends.
god damn it's so hard moving on. I think I've been a core part of 4 friend groups in my 2.5 years in college but I always end up moving on when I stop seeing those people in my life regularly and then I just stop all communication with them apart from the awkward hellos when you see them passing by. I hate being by myself its so depressing, I love hanging out with cool people but making new friends is not something I like to commit myself to doing."
834,estp,Yo I feel you brother. I wonder the same things myself and maybe you’re right. Maybe you do need new friends. I guess it depends on how much time you’ve spent with them and how much you care about them ya know. How committed you are. And how much they care about you. Do they ever not invite someone else? Is this common behavior for them?
835,estp,"Oftentimes, when someone starts to question a friendship like that, it's because they've been overthinking things. 
When that happens, there arises feelings of angst between the two friends when they do hangout. This can create a loop of confusion between the friends as they both tend to wonder, ""hmmm, he's been acting weird around me. Maybe he doesn't wanna be my friend anymore."" This misconception causes the friends to start distancing themselves from each other.
So, what's the solution? Open yourself up, be a good friend to these people, invite them to hang out, stop worrying about it all. Leave no room for misconceptions."
836,estp,"In my experience, they might not have invited you because:
-Maybe it was a last-minute thing that just happened??
-You just joined their group, so they still don't feel that comfortable with you???
-Someone who was there doesn't like you and when someone else brought up if they should invite you they shut it down.
-They think you're  too cool for them and that you probably already have plans?? (tbh, idk if this ever happens but saying this to myself makes me feel better at night when this shit continues to happen and I know I need to move on to a different friend group)
-Unless this happens every week, you're probably overthinking it"
837,estp,"Same boat fuck em all... 9 out of 10 times YOUR NOT MISSING A THING, people only tell you how great somthing was after the fact so that if you come next time it wount suck as much for them. FACT 
Also consider that you yourself were Probley doing something that was more productive then the BS thing. We do what we want... No loss "
838,estp,If you're my friend I care about you a lot. I guess it's the us vs them mentality. I don't think they care too much about me or at least not as much as I do. I'm not sure if they openly invite others just that I don't get the invite but learn that they hung out via snapchat/gossip
839,estp,"I realize this is unrelated somewhat but it’s been on my mind. Everyone seems to have an affinity to something except me. Sometimes I think I’m one of those “Good at all, master of none” type people. Is that even a thing?"
840,estp,"A lot of people will agree that humans should have complete control over their own bodies while they are alive. How about after death? Is it better to use those bodies (for organ donation etc.) for the benefit of the living?
Should there be an opt-out instead of opt-in for organ donation? How about in tricky situations where the person died really early before deciding?"
841,estp,"Alright. This sub seems a little less active than the other MBTI subs so I'm crossing my fingers that I get some responses. For context I'm proooobably an ENTP or an INTP.
I've known this ESTP since high school, but we hadn't really seen each other since 2007. Every few years he hits me up to flirt with me and test the waters to see if I'll have sex with him. Usually it hasn't worked out for one reason or the other. 
This last time I happened to be single and we got to talking. He stood me up a couple months ago and I was pretty meh about bothering to try and meet up again. Then a few weeks ago he started snap chatting me pretty much every day. I got a little fed up with him beating around the bush and was finally like ""We fucking or not?""
So that happened last Wednesday. I know some ISTPs pretty well so I went the route of giving him food and fucking him. Which was a good game plan but you know, I'm an intuitive, so things got weird. 
Places I probably messed up:

told him about past relationships edit: briefly - we were catching up on what we've been doing for the past 11 years and I said ""dated one guy for about three years and got out of a year long relationship 6 months ago"" and that was it.
told him like a year of my journal was dedicated to him in high school
listed off a bunch of facts about him because... well... I'm a creep
got super giggly after sex and said ""this has nothing to do with your performance, that was bad, but more so with the fact that I just fucked my high school crush"" DISCLAIMER: he said the sex was bad first (not on my side. It lasted like 2 minutes, but I'm pretty forgiving of that, especially on the first time). 
I'd told him I had gotten laid the night before. But he also high-fived me... so.
Oh yeah, I was pretty hammered. But I hold my booze well.

Places it probably went well...?:

He said ""this is the most relaxed I've felt in a long time"" like while we were banging. 
He said I was good in bed.
Liked dinner.
He hung out in the morning for like an hour before going to work.
Said he did, in fact, want a redemption lay. 
Talking to him was actually really nice.
The jokes were on point.
We avoided talking about politics. 

So, question 1: How do we think this interaction went? I've sent him a couple of gifs the last couple days and haven't gotten a response. I have ONLY texted twice. 
Question 2: if he does hit me up, how do I proceed? I'm mostly looking for FWBs... but actually talking to him was really nice and I was surprisingly comfortable with him (he kind of bullied me in high school, so I didn't expect that). So I guess I wouldn't mind actually dating, but that seems unlikely."
842,estp,"I think the question is, do you really want to be a FWB for him or are you just convincing yourself of that? TBH it doesn't sound like he's all that into you. 
However sending a gif image via text doesn't really warrant a reply. Asking direct questions or making plans warrants a reply. Since he likes to poke fun at you, poke fun at him. He seems to be ""neg hitting"" you, making you fight for his approval. This is a tactic used by sleazy men in fast seduction techniques. He got what he wanted so now he has lost interest. You can use the strategy of making him think he's not good enough for you, in which he will be clamoring for your attention again, but I do not suggest this.
Instead, i suggest you might want to take time for yourself and ask yourself why you need validation from men who do not value you? "
843,estp,"It went well. If the ESTP says this is the most comfortable he's been for a long time and it's got something to do with being connected... like during sex... then you're doing good things for him. I usually finish much faster if the girl reacts well to me. Ego massage whilst fucking is great sex even if it's quick.
Would proably put the short duration down to desire as well. He'll get back up to marathon sex after a few lays. I know this. Because i have met plenty of ESTPs now (and just generally male friends). And to be fair ... we do talk about it.
There's stuff you listed as bad that doesn't matter. You gave the guy some ego massage - that's great.
You also presented yourself as not clingy. That's ideal.
But you also made it clear that you've always wanted that dick. This is perfect.
ESTP likes to be your champion.
Well he probably feels comfortable being silent. ESTPs don't always give confirmation so if you want that you should be direct - i.e. ""come spend time with me"" will do a lot more work than making him laugh thru a text. We are much more thoughtful about things in our direct environment. I often come across cold in text conversation.
But by all means try to engage a conversation on something he''s interested in that you also like nebough to not be dumb in conversation.
Getting deeper with an ESTP means enabling them to do the things they want to do. In return they will show their affection by ""championing"" for you... sounds pretty gay but i should know how it feels.
It is a good idea to challenge the ESTP at things he is interested in. This is a way of enabling the ESTP.
What? Oh right... are you sure? Cos it sounds like you want to date him.
ESTPs will often tease people who they like or if they think there's chemistry - it's actually a sign of how comfortable we are with you as a person to tease you casually
unless it was very mean teasing... but an ESSTP friend recently described this to me ""there's a fine line between love and hate... but both are powerful feelings..."" he was talking about the fact that not caring at all is the opposite end of the spectrum but love and hate are not so far apart.
Find out what the ESTP wants to do and enable. Failing that provoke the ESTP with challenges.
But there's a good chance the ESTP might be shy about not lasting long. He made a joke about bad sex because that's how ESTPs cover insecurity. Or at least that's how i would feel comfortable with it. Alluding to poor performance is a sort of ""you should see how many fucks i could give"" statement.
I frequently joke about my shortcomings with people i am comfortable with. To be fair i've started to reject almost all criticisms of my character. It's not a good idea to take it very seriously when an ESTP jokes about their shortcomings... because we did that to distract you from it in the first place.
Maybe.
But also maybe not. I don't know this guy. From my perspective ... i'm fairly confident of my dick. But if i haven't been laid in a while it's gonna be a quick fuck followed by another longer fuck.

You asked this to someone else... the best result really would be to consider a week timescale. You want the ESTP around next weekend? Then you need to talk. Considering you've recently fucked i'd probably call.
But i'm also terrible at social ettiquete on these things.
I just don't really care about people's boundaries. Try not to make a plan in your head but call the dude and ask him what he's doing at the weekend cos you'd like to spend some time with them.
That's not clingy.
But if he's busy you have to be cool with it and say ""maybe another time"". Say that positively... like a question and you'll see what the guy can do... this is light pressure to make a decision. It an empowering way of getting he ESTP to stop dragging his feet. But largely because sounding sad would be clingy. And you're not desperate.
You probably know how much you can pressure this person. Some ESTPs are less sensitive ... i'm quite anti-authority. Which means i frequently need to make an effort to overcome the sour taste of following someone else's goals.
But that's not the case if i really like the person or if their goals allign with mine.
Footnote; Did the ESTP tell you the last time they got laid when you were being quite open about your sex life? The answer doesn't really make much difference but if they shared or not shows a level of confidence and comfort."
844,estp,"Seems like you're an ENTP, to be honest when any penis is in a vagina in straight sex, it feels like home/relaxation when sensory nerves interconnect physically with another warm live body.
I kinda get the point of this post since from the very beginning it seemed like a FWB and you're trying to find out if there might be something substantial and I don't mean ""sharing of dreams/feelings"" cause you can do that to anyone like people post on reddit. All I can say about ESTPs, is that once they've figured you out that you really don't have much to offer them substantial for the long term they'll move on. Again this is nothing physical, sexual, or emotional, those things can be easily achieved. Now, this doesn't mean they are liars, etc this is simply honest with themselves. 
It's funny when I see thinkers date other thinkers because it's just easier just like feelers doing the same. The funny thing is other feelers have little to offer me except companionship when bored. 
Maybe that's the case
(INFP)"
845,estp,"This was incredibly thorough, thank you. And also kind of scary, for some reason. Just... makes me think this thing is more intense than the impression I got.
Yeah, I'm kind of lying. I just got out of a year long relationship, but I get over these things quickly. And I kind of admitted it to him when he caught me on a bad night (he was all like ""you want the d?"" and I was like ""Fuck off, I just got dumped by some dude, and another one called me a 5.5, and I'm so over this casual sex thing, and I want things I bet you're not willing to give me like life-partnership, and I haven't seen you since 2007 and it's a goddamn Wednesday"" which I then kinda fixed by being like ""sorry, you just caught me on super bad night. I got the mopes."" but yeah, I'm a shitshow sometimes). But I know I come across as kind of scary. Like, I'm buying a house, I want a dog, I want to get married. I want all those things. Maybe it's not right now, but it's clear I spend time laying the foundation for those things and it frightens a lot of people.
And as for the bullying, he once told me in high school that he teased me because he knew I could take it. It's definitely one of those passionate, love/hate, wanna fuck, mischievous sort of rapports. 
About the poor performance he told me ""I'm just bullying you again"" and ""Happy to disappoint you"" which was HILARIOUS. Also, he does have an incredible cock, so yeah, I don't mind and would like round two. Round two didn't happen that night because we were drunk and tired. Although, I have to say, I went down like a champ and I do feel a little salty I didn't get mine. But whatever.
And I don't know what he wants. I'm scurred. I don't think I can call him - we've never talked on the phone. Can I like text him with ""Hey wanna shoot some pool tomorrow?"" the day before I want to see him? I... am not comfortable talking about my feelings about the situation with him or even alluding to them, but I would like to see him again. "
846,estp,"To answer your footnote - he told me it had been a while since he had gotten laid. Which is surprising, mostly because I think we have a similar outlook when it comes to sex, which is that it's fun and it's also fun to try and get people into bed."
847,estp,"Isn't that any Perceiver? We meet the same people day in and day out, eventually it gets old. 
I've dated feelers - an INFP actually. I didn't like it. I didn't know how to talk to him. Much more boring than my relationships with other thinkers, too."
848,estp,"You need to challenge him to do a better job. When offered the D you expect satissfaction.
This is a dominant tease. But you'll provoke a reaction.
He may not like it... but he'll get over that (especially if you sex). I mean... i would. Shit i've dumped a girl and we carried on fucking for months after cos we both liked it.
You're just excited about it. That's cool... you can show him that and he'l get a kick out of it. We like to be important and interesting.
Fair enough i guess there's a generation gap at play here.
How do you kids get people to come out and do things with you?
Again; you might be tempted to beat around the bush... but the ESTP prefers direct communication. And that might seem cold. But hopefully there's something you guys can do together.
I would specify that it is important to go and do something and not just meet n fuck. I don't wanna be trapped in your house and a stimulating environment will give me more things to talk about.
Yeah that'll do it. But i'd leave it open ended and ask him what he;s doing or you wanna play pool... if you present things as open ended choices the ESTP won't have a gut reaction of feeling trapped.
I'm a bit of a fuckhead when it comes to comittment and i really hate to admit that. But basically ... the best people are the ones who completely respect that this bird cannot be caged.
So you should suggest that he takes you out somewhere fun. This is a way to leave it open ended for him to make decisions and also issue a challenge.
Don't always make things easier if you want something. If things are easier the ESTP thinks everything is under control.
And here's the kryptonite. Argh... sorry guys... every guy in the world appreciates dirty pictures. You make the guy horny when he's not near you and there's a prettty good chance he'ss going to make himself nearer to you at some point in future.
It's not clingy to be horny."
849,estp,"Yeah it sounded like you ended his dry spell. You guys know each other and are comfortable so i'd be direct about a follow up.
Both of you have ""qualified"" each other. You are closer than strangers!
If you want friends than send goofy messages ... but he's nt replied to that probably because he's not thinking of friends... sex changes things.
Are you good at getting him horny in text? i dunno if you guys do much of that but it's a good way to state interest without asking any questions or boxing the guy in.
Plus ... like ... every guy in the world appreciates being sent naughty things. If you want a reply tell him you were just thinking very hard about sucking on a ice cream... or something suggestive and fun.
It's Tuesday. So i'd probably just assume that a portion of the weekend is reserved for fucking. But that's me and i don't know you guys at all.
You sound usure of where you stand so i'd recommend thinking about how much fun the ESTP had seeing you.
Personally... I would consider it my duty to lay that snatch properly. It's a bad sign if he doesn't care to impress you. Don't confuse deliberately shocking you with ""not trying to impress"" because that's teasing.
And as previously established teasing is caring and that's better than not caring.
Don't be scared of disappointing a person. Everything can be reset to attraction. You guys clearly find each other attractive.
And i'm out. I shouldn't give relationship advice anyway cos i'm terrible at them."
850,estp,"I texted him ""Do you want to go do something fun this weekend if your schedule allows?"" and he replied ""No I hate fun."" So I said ""Boooooo"" and ""You can wear your Make America Great Again hat if you want"".
So. He gave me a non-answer, lol. Guess we'll still see. Kinda seems like he's trying to keep me on my toes because he knows I'll get bored otherwise."
851,estp,"True. To be fair, I only text memes and dumb internet stuff that doesn't require a conversation. But I did tell him to text me as he was leaving. 
So yeah, I'll just sit tight. Thank you for the response! "
852,estp,"He teased you. I'd wait for validation of attraction again before talking to this guy again.
At this point i'm thinking that you need to display that you can leave him alone completely.
I don't really know if this makes sense... but the way i read this interaction is that you asked for time and he said he doesn't ahve time. Which does seem a little distant. If an ESTP seems distant it's because of thinking. Thinking can be good or bad... i dunno."
853,estp,"You guys are able to have almost anyone as a friend, but do you actually view everyone as a friend or just someone who is in your circle?
What kind of friends are the ones you are willing to do anything to keep?
Another question, what do you expect from a friend? 
Is being fun the characteristic you want the most for a friend to have?"
854,estp,"Enough similarities to keep the ball rolling. Enough differences to keep it interesting. Trust and loyalty on their part will result in the same from me. People who reach that level are better described as family and are to die for
ESTP friendships are tools. You're of some use to me. I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine. When you stop scratching it, I will break it off. So long as there's a mutual exchange of something that the other needs, we're in business "
855,estp,"People who don't understand simple concepts. 
People who need every detail clarified before doing something - like being explained an activity when you could learn as you go.
People who try to assume leadership but don't know what they're talking about.
Ha, so summed up; people who are indecisive, and people who overthink. 
I am not outwardly angry but I probably make them feel a bit under pressure."
856,estp,"People who tell me ""no, stop doing that"" or who try to shut me down. Those people are the absolute worst in my head. People who call out other people in front of friends in general make me pretty angry.
Usually I'll get really awkward or just leave when I get angry in a group."
857,estp,"People who say I want to do x and then when it comes around they only half ass it.
An example would be a group of us came up with the idea to do a power paint fight and one girl was really excited about it. The day came round, we were about to start and she starts saying don't get it on my face, don't throw it at me too much. Really??"
858,estp,"Tradition for tradition's sake. Nothing makes me angrier than the words, ""That's just how it is."" Some people think since they do something a certain way, all other ways are wrong and stupid; that's so narrow minded and judgmental. 
The fear of trying new things frustrates me to death as well. I am dating a girl who, so far, refuses to try new things, and refuses to give me answers as to why. For example, I really enjoy playing sports and exercising and I just want to do something active with her. She is collegiate athlete, but she is unyielding so far at my attempts to bring her to the gym or when I ask her to play a sport with me. "
859,estp,"Violations of consumer rights, it happens a lot everywhere but you just don't hear about it too much. I'm kind of shy on preordering games because some triple A titles hype up old games with new faces with ass loads of day one DLC and preorder bonuses and not to mention console exclusive content. It honestly makes my skin crawl just thinking about it."
860,estp,"I had a clash with an I-something (I don't remember her exact combination anymore) last summer. We worked in the same dev team, and I just went nuts by her over thinking and over discussing everything. When I spent an hour coding, refactoring, and refactoring again (learning my doing, folks), she sat looking out the window building a solution concealed in her mind. "
861,estp,"Thank you for asking :) 
Close-minded people that don't even make an effort to understand people who think differently then them,(people who lack independent thought), when someone is attempting to control or manipulate me in some way. How about you?"
862,estp,"I wish! haha :) No, I'm an NF that much I know for sure. Not exactly collecting information, more like trying to understand their differing worldviews, I simply like to understand and connect with different types of people. "
863,estp,"My number one advice would be to work on your intellectual and mental side of life. With that said, here are things you and all people should do, let alone ESTPs... 
Read, meditate, study hard or work on business opportunities, work on efficiency, find useful hobbies such as cooking, find the right physical activities for you (lifting/fighting I find most useful for both physical and mental state), and of course don't forget your social life, go out or hang with friends (women! if ur a guy) when you have free time. "
864,estp,"I'm 20, ""dark years"" in full effect but only under one domain it seems. At times, very self conscious/anxious when somethings triggers me to get into my head and not be focused on the present, so that would be a manifestation of the negatives of Fe development. As for Ni development, no negatives present, I seem to already have a relatively strong Ni, most likely due to trading crypto and forex.  
Are you currently experiencing your dark years, early 20s?"
865,estp,"Your Weak Fe would cause problems like low self esteem/ social anxiety/ fear of harsh and intense emotions / overall fear of abandoning  your self needs  for the sake of other people. 
Ni is more of being stuck in your head and your introverted world and fearing negative future possibilities having dark phobias and cutting you off from the straightforward flow state Se gives us and put us into a headspace of being very reluctant and questioning every small move fearing a negative result and make us attribute dark or inappropriate meaning to sensory information and also connect things in a bizarre way without any real  world evidence. 
In my case I think I got into the dark phase due to a lot of betrayal in my life from people close to me and from abusing drugs I  was put into the world of my inferior Ni and stayed put by it like being pinned down by some heavy force . Stayed in that unfamiliar place of introverted world and slowly came out after developing all functions to a moderate level and elevating the entire mental setup from a help I got from a extremely developed intp mentor , but I know how to navigate my  mind  now and where what is so I think that helped me snap out of it im  still not out fully yet. Ni and Fe still hold me tightly and torment but im growing stronger and reclaiming control day by day. "
866,estp,"Me: ENTJ (25f) Him: ESTP (28m)
Things happened very fast, and we both want to move away from the area.
I think if we move, he implied it would make sense to move in together, and his logic is that we already practically live together.
I am unsure because he typically does things very fast and often times it can be hard to be part of it or watch it etc.
I really do care about him and I NEVER want to hold him back from an experience but I’m not ready and I’m worried if I explain he will only understand “she doesn’t want to be with me.”
Thanks for any advice, FYI his idea if it matters.
Thanks "
867,estp,"One of my best friends from high school is also a 28m ESTP. He’s been half-pressuring me to move in with him since forever, I think in part because he knows I’m more responsible than he is and have more money than he does. That, and titties. 
I don’t judge him for wanting to be somewhat carried in life, I’m just not going to be the one to do it. As much as he thinks he wants someone to put their foot down and see through his BS, I don’t actually see any evidence he genuinely wants that. He prefers the safety of having the mental/emotional upper hand in relationships. I hope your bf is a healthier ESTP than my bff is. 
ESTPs are resilient. Just tell him the truth in a way that isn’t crushing. If he is mature, he’ll accept it and try again later. If not, well then you have bigger problems to worry about in this relationship. "
868,estp,"If he’s a healthy ESTP it won’t be a problem. Opening up the conversation on how you still want to move, and thinking logistically how you could both make it work financially would be helpful.
As an ESTP maintaining some of my individuality and personal space doesn’t seem like that much to ask- just don’t make it about him. 
Just have to be honest, direct and open about why you feel the way you do- and that it’s not something you’re quite ready for in this stage of life for whatever reason (you don’t necessarily even need to have one)
I feel like he should be able to understand/appreciate you living true to you and not take it personally "
869,estp,"Just tell him ur nervous of all that change at once (moving to a new city And moving in together).  Say you wanna do one thing at a time....move to the city first and then see what happens. 
That assumes that maybe u would want to live with him at some point in the future. If thats not the case, dont make him believe he has a chance in the future. Just say you prefer to live alone. "
870,estp,"I think Ne-Fe loops manifest as narcissism. And I think that Ne-Si ""loops"" aka the ""Si grip"" manifest as hypochondria. Si becomes aware of negative bodily sensations, while Ne and Ti analyze it. Interesting how various loops and grip behaviors in various types can correspond to unhealthy mental conditions... maybe MBTI could be answer to solving these."
871,estp,"ENTP here, have an ESTP friend. I don't know what her Se-Fe is like because she's chronically ill and can't do most of the reckless ESTP stuff, but Se-Ni loop or Ni grip happens when she loses trust in everything around her and the things she notices around her serve her as the base for the most dramatic stories; paints everything black, refuses to see possibilities, suddenly the most mundane things take existential value, can't take action, overthinking... a theatre kid. Take ESFP dramaqueen, a normal INFJ and then mix it with ENTP hypochondria, but that could just be the circumstances - she doesn't only theorize about what her personal experience means for her physical health, but also for her status, for people's motives, what the implications for the future are... 
I knew another ESTP once and despite being really smart, she sometimes would repeat something funny she heard and laugh about it and then repeat it again, and again... when everybody already stopped laughing and just thought it's weird. Could also be patronizing, seem a bit extreme, inconsiderate, reckless or impulsive. Somewhat of a sociopath, but that would be an extreme exaggeration."

Sounds extremely similar to what I might be going through. Do you have any solutions to get out of it ? "
875,estp,"It depends on how you use your functions. I knew a guy who was 100% ESTP and although he was aggressive and pretty intelligent(and wanted to be ""alpha""), he was still a follower. You have Fe after all, so I think you're overestimating your ability to not give fucks"
876,estp,"Good day fellow ESTP personalities! Being an ESTP and using my powers of observation I have noticed some things and wanted some feedback from other ESTPs. Question time....
1) What personality type do you dislike the most? Why?
2) I have noticed that ESTPs (And most other types for that matter...) dislike similar personality types. Its almost like there can only be one ESTP in the room at any moment or anger sets in really fast... Do you find that true?
3) Most ESTPs are ""systems"" people because of our unique ability to work with parameters and variables in terms of people dynamics. That being said, most of these ""systems"" I see or work around are very hilarious to me as I see so much possible FAILURE everywhere and on many levels. This is quite defeating to me, how do you deal with seeing systematic errors and continue to stay driven?
4) What are your guidelining principles in references to raising children?
5) Lastly, do most kids just naturally like/gravitate towards you as an ESTP? I think there is something in our personality that draws an instant chemistry with kiddos 14 or younger in particular. Its quite uncanny how quickly strong bonds can be formed with all genders, ethnicities, and demographics of kids... 
Thanks everybody! ESTPs crave information on an almost soulful level and this subreddit has a lot of potential! We are natural leaders given the right circumstances and while we can be irritating in some of our habits (Who isn't, in all honesty...), we are probably the most capable of the personality types in getting to our true self and happiness as long as we have people to interact with. That being said, the word ""blunt"" does not even come close to describing what we do to those same people we interact with in terms of communication. If there was an Achilles heel to our thinking or acting, that problem is probably what holds so many of us back from the truly great areas of life like higher learning, or religion, or careers, or whatever it is we each think needs to be fixed/conquered in that moment. Thanks again and I look forward to the responses!"
877,estp,"1) Honestly, I'm not a big fan of ESTJs. Even though they are very similar in a lot of respects, I find they sometimes tend to be more close-minded and judgmental. I think I get frustrated because I see eye-to-eye with them on so many levels, but when particular issues arise (mostly social issues) they automatically shut down other ideas. Maybe other's have had similar experiences? ESTPs are good social adapters I think, so I find that a lot of my friends are all over the board-- ENFJs, INFPs, lots of NTs, etc.
2) I honestly don't know any other ESTPs! 
3) Can't say I have a problem with this. While I do see failures in things, I'm more concerned with the final result than the errors themselves. Vague answer, but hope that makes sense!
4) no kids
5) I do find kids gravitate towards me but that is because they see my as a leader in a group of other adults. Also, as ESTPs, we're good at reading all kinds of people, including children. I can tell when a kid is getting bored so then I can change the subject we're talking about or start a new activity with them. I experienced this while working at a daycare."
878,estp,"

INTXs that are stereotypically arrogant, elitist, and judgmental.


Yes, for ESTPs, if any of them feel the need to out-alpha the other. Laid-back ESTPs can coexist, but once one starts exerting selfish manipulation (which the other ESTP will obviously recognize), the other ESTP will be irked.


Luckily, I have been blessed with several leadership positions which have allowed me to change the systems that I see. When I can't, I try to use persuasion, otherwise the failures just irk me. I know EXACTLY what you mean on this point.


No kids, but giving them enough freedom while developing discipline.


Can't say for certain.

880,estp,"

I don't really know enough about the other types to know which one I do not like. Sorry


This one is really interesting to me. I took the test for a business class at uni, and I was pretty good friends with my professors son, he was also my neighbor in the dorms. The class I took the test in was like the third or fourth class I took with this professor because we got along really well. Low and behold, when the test results came back I found out he and I were both estps. This was awesome because I got to really find out what exactly an estp meant, seeing as how he knew a lot about the topic.  Turns out I scored low, or towards the center, in ""e"" category. He explained, after looking at my test answers, that the larger the group, the more of an ""I"" I became. So after reading your question I realized I got along great with the only other estp I knew, but I also know he scored very highly on the ""e"". He also told me one of his colleagues, a professor I also had a couple classes with was and estp and I got along great with him, despite the fact that I always thought he was more of an introvert also. 


I too have troubles dealing with systematic errors and I think if you can help me figure out a way to deal with them I can get some of my drive back that I feel I have lost. 


Don't have any kids. 


This is hilarious. I always wondered why my friends kids always took an immediate liking to me. I always referred to it as ""kid charm"" but maybe it does have something to do with me being an estp. Furthermore, I have that same ability with dogs. I can like instantly connect with both kids and dogs. I am a good person and just thought kids/dogs could somehow just see the good in ones heart. 


Hey you said being blunt can be a sort of Achilles heal for us and I somewhat agree with that but I'd like it of you cared to elaborate as it may help me be less blunt. "
881,estp,"Really interesting response! Ive never met or known an ESTJ. Sounds like I don't need to either... Very judgmental people rub me the wrong way. Its not that they don't have a good point from time to time, there's just no conversing with them. Its a lot like the Fox News watching demographic... That's also intuitive on the kid question too. As with all things, I know there are differences, extremes, and exceptions to any rule but I have always noticed this. I know ESTPs have a ""childlike"" essence and mannerism about them in certain behaviors. Its just uncanny... "
882,estp,"Hmm, I've seen some suggest Debbie is an ESFP - but what makes you think Fi-Te over Ti-Fe?  I see more Ti-Fe from her.
And why is Jett an ESTP over ISTP?  From watching her interviews, I got more inferior Fe than inferior Ni."
883,estp,"My boyfriend is ESTP, and I m INTP.  
I caught him lying for the first time one month ago about him flirting with a girl. 
He was very sorry about it, and promised me will never lie to me in the future (...right...). 
But his behavior hasn't changed: he still talks to the girl, and lied to me he didn't.
And when I found out, he accused me for not trusting him enough(said by someone who destroyed trust
between us long ago.) 
Since my lie detector is now awaken, spotting his lies become a sport to me.
Now I realize he sometimes even lies about unrelated things, which doesn't make any sense to me.
When I confront him about his lying behavior, he will go all crazy!
I tried to be straight-forward: You were lying about xxxx, and the truth is yyyy.
aaaaaaaaaand he gets offended.
I will have to peel the onion and get to the core step by step with him (like a child)
before he can admit he has been lying.
something like:
Then he would admit he was indeed lying.
I m a very calm person, but he gets angry and frustrated when his lies are being exposed.  
 
tl;dr: What should I do to make him realize lying is bad, especially his girlfriend is a very good lie detector?
(without making the whole situation emotional)  "
884,estp,"ESTP are typically very headstrong. 
Unless he is ready to make the change himself its unlikely he will stop lying. 
In his mind he probably doesn't think it is wrong of him to talk to this girl. 
That's probably the reason why he is getting mad. He thinks you are looking for trouble when he is doing something normal.
I am sure he has his own set of boundaries but if you feel neglected you need to somehow get him to value your opinion above his. 
Maybe instead of picking at his lies you should talk to him about the lack of respect he is giving you. 
And that your boundaries are different from his. If he cares about you he would respect them. 
In my honest opinion I don't think he really values your feelings. And it doesn't seem like he ever will. Perhaps its time to cut your losses. "
885,estp,"I think he's lying about talking to the girl for the same reasons, but I don't agree that it necessarily means he doesn't care for your feelings. 
If you ask me you simply don't tell somebody not to talk someone. That only forces the person to hide their actions better if they feel you're trying to destroy a friendship. If you want honesty you need to be able to tolerate his female friends. And if that is not possible you have to have a convincing reason that he understands why he shouldn't be talking to her. But just out of jealousy you won't be able to convince anybody. "
886,estp,"I concur.  If you're that insecure, get a cat.  Talking is not a problem, and is a common skill set for estp.   Your life will be miserable trying to control extroverts.  On the flip, such a strong suspicion suggests you've been cheating imo.  "
887,estp,"I feel like I figure out how “the system” works really quickly in a situation, which lets me get away with so much shit. Combine that with good persuasion and I can get out of almost every problem. Anybody relate? I feel like ESTPs look really reckless and overconfident because we know exactly how much we can get away with."
888,estp,"Yeah same.
I wanted to know what the point of going to school for ~22 years, getting a job, retire, and all this BS I was being forced to do. Then the system all looked like a game to me, with all these rules, who wins and who loses, etc. Eventually realizing that you really don't have to play, or you can decide to play and bend the rules to your favor, which makes life all the more interesting.
Quoting this from a song, but I relate a lot:
""And it seems like a waste of time. If that's what it's all about. Good luck movin' up because I'm movin' out.""
I feel like other ESTPs just get this. They don't like being boxed in by the ""system"" so they strive to see what the whole point of it is and how it works, then they observe what works for them and just do it. This is sort of why we get overconfident with things, because we expect things to play out like it should, but life doesn't work that way all the time. I guess this can also explain why we are optimists, because we see how rules can easily be manipulated as well as people, and that we can also change ourselves for the better by looking over what troubles us. Observing people being so caught up by things in ""the system"" seems like a joke almost, because we know there is more to life than what you are expected by everyone else to do."
889,estp,"Yeah I kinda know what you mean 
Honestly just remain calm and not rude and you can pretty much get out of anything 
Sometimes you need to take a small hit to pull off the biggest heists. Some people can't/won't take that hit"
890,estp,I'd even say those of us with a less dominant presence would be victims of bullying from others who think of us as assholes by just being ourselves and can get alienated by others rather easily. Thank god for Aux Ti and tert Fe.
891,estp,Literally happened to a friend of mine (who I forced to take an MBTI after the following): she basically alienated certain members of upper management with her brash overconfidence however that same brash overconfidence led to her being pulled onto special projects the following year— it was a total mindfuck 
892,estp,"His victory just makes a lot of sense. All the pc culture busting our asses and being butthurt for the past couple of years or so. So annoying,  I'm pretty sure all my fellow Estps see exactly what I'm talking about.
Right now, we can't joke about anything anymore,  can't say anything anymore, the social justice warriors with high Fi will kick us in the nuts.
Many American kind of felt that way... ---He's just smart for understanding those intricacies. 
The only bad part for me, the butthurt infp/isfp still won't shut up!"
893,estp,"As an estp I don't agree with your butthurt, intricacies thoughts.
The man is an estp and can't help himself he has a lot of charisma. I don't defend him or his policies, neither do I praise him. I merely notice his personality and wonder if anyone as unqualified and not an estp could possibly have pulled what he did. "
894,estp,"I know we're 'good with our hands' and are busy bodies compared to other types. Have you built or created anything lately (or have an on going project)? to make something more efficient? or direct?  Or out of boredom?
This thought came up as I was watering plants this weekend. On a good day it takes about 20min going around to all the beds. It's a complete time waster when trying to get ready for work. I made an irrigation system for my garden within a few hours. My SO is shocked that it didn't take long and I didn't seem to plan it out. All it took was a 2 garden hoses, knife, and mulch to make it. Now I just turn the hose on and go back inside and wait 20 minutes. #ReclaimingMyTime.
It's not fancy or expensive, but useful AF."
895,estp,"Not necessarily making things but I've made several processes at work faster. I'm not really a creator in the physical sense of making things but I get ideas for different approaches to stuff sometimes and attack them as my creative outlet

896,estp,"Dating apps are the most ESTP ever, and I recently re-downloaded the Holy Trinity (Tinder/Bumble/Hinge). Back in the game after a long hiatus. The last 2 weeks I've gone on 5 dates, and 1 ""come over and let's drink wine and hang out"" psuedo-date"
897,estp,"What do you mean dating apps ""are the most ESTP ever""? I haven't been talking to like 10 people the past month.
No but really. My friends have stopped going ""?!?!?!"" when I tell them about someone new I'm seeing. Woops."
898,estp,"Hate them. To me they're just a way to start conversations that neither party is fully invested in because at any moment you have 5 other conversations going that take away from the value of any one. It feels like a way to get a dopamine rush to keep you hooked. For me I have great success when I'm dealing with people in person and would much rather meet someone in a social setting. 
All that being said I do have them installed which is slightly hypocritical. Where I live is a fairly introverted and cold city so it's difficult to make connections now that dating apps have become the norm of dating. I don't like them but it's hard to date without them so I just tolerate it.
Edit: I should have probably added that I counter this by having light conversations to get something started and then soon after saying let's meet up so we can talk/interact in person."
899,estp,"INTP with ESTP father.  I would have preferred to read, study and watch TV, but he works hard and plays hard. So I got a lot of exposure to the outside, mowing, raking, woodworking, fixing cars and snowmobiles, hiking, cross country skiing, unicycle, camping, playing an instrument, choir and travel. My older brother got a microscope, telescope, a train set and a chemistry set(note all this was 50 years ago, we didn't have much money but somethings he got us anyway).
As a introvert I would like to avoid many social settings, but if there was a social gathering, we were there, and he was talking to everyone.
Overall, very helpful having all those experiences, which I might not have had otherwise."
900,estp,"I've read that ESTPs are the fun parents. Like, kids generally love hanging out with them and have fun, and feel loved but not suffocated. I feel like I am this parent. I also substitute teach, and the kids the tell me often how I'm fun but we also learn a lot.
My dad was an ISTJ/ESTJ. He was strict and I hated him for a long time. My mom was a INFP-ish? "
901,estp,"As an ENFP, I got along with my dad (ESTP) only when we do things, but constant conflicts arise when we talk.
He played almost every sport with me and I enjoy it, but we've gotten to the point we don't communicate at all.
He's very insensitive and he knows I take things personally, so he stopped talking. Also we can't talk about any deep feelings because it's just too vague and painful for him."
902,estp,"Dominant Se (ESXP): Experiences are the stuff of life. I want to go snowboarding! Skydiving! Drive a racecar! Give me an adrenaline rush, and I’m fabulous. Okay, what’s up?

Okay, so here are the sixteen awesome things we can do in this theme park. Which one first? Look, you do that, I can hold this, and keep track of the kids, and check my Blackberry, and call Gary back all at the same time.

I want to try that out; I think my body can take it, and it’ll be fun to find out. I’m going to say this, and see what people do…
Auxiliary Ti (EXTP): Hmm, give me a second… okay, I know what to do. I know how this works and how to fix it. I just analyzed it from six different angles in my head and feel comfortable with diving right in. I can take this situation or problem apart and reassemble it. That sounds illogical, so I’m going to ignore it. If I have time, I’ll argue with it. Look, cut the crap and get to the point. THIS is the problem and THIS is how we fix it.

No, I understand the system, I have it, let’s start in on it and get things done! Hop to it! Chop chop!

You’re really doing a good job with that; you’re a natural at this, you know! I’m glad you feel comfortable with me. I like you too. I know how you feel, and I’m sorry this is happening to you. Tell me how I can help, so I’m not just sad on your behalf. I feel like I need to take care of you, and be responsible for you. If you mess with someone I love, I will kick your butt; do you hear me? Hey, do you want to talk about how you feel? I can share some stuff about myself, too, if it makes you feel better. People find me friendly and enthusiastic.
Inferior Ni (ESXP): Though I care more about what’s happening in my life right now, I want to have a good future. I haven’t forgotten my dreams, and I’ll figure out how to make them a reality one of these days. I like thinking about my future life and, although it’s hard, I can learn to put aside immediate experiences if I know the long-term goal is worth the wait! I feel optimistic about the future, and sometimes out of the blue, know how to do something that I have never tried doing before. I’m not sure how, but I knew that person would do that.

904,estp,"Psychic mediumship and telepathy is expressed throughout pop culture. What this means is that other human beings are expressing their observations about reality through art. Art is a powerful medium which can heighten awareness in other individuals very quickly. Artists take their own life experiences and inner realities and display them for the public to see. Awareness of ESP is expressed over and over and over again in the artistic world. It's time to own up to the truth and be real: we are all psychic. Telepathy is real, and it should be used well (with kindness). We are all psychic mediums, and when we believe in ourselves, we can connect with the spirit world directly telepathically. We don't need religions, other psychics, or authority figures to tell us what reality is. We have our own observations, and when we open our minds to new information, more confirming experiences about the truth of reality. There is no death. There is a difference between being extremely confident in our observations and expressing this confidence to other people, and being authoritative. Think for yourself. Question authority.

My radio emits a signal form / 
A loud noise the kind of which I've never heard before / 
I scan the dial for more stations but all I get / 
Is an eerie feelin' I'm not dreaming' this is the real dealin / 
There's nothin like this trance I'm caught in a daze / 
'cause I'm finally out of my body the blue lights are ablaze / 
Yeah I'm really amazed and feelin' so light that's right / 
Lift off and I'm into the sky / 
As if a hologram were created to shift my consciousness / 
Changed again and I'm flung in the rift / 
I want to be free I want to do right / 
I move through the portal to be purified / 
It's not ambiguous it be continuous / 
It's all about us it's for real my man / 
The continuous life there is no end / 
Movin' through life movin' through death /

What you have done here is called spam.
If you ignore the audience you are posting to then you're not really posting here to have a discussion but rather just to whitewash. In which case, yes, i would support moderation of your posts."
906,estp,"So I've taken the test probably 10 times and half the time I get istp and the other half of the time I get estp. 
Are there huge differences in the two types?
I think as I age I'm also not quite able to relate as much to one type or another simply because I have a more full perspective on life/how things work/etc. "
907,estp,"Well I'm an ex-ISTP who suddenly solved his own problems and now I'm ESTP. Difference is about how do you care about being social or have friends at all. As ISTP I totally give no fucks about being loneliness (just me and just my gf) and I usually prefer to play videogames or do some code instead of most of social interractions. As ESTP I found being social very funny, exciting and, uhm, pretty much necessary to not being depressed. Currently I will drop any book, game or job for have some fun with somebody or go to party and usually I lead any trashtalking.
​
This is so fucking true. I'm developer now but I kinda hate now being watching screen for at least 8 hours per day."
908,estp,"A bit late to the party, but are you me?
I test ISTP more often, but feel like I'm either an extraverted introvert or vice versa.
- Love being alone, need social contact after a while.
- Love social contacts, need alone time after that.
- I start conversations often when around people, good at small talk, don't like silence.
- Don't often initiate first contact with friends.
- Too lazy for ESTP, too much of an epicurean for ISTP. (Is that a word you English natives actually use? It's what Google translate comes up with when I enter ""life enjoyer"" in my language).
To me you sound slightly more ESTP and I think me more ISTP."
909,estp,"I second this, and I am pretty sure I'm an ESTP. I constantly weigh the pros and cons of for example certain professions, and even something as small as which snack to pick when grocery shopping. I have this thing where I'm often worried that the choices I make won't give me the maximum enjoyment, and that if I accidentally pick the wrong thing and regret it later, it's like it's the end of the world (for like two minutes but still)."
910,estp,"Exactly! The only thing that I do differently than you do is I don't mind silence depending where I am, and I do initiate contact with people, probably because I worry they wouldn't talk to me if I didn't. It might depend on our ages because I'm a definitely a younger person and I've got some learning to do."
911,estp,"I don't worry about what people think of me, did it enough for a lifetime when I was a teenager. 
I'm late thirties, husband, 2 kids, but career wise feel like I'm still getting started. 
Have fun finding your type, and your path in life!"
912,estp,"Being alone energizes me and makes me want to go out and do something after a while, and being around people too much makes me super tired and irritable. At the same time, Im very good at talking to people, I work best with a group, and I love being the center of attention. I know ISTPs can be charming and attractive, but its much more of a mysterious charm, and ISTPs are much more lowkey at a party when compared to the ESTP. Now, generally yes, someone that is energized by being around people is more likely to be an extravert due to having a lot more experience dealing with people, but its possible to have an ESTP that gets tired from too much socializing, or an INFP that gets energized by having 1 on 1 conversations about their interests. "
913,estp,"How ambitious are you career wise? If I were to compare myself to an ISTP friend, there’s major differences in that aspect. We’re both 25, but I work at a bank and one day would like to be wealthy. My ISTP friend seems content working as a dishwasher. That could be more of a person thing than type, but I believe in general ESTP’s would be more ambitious than ISTP’s.
What function to do believe was the most prominent as a child growing up? For me personally, Se showed up more in terms of being more active and also acting before thinking. An example could be playing chess. Are you more likely to make a move and act off of impulse, or are you more likely to plan multiple moves ahead? 
Also I believe the older you get the more similar XSTP’s can seem. When I was I college and the first year out of it I partied a lot. That’s toned down the older I get. "
914,estp,"I also work at a bank! Se has always been my main function. Im very impulsive but its not a huge problem since my teen hormones have worn off. Ti helps me see when there's a great opportunity. Personally I dont plan things out ahead, but Im great at taking advantage of a situation when I can."

921,estp,"ESTP here. Throughout high school everything came naturally to me. I never had to study because that material was never difficult enough for me to get bad grades. 
I'm now in my Sophomore year of college and have little to no motivation to do any better than just pass my classes. I just got a new job through my school that I really love so usually in my free-time I just go to work. Whenever it comes to be time to study I end up getting food, taking a nap, basically doing anything BUT studying.
Any other ESTP's have this issue? Any advice as to how to cope?"
922,estp,"I struggled through college, but I can guarantee it is better than the ""real"" world. Having a degree will make life soooooo much easier after college, for example I'm currently in the middle of leaving my current job for a new gig, because I have a masters degree I'll be starting at $10k more per year than I otherwise would be, and the guy that I believe would be the best replacement in my current position most likely won't get a chance because he doesn't have a degree, even though he has a way better work ethic and tons of real life experience. 
Just for practical reasons you better buckle down so you don't fuck your 40 year old self. "
923,estp,"Throughout life you're going to find that your time will be most valuably spent on researching and identifying your motivation and ambitions.
You can pass because it's routine to you. But you won't excel because there's no point in your mind at the moment.
You need to invent a reason to excel if you want to maximize your life and challenge yourself.
Spend some time conceiving what that is.
Toughest part of life as an estp is I'm full if potential but it's left untapped. Motivation and ambition solves that."
924,estp,"Honestly, for an ESTP I've always been really good at school, but when I got to college I also lost some motivation because I hated every class. My advice for you would be to join a fraternity. There will be a bunch of guys who are currently in your major so it's easy to just hold each other accountable and form study groups. Additionally, because some of the brothers have been in your major they have test banks, which makes it much easier to study for exams."
925,estp,"I answered all the questions right to get prescribed adderal freshman year (6.5 years ago). That did the trick. Still prescribed (Vyvanse now). It’s how you cheat the system, but it was my method. I had / still have the same motivation “don’t give a f***” personality. I still have some growing as a person / ESTP  to do. "
926,estp,"Oh, well, we can relate pretty well, we share the same functions, and my mother is older so her functions are more mature so she’s kind of evened out. So we can relate within our communications. Plus, I don’t speak like that person at all😂, but it’s a funny stereotype. I try to rationalize with my mother when her Ni is going wacko when she’s stressed out, but other than that, we can relate pretty well."
927,estp,"At school, the ESTP told me to join the activity that he is at, but the time he told me my attention was at the person next to him who was talking to me (and than they walked away) and so I couldn't reply. 
I'm just wondering, I know ESTPs will be fine with anyone (as long as they are not shy, suck, etc). So does it also mean he likes me/or just think I am cool?
Another small question without details, do ESTPs usually say sorry? How will you show someone you are sorry of what you abve did? Especially if it's an accident."
928,estp,"Depends! we love to be surrounded by anyone and everyone, more opportunities to make friends and connections! now for the apology part of it, depends, because my prideful ass wont apologize to anyone, yet my girlfriend has to tell me to stop apologizing lol "
929,estp,I don't ask people to hang out that I don't like. If I find someone boring or just a drag in general like a real prude I'm never inviting them to anything even though I might be cool with them. I don't say sorry unless I really mean it and it was truly an accident.
930,estp,"Yes, for me to give an invite I would already like you or want to get to know you more. In my social circle, I'm around a lot of reserved people/introverts and I find them pleassnt to be with. I think having a positive outlook is better critera of who'd we want to hang with. I know I exhaust my introverted friends, but luckily, estps arent ones to hover over friends.
I dont say 'sorry' because guilt and shame dont serve a purpose to me. I do see where I've wronged someone, messed a situation up, or I try to fix it before they notice the accident (we're quick thinkers and improvisers). 
If it was a less serious accident, lets say I chipped a friend's gravy boat, I'd probably explain how it happened. I'd say:  I thought I had a tighter grip instead of saying I'm sorry for chipping the dish. I'd probably go buy her a new one and throw in a joke or two. "
931,estp,"Most definitely! And also.. it depends... lol, we love people and love connecting with them, we’re very universal wit other personality types and are open (atleast me) to getting to know just about anyone, except people who are super dry and very irritable. The worst lol "
932,estp,"Personally I open up big time when I trust the person and get “deep” with them, I give them life advice and ask them a lot of questions regarding their past, and how they handled certain situations and simply relate. "
933,estp,"I''m beginning to think my BFF relationships  are often ESTP or similar to it.
I will entertain your equally curious minds ny not revealing my MB type.
MB describes this personality as having one sided relationships.  Explain this more please...
(I don't think I'm psycho, just wanted to get your attention.  :)  )"
934,estp,"In my experience, whatever's going on in front of me is more important than anything. Like what you're doing with the whole ""I miss everyday companionship"" is just way overthinking everything. The friend probably likes you but doesn't feel the need to keep telling you. In my experiences, I don't really tend to ""miss"" people unless something I'm doing reminds me of them. Even then it's more like ""Oh wow I should call them sometime"" and that's it lol. 
That being said, it could be you haha. There's a girl who's been obsessed with me since 5th grade (I'm a junior in college now) and she always expects some kind of deep conversation or some shit from me when she texts or calls. Then if she wants to hang out, she'll like use words that trap me and I can't get out. If her dad wasn't the manager at a bank I wanna work at I'd tell her to fuck off. Just don't be overbearing and you'll be best friends with us forever "
935,estp,"that's funny.  i have no doubt each friend cares, we pick right back up no matter how much time has passed between visits.
thanks for the feedback.  I'm an INTP that has learned to value and appreciate people.  "
936,estp,"Oh, yeah. Pretty solitary, keep emotions close to us, keep others at an arm's distance. Definitely out of sight, out of mind unless we're actively thinking or reminded of them in a situation. Like when my SO is gone out of town, I don't sit around and think about her and think about how much I miss her. Do I? Absolutely. Do I think about it? Not much at all"
937,estp,"in your thoughts, but not enough to reach out?
Sounds like my past BFF's.  not my choice to decrease contact​, though its hurtful to have them gone from daily companionship.  They get it and promise to contact more and I haven't lost my importance, but... no follow through again.  :)
Just curious if this is a legit trait... sounds like it's trult not me, rather what's natural for them."
938,estp,"People and friendships are viewed as tools kinda. Are you useful? Does my friendship with you provide me with something, be it a skill, compassion, whatever? 
If it does, cool, and so long as it continues to be satisfying the friendship or relationship will end. When that eventually disappears, we see ourselves out "
939,estp,"Just want to get this place a bit more active. I don’t know about you but I love hearing from others for life advice and life stories. Especially over reddit because you people are quite interesting!
I’m a college student aiming for an degree in information systems (basically IT). I went to a four-year initially and hated my experience so I left. Hope to get a position as a business or systems analyst after undergrad or a sys admin. Not really sure why, I just wanna get into management for an IT team and that’s pretty hard straight out of undergrad even for a BBA/B.Com/Econ major from what I’ve heard. So hopefully one of these careers will get me to where I wanna be in the future.
My whole life I’ve been sort of aimless, not really putting effort into anything but getting places, slowly but surely. I’ve had a passion for cars and astronomy but I don’t really have the means to get serious about them. Nor do I have a strong drive. Probably more of the latter. I haven’t started dating but I’m pretty optimistic about starting in the near future. I’d love to adopt a dog once I make good money as well. Not sure about children quite yet. I’m just not sure if I’m responsible enough.
Share away! Hope you all are doing well.
Edit- adding stuff"
940,estp,"I got a 3.78 in High School and scored a 30 on my ACT, so I thought college was going to be great. But after four years of attendance, and after trying Applied Math and Physics, BioChemistry, Psychology, and Business, I had a 2.4 GPA simply because I couldn't keep trying and had no passion for anything I had studied. I just dropped out of school this May, as finishing my degree would take another 1.5-2 years of school and I don't have the motivation to do it anymore, and honestly I have no idea what the hell I want to do.
Or well, rather I'm torn between two things. I am smart, and I know that. But I am also extremely good with people and flourished in college. This sounds conceited but I think my fellow ESTP's will understand when I say that the only thing that gave me a sense of meaning in college was my popularity. Not necessarily because I want recognition (which I do to be honest), but because I simply love making others smile and enjoy their day to day lives, and I felt like I truly made people feel valued. I love computers and gaming, etc. so I have been considering a career in the tech field, but if I'm honest, I really WANT to be an actor, because making people smile is what gives me satisfaction.
So there you have it. I'm trying to decide whether to settle for a secure, good paying job in the tech field, or take the risk (which we ESTP's are all about) and try to become an actor.
Also, fun fact since I'm talking about acting: I'm from Springfield, MO (where Brad Pitt is from), and I actually know Brad's family."
941,estp,"I have been pretty aimless myself. I have always felt that I often go with the flow.
My school life I was an average kid with really no particular aim. I wanted to be an engineer because I liked automobiles. While I did engineering, it was not even remotely close to anything related to automobiles. 
During the last year of my high school I was good at coding so I thought I would do engineering in computer science. When I got the option, I instead went for communications engineering. 2 years in I was still average at engineering and already bored of my stream. 
At the beginning of fourth year of engineering, different companies come to recruit freshers for their company. By that time I still hadn't thought what I wanted to do. 
Then one day this big powerful multinational company came (one of the big four) and I suddenly thought that I should try for it and I got through. So yea, esstentially going with the flow. I have no idea what I will be doing in 2 years down the line honestly.
The only plan that I really have is now that I would like to retire early and party and travel like fucking dan bilzerian. 
And about personal interests - I haven't had a gf yet because I was extremely shy and had social anxiety in my school life. While I am not as shy and socially anxious anymore (partly because I was able to discover my personality), I just havent found the woman who I want to really get on with and has shown interest in me. 
Also, only plan that I am really sure about is that I am getting a German shepherd for me when I can. :)"
942,estp,"Also, dang, I am reading your story now and we have very similar situations haha. Use your tech savvy to get involved with cars! You know how many computer systems are used in suspension, braking, etc. nowadays? You could use your tech side and your passion to make a career."
943,estp,"Our inferior function is Ni, which means we are terrible at using abstract between-the-lines information to make connections in order to derive a framework of how things work or the way things are (causing us to be prone to overextending Se and ultimately falling into Ni grip). Because of this I think MBTI is actually ESPECIALLY useful for us and ESFP's because it provides just that, a comprehensive and insightful framework (about people) from which we can constantly reference to guide our behavior and construct our worldview.
Ironically, based on the presence of our online community, it seems like we're the ones least interested in MBTI. Ah well. 
~ flies back to r/entp ~"
944,estp,"This is just an anecdote, and I'm not sure you explained Ni properly, but my brother is ESTP and I always sort him out when we meet about where he is in life and where he is going. He's not stupid or thoughtless at all, but he definitely lacks a coherent framework for his life."
945,estp,"I have to agree with you here, I am an estp and ever since I found out about the mbti I have used it to my advantage to figure people out and what motivates them. Knowing that and a little of their background has help me to know whether they are worth my time or not."
946,estp,"Both Ni and Si take in information and processes it internally. Si acts much like a hard drive, taking in concrete information, such as physical qualities, date/time/place of events, what feelings were incurred, etc, and storing it as is, ready to be recalled at a moments notice. Ni on the other hand, ""forms an internal map and framework of how things work. The map is slowly adapted and adjusted over time to allow the user to get a better sense of the 'big picture of things' and what steps to take to get the desired outcome.
Introverted Intuition will take pieces of abstract information and make sense of it. It is not interested so much in concrete facts, as it is with the essence of ideas and theories, and how they all fit together. They are very good at recognizing patterns."" (personalitygrowth)
Both Ni and Si work retroactively in the sense that the database they keep is continually built on new information they take in. As such it would be more accurate to label both as backward oriented."
947,estp,"When I'm interested in someone, I pursue them. I don't like being hit on, although I find it flattering that they have the balls to hit on me (that's only if they know me well, not random strangers in the street.)
Any other estps feel the same way? "
948,estp,"nah, being hit on is nice. it's flattering, I like the compliments and the attention. but that's just if it's a brief thing that I know isn't going anywhere...a flirty conversation, a compliment in passing, etc. 
when I'm interested in someone and they're too eager in return...then I lose my interest. "
949,estp,"Yes I find it annoying. I should probably look into a way to turn down girls with a bit of subtlety. At the moment I just feign ignorance and then ignore them afterwards. 
Also the chase is a lot more fun. Being hit on is boring. "
950,estp,"I guess a bit of that, but it's mostly that I like being the one picking my mate. I don't want to waste time waiting to be hit on by a man or getting hit on by someone I don't consider mate material for me. I have a very colorful personality so if someone that isn't particularly fabulous hits on me it's kind of out place. 
I analyze the person and calculate whether we'd be good together and go from there. Usually it takes a ""you should take me out"" or letting my existence be known. Things don't always work out in the relationship but at least I had the satisfaction that whoever I liked wanted me back and when things ended it's because they no longer are what I thought they were. 
It's not about winning because I don't like playing games. 
Sometimes I do wonder if maybe I should wait to see if they hit on me because they didn't actually ""play the game"" because I was so straight forward. I've caught my men ""chasing"" other women. Inferior women I should add (strippers, prostitutes, etc) which both confirms the man isn't for me because he wouldn't stoop that low as to pay for sex, but I'm conflicted because he likes the chase or whatever that is with women he has nothing in common with. 
Edit: spelling "
951,estp,"wait. are you ESTP? maybe i got confused. 
Because of what you said ""analyze the person and calculate whether we'd be good together "" is not an ESTP thing to do. 
Usually it's all about chemistry and/or physical attraction with first hands on experience. ESTP usually go with the flow, without really giving thoughts about if it would work out on the long term as a projection. "
952,estp,"Hmm good point. 
Didn't think of it that way. I'm a woman though, but I'm the one pursuing. Idk nowadays the roles are strange. Still like to give the man his place in the relationship although I'm the one targeting them. 
From what I know about most women they wait till the man hits on them. Thought maybe that was an estp trait...not to wait. "
953,estp,"What I meant is hit on people I find appealing, don't like getting hit on by people that there's obviously no chemistry between us. 
I think estps get a bad reputation that we're idiots because of the whole ""go with the flow"" jump in, but I don't really see it like you do. More like just analyzing if they'll be down to put up with my eccentric behavior and if they're smart enough to get me, hot enough to fuck, and if they have adventurous enough of a lifestyle for me. That's if I'm actually looking for a relationship, not a fling.   "
954,estp,"well, there's 2 types of ESTPs. One with observes and talks a bunch of show like Donald trump or goldishblue, and one that talks only enough to try to get a reaction but are much more physically fit. I get along with the 2nd type.
(INFP)"
955,estp,"I get impatient sometimes, but not really. I used to drive really aggressively, speeding and weaving and all that. I got pulled over a few times and got away with murder, but then once I got a ticket for like 3 over and said fuck it, no more speeding or aggressive driving or anything
Cool as a clam, I'll go for a drive for stress relief though. I love driving "
956,estp,"The first 10 minutes of a meeting I'm good, but then its all down hill. I either have to fidget, draw or stand up in the back of the room to take notes. Luckily I'm in a health related field so standuping instead of sitting is encouraged. 
The WORST is when you're not even in the convo, but someone is blocking the exit or it would be awkward to pass them. 
I think it boils down to feeling trapped in an open area, cuz technically that's whats happening."
957,estp,"I'm usually fine in meetings as long as the subject matter somewhat interests me and the talk is productive. As far as waiting for people to leave, absolutely. I get especially mad when we set a designated a time to leave and they're still getting ready 5 mins after that time but I'm ready. That's just asking for me to bitch."
958,estp,"Edgy opinion, but I do tend to find people predictable. I also hear fellow ESTPs can relate to this.
​
MBTI just makes it easier as a tool. But in general, I tend to only need to observe someone for an hour or maybe even first impressions, and I already get the gist of what the person is and what would best suit their needs. I can easily change my ""face"" to suit their personality, so I have no problems making friends with almost anyone. Sometimes it just comes off so easily to me, that I find it a game and I would provoke certain people for the fun of it (and to confirm my aspects of similar people I already subconsciously know about).
For example, I tend to troll others just to confirm what I know will fire back at me, also for fun too. I just find it entertaining to confirm how I predict people will react a certain way or something.
It becomes some kind of practice. Super edgy, but just listen a bit... every butthurt comment I get (in response to troll threads I post), I keep an aspect of that personality in my collection of how I can act with these specific people and almost blend in to suit them. 
TL;DR Example: 

Post meat in vegan forum
Vegans get mad and start spouting their opinions 
Somehow take in their opinions, observe their profile pictures, their usernames, the way they form their text, and create my own ""vegan advocate"" persona.
Become nearly indistinguishable from the average vegan whenever I want to

Type stuff if you relate fam"
959,estp,"Yes, it’s quite easy for me to be as uncharacteristically professional or as ghetto as I want in order to blend in with a certain crowd. What’s still difficult is to stick to the way I really want to be. "
960,estp,"Yes, people are often very predictable. But they are equally unpredictable. For every ten guys who ignore your troll there will be one who responds. So I wouldn't become too arrogant. 
​
Anyways, trolling is a big waste of time. The internet does not equal real life, you don't actually learn anything on the internet in terms of other peoples' character.
​
On the internet it's way easier to insult people or to get dragged into a useless argument. That's why there are so many trollers and trolled people. In real life they'll probably just ignore you because it's more tiresome to get into a discussion IRL, and more confrontational.
Instead of trolling on line you could give people sincere compliments in real life. That way you're doing the same thing but you're actually doing something useful for yourself and others!
​
​"
961,estp,"I too find it easy to determine a persons personality in a short period of time. My issue is trying to not project my own thought process/morality on to that person. I’m often let down thinking others respect personal space (public transportation),  conversation (talking too long about nothing and or themselves), simple manners the way I do. I suppose that’s a personal issue but wonder if being able to predict people’s behavior, you also allow yourself to be let down by complete strangers. "
962,estp,I completely relate with you on this. I’ve personally found that people generally fit into archetypes and I think it’s our instinct for people that allows us to adapt and somewhat turn into a mirror for personalities. I like to think that it’s has to do with ESTPs refusing to fit into these molds that make us see personalities at a higher level.
963,estp,"Obviously if you go to a vegan site people are going to act like vegans on that vegan site
Just like if you went to a church people will put on a ""Church"" face. (Depending on the church of course)
​
The problem is trying to break through that ""face"" and finding out what a person really cares about/is like in other areas of life. 
​
Somebody at school may hate school and look depressed all the time but outside of school are a total blast to hang out with... just one example there."
964,estp,"Yes, PnssyDestroyer. I have no idea how, but as an INFJ you really just described me very well. I do the same thing to people. Everyone has a collection of traits that they show. These traits are observable and understood. You recognize what groups they fall into. Everyone, in my head, is a combination of different archetypes. These archetypes are not really something that exist in the outside world (like ""geek"" or ""jock""), but they're arbitrary ones I have in my head. I do it unconsciously, and then when someone talks for a while, or tells me enough about them, I can pretty much place the rest of their personality. I know this seems arrogant, but I'm usually actually right. Some people can get mad when you do this, but I think they're more upset that you can read them really well and that they aren't as unique as they originally thought. 
​
It's not my fault that, left to their own devices, people do tend to center around the same couple of ideas. A lot of it has to do with mass culture and hive minded tendencies. People surround themselves with those that they agree with, and never really strive to change their opinions, so they end up acting the same and it makes my job so much easier. That's why I'm careful to not subscribe to any particular faction, ideology, or group too heavily. 
​
I also am a massive troll, and am somehow very edgy for an INFJ. I can go in threads and piss people off with my opinions and make it 100% believable. I could be a flat-earther or might even convince others that I'm an extreme vegan and pose some ridiculous political ideology that runs parallel to the holocaust for meat-eaters / fur wearers. 
​
That's why I'm always attracted towards extremely weird or unordinary people. I can't type them down and need more info about them. "
965,estp,"I do agree with you.
But it's more like ""i know if he will bore me"" and generally i need like less than one minute to know that.
And if they bore me, it's easy to know how they are.
People are often predictible.
It's pretty boring"
966,estp,"Been told by ENTP's that I'm not one of them, so I'm wondering if you guys can relate to any of these points:
*Highly aware of my surroundings, have quick reflexes
*Love to show off, but never exaggerate
*Set high standards for myself and those around me, hate mediocrity
*Conflict-averse, but never kiss ass or hesitate to disagree with someone
*Never been into sports or cared about winning in sports, otherwise pretty competitive
*To the point, hate people who ramble, instead of saying exactly what they mean, see rambling as an intellectual weakness
Sentimental about things, not so much about people
Very hedonistic and into money
*Love superficial social interaction, but otherwise quite secretive
*Mostly form opinions on my own, without thinking out loud or needing someone else to bounce ideas off of
*Wasn’t good at school, hated doing anything related to it. Sucked at math and chemistry, but knew languages better than anyone else
*Understand languages more intuitively, having a gut feeling for what is suitable for a specific context
*Been pursuing the same artistic career since 14(in my early 20’s now) and never had second thoughts about picking it
*Like “fun” art and see most “serious”/“dramatic” art as pretentious and pseudointellectual, don't mind pop music or popular movies as long as they're not trying to shove morals down your throat
*Love debating, but like winning them more than reaching a truth
*Despite that I've grown tired of debating politics, religion and philosophy, see it as pointless and not satisfying, I'll debate the shit out of some other topics though
*Optimistic"
967,estp,"Quick glance at your post history. 
You have Fi and Te for sure.  Not ESTP."
968,estp,"Aren't feelers supposed to like people and be kind? I try to be polite, but I don't empathize with someone I don't see as intelligent and/or competent. I'm also good at taking criticism, unlike the feelers I've read about and would always prefer someone to tell me about things that can be improved, rather than flatter me."
969,estp,"lol jeez dude, this would be the exact person I wouldn't hang out with. Just because someone isn't as intelligent as I am, doesn't mean I can't empathize with them on things. 
I hang out with different people, the same people make me bored. I also like listening to their variety of experiences."
970,estp,"same here. And this
isn’t quite a characteristic of an ESTP."
971,estp,"I did mention competence for a reason, most people are not too intelligent, so being that snobbish would rob you of any social interactions. A lot of people know something interesting or have experienced something unique to me that I would like to know about - I empathize with these kinds of people at least to some extent, but I don't empathize with people just for the sake of them being people. I mentioned it because I've read about feelers ""falling in love"" with 20 people at the same time and that's something I've never experienced."
972,estp,"I mean, I get it. I had to deal with a lot of dumb people at church that knew nothing but whatever is being taught to them, and that their whole ego was about church and JEEESAAASS!! That I never made friends with any of them because they'd get insta butthurt if I talked anything of the contrary.
​
I would say, specifically, if the person doesn't align within my best interests then I wouldn't hang out with them. Even if someone was ""less intelligent/competent"" in general, but has a great experience of something else(job hunting, fishing, going to foreign country), I would emphasize with but not be friends with per se and limit my interaction with them.
​"
973,estp,"I feel like past situations where I experienced a large amount of stimulation/arousal/fun tend to influence my current decision making/thinking process that aims to recreate those circumstances and often times this detracts from the now/present and negatively affects my ability to enjoy it and the relationships I have with friends and family. I think problems arise when people think I have a hidden motive that I don't share but often even I don't realize what I'm doing its more subconscious level. And I myself don't feel good doing this since I feel deceitful/guilty when doing this even though I feel my intentions aren't evil. 
Do I just have really bad anxiety? The only time I can truly enjoy the present and now is when I smoke weed but I don't want to smoke weed everyday maybe I just need to recreate the effects of weed in a more natural way but I don't know if I want to be on anti anxiety medication. I'm definitely an ESTP since I've been tested multiple times across different moods/time periods. I guess I'm just an ESTP who's bad at being an ESTP. Does anyone understand what I'm trying to say? "
974,estp,You have got yourself into a Ti loop. Lay down on the ground and let yourself get pulled down by gravity. That is real... right now. Nothing in the past matters. You need to look forward and recognize what opportunity is ahead. It will get better if you strive for new experiences and focus on living. Push the past aside and your world will open up again. ESTP is a wired existence because we enjoy thinking but if we do it to much we hate ourselves. 
975,estp,"Maybe you're in the grip of the inferior. Since you're less able to enjoy the present, that means Se isn't working well. Your shadow functions may be clicking on. I think this might be Si here: 
After prolonged stress, your preferred functions can become exhausted. When that happens, shadow functions will kick in to help out with the cognitive load. For an ESTP, your personality would change and become similar to that of an ISTJ. But you would be an inefficient version of that type. 
If you think that might be it, do some further reading. The standard advice for recovery is to avoid stress, eat well, light activity, and get plenty of rest.  "

977,estp,"I don't know if we are being invaded by trolls, or people who are just awful at typing, and are trying to patronize all ESTPs by portraying an unhealthy version of an ESTP, but this sub was so much fucking better dead than alive. I would rather take a dead sub with limited conversations than this trash. "
978,estp,"Hi! I know I’m not an ESTP, but I feel sorry for how much your subreddit has been an awful experience. :(  It sucks to have any kind of trolls or be put in a position that you have to feel bad about your mbti type for negative associations.
If it makes you feel better, I’m always reading how people don’t like ENFJs. And I’m just putting that nicely... there are people who hate ENFJs. (We’re not even that common, I don’t know how people find other ENFJs)Anyway.— it makes me sad because my whole life has revolved around having morals that I live by to treat every person with a higher standard of decency and to actively work towards loving and understanding even the most difficult of people I struggle with.
You ESTPs are so cool!! I have a good friend who is an ESTP and he really is a sweet, caring, and deeper than most people realize. He loves his action and he is amazingly efficient. More people should notice those special things about you!!
I wanted to give you love. :)
To be honest, people are not looking to nurture a healthy community on Reddit. I think people just speak freely, and probably more so than what would be appropriate in real life. It would be hard to keep the unwanted stuff out of a subreddit, but there may be a good approach for what you’re looking for. I would be happy to lend some positive support. :)"
979,estp,"Kind of interesting same thing happened in ESTP facebook group - too many other types posting, too many irrelevant or trashy posts of no substance, and too little quality control of content as ESTPs are too freedom loving. It led some ESTPs to retype themselves into ISTPs, or at least play with the notion, so that they could escape their own group."
980,estp,"At least the occasional post was like worthwhile for the most part too. It's almost getting to the point where it isn't worth being subbed here, and that's sad because I'm like one of the more active people here and I enjoy explaining our perspective to people who actually come here for it"
981,estp,"I understand the feeling, it's like the bullshit from the MBTI main sub is leaking into all the other subs. Not just that it's the same bullshit spam coming in. ""Oh I just found out that I'm a ESTP all the long, I wish someone would just put me out of my misery, or something close to that."""
982,estp,"I can't speak for all the people that say they hate ENFJs. What I have commonly found is that many get mistyped for ENFJ. Many ESFJs (because of shared Fe-dominant, inferior Ti, and desire for harmony), some ENFPs, some ESFPs, and significant smaller percentage of other types get mistyped for ENFJ. My best friend of 10+ years thought she was ENFJ, but recently I discovered she's ESFJ based on her supporting cognitive functions. She and I have a lot in common in terms of morals, how we treat people, and our giving nature. We have subtle differences supporting Fe with my Ni-Se vs. her Si-Ne. In a perfect population sample of personality types, there is about 2-3 ENFJs out of 100. For every 100 there are 12 ESFJs. 
Just like any other type, if a person has one or a few bad experiences with a type they judge/dismiss that person and hate them. Whatever functions they vibe off of other people, they try to steer clear of people who do similar things and write them off for being the same type as the others. I find that that judginess and hate comes from a place of a lack of understanding and acceptance of people different from them, which could very well be areas of weakness. MBTI personality types have developed a bad muse though. It really should be used instrumentally and not as a whole summation of a person. (Healthy or unhealthy types) Human beings are self aware, so behavior and reactions are dependent on a diverse set of factors that influence one moment with another person.
From what I read from comments, they say ENFJs are manipulative, are too feely, and annoyingly please others too much. Their usually are unsupported statements, that I can't speak to unless there is a real story even after the assumption the personality type is correct. The other ones I get, but the manipulative one I don't understand. After much research and encouraging others to openly discuss this, I've learned there are many definitions of manipulation coming from subjective interpretations and/or different objective point of views (i.e. conservative, liberalist, or branches of philosophical thought). For types like healthy ENFJs who have individual freedom and high morals for value judgements, you can send an ENFJ to a very dark place calling them manipulative because they don't want to take advantage of others, hurt people, or put others in a position they didn't even want."
983,estp,"I think it's like a personal space thing. It is an open community but I don't think I'd be reaching to say we as a whole probably see this as our subreddit. Just our subreddit that is open to others
So, given that possessiveness, we don't like it when people come and fuck with it in ways we don't want to, we like our little corner where we get to be quiet and have a breath to ourselves to be exactly the way we want it"
984,estp,"As far as I can tell the spam is mostly our dearest ENTP and the last few Hello, I'm an ESTP posts. I'm ok with removing them, or I could do a sticky for the latter (but do we really need one? where did they come from all of the sudden? Rly just all trolls?).
I tried to engage MDK in a positive way which might have helped, but he's still way more active than anyone else here. Like half of his posts already got removed.  
But yea, what do you guys want in this sub and what not?"
985,estp,"Beer would be nice.
AMA by you.
For attention seeking spam, posts like this from us is probably better in the long run than you having to mod it.  That seems to energize the ""muh free speech"" ""nazi mod censor"" asshats"
986,estp,"He was kind of annoying initially but I've been ignoring his PMs and comments he still leaves me, but I don't think he needs to like be banned or anything.
I think I personally would like it to just go back to how it was, the like once a week or maybe twice a week post where someone actually asks us something and we say our pieces and it goes back to our happy medium we have here. The ""So what's up?"" posts are always cool too. I dunno, this sub is just kinda like a family business that keeps to itself, comes together for business meetings (posts), and every once in a while we have a little family reunion
Probably unrealistic though"
987,estp,"My husband's an ESTP and wants to get out of the Army (Infantry) after 7 years in. What led you to get out and what are you doing now? How was the transition from military life to civilian life for you?

He's interested in sustainable living/tiny homes/earth ships/survival skills/weapons."

They also have a great program for veterans.

989,estp,"Easy, ESFPs are shit at Ti (no consistency, no building up arguments across multiple comments, answers are independent from the comment tree except the immediate parent) and ESTPs are shit at Fi (can't see how a person stands in regard to another, are they my friend? enemy? can't tell, better be prepared for the worst).
I doubt you're either. This show's you're quite good with Fi, but also very focused on how things should be. You're basically taking his hand and leading him through the exercise. I doubt any Se-person would be this embellishing. At the same time you're not as averse to Ti.
But tell me, where do you have problems? What do you often complain about? Where would you appreciate some help? What do other people do that annoys you? :)"
990,estp,"Here's a more detailed round of ESTP/ESFP descriptions, see if anything here sounds like an accurate description for you:  
ESTP by Gulenko | ESTP by Stratiyevskaya | ESTP subtypes 
ESFP by Gulenko | ESFP by Stratiyevskaya | ESFP subtypes "
991,estp,"Hey thanks for commenting.
Those two threads you linked to for weak ti and fi... the weak ti one seems just like a super oversensitive immature dunce to me... i mean... is that really how ALL people who have weak ti  are? I'm sure not, that would be very unfair to paint a whole swathe of people with that brush when that person is obviously just kind of a dick.
The weak fi example is a really good one for the reason why I started thinking I may not be an fi user.. that's me to an absolute t. When I read that I wanted to chime in with a me too!!! But since I'm not sure my type I didn't want to muck with people's understanding of the type.
My reply to the other thread in this post has a lot of info that you asked for as well as how i got to esxp for my type. I'm open to considering isfj as my type because people tell me that a LOT but I'd take some convincing for the idea I could be a J type. That's the main reason I've ruled it out. That and i have four people close to me who are SJ and they are pretty different from me in some ways, the way they do things and see the world. I don't think I am an N. 
The thread of mine you linked to is interesting as the thing I was telling him was actually the step by step process of a specific exercise as my psych lead me through it. In this case i didn't see the point of even mentioning it without outlining how it is actually done. I'm also curious as to why you think it is fi? I wouldn't have said fi is in that at all. I could see it as si-te or si-fe, but not fi. 
To answer your qs quickly here:
I have trouble with organisation, forward planning, sticking to things, self-promotion and obligations.
I hate feeling useless or incompetent
I like it when people can help me get organised and i love working in a team. I love to be the doer/driver with more of an in the moment focus on what can get done now, while leaving the strategising and advertising to others. I like when people give me opportunities to learn new skills without taking over and doing it for me. I need to get in over my head a bit to thrive and the best managers I've had have known that I think. 
I don't like when people want to monopolise my time or dominate concersation in a group. I prefer to converse with the whole group, not just one person as then i miss out on all the other convos and relationships.
Ps edit: i see what you mean about the ""should"" though and on reflection i can focus on that sometimes. Depends context."
992,estp,"Well, I've always thought of myself as a feeling type but I've been exploring the idea of maybe being more on the ti-fe axis. I'm not quite sure. I'm very expressive and can be a people pleaser, I definitely feel the tension between honesty and not hurting people's feelings and generally settle for a diplomatic or evasive way of not outright lying, if the person is only an acquaintance. I'd countenance the idea I could be an xFxJ type, except I'm 100% sure I'm not a J. And I fit best into the SP/artisan temperament. So if I do have Fe I'd be an STP, but my Ti is not defining enough for me to be an ISTP.  Also i think I fall marginally more on the extravert than introvert side of the dichotomy. So that's why those are the two types I think I am. I strongly identify with many of the weaknesses of both types: not sure where I stand with people (estp) and also fearing seeming incompetent (esfp) and I'm prone to worrying about the ultimate meaninglessness and bleakness of the future when in a slump, also worrying sometimes about how i have a lack of long term planning and purposiveness. I just can't think that far ahead. I've just started really thinking about long term career and I'm over 30. My ISTJ spouse took a little while too though, but he's got his career now and I've just changed path after realising the one I was on was a dead end a few times. (I'm feeling ok about that at the moment but that's the kinda stuff that bothers me under stress). "
993,estp,"I can't access the stratiyevskaya ones but for the others the closest is probably the se-esfp subtype (the non-gulenko one; the gulenko one didn't ring as many bells). The ti-estp was quite close too.
Do you think the socionics descriptions are valid for mbti? I've always had the impression they were fairly different systems."
994,estp,"Just read your actual response lol. MBTI is about the cognitive functions, not the letters. If we go by letters, I’m probably an ENTJ, maybe even INTJ. Cognitive functions means that even if you are literally more of a sensor, you can still have Ne as your dominant function"
995,estp,"I believe you have to be logged in to view it, that's what the prompt says. The descriptions are valid for introverts almost 1:1 as the polls done on PerC show that over 90% of E-types will convert to the same type in Socionics. For introverts it's another matter. Also consider that you might have another type besides ESxP which is sometimes what happens when people are stuck bt two types neither of them quite hitting it."
996,estp,Interesting. I'd been thinking about it as being both at the same time I guess but hadn't thought of the idea that you could be dominant ne and come out as sensing? Isn't the definition of N that you are dominant in Ne or Ni? 
997,estp,"Ah well it was quick to register and view them. The mistypes for ESFP are sometimes ENFP, ISFP with strong Se subtype, and on a more rare occasion ENFJ and ESTJ. For an ESTP it can be ISTP with strong Se, ENTP, and at times ENTJ or ENFJ. And of course they mistype as one another."
998,estp,"Hm well I just did this test: http://aimtoknow.com/test_beta and got ENTP. But I also strongly relate to the weaknesses of Ne and Fi as 1D functions from here: http://personalitycafe.com/socionics-forum/698786-figuring-out-dimensionality-weak-functions-associated-fears.html 
I don't know, the more I look into it the more I feel like everyone just makes up their own definitions so typing seems kinda useless anyway. I mean, I could just pick a type I want to be and find the definitions that suit that type and also apply to me. Or just redefine the type. I don't get it."
999,estp,Thanks. Which comment are you referring to though? It's interesting this as well because I do sometimes get ENFP as a result but only in dichotomy based tests... when I take cognitive function tests I always come out as Se being way higher up than either of the N functions.
1000,estp,"Whenever I see you people described you come off as; ""Fun, but smart"" even the little tidbit on here reads; ESTPs are outgoing, straight-shooting types. Enthusiastic and excitable, they are ""doers"" who live in the world of action. Blunt, straight-forward risk-takers, they are willing to plunge right into things and get their hands dirty.
Here's the thing for the life of me I don't know many ESTP characters that embody the ""fun"" trait. In fact most fun/outgoing characters I've seen tend to either be ESFP, or ENTP.
I'd really like to see an ESTP character that embodies the full concept, a character who actually seems like a fun, life of the party sort, who also happens to be intelligent, competitive etc. 
Figured I'd ask here first, since this is the ESTP place."
1001,estp,"I'm looking for new friendships, relationships and anything else. What personality types do we mesh with? I figure that other ESTPs are a go, but who else? I mean we can get along with just about anyone, but I'm looking for people who I enjoy to be around. Any help? Thanks guys!"
1002,estp,"Everyone is unique and demands investment on our side if you want a deeper relationship.  It's freaking hard as we tend to remain on a surface level... 
Type to hang out with---Type to avoid---Even Enfj who are supposedly a good match can be super tiring,  because they tend to judge our shaky morals.
So my advice would be. Just hop in and see what happens, but do not invest too much in people who will not reciprocate. When that happens it's super annoying and feels like a huge waste of time. "
1003,estp,"I feel like there is literally something I can dislike and like about every personality type. I really enjoy ESFP, also easy going and also a party person. I like ENFP's but ugh stop stealing my attention!!!"
1004,estp,"My best friend is an ISFJ. We are quite different, but mesh fairly well. 
I have lots of ENFP friends I like to party/casually hangout with. Always have lots of fun with them. INFPs are pretty cool, too, but tend to wear on me sooner.
My dad is an ISTP and I love hanging out with him. So chill. 
xNTJs STRESS ME OUT. They are so..... intense. I feel like they're digging into my soul. I tend to think they're cool, but want them to leave quickly. "

I experienced some conflict with a coworker recently, whom I'm pretty sure is ESTJ. She pressured me into completing a task her way, ignoring my attempts to reach a compromise. In the end I just smirked and told her to talk to our boss. I don't respond well to coercion. 


INTJ: to echo /u/threefootnick, I can't handle this type's intensity. Went on a date with one; felt like I walked into an interrogation. I guess I just don't mesh well with hard -J types.


Close Friends:


INFJ: pretty ironic considering that we're polar opposites, but she compliments me in so many positive ways. 


ESFJ: helps control my impulsivity and frivolous spending lol


ENFP: easy to have fun with because they share my ""down for whatever"" mentality

"
1007,estp,"I second this. Met self-confirmed INFP once... before I really got into mbti. And, looking back, it was really hard for me to understand that person lol there was no real sense of clarity or definiteness from our conversations... I enjoy hanging out with extroverts most of the time tho"
1008,estp,"Interesting, one of my best friends is Intj,  definitely the longest relationship still going in my life! We talk a lot about human conditions and deep subjects. And he's kind enough to keep things tied in the real world,  he knows how much I hate abstraction. He's super intense but I don't mind, we get to be serious, I like it!"
1009,estp,"The way you explained it is perfect. We always have that, because we are deeply afraid of boredom. If the estp is enneagram 7 it's even worse because he or she will try to avoid pain and suffering at all cost. Guess what? Every relationship has bumps at some points, so to just avoid conflict he might piss off haha
To answer specifically,  boredom is the culprit in our mind. It needs to be flashy and crazy to keep things fresh. But I've learnt after a looooooooooong time that you need to invest in people and it's fine to be patient. If you are hanging onto an Estp for a while and he shows he cares, it means he really really likes you (even as a friend, doesn't have to be romantic)
If he leaves, don't take it personally,  we have issue with sticking around. If you really enjoy an Estp, try to make him invest, it might turn his gears and make him realise the benefits of patience... 
Good luck! We are simple creatures: we like, we stay. We fear or don't like, you will know. (can be just his own problems biting him in the ass)
We invest a lot in you: we fucking love you! We would take a bullet for you...
There's a lot of ""valor"" and ""loyalty"" to us, we see ourselves as Knights in shiny armors haha"
1010,estp,"Not to sound too much like a robot, but I think I have a superior and inferior mode of processing information depending on the situation I find myself in so would pushing that boundary of processing help make me a better Estp?"
1011,estp,Try to be thorough... this helped me in work as well but even walking down the street you will prioritize what’s actually important and what’s not. Also you don’t have to act on your thoughts. Everyone has weird thoughts but remember they are just thoughts so you don’t have to act on them.
1012,estp,"I'm ENTP and (sadly) recently lost my ESTP best friend (drinking and drugs, wish I could say it was a surprise to anyone) but it got me reminiscing on our time together and how strangely perfect we were as ""partners in crime.""
Fortunately, our crimes only involved minor stuff, but the way we worked together was beautiful... He was the aggressive face/muscle that made moves and kept me from getting too caught up in my head/possibilities while I helped him maneuver at a much higher level, proposing new connections/opportunities/ways of doing things he wouldve never been able to conjure...
Had we not been decent guys, I could see this really escalating into some supervillain-type behavior...both charming, suave, manipulative, lovable, and neither of us possessing the ability to reign in our behavior or slow down...
Have any of you had friendships with ENTPs?  How well did you get along/play off each other?"
1013,estp,"I have a good friend who is an ENTP. I myself sort of walk the line between ESTP and ENTP though, so I'm not sure if my point of view is really all that accurate, but I can tell you that it's definitely a compatible thing. Just look at Mac and Dennis from ""It's always sunny in Philadelphia."" Mac is the ESTP and Dennis is the ENTP. They're always coming up with crazy schemes for the bar. (Dennis may be more of an ENTJ though, so I might be wrong about that)"
1014,estp,"I've had a couple ENTP friends and we honestly get along great. The whole devil's advocate thing makes me mad sometimes, but I also see all view points so it kinda works out. I find ENTP's are one of the few that will actually go on adventures with me. I have this one ENTP friend in particular and I would def say when we get together it a whirlwind... definitely partners in crime. "
1015,estp,"I've got an ENTP as a man friend and it really does feel like we're partners in crime. We've only known each other a few months, but it seems like every time there is something for us to work together on we can pretty much read each others minds to get the job done as efficiently as possible. It's nice (: "
1016,estp,"It's certainly a very similar dynamic thats for sure (love that show!)
Also, funnily enough ENTPs comprise the largest portion of psychopaths, so while Dennis is probably ENTJ his psychopathy is rather ENTP"
1017,estp,"Which of these points do you relate to and think is true for ESTP men?
I've found some effective ways in seducing the ESTP male. Here are some observations: 


Always let him plan the date. ESTP men are intimidated by women who seemingly like to take control of situations. They rather direct activities, so only suggest things to do, then let him take credit for it. He'll feel confident and in-control and won't feel resentful that you're 
""leading"" the relationship. In essence, you are ""guiding"" him to do things you'd rather do, which you are letting him take the credit for. 


Always talk out his feelings with the ESTP male. He doesn't want an intellectual equal or a woman is knowledgable on a variety of subjects nor an intellectual sparring partner. He wants someone who listens to his problems and gives him emotional support. Aside from talking about his problems and feelings with him, laugh and giggle at all his jokes. He's feel confident and in-control. 


Aside from talking about the ESTP's problems and acting as his personal therapist, remember that the ESTP male loves to talk about sex. Primarily discuss all the sexual things he'd like to do and talk about all his sexual fantasies with him. He'll appreciate all the time you pay attention to trying to fulfill his sexual needs cos it will make him feel confident and in-control. 


ESTPs love exploring and adventure, however they prefer predictability in their partners. Always be on call when he calls; immediately pick up the phone and answer him right away. When he calls, make sure to only talk about him and don't mention any of the things you are doing or working on. Be doubly sure you don't talk about other people to him. ESTPs love being the center of attention, and they prefer that they are the only star in the shining star and will feel resentful if there are other people whom he sees as competition.


ESTPs also like being dominated in bed. Make sure you throw him around and be a little rough with him. He likes to be the boss outside the bedroom, but in the bedroom, the ESTP male is actually a submissive guy who likes to be pushed around and made to feel a little pain before the orgasmic ending. 


Don't try to help the ESTP in matters outside of being a good ear to his emotional problems. The ESTP rather you stay out of his professional life because he is the one who wants to be seen as helping others. Instead play damsel-in-distress. Learn to say things like, ""Oh, ESTP male....[sniff sniff] What should I do?"" He can then run to your side to help you which will make him feel confident and in-control.


Never be direct or say what's really on your mind with the ESTP male. Instead be unassuming, quiet and say things in a way in which you never truly express your real thoughts or opinions. Opinionated women irritate the ESTP male- especially if you have a conflicting opinion to his world view. Instead, agree with him gently but then make a few additions such as ""You're so right, ESTP male, and do you also think that it could be true that A=B? What is your opinion on this?"" That way, it will give the ESTP male to talk about his thoughts, his opinions, his observations without you interjecting with what he wants to see. 


Remember, the main goal of the ESTP male is to feel confident and in-control. Any time there is something in the environment which points to the opposite will make him feel resentful of you. The point is to make him feel as comfortable as possible, and then seduce him. He'll think in the end, that he seduced you instead!"
1018,estp,"I'm not sure if my input is what you want, but this seems to be reinforcing the reputation of ESTP men as knuckle dragging neanderthals.  
On a platonic level, they and ISTPs, are the ones you can easily shed any semblance or pretense of being ""ladylike"" without being judged or scrutinized for yukking it up along with them. "
1019,estp,"I disagree with 7, the reason I love him is I can be myself 100% and not put on an act.  I mean he might like butt-kissing bullshit for all I know (I seriously doubt it, since he sees through games immediately) but he really doesn't give a shit about either of us conforming to a social role.
Basically, be who you are, and if you like him and yourself and you're basically good-hearted and fun, the sexual chemistry is really the important thing if you're hoping for a relationship.  Negative, controlling nitpickers hate them, so that level of incompatibility is unlikely to come up very often."
1020,estp,"Who would want a girlfriend that is a pushover? Not me, a headstrong girl that bites back will get me everytime. I need someone to challenge my ideas rather than just go along with them, cause God knows that 60% of my ideas are bad...."
1021,estp,"Yeah, I would think FJs would be more wooed by the idea of a ""damsel in distress"" swooning over them as they ride in on their noble steed. (Edit: No offense to FJs.) 
ESTPs shamelessly joke about a damsel unless there is actual trouble brewing, and needed to step in to take action.   "
1022,estp,"I do like the girl knowing she can depend on me when she is actually destressed, but if a girl comes to me with every niggle, I don't really want it, and will eventually laugh at her. Heck yeah a girl that doesn't care about roughing it and isn't a ""princess"" is the way to go. If she is happy to leave the house in 5 mins wearing only jeans, and hoodie and trainers, then she can probably steal my heart, just as fast albeit with less effort."
1023,estp,"How's ur life going? When I'm down in the dumps (which is not my default state) I resonate with an overplanned asshole hermit, rather than a fun and active estp. 
These two types are quite different. I know ISTJ's that are scared by my disregard of ethics and rules. "
1024,estp,"Hi I'm a relatively young ENTJ male (20) and started dating this girl who I think is an ESTP and am looking for some opinions and advice. She loves to be active and always out of the house doing things, is fiercely logical, and is up for everything and loves to drive fast. For our next date she's going to take me drifting in her extremely fast car, and I plan on making her dinner afterwards. I don't know her type for certain, but I she's ESTP. Does this describe you?
Anyways, do y'all have any general advice on how to proceed? Things I should do and things I should definitely not do? I'm not looking for y'all to make my relationship perfect, but some personal advice would be wonderful."
1025,estp,"I'm also a young female ESTP. Don't overwhelm her with feelings or sweet talk, just be fun and witty/charming. Keep her on her toes ! If she's already taking control of the date with dinner and he racing, just see how you enjoy her craziness! Determine if you can keep up. "
1026,estp,"She totally sounds like an ESTP. I'm the same way. I'm never at my apartment (my roommates probably think I hate them), I speed all the time, and I'm fairly active.
I think you guys should do something fun pre-drifting like rock-climbing, going for a swim, or anything that's also fun that you have easy access to. To me, having dinner after drifting sounds like leaving the party early. I have a hard time thinking she wouldn't like to do something else in addition to having dinner. 
Also, I second taking her to a Brazillian BBQ place. They usually have different cuts and kinds of meat, which will definitely spice up the dinner portion of the date. "
1027,estp,If there's a general rule(s) to be followed it would be to just take it easy and have fun. I feel like if you try to plan everything your interaction (Im trying to think of a better word) is not going to feel as natural.
1028,estp,"I’ve actually thought I was both at different times since I’m a fairly motivating and effective leader, but I think the main difference is that while I realize my goals, I focus on what’s directly in front of me to find the path of least resistance, while an ENXJ will have a solid, objective plan on reaching that goal."
1029,estp,"More likely the other way around, Estps typing as Entj/Enfj. Could happen if say a younger Estp spends times with older entj/enfj and picks up their mannerisms and such. Wears off quickly though. Entj/enfj don't really type as Estp unless they're unhealthy or something"
1030,estp,"Yes, some ESTP's will type as ENTJ's (is that what you meant?) Shared Se-Ni can make an ENTJ and ESTP look very similar if you don't know them that well, and Ti can look more similar to Te than typing descriptions will tell you."
1031,estp,"dislike them generally, seems like they think they're these misunderstood intellectuals, but in reality they are just lazy and don't contribute much. their subreddit gives me feelings of r/iamverysmart, and it's the only mbti type subreddit i follow other than estp, just because they are so fucking cringy that i subbed literally just to make fun of them. i'm sorry if this comes off harsh, i have INTP friends if it matters anything"
1032,estp,"Amazing that you should ask this on the same day that I was searching for a thread like this since I’m wondering the same thing.
But of course it’s not that simple. I have one INTP friend that I get along with really well; we have the same values and have really interesting conversations once we actually hang out (damn introverts). We are similar, but our approach to most things are different. We sometimes clash when our conversations start leaning towards being more abstract and sort of meaningless (if you ask me). I get a bit uncomfortable by this, and whereas she gets really excited, I instead try to steer the conversation in a different direction, lmao.
But then I know this other INTP, and I don’t think that there is a single man on earth that has the capability to annoy me more than he can. He is sort of an elitist, convinced that everything that he says or does is the absolute ”correct” way of doing things. Usually I am of course fine with people having different opinions and I truly enjoy discussing with these people, but once I meet someone with a personality like his I’m not that excited anymore. Of course this isn’t necessarily an INTP thing, but perhaps rather a Ti user thing, which is probably why we can’t click. We are both so convinced that we’re right so we just end up arguing. I believe that the only level on which we actually click is humour-wise. 
But where he is very similar to my other INTP friend is this endless-conversation-that-doesn’t-lead-anywhere thing. The kind where they just keep talking and repeating the same thing all over again, without coming to a real “conclusion”, if you know what I mean? I’m more about talking about something that is supposed to lead to action, but they’re fine with just talking for the sake of talking, and discussing theories that, in my opinion (since I can’t apply it to the real world and what I can see right before me), doesn’t make sense. 
But most INTPs are really funny and chill... perhaps a bit too chill."
1033,estp,"Y'all are dope. I'm not sure what the other comments here are on about. The communication can be frustrating sometimes but both parties are better off once they learn to communicate more clearly, and in my experience that's kind of been understood both by me and the intp I'm talking with even when things are frustrating."
1034,estp,"some kind of wizard that hides in the deep dark woods, researching and experimenting on how to create black magic.
​
(jk)
I am an ESTP and i love intp (i love all NTs) , they are the type of ppl you can discuss freely with. Although sometimes i feel like INTP don't say much, but they just needed their time to phrase a sentence or conclude, they need to collect enough info first before they can respond you.(becuz of Ti)Overall ,very chill type based on my experience. We don't share the same value but that doesn't matter, we both are willing to listen to each other's opinions and learn from it. 
I don't think how a person sees has anything to do with MBTI , its honestly more based on a person's maturity or personal aspects/beliefs that makes them dislike or like you. Don't take some of the stereotype, negative comments too serious :*"
1035,estp,"I'm an ESTP and I love INTPs. I'm also a 5w4 so I'm honestly attracted to intelligence, but I find a lot of INTPs are of course smart, but they also tend to be socially awkward and as an outgoing ESTP I find that shyness/awkwardness cute typically. The only personality I like more is INTJS, but overall INTXs are really great."
1036,estp,"I have a crush on this f-ing cringe INTP nerd and it’s infuriating but also kind of exciting cus I don’t have real crushes often. Anyway, I told him that I liked him and he asked me why...(huh? What do you mean why?? Wtf) I replied that I didn’t know why I just did (which is not true. I know why I like him I just couldn’t put it into words) then he ghosts me for like two weeks, and the next time we see each other  he pretends like nothing ever happened... so F y’all I guess :/"
1037,estp,Someone I believe is an INTP lives above me and we either hate each other or can easily get along depending on the day. He knows how to push my buttons and set me off really easily and loves to rile me up. He tends to bring out my more petty side and we can easily lob insults at each other for fun.
1038,estp,"So for years I was typed as INTP and over the past year or two I've been working to improve on myself as a person, i.e. socially, at work, read more, etc, and then went to ISTP and now I've been getting ESTP after gaining confidence and learning to really enjoy social situations more. 
I don't think personality types are concrete and people can move between them through the course of life and having been super on-par with INTP before, your sentiments are pretty spot-on, esp the ""misunderstood intellectuals"" bit.
I respect the doers more than the thinkers."
1039,estp,"This. I used to be an INTP, but over the last 5 years, I’ve slowly become more of an ESTP and would now consider myself an ESTP. When I think back to how I used to be, I cringe. If I met my past self, I would punch that cunt in the mouth. I was obnoxious and egotistical.
One of the things that helped me escape the INTP mindset was the realization that everyone thinks they’re smart. If everyone else who I viewed as dumb thought they were smart, then how would I know if I was smart? Was I one of the “dumb” ones? Just assume you’re like everyone else and I say pretend to be dumber than you actually are. That way, when you fuck up, you don’t disappoint and when you do well it’s a surprise."
1040,estp,"sigh Okay, explain to me logically how type can change. I personally go by the functions. How can your functions change around? If you type by letters... how did your first two letters change? That's illogical. Explain it to me instead of downvoting me."
1041,estp,"While brains do evolve over time, and things like Thinking and Perceiving show up more dramatically, as the brain matures, personality is a genetic thing.  So, no, it doesn't change, really.  It's the basic infrastructure design of the brain.  
You can take drugs to change your personality temporarily, though.
And, as I said, we do mature as the brain ages.  So little kids are less of who they might be as old folks.  Especially, as I said, the Thinking and Perceiving types, which take longer to grow into than the Feeling and Judging types, which are a bit more default for the brain."
1042,estp,There are parts of us that are completely static. Like you will never grow a 3rd arm or another leg. Similarly you don't change from being Ti dominant to Se dominant. Dominant function develops and establishes itself in childhood. Once you're past that age you're dealing with mistypes rather than changing types.
1043,estp,"Don’t ever type this out. It makes you sound like an obnoxious cunt.
They just kinda do. I mean, your views on the world change. You can become more hands-on than intuitive. You act like because one function is primary the other is non-existent. It’s still there and it can still be used and improved.
You downvoted me first lol"
1044,estp,"Thanks for the first point... I guess. But what I'm not getting here is how you went from having Ne (supposedly,) to Se - it sounds like you're simplifying the functions. You say that a person can become ""more hands on than intuitive""... but they can still be an INTP. Are you saying that you just stopped being an Ne-aux, and Ti-dom, because... you became more involved in the sensory world? Even in an 8-function stack, an ESTP's Ne is literally the 8th function... so either you're mistyped, or this isn't making sense. I mean, I'm an ISFJ. If I work on my intuition, will the 8th function in my stack (Ni) become my dominant? What you're telling me is just sounding either illogical, or like a functional misunderstanding.
And you wouldn't know if I downvoted you."
1045,estp,"Ti would only drop one place
It just kinda falls out of use. That can happen over five years. Have you ever taken a cognitive functions test? Your lowest function can be as high as 30% and your highest 60%. That’s not that big of a drop.
Bullshit. I know for three reasons you downvoted me:
1) The original post had 0 points when you replied. This means that if you didn’t downvote it: within the five minutes I had posted it, somebody else downvoted it without writing a reply, then you saw the post, replied strongly disagreeing with me without downvoting, and nobody else has downvoted me since then. Is that what you’re suggesting?
2) You’ve downvoted 2 of my other replies.
3) You haven’t pressed the point strongly. This means you probably know you’re wrong and don’t feel comfortable all-out lying, since you’re worried someone could prove you wrong. You used the phrase “you wouldn’t be able to prove” instead of “I didn’t.” This means when you typed this out, you’re thoughts weren’t a strong feeling of “he’s wrong, I didn’t do it,” but rather “he can’t prove I did it!” Because you know you did."
1046,estp,"I'll get my head around it, then go to sleep and totally forget what it was I had gotten my head around. Fi is like the major blindspot for extps though, so I suppose that's what blindspots feel like for every type."
1047,estp,Plan a day out somewhere for you both. Bonus points if it’s somewhere he’s been meaning to go for a while. For me I’d like it if someone organised a bike that I’d been meaning to on but cause I’m shit at planning I haven’t yet sorted myself out to go. 
1048,estp,Smart watches use Bluetooth which is actually bad for your health. Not a popular thing to say but having Bluetooth waves pulsating every day next to your wrist isn't good. Let's not forget some people have gotten cancer from speaking on the phone too much
1049,estp,"So we as a type tend to be super alpha for no reason. Lots of us seem not to care wtf people think and what not so we just go and do. 
Where does this come from?
In your own life personally?
Or even in a cognitive type sense?
For example I’d say most of my confidence comes from a solid support system I can fall back on. 
Just curious y’all thoughts"
1050,estp,"I’ve often wondered where my confidence comes from too. In high school I was pretty insecure but once college hit, it was like BAM. My parents are pretty passive and modest so it isn’t from family. I think I just grew into my looks. I also started lifting weights which brought me to another tier. Interestingly, sports were always meh for me."
1051,estp,"Mine came from my family.  We never settled for bullshit.  Confrontation was the norm.  We clashedfought and then the dust would settle and we would make up.  Rinse and repeat.
For me confidence came slow but sure.  I was shy in the beginning but as I got older I saw a bunch of cowards afraid to call bullshit out.
In sports there's a lot of bullshit.  I happened to be fast and athletic and I carried my teams in footballbaseballbasketball.  So my confidence grew more and more because I wasn't going to tolerate crap and people going half ass.  This immediately got me respect.  As a white guy when you run a 4.3 40 that's half the battle.  Speed kills.
It grew and grew.
Now as an older man who doesn't play sports I just carry that confidence over to all aspects in my life.  I call out bullshit.  It's in a more tactful way than when I was younger.  It's also in a way that helps people and is kind and considerate.  It's because I see their potential.  
Kindness and courtesy go a long way when trying to achieve things in everyday life.  
So I try to build on that daily and with everyone that comes into my bubble.
There are many more things I could say, but I've probably droned on far too much.
Hope this helps some."
1052,estp,"There was a time in my life where I had low self esteem and down in the dumps...then I realized it's called 'self' esteem and that others aren't involved with it. I started saying things like 'i got this' or 'let me try/fix that' and kept getting positive feedback/results.  I didn't believe myself at first but as things started getting better, being blindly confident came easily because being unconfident really was a drain on my life and the things I was able to experience."
1053,estp,"It does. You can't not have weaknesses, sensitivities or emotions because people are complex beings that way. I noticed ESTP's tend to have a toxic hyper-masculinity thing going on, it comes across more as over-compensating for something, perhaps to hide weakness, sensitivity and emotion? "
1054,estp,You do sound like you're coming from a prejudiced viewpoint. I'm not emotional it's not a power thing. I just don't feel emotions of others. This says more about your insecurity over your own sensitivity.
1055,estp,"No such thing as toxic masculinity. A lot of guys are just way too soft nowadays.
We have all of those, I guess we (or I) just have fewer than most people? I'm not an overly sensitive or emotional person, but I still smile and laugh a lot, and I would say I'm pretty damn charming."
1056,estp,"...and how about estp girls? I feel a lot of people think that our confidence plus constant need to move forward (not really reflecting, mainly cuz what's done is done) makes us seem tough to others. If we fail, we probably make a joke about it in public and think about it internally. However, most estp's don't care what others think of them unless it directly affects them."
1057,estp,"... you're not magic, you know.
As as for ""hyper masculinity"" - that's a very sexist way of looking at it.
We just aren't wimps, and we aren't very interested in wimpy wet behaviour. We tell our kids to stop whining, our friends to get a grip and our lovers to cheer the fuck up. It's not ""hyper masculinity"", it's a lack of tolerence for whiny nonsense. You can make of that what you want.
Interest level exceeded, Titus out "
1058,estp,I tend to go back and forth between the two depending on the website or sometimes even just the day. I feel like I really relate to the the esfp need for attention and validation but also I can be really selfish and honestly mean when I want to and I’m not sure if this pushes me more into estp or not as I’m usually only looking for how I can get fun and enjoyment out of a moment.
1059,estp,I have a difficult time typing my son for this reason. From the time he could walk I knew he was ESxP and I’m eighty five to ninety percent sure he’s ESTP now (he’s in kindergarten) and that the “softer” aspects of his nature I can attribute to years of him growing up with a single mom and an older sister...but I’m still on the fence too. I’m curious to see the answers you get in this thread.
1060,estp,"Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.  
ESTP by Gulenko | ESTP by Stratiyevskaya | ESTP subtypes 
ESFP by Gulenko | ESFP by Stratiyevskaya | ESFP subtypes"
1061,estp,"His type could also possibly change as he gets older, up until about half way through high school I was an ESFJ, probably due to growing up with two judging parents, but as I got older and grew independent from them my perceiving began to show more prominently."
1062,estp,"Yes. I have to stay on him about being unintentionally “handsy”...he had to eat lunch at the peanut allergy table the first day
of kindergarten because he was playing with a little girl’s ponytail and tried to kiss her. When he was two he’d do things like comfort kids who fell down by rubbing their backs and hugging them.
But even though it’s expressive, it just struck me as Fe modes of expression for some reason. Like I’m touchy feely but super particular about where I direct it. Plus he likes to entertain and be seen as funny, charming. All the adults who work at his school and anyone who meets him makes sure to comment to me how much they love him.
It is so far removed from how I behave I can’t even relate to him in that regard. People think I’m aloof, bitchy, etc. until they get to know me."
1063,estp,"Te is short for extroverted thinking and Ti is short for Introverted thinking. Better yet, do you find yourself somewhat ambiverted? Most ESTPs would agree they aren't fully extroverted or Introverted but rather  in the middle. "
1064,estp,"why do you want to be an ESTP? We can trade! It ain’t all daisies and rainbows over here, I can tell you that. Genuine, deep, authentic, reciprocal feelings (or feelings in general) are so hard it’s downright painful. I would do ANYTHING else than to sit around and “feel” things, especially difficult emotions like sadness. Anger is the only acceptable emotion. Anger becomes sadness, hurt, disappointment, a catch all. Hardened exterior as a result. Outside is fun, strong and impenetrable, devil may care attitude, but inside, a loneliness that no one would ever guess is there. "
1065,estp,"I would say just be happy with who you are as a person. But if you are really want to know type correlates with you, I would research the functions of each type and see if any of them match up with you. I would also take various personality tests and keep track of the results, and see if there are ones that repeat. And if you still feel that you need to find your type, I would just pay for the official test from the Myers-Briggs Foundation."
1066,estp,"There are definitely people out there that will cherish you for the mindset you naturally bring with you, don't try to be someone else. But you might have to force yourself to try new things to find them"
1067,estp,I think I was more so in the past. And I hate it becuz I used to be blunt and more of a straight shooter and said whatever I want whenever I wanted. I was far more energetic full of life and even more imaginative I let my mind go wherever I also wasn't nearly as stressed out. But over time I got weaker and weaker. People made fun of me and my flaws. And I lost a lot of confidence. And becuz of that it pretty much forced or obligated me to be super nice to others and I couldn't be blunt or not give a crap. I want to be that old me but with the happiness and new found skills I have now. Best of both worlds u know?
1068,estp,thats not ESTP either. we aren't retards who just say whatever comes to mind with no thought of the outcome. 
1069,estp,"I dont have a lot of energy to get into a debate with you on that especially since we’re not face to face.  if you read some negatives on ESTPs, reactivity and aggression are not uncommon. We are movers and shakers, if you fck with us or people we love, you’ll wish you’re dead. I can and will rip you a new one. With enneagrams and Myers Briggs, you have to read these things with the mindset that these are just broad brush strokes of a person. Every individual will be different in their own way. They may have a certain type of foundation to their thinking and being in the world but everyone is so varied and cannot be deduced to one thing, one type. 
I have a masters in psychology and had a thriving practice before marriage. I just woke up from a shit night so I won’t write a bunch (hope most of it will be coherent to you)  there are things that can happen to a person that causes their personality to mold in a certain way, for example, 8s typically have anger issues because they’ve had hard traumatic pasts, sometimes abuse or having parents who were addicts or violent. As a result, the developed a survival mentality/personality that’s aggressive reactivity. If anything feels like treat, it causes them to strike back with anger or aggression in order to protect themselves or those they care about. Other examples: Narcissistic personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, bipolar personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder- all those have “personality” in them. Sometimes emotional attributes aren’t “choices”. It breaks my heart to hear you say that. Most times, it’s hardwired into us as children during crucial development and remain stuck, intricate in our personality as adults. People who have PTSD for example who witnessed and experienced a lot of violence and death on the field, or children who were molested and beaten to a bloody pulp daily, not uncommon, will react with anger and aggression as adults when some trigger hit (someone coming at them aggressively, posing s threat to their well being), the reaction for 8 and ESTP will be to retaliate back with anger. Please look into some of this. are you saying that they can “choose” whether or not to react that way? For example, PTSD hijacks the mind when initial traumatic stimuli  became too great to bear and gets fixated in an auto response from that moment on, carrying it into daily life EVEN when the threat is no longer there. It’s hardwired into the the mind. Why do you think so many use substances in order to feel normal? Do you think they WANT TO use drugs and alcohol to numb, what, nothing at all? Are they weak because they’re not “choosing” to react like the Dalai lama? They use substances to cope so they could live, feel, be in the world where they can experience some level of normalcy. Reacting, a lot of the times with aggression is a self protecting mechanism that gets carried into civilian or adult life. These are just a few examples. There are thousands. Pick up a DSM sometimes and look under personality disorders. They don’t have it because they “choose” to have a disorder. Who the hell would do that? Let me see.... “let me choose today to be an angry reactive, take no prisoners type person because it’s so fcking cool”. 
No. Be happy with who you are. Trust me, it could be a lot worse. There are people who hate themselves so much they attempt to end their lives on a daily basis. It hurts THAT MUCH to be them, to be inside their mind. Please, I ask of you, to refrain from overly simplistic, black and white ways of thinking and speaking. It’s very hurtful and disrespectful for those who are actually suffering from the very thing.
The human mind and personality formation is such a complicated thing. Please resist the temptation to deduce it into a black and white thing. You are doing yourself and others a great disservice that way.  
There are good and bad to everything in life, my friend. Wanting to be something other than yourself makes me feel sad; I’ve read some of your posts, you seem like a cool, down to earth, kick ass person as you are NOW. Gumball is a cool fcking show. My stepchildren watch it and my husband seems to enjoy a chuckle every now and then. 
You’re courageous in that you admit things that most will never even become aware in their whole lifetime. In depth introspection is fcking hard and frightening. And you’ve done it. Don’t let other people’s opinion get to you. Be a lion, the lion you already are within. Fck the sheep. Sheeps get eaten.
Ok? You’re doing better than all right. Go easy on yourself. 
Oh, a gentle suggestion,  be mindful that sometimes you can speak contradictorily. It’s ... very hard to have a conversation with someone that speaks two opposite truths at the same time. For example, you said to one responder that you don’t care about what people think and here you are asking people what they think. You feel me? You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
You can write back or not write back. I don’t have an investment in this thread. I have a lot of shit to get done today, tomorrow and forever. If you can hear some of the points, great, I think it will be of some service to you down the line. If not, fine. I don’t know if you checked out enneagrams but this conversation feels similar to those I have with 4s and 6s. I feel like I need a drink. "
1070,estp,"People made fun of me and my flaws. And I lost a lot of confidence. And becuz of that it pretty much forced or obligated me to be super nice to others and I couldn't be blunt or not give a crap.  
See, you already adopted the values of others and changed how you act because of it. So I think you should try to get the same effect again, just with people that are good for you and bring you closer to being how you want to be :)"
1071,estp,"And I hate it becuz I used to be blunt and more of a straight shooter and said whatever I want whenever I wanted <-- Te, Ti can be blunt but still a bit diplomatic/tactful.
even more imaginative I let my mind go wherever <-- I don't really do this... I don't have that mind wandering thing... my thought are focused and kinda linear. If I know I'm distracted or imagining unrealistic things... I make myself focused. I don't like randomly imagining unrealistic things or fantasies. Makes me feel not in the present moment. And that makes me feel uncomfortable.
In your comment history you show a lot of Ne... you imagine scenarios, examples what if this or thats... that's Ne. Seem more interested in possibilities than what is. Fi focus on feeling vs analysis(Ti). Not Fe because you seem to rely on personal rather than shared values.
You have Fi, Te and I'm leaning more toward Ne vs Se.
I could be wrong... this is just my opinion"
1072,estp,"Hey thank you. That means a lot to me. I’ve been doing better lately and have recently come to the conclusion that undergoing a personality just limits me too much and that like you said, there’s so much more to a person than just the brush strokes. Instead of taking in a label I will go by the words of God. “I am that I am”. Also what I meant by it’s a choice was not in cases such as ptsd or abuse or cases like that. I meant it in cases like (it’s a rainy day. You can choose to be sad about it or you could make the most of it.) that sorta thing. Also, thank you for taking the time to respond with such care and thoughtfulness it means a lot. You’re awesome thank you "
1073,estp,"Now this is a friend that I would love to kick it with!!! This is who you are, don’t you see??? You’re so great just like this! As U R! Confidence is very cool and extremely sexy. Show this side of you more often because there will be a line of people wanting to be like YOU!!! And wanting to apply to be your SO! I guarantee it :) :) :) 
You made my day. "
1074,estp,"I would need more info to get a better understanding, but from what you asked earlier the fact that ENFP and ESFP are the most frequent types that you match with. I would say your Te just based on what you said, but I can't be sure until you provide more info. "
1075,estp,Do you find women who want nothing to do with you as a challenge? I can't get one to leave me alone. I've been blunt and told him to go away and he still comes back. I don't like playing games and I'm getting irritated by the constant boundary pushing. Do you think ignoring him would be the best idea?  
1076,estp,"If you aren't interested then stop talking to him
They are a challenge and in my own experience they eventually budge and have fun. 
But if someone is telling me to go away I wouldn't be still nagging. 
gotta realize that sometimes it has nothing to do with a mbti type but rather a dumbass "
1077,estp,"Thanks, appreciate the reply. You are right, should have posted in askmen. I know other ESTPs who aren't like this but never romantically involved with them. 
It doesn't make sense to me why he keeps coming back for me to tell him to f off again...it's not like he has a shortage of women to keep him company. Maybe has zero concept of boundaries."
1078,estp,"No problem. 
I think that you shouldn't really be asking for advice when your case is ""I've been blunt and told him to go away and he still comes back"". Just straight block him or threaten to call the police if he/she continuous to try and make contact.
Good luck nevertheless "
1079,estp,"Oh mighty Mortaldeadking, I humbly throw myself at your feet in supplicated remorse; I've been an ignorant fool. How could've I been so blind as to not see the intent of, as well as the wisdom in your usage of, your sarcasm. Your command of the English language is in depth many leagues deeper than mine and a multitude of universes more vast. With my simpleton's grasp of the language, I simply cannot accurately express my gratitude for your patience and willingness to teach me by example. May your graciousness be nevermore removed from my conscious.
Did I do it right?

1080,estp,"As an ENFP, I fucking love the bluntness. Sure i've been criticized by an ESTP here and there, but I justify it by analyzing the root cause of why you guys would use the bluntness for a certain situation, deeming it beneficial."
1081,estp,"Yeah... it can. I have a lot of one liners I have to hold back. Lol. But on the bright side, I'm usually more of a ""defend"" than ""attack"" kind of person. If someone gives me crap, I have a thick skin and can handle it. If someone hurts someone I love, though, you messed with the wrong bitch to get a verbal smackdown from. Lol."
1082,estp,"If you meant red got chili peppers, as in spicy food, then you got me.
IDK about the band though, their music is alright but it's not that intense enough for me. 
My favorite bands are Sum 41, REO Speedwagon, and [anything Eurobeat here].
GunsNRoses when I'm sad."
1083,estp,"All of my siblings and other family members have tried to figure out why he is 100% okay with saying something negative about someone, but as soon as anyone else says the same exact thing about said person, he will literally defend that person and treat them to be the underdog. 
And that’s not the only thing he does, he’s always trying control the conversation. We could be saying the same exact thing, BUT he will argue it and try to make a point, while you’re standing there, thinking “I literally just said this.” 
Help me understand this part of his personality, please. I understand cognitive functions really well. I just haven’t gone that much in depth with his type, yet. "
1084,estp,"My dad is very similar to this, (ESTP according to the 16 personalities test) and I came to this sub to try to understand him better, cause the same issues confuse/frustrate me.
​
Controls the narrative of situations.
Unwilling to listen to conflicting opinions, and doesn't want to hear them (literally shuts down the conversation)
Will still get upset that your ""unwilling to understand/listen where he's coming from.""
(But you effing are listening...you're just giving an alternate opinion)
​
Uses things against you for millennia, however if you bring up something he's done you're being ""unfair, and need to let things go""
Just impossibly contradictory, and denies or acts blind to all these contradictions.
​
I work with him, and strangely he seems to be capable of extreme empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness in a professional environment, just not a familial one. It's kinda mind-fucky, and it confuses my other family members as well.
Interesting to see a lot of people saying this isn't an ESTP thing."
1085,estp,"I have also considered this. I’ve always imagined him to be on the very unhealthy side of ESTP personality. 
When he divorced my mom, he told her all he wanted was his freedom. 
He struggled greatly with the whole family dynamic, even though he apparently loved us. "
1086,estp,"ESTP is more ""you can do ANYTHING you put your mind to if you have the willpower to keep going for it.""   
I don't want to pin his bad traits on any type, but this doesn't sound ESTP.  Can you describe his traits that aren't unhealthy?  "
1087,estp,"That actually makes a little more sense, https://www.16personalities.com/estp-strengths-and-weaknesses I'm not sure if you've seen this already but this is a link that can answer a few questions you may have "
1088,estp,"It’s really hard to find those, but they are there.
He’s always willing to help, he gets really excited when he is needed, and can add a positive impact. I think because he knows he’s done a lot of negative. So he’s always there to help me when I need oil changes, or like when I went on my first plane ride to California he was so excited for me that he contributed $100 for my trip.
Definitely an extrovert, loves being around people, even if he doesn’t understand them. Definitely doesn’t look at big picture first until you explain it to him. He is always on time to ever event, but as far as the rest of his life goes with structure, it’s very opened ended and on his dime. 
I always figured he was an SP type because his need for freedom. I also though Se would be a big part of his personality, it seems like it’s always been the thing he’s trying to fulfill. 
I tried thinking maybe an ENTP, but I don’t think his arguing has anything to do with actually wanting to debate. He gets his feelings hurt easily if you don’t agree with him, even though he doesn’t see that he’s arguing. It’s like he doesn’t even realize it. 
Maybe I’m mistaking Fi for Ti. They’re both subjective cognitive functions. He could be an unhealthy ESTJ. "
1089,estp,"The more I think about it, he really could be an ESTJ. 
What I do know is that he is definitely an Initiating/control/direct type.
ESTP and ESTJ both fit into that description and I’m in an ENFJ, which is also in that category. 
I’m the only one of his children that fit into that same category which I presume is why we have always butted heads. I don’t like being forced to give respect.
The problem is figuring out if he’s more SJ over SP because the more I think of it both fit him. 
Is he Concrete, affiliative, and systematic or is concrete, pragmatic, and interest based... that I don’t know yet. "

1091,estp,"I'd look into enneagram.  Whatever is motivating your dad's behavior sounds more like unstable e8 than type related.  
Note: If you're getting your information from CS Joseph, his judgement is way off for ESTPs.  If you try to use it to understand ESTPs you are going to have terrible interactions with us in your personal life."
1092,estp,"I’m pretty sure my dads oldest sister is an ESFP, but I don’t think it resonates with him. I feel like underneath the surface he is always rooting for the underdog, even when it doesn’t make any sense. He doesn’t care if they’re competent or smart. He just makes sure his neck is stuck out for them 
Here’s a few more examples:
-he expects you to respect him. He’s all about respect. If he walks through the front door, he thinks you should acknowledge him and give him a hug, otherwise it hurts his feelings. 
-He quit working in accounting when he was married to my mom because the person in charge of him was a woman. So he started his own painting and pressure washing business. 
-his moms recent anniversary of her passing just came by, my aunt (she’s an ENFP) sent out a text individually to him and the other siblings about it. My dads response to her was “nothing, but a faded memory now.”  Very cold and detached from her, but also wondering if it’s just a bad feeling he doesn’t want to feel. 
An example of his logic with work:
-At one point he was very successful, he had a whole crew. So what he would do is if he had a really busy week and made his quote before the end of the week, he’d always take off a day and go fishing because he made how much he was supposed to. 
-And even in his slow seasons, he won’t go have a part time for somewhere like Lowe’s or Home Depot. He just won’t do it even though he really should. "
1093,estp,"Control type means “I want to do things at my own pace” if things go out of their control or their normal speed it feels chaotic.
Movement types like ENTP and ENFP like chaos. They need it for fear of things becoming stagnant. 
Control types and movements types can balance each other out well"
1094,estp,"He is an 8w7 sp. Which is why I have a hard time figuring out if he’s an ESTJ or ESTP. I’m a type 4w3 so. 
I was reading info on an unhealthy ESTJ and I’m honestly leaning more into it. I think he suppresses his Fi heavily. He had a really unhealthy childhood growing up and it’s still hard for him to be around his family, but feels like it’s his duty to respect family regardless. They literally had to drink in order to cope being around each other. 
The biggest part I thought about him being an ESTP was because of his need for action all the time and fear of being tied down. He told my mom when they got a divorce, all he wanted was his freedom. He engaged in a lot of risky behavior, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Se. Like I mentioned in the beginning, I’m really starting to see it as a problem with suppressed Fi and the reason we conflict so much is because I’m dominant Fe. 
I haven’t looked at his information on an ESTP yet. Could you provide me some solid information on it?"
1095,estp,"Solid info on ESTPs or on his take on ESTPs?   
On youtube: Wenzes understands ESTPs very well. I can't remember anything Michael Pierce said, but he's generally good and I don't remember him being horribly off like CS Joseph."
1096,estp,"Lately, I feel as if I am in an Se-Fe loop. It seems to have been going on for a couple of weeks now and I can’t get out of it. 
I wanna ask:
-How do you guys usually get it?
-How do you get out of it? "
1097,estp,"It probably means that your subtype is sensory Se-ESTP. Se-ESTPs sometimes get stuck in Se-Fe loops. To chill out find some introverts to hang out with especially Ti & Ni introverts like IxFJs and IxTPs and INTJs. They'll help to bring out your introverted Ti, while INxJs will lure out the Ni."
1098,estp,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwtDLxnVd0c
So there has been some talk about this guy in the MBTI forum and I guess he makes some interesting points. I personally agree with him more than I initially wanted to. What do you guys think?"
1099,estp,"Really impressed at this. At times I wonder if I’ve taken the Myers Briggs test accurately. There’s self bias that can alter your answers so that your results are who you think you are, not always who you actually are. I can fully confirm that I’m an ESTP now lol "
1100,estp,"That’s super accurate... I’m an estp who met my wife at 19 and I have not looked back... before I met her I had gone on dates w/ numerous girls in high school and college. I had a bit of a reputation to say the least but now I would never dream of cheating on her! That vid is really accurate but the guy is pretty annoying in his voice, repetitiveness, and mannerisms..."
1101,estp,"His estp profile video is also very good, definitely check it out. Not all of the other type videos he does are great. Like I wanted to share the ISTJ one with my ISTJ mom, but it's just so biased and bad. So be skeptical with his other stuff if you watch it."
1102,estp,"Ahhhh yep, welcome to the struggle. Biggest thing I've done successfully to improve this has been really working hard on my listening skills, also on responding with things like ""that sounds awful"" instead of ""well you could fix that by doing x"". That's the best I've got. It is definitely very hard and I completely feel you on caring a ton about people and then getting feedback that they don't realize you care about them because somehow it all got lost in translation. "
1103,estp,"I am an INFP and my ex was ESTP. There were sooo many conversations where i felt like i was never actually being heard, he was a pretty unhealthy ESTP tbh. He would constantly interrupt me and would dominate the conversation. It had started getting so difficult for me, it took me a while to realise why i think he doesnt care. So when i started confronting him, he would usually get defensive but also tried to put an effort to listen more after a while. But it didnt really come naturally to him. And it makes more sense now because he would always say he cares for me and he loves me but his actions never really showed that. I also think he was narcissistic. There were days where he would make me feel good and then there were days where i felt so not valued. 
I think being aware of another person’s feelings is a good start. And yeah just definitely try and listen. Maybe if you practice enough, it will start coming naturally? "
1104,estp,"thankful for that fact- and to know anyone who knows me would look at my actions rather than cling  to my (many) words.
My logic gets in the way sometimes in actions though “This would be the best thing to do for this person because it’s what they need” is not always the best solution in emotionally charged situations "
1105,estp,"This is probably the best feedback- and a good reminder of what I already knew.
Being mindful on how much I listen is the first step- but probably could do some research on how to practice listening intentionally. 
My conversation style is generally interjecting, asking questions, back and forth, rather than listening to a monologue and then saying something like “that sounds awful” I generally find it to be valued because people know they’re being listened to by me asking questions- but could definitely stand to keep my mouth shut and let someone else have the floor for a little bit. "
1106,estp,"Hi! enfp here,
Just wondering are you or were you ever in a relationship with an enfp? How did it go? What was good? What was bad? 
I recently ended my relationship with an estp but it was not until it was over that either of us found out our types.  So now i have the question how big of a role did our types play in our problems.
Thank you for your insights. "
1107,estp,"I've never been with an ENFP, but I have a tooooon of friends who type as an ENFP. I like the positivity they have about the world and they're really great at conversation. However, when you look at how the cognitive functions stack up, we really see the world quite differently from one another. I love ENFP's but there are times that they flat out frustrate me -- such as they really don't tell you when they're upset with you (and don't really give a direct answer), they really try to see the best in everyone and I just don't work that way... I go off by your actions, and I don't know what it is but I get slightly annoyed frequently by them (assuming due to how cognitive functions stack up). Now, of course, this is from me analyzing my friends who are ENFP's and have tested as ENFP, so I'm generalizing a bit. But I think they're also hella fun to be around too. "
1108,estp,ENFP is the type that I am able to build the closest friendships with. The girl I've had my longest relationship with was maybe an ENFP. They're a decent match for us I think. I've not really fought about anything with my ENFP friends but the main differences is they tend to dream a bit more and aren't as focused on the present and don't really value material things as much as others might.
1109,estp,"Yes I have actually! When I identified as one too.
It was spontaneous but always on edge. We craved stability but we felt very vulnerable about it. And over time I guess we learnt to be vulnerable around each other. Can't say it ended while though it did on my side."
1110,estp,"Agreed, I rarely ever told her that I was upset, I just wanted her to know it and she never did, at least not right away. 
I do, to a fault, try to see the best in almost everyone. 
yeah I think we are fun to be around. 
Thank you for the insight, you're Awesome!"
1111,estp,"“Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.Youth means a tempermental predominance of courage over timidity of the appetite, for adventure over the love of ease. This often exists in a man of 60 more than a boy of 20. Nobody grows old merely by a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals.Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul. Worry, fear, self-distrust bows the heart and turns the spirits back to dust.Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonder, the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game of living. In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station: so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from the Infinite, so long are you young. When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism, then you are grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up, to catch waves of optimism, there is hope you may die young at 80.”

1112,estp,My ENTP is ready to just destroy this chart and list all the rational reasons it’s wrong. I’m extremely happy all the time. This chart can’t even begin to describe my happine...oh. I see. Fuck me I guess. 
1113,estp,"I have this ESTP friend who plays LoL with me and he kept buying new champions before using them even if they're free to test for a week. When I asked him why he doesn't like playing things before buying them he couldn't really put it into words and said that he was a 'possessive man'. I wouldn't expect him to be irresponsible with real money as this is just in-game currency, though.
Do you guys relate to this in any way?"
1114,estp,"I've recently entered a relationship with another ESTP.
It's amazing!!!! We both think we're awesome, and it's like we're always able to follow the line of thinking of the other. Sometimes we have trouble talking over each other, but we're both so nonchalant about it we're getting pretty good at giving each other dedicated story-telling time.
I know ESTPs have a rep that they don't stay in relationships for very long, but I really can't see this fizzling out very soon; it's just so easy."
1115,estp,"Nice. One thing's sure, you won't get bored. :D I've talked to several ESTPs and the answers I got where either they prefer short term relationships or they can commit to one person but the person they choose has to keep up with them, join them in activities they enjoy at least occasionally, be supportive of what they do, introduce them to new things etc. "
1116,estp,"I'm an INTJ and one of my best friends is an ESTP. My first question is do any of you guys have an INTJ friend? If so what is the good/bad about it? If not, how would you say it is being friends with an ESTP from your objective perspective? "
1117,estp,"I’m an ESTP and great friends with two INTJ. They’re both very smart and rational. They give great logical advice. Based on my interactions with them, I’d say the two types go together well as companions. So long as each party lets the other be himself/herself "
1118,estp,"I do. Well, I’m xSTP. But I have 2 good INTJ friends. In fact, I tend to attract them. Well, NTs in general. 
But - they see my blind spots and they point out things I don’t want to see BUT it’s something I will initially reject then think about. Like they are really insightful buzzkills. I can appreciate that but not in the moment and a lot of their advice is immediately distasteful but upon inspection - intriguing. So they make me think (later on and they will never get credit, btw) and really? An INTJ xSTP dynamic if turned bad would be really evil. Lol "
1119,estp,"Ugh, my crush that I'm having a really difficult time being with/without is an INTJ
The reason why we aren't together is because he is really strict in life and I'm not. We are the complete opposites almost and yet we get each other. So weird"
1120,estp,"2 of my best friends are INTJ's. 
Most of our friends are NF types- so it's nice when we're all together and can talk more intellectually and mentally spar a bit
We debate often for fun (which our NF friends don't understand), 
Seems like we feed off each others energy and it spices things up a bit"
1121,estp,Hmmm. That's interesting. I like the phrase insightful buzz kill. I feel like that's exactly what I do to her lol. I shoot down her ideas sometimes with my skepticism :-/ it's not on purpose though! It's just sometimes ESTPs ideas can seem to be so immediate and for me I'm a very long term thinker. So if an idea doesn't make sense for the future to me that's when I can be a kill joy lol. 
1122,estp,"I’m an Intj woman and had this type of thing with an Estp man. He had a really hard time knowing how to work with my principles, mainly because he didn’t try to understand them— he just saw them as rules and wanted to push the limits. It totally broke my heart. "
1123,estp,"Hey guys, INFP girl here.
Everyone seems to say that INFP/ESTP is the least compatible relationship. I can understand why they say that; we perceive the world in completely different ways. And our communication styles are different.
I dated an ESTP dude for two years and it was turbulent because of the differences in how we saw the world. He was blunt, I was sensitive. We were both private in the wrong ways: I never told him what he did wrong to hurt me, while he was less forthcoming with his emotions, which I need to connect to people.
There were great things too. He was amazing at listening to my emotional rants and straightening me out, making me think clearly. Also, the sex was fantastic (this is where ESTPs/INFPs are hella compatible in my experience, fyi). Things eventually went south and we broke up, but I learned so much from our relationship.
A year after the breakup and now we're friends. We've changed each other in subtle ways, I think. He's become more aware of my feelings and will accommodate them without just saying they're stupid. I've learned how to communicate directly and stand up for myself. It's easy to see his growth and how he's started to really try and see things from other emotional perspectives.
I'm just writing this to let you guys know that although we're ""supposed"" to clash, we can learn a lot from each other. And I always, always appreciate you trying to accomodate our annoying sensitive feelings, because I realize it's not super natural. so thx <3"
1124,estp,"Interesting, I’m also dating an INFP right now after being really good friends for a year, and we’re doing pretty well for ourselves. I love that she’s more the blue to my red, giving me her more measured perspective of a problem without sounding like she disrespects or doesn’t understand my own. On her end, she loves how rapidly I can swing from curious and hyperactive to genuinely comforting and concerned.
I think the crux of our relationship dynamic is that we’re able to think with the same wry cynicism, but what we make of our similar perspective is different, which allows us to foster similar understanding.
The only problem I see is that we can both be very outwardly stressed at times, which weakens our ability to communicate, but I’ve been training myself to at least be honest when I’m in a bad mood as well as being patient when she’s in a bad mood."
1125,estp,"Were you amazed by his ability to straighten you up? 
Se Ti should help Fi Ne in staying grounded to reality . I have an infp friend and he expects me to straighten his thinking out all the time when he’s in some mind fuck or all caught up in his feelings not able to decide anything clearly. "
1126,estp,"My wife is an INFP. Our disagreements are usually based around time mismanagement. Overall our relationship is great because we both put an active effort into it. 
I am way more conscientious than she is. She's usually overwhelmed by letting things build up until they become too big to tackle. This is generally the story behind household chores. She's more imaginative and caring than I am. I don't really understand my feelings, and Fe child can hardly keep up with Fi hero.
She probably wishes that our lives were more balanced between work, parenting, and leisure, while I wish she could be more independent.
INFJs are way less compatible with ESTPs, INFPs can do just fine. It's actually a pretty common relationship.
​"
1127,estp,"This was nice to read, i am glad you shared it.
It’s been days since i left my ex ESTP bf, i have started to learn quite a bit from it (after my feelings have died down a bit). Our relationship at the start especially was super toxic. He would never tell me he is in a bad mood and choose to ghost while also asking me to wait for his call. I used to really think he did that on purpose but after learning about his personality type i think they just dont realise where they go wrong. 
We both learnt quite a bit from each other and even when we talk now he tells me he thinks i am ‘whole’ but i still dont see us happy together in the future despite my feelings.
I am scared that i will always have to be at my best and i cant go back to him feeling like that. I may be wrong but he has made comments to make me feel like that. 
But yeah he definitely made my rely less on my feelings and being more upfront with issues. "
1128,estp,"I'm (was?) dating an ESTP for six months. We lived together for three months because I was offered a job in his city and had to move there. It was the only relationship I learned a lot and grew more mature in this short time. 
Although, he's really insensitive when saying things and complains about how sensitive and emotional I am to everything. The problem is that he is still too immature and lacks focus/direction in life. Too arrogant and doesn't take things too serious.
I'm still wondering if this is going to work. He's also not good at sex because he only cares about his own pleasure, lol. He is the second ESTP I ever dated. Anybody care to explain why INFPs attracts so many ESTPs? I'd bet it's because of our innocent aura.
Some of those guys are just a pain in the ass (sorry to any kind ESTP).
Edit: formatting in cellphones sucks."
1129,estp,"wow, I'm sorry about the breakup, hope you heal soon.
I really relate to the statement you made about him being inconsiderate despite having good intentions. it was quite the trend in my relationship as well, and it sucked. the pressure to be at your best is huge too, you're not wrong about that.
it's good you learned from him though. it's admirable you recognize that now!"
1130,estp,"It seriously represents us, look at first post which would have been like a challenge and stuff so its fun to make. Now its DEAD!
Btw I dont even expect anyone to reply...cause I wouldn't
Anyways, hope everyone is having fun! :)"
1131,estp,"It is. But like I need her and think of her far less than she does me. 
We focus on the task at hand, do what we do. If she and I are separated she constantly thinks of me and misses me and whatnot, but I don't do that at all. I just focus on what's happening in my life. Do I miss her? Sure. Do I think about it? Not remotely "
1132,estp,"I doubt those would help. She needs to focus on other things, not get reminded all the time. She manages that one on her own...  
/u/FuckTheSooners You could try to help her find a ~~distraction~~ hobby. Maybe gift her an empty art journal and encourage her to put her feelings into it. Then when you meet up you can look through it together. Might not get rid of the clinginess but at least she'd actively work through it?"
1133,estp,"This guy had so much fucking energy...it blew my mind; also, he was extremely animated when he talked. This classmate of mine is 37 y/o and has more energy than me, a 24 y/o ENFP. 
I have never hung out with someone with so much energy, character, and confidence. Definitely a personality type that makes a lasting impression. Also, it seems like he needed a lot of stimulus and is very much so young at heart and is full of life...slightly insane and also very Machiavellian vibes.
Just wanted to stop by and let this subreddit know that I find ESTPs fascinating :o 
Are all of you full of energy, ideasss, life, and non-stop action??"
1134,estp,"ESTP is really good at putting on a show & charm when we want, we can show incredible amount of energy and confidence if we feel like it. Especially during a conversation with a new person that we find attractive or fun to be around. In general we can be very relaxed and ""normal"" depending on the situation."
1135,estp,"So have you ever been heartbroken, and by whom? What did you do to feel better? And did it ever really go away? Hoping for some ESTP advice from fellow ESTPs (non english speaker if any misspellings cut me some slack;) )"
1136,estp,"Basically just keeping myself distracted, especially with new activities. Take up a new hobby, meet and talk to new people, yada yada yada.
Also telling myself shit like ""He wasn't good for me anyway"", ""We never would've been happy"", ""If it's over now, he wasn't the one for me anyway"", ""I'll meet someone better someday"". 
I tend to move on fairly quickly tbh, depending on the intensity of the previous relationship."
1137,estp,"Girls mostly, my crushes always seem to end with to people I considered good friends until though I don't think thats an ESTP thing. Just move on, focus on the big picture. Generally, if I have some reminder of that person, then it's really easy for me to feel those feelings again. Working out, team sports, hanging out with genuine fun people like enfps lol "
1138,estp,Im lucky to hav an ENFP in my life; really hjelps me Get out of my head and focus on the future:)! My ESTP friend had a Nice quote that was; If you get your head out of your ass things will get brighter» ( funnier in scandinavian;-p)  Do any of you get tense in your muscles because of heartbreak? Does it manifest physically? Have found getting massage is good ❤️
1139,estp,"Do you have any? What are they? Why did you get them?
I'll start! (In order from first to last)

Cross bones on my right butt cheek because it was a 20 minute time bonus for an alley cat.
13 on me leg because it was Friday the 13th. My buddy said lets get tatted.
Dagger through and eye crying blood for another race.
Flying eyeball monster. 
Grim Reaper with a scythe and rose to mark year ten since my father passed. 
"
1140,estp,"One tattoo:  full sleeve of (actual) bio-mech. Twisted shreds of metal, overlays of sharp bones, clock gears, and its pulled together with a background of neural synatics 
It actually has a deep meaning to me but I tell everyone ""I thought it was a cool idea"" "
1141,estp,"IDK if it's just me, but do you guys sometimes get irrationally angry at people when you have nothing else to do? 
​
Sometimes I sit by myself, then start observing people, then start getting mad at how many dumb people exist in the world. Then start worrying about how many more people are going to exist, how the world is going to get overpopulated and how everything is going to turn chaotic and we're not really doing anything much about it. 
​
Example mini story:
1) Told to sit and wait in the car alone
2) After probably almost an hour of fidgeting, get bored and start thinking about stuff
3) Observe girl buying a starbucks with a mac laptop, typical
4) Get mad that she bought an overpriced cup of coffee and laptop with a terrible OS [but not as bad as win10 tbf]
5) Worry that millions more of these kinds of people exist, start thinking that people must be really dumb
6) See traffic and lots of people honking to get to work, start thinking existentially and get mad about working ~20 years to pay off a house these days (in California), and student loan debt and we are still complacent about this.
7) [insert more angry angst here]
8) Gets pumped up, but then gets back home and chills out when I find something to do.
​
I know it sounds edgy, but I'm not actually a person to think about these kinds of stuff (only when I'm bored). I think it's a demon thing for ESTPs to be left alone with nothing to do. If I get this mad because I'm bored idk about you guys? 
Type if you relate fam"
1142,estp,Can't relate. Would be annoyed if the starbucks girl was a caffeine addict though since its a crutch. Would get annoyed if people aren't aware of their surroundings and are blocking the stairway/street or walking slow
1143,estp,"When I'm bored, I usually think about my personal problems. In this time the craziest solutions come to my mind. And I see them actually like a good one. But often I'm tired of people and than get angry. I love company. But sometimes people around me are too sensitive and they complain about every little thing, take things too personally and die in their own misery. In this moment they expect, that I'll give them my energy. It's so tiring. Then I get frustrated and I start to be angry and mean to this people. "
1144,estp,"Lol yeah I relate hard to slow walkers. If it's in an open park or a wide concrete walkway I'm totally fine, but if it's crowded and I see some group of hipsters on their phone walking slow asf and I need to get somewhere, I get mad."
1145,estp,"To start, I'm convinced I can achieve and get anything I want no matter the obstacles and confidence has never really been a problem in that area. However I always seem to struggle with knowing what I want which often leads me to feeling lost in life and then I never seem to do anything at all. I read somewhere that has something to do with our low Ni? Idk?  I'd really like to get over that as I feel at my best when I'm doing/conquering things. I just need to know what do I want. And also I detest doing something just for the purpose of doing it, it has to make sense, you know? Can you relate at all and if you do, how do you deal with this?"
1146,estp,"Relatable. I find interest in A LOT of things. Can’t keep it for too long though.
I tend to have a lot of diverse interest that keep me occupied. If one gets more boring I switch to another but I find myself balancing 100 things instead of being 100% into any one thing. "
1147,estp,"I totally get this my man! I hear people say, “Well doing something is better than nothing”. Sometimes they say that in a “I know best” way. Like fuck off that’s not always right dipshit. But I digress. Just doing something for no reason is not good enough l. It’s empty and meaningless and I have no motivation cuz there’s no means to this end!!! "
1148,estp,"Some good advice that an ENTJ friend gave is to try a lot of things if you don't know exactly what you want. In process of trying out these different things you'll find some that are more interesting and others that will bore you, some where you excel and possibly have a future ahead of you, and others that are not the best application of your capabilities and talents. Worst thing you can do is to try nothing and keep wasting time. This is the path this ENTJ guy has followed, and after holding like 30+ different kinds of jobs, gaining experience and skills and testing waters, he finally started his own business in his mid-40s and now he is doing what he enjoys that is also making him a lot of money."
1149,estp,"Can I please ask some ESTPs to elaborate on this? 
I broke up with an Estp because of exactly this- he is grown (in his late 40s) but has never seemed to figure out how to set priorities and live in alignment with them. 
I felt like he was using me and was inconsiderate because he didn’t value me. So I ended things— he didn’t take it well, which was very confusing. I’m trying to be less confused. Would appreciate help. "
1150,estp,"Your thoughts about people hurting you after you became vulnerable sounds like him too. His dad was abusive and he wasn’t allowed to be himself growing up. He was the child of immigrants and they just wanted him to excel and live according to their native cultural standards of excellence. So they crushed his sense of self. He had to fight to make space for himself, which is why I think he doesn’t like anything encroaching on his freedom now. His self is fragile and so the demands of others will easily overwhelm him. He has a harder time saying ‘no’ than one would think an ESTP would, so he avoids closeness so he’s not letting people down. 
I think this was why he liked me— I held space for him to be him, and to be vulnerable as he figured things out about himself.  I’m very protective of those I care about in this way. It just seemed like every time we were together and felt closer to each other, he would then do something that was exactly what he knew would unduly push my boundaries. Like cancelling dinner plans at the last minute for work and then wanting to come over later after going out with others (I shut that down). Or sadly continuing to try to not use protection in bed, but repeatedly saying he didn’t want kids. Then he would never call me- just wait for me to call him. 
I still miss him a lot- he didn’t seem to understand why I liked him. But I was totally in love with him. It felt like we had always known each other.  But his actions put me at odds with my self worth, and that’s not ok. 
Do you have anxiety when you separate from someone you care about? 
How do you deal with the desire to push boundaries and the impact of this on other people? "
1151,estp,"Yeah I do that too. In general boredom is a big problem and I personally find that if I dwell in it for too long it leads to depression so I have to switch things up constantly. 
How do you balance that with work/school tho? Or even people around you?"
1152,estp,"There arent enough details here for me to give you a good answer but I'll try.
ESTPs tend to have a devil may care attitude and can be projected out in a negative way and I HATE being bound by things and that could be something like priorities...we naturally rebel against rules and structure....even if we agree with them."
1153,estp,"Same for me. I have noticed that with the more projects I'm busy, the more I progress in all of them. If I'm focused on one task, I start slacking, just not my thing to be busy with one project. And I think the same counts for most ESTPs. We all want something, most people are just too lazy to start working on it. 
What works for me is this: think 10 years ahead in the future. What does the successful version of you look like? How did he get there? Try starting there. "
1154,estp,"Thanks! I get not liking rules— I am the same way in that if I don’t like doing something, I probably won’t do it. But I try to keep in mind that I value some other people and need to treat them with respect, respect their time, etc. 
How do you maintain close relationships with people? Or a committed romantic relationship? 
Do you find that people have no idea that you care for them and leave your life? "
1155,estp,"Well If someone is treating you as if you are completely worthless then leaving him was a good call and not liking rules or structure doesn't mean I'm completely terrible to other people. For example, I hate being late as I hate having to wait for people. I think it's very inconsiderate and I try my hardest to be on time...do people recognize this effort? Most of the time no but I still do it and it's my way of showing respect.  
Ahhh you touched on an interesting topic. I don't know how to answer this really and I'm not sure if my answers reflect an estp type or if it just reflects my life experiences...before I begin i wanted to point out that it's very hard for me to open up  to people and I don't mean I'm  an introvert, I just think Ive been punished by people when Ive opened up to them, loved them and become vulnerable to them and that started by my phsco mother...I lover her to death but she is mentally ill and extremely selfish. ESTPS are generally fighters and I attest to this, I fight for a sport and love love love a good challenge but when someone I care about fights with me it's either fight or flight and if I fight (via arguments and discussions obviously) I will probably win but people will get hurt by my words and in turn create a much bigger problem so I run away....aannnyywwaayy   i have a lot of friends and many that I consider very close friends of mine....I don't know what I offer outside of a fun and good time but I'd like to think that I come in for them when they need it, when one of my friends needed help moving I was basically the first one to show up and I started helping hours before anyone else came. When my friend went through a breakup I stayed around him as much as I could. Romantic relationships have been very difficult for me, iv been burned way too many times. I'm a 28 yo male btw.
Yes people think I don't care about them but I really do. My sister learned this about me, that I care but I don't show it and I don't communicate things very well."
1156,estp,"On the INFJ page its mentioned often that INFJs don't really like or get along with ESTPs.  Im curious what your opinion of us is.  
I met a guy who is ESTP and he's quite possibly the most interesting guy I've ever met.  
I've only known a few in the past and I tend to have love/hate relationships with ESTPs.  
Personally what I love about your type that I see often is you all tend to be quite intimidating and you don't take shit from anyone.  I personally HATE passive aggressiveness and am drawn to straight forward people.  
I know that INFJs are known to hate conflict and are passive aggressive, but I grew up in a very verbal outspoken home and I would rather you call me out and solve the issue right away.  If I have to dwell it eats me alive.  
I guess I really hope the relationship develops but when I read these subs I get nervous from all the people who say they don't get along with your type.  "
1157,estp,I'm not an ESTP but am an INFJ and I've been married to an ESTP for 28 yrs. Definitely challenging at times but we make it work. Sometimes we have a love/hate relationship but always work thru it by good communication.  It's definitely not boring and we seem to balance each other out.
1158,estp,"It's funny because I came to this thread to ask exactly the same question. I am an INFJ and I recently met ESTP who I developped a crush on. 
Actually, it's quite understandable in socionics terms - because INFJs and ESTPs are duals - they are believed to balance eath other's functions. Because one's Inferior is the other one's Dominant. 
I've had very different experiences with ESTPs. One was professor at Uni, who's lectures I used to enjoy a great deal, and had a great friendship with him. The other one was the guy I used to briefly date, and it was frankly awful. We had very different political views and passively hated each other for them. 
I have high hopes for this new ESTP I've met. INFJ and ESTP is a challenging but exciting mix in my opinion. And nor we nor ESTPs like boredom, so.. :)"
1159,estp,"I am an ESTP (male) and my mom is an INFJ. I thoroughly enjoy hanging out with my mom; we get along extremely well. I am the youngest of four children, all of which are different types (ENTJ, ENFJ, and ESFJ, respectively). I can confidently say that I get along with my mom the best. INFJs are really good at playing the extrovert, and ESTPs are really good at playing an introvert at times. We have very similar interests and even read the same kinds of books. We definitely see/perceive things differently at times, but we respect the other's opinion. Part of it is probably because she is my mother and she raised me, but I think the INFJ/ESTP combo is definitely a complimentary one. "
1160,estp,"I think INFJs are hot. They are intriguing and I don't get them. I want to get them. They can get on my nerves. 
I don't like INFJs though. They seem dumb to me. I think that's just because of the way the INFJs I know have chosen to respond. If they liked me, I would like them. My Fe (ESTP Tertiary) is REALLY child-like. "
1161,estp,"One of my best friends is an INFJ and we get along really well. She laughs along at my antics and is really supportive of me. She also keeps me in line, allows me to consider other people's feelings and is great to reflect with about my emotions. 
I think that I help her to be a little more free and open to new experiences. 
INFJ & ESTP can be very complimentary in the right conditions. "
1162,estp,How do you connect with people? I think thats one of the biggest issues when people say they don't connect.  My best friend is an ENFP and we connect by have deep conversations about life and stuff.  I just know that Sensors don't necessarily like conversations like that so I would already know my guy friend and I won't connect like that.  But I wanna know what you consider to be a connection with another person.  
1163,estp,Okay this gives me hope. How do get an ESTP to just chill out or get a straight answer from them? He just loves playing games and its fun at times but if we're not going to develop into anything I dont wanna waste my energy on this. And i read they get bored easily and i fear that I will find him more interesting and fun than he finds me. 
1164,estp,"I find this so funny, because an INFJ will understand and ESTP better than you probably understand yourself.  It sucks for us too, because we just wish someone got us.  
I can totally understand an ESTP getting frustrated with an INFJ with how they respond.  Its more of a sensor thing than anything else.  I have made a few decisions where my Sensor friends didn't understand and thought I was being stupid, but I wasn't going to change my mind.  I actually sometimes have to stay away from Sensor types because you can be so persuasive, and your decisions might not be what's best for me.  Yet whenever I need the best most logical answer I ALWAYS go to my dad who is an ESTJ.  He will not put emotion into his decisions and he can give me different ideas on what to do.    
Also, in my opinion I think INFJs and ESTPs are the most stubborn of all types, in the most opposite of ways.  Also INFJs and ESTPs will be most likely to take pride in who they are, for different reasons. 
Honestly, I love that you guys don't take crap from anyone, and I like people who won't do something just because EVERYONE else is doing it.  I can be very intense and I need someone who can put me in my place and not fall for my manipulation.  Thats why I think I am so drawn to ESTPs.  You drive me INSANE at times, but somehow I keep coming back for more!!"
1165,estp,"Haha yeah. Its probably the one personality type i would have to work the hardest with. I know one ESTP. Hes actually my pastor, and he is the only pastor/ person in the church that I like. Hes so blunt and honest and real. Its super refreshing, esp for someone who hates church and every thing that has to do with it. 
The planning part hahaha. Its so painful trying to live in the moment, taking it day by day. It stresses me out so much. So being with people who cant plan anything makes me really anxious. But we would almost compliment each other. I can plan Everything, but actually doing what i planned takes a ton of energy, i need someone who helps me just jump into things. "
1166,estp,"I can only answer from my personal experience so it might not apply to you.  With us, yes, he is always the one that wants to go-go-go all the time.  He knows I need my quiet time and that social situations overwhelm me easily.  It's just something that he knew about from the beginning.   He allows me the space and time I need.  In turn, I have to allow him to go and do things he wants to do even if I don't want to go. 
I suppose for the relationship to work well both people need to be willing to be honest with each other about their wants/needs.  But, I would say that applies to ALL relationships - regardless of personality type.
As far as getting a straight answer - that can be tough.  At times, we can have what I think is a deep, meaningful conversation and I think we're on the same page only to find out he is in a completely different place.  It's those times where we have to have a ""Come to Jesus"" conversation and get things straightened out and I call him on his BS.  For me, I find the more direct and clear I am about my feelings, the better it is for him to understand.  I can't beat around the bush, hints don't work, etc.
Every relationship is different.  I hope this helps!"
1167,estp,"She was (and is) beautiful, and I felt something when we made eye contact. From there, she was very optimistic and interested in me. She didn't reveal much about herself at first, and continued to ask me question after question, until i started to pick up on her tendencies. Once i had her pegged, i knew which questions she did and didn't want to answer. I enjoyed watching her give in to heart over her mind, when she would answer the questions she felt like she shouldn't. and dat ass tho."
1168,estp,"This ISFP who is married to an ESTP (10+ years) said she caught his eye by not being easy to get, when he could get any girl, and by basically allowing him to have his freedom, not being clingy, controlling, or possessive but letting him go about his things while having a life of her own, and by being always able to come up with a comeback. But then ISFPs are supervisors of ESTPs, so it's very common that ESTP men put ISFP women on a pedestal and end up chasing after them."
1169,estp,"OP has said nothing in that direction at all, you just assumed and berated him for it. Since he's asking for a ""missing"" one it's more like he wants to collect them all.  
Hey /u/sensationall, here's a masterlist but yes, most ES ones are missing."
1170,estp,"INFJS ARE THE WORST
jk i love them to death, we're surprisingly alike for ""opposites"".  we get along best in conversation though...when it comes to getting out and doing stuff, our differences are much more evident.  overall though i'd definitely recommend them, 9/10 you go INFJs (minus one point for being so rare) 
source: having an INFJ mom and an INFJ best friend"
1171,estp,"My younger sister is an infj and my ex gf turned best friend is an infj.
They suck at accepting when they are wrong. They suck at apologizing in general and they cry when you get truely mad enough to call them on thier shit and tell them to knock it off. They can be mistaken for extroverts because they have a bright shiny quality about them that draws people... but they really NEED  alone time to recharge. They will get you when no one else seems to... that means they can call you on you bs too... 
You will war and you will love with each other... 
You will want to protect them and shake sense into them all at the same time... that feeling from what I understand is mutal. 
I have been pretty luck to know these girls. Though I have hated and loved them both. Its a frustrating and fun experience."
1172,estp,"OMG.
I Need an INFJ in my life at all times. 
They're masterminds that can use my situation awareness effortlessly into a mutually beneficial experience. 
I have 3 INFJ's I truely trust. All three are top tier friends haha.
They're the brains behind our plans, While I'm more of the face in a way. We work too good together, I pick up on their hints and act accordingly. We work the crowd really well. I can't even count how many friends, and sales we've made. The night usually ends really well with us. They're great entrepreneurial partners as well. "
1173,estp,"j/k, we have an agreement that I go out and socialize frequently, and every once in a while we have small gatherings with a few friends.
I also remind her, as lovingly as possible, about time committments.
And when I smell grass or smoke, or peppermint I remember to say ""this reminds me of my childhood"" "
1174,estp,"ISTP here, need some input.  I just recently met my girlfriends cousin, and just learned she's an ESTP.  Her and I have a lot in common, and I really like her.  My girlfriend and I have been together for three years, but are at the point where we both agree that we're not really compatible for a relationship and would be happier with other people.  Even my girlfriend thinks I should date her cousin.  
My question to you is: how do I know if she likes me, and is there any advice you can give me to maintain a relationship with an ESTP? 
She seems like she's into me, but I don't know if she's just being really friendly.  She likes to tease me, often with insults.  Is that something all ESTPs do, or is that how you guys flirt?  Her and I talk a lot, though I usually initiate the conversations (I know you guys don't like to text much, but she seems to enjoy talking if we are talking about something interesting), but she usually prefers to talk on Skype when possible.  
She and I both share a lot of interests (shooting, driving, dangerous activities).  I have been tossing the idea around inside my head of becoming a police officer, I plan to start training as soon as I turn 18 (next April), and she has 6 more months of training and she will be a police officer.  I would think shared interests would be a bonus, but she always says opposites attract.  Do you guys like people that share interests with you, or people that are different?
Any input or advice is appreciated."
1175,estp,"Just be fun man. Do activities together, you're both STP, enjoy it ! 
Don't play games. Honest and direct always work for ESTPs. 
And if things ever get weird, awkward or confusing, just tell her :
""Maybe making out for a few minutes would help us figuring things out""
Best luck !"
1176,estp,"I'm a female ESTP and for the most part I am always more attracted to introverts in general. I tend to find extroverts too much. It tends to lead to this dangerous cycle of constant entertainment. My bf is an introvert and he keeps me grounded when I go too far.
I say that to keep a relationship with an ESTP you need to be open to just doing a lot of random activities spur of the moment. Maybe surprise her with a date every once in awhile. Keep it interesting and be open to new possibilities. Be frank with how you feel. Don't hide things to protect her feelings."
1177,estp,"Kinda hard to do activities together when she's on the other half of the earth.  Haha.  She's in China right now.  She gets back to the states in June, and when she's back, my girlfriend and I are taking a road trip down to Cali to see her.  
That sounds like a great way to figure things out.  xD
Thanks for the input.  "
1178,estp,"Well, definitely not the best configuration or setting. 
Maybe you should figure out what you want first
Chasing two birds at the same time (especially if they are in the same family) is definitely not recommended, even with STP skills "
1179,estp,"When I feel like life sucks, I got fuck shit up. Go out, party with friends till I'm fucking hammered and the night was fucking crazy. Then, ONLY then, I want to get to work and get shit done for like 1-2 months and then I go back to being a fucking retard. I need both. If I just work I'm depressed, if I just party I'm depressed AND if I party/work moderately I'm depressed.
​
I really need to work hard and party hard."
1180,estp,"Hello. I'm an ENTP and my dad is an ESTP. Lately he's been super critical of himself and he brings himself down for every little thing he does wrong (today he almost bit into a olive pit and he ranted for 20 minutes about how he's a worthless idiot).  
I feel like he has a lot of problems in his life. Lately he hasn't been doing well financially (his job is sort of seasonal, as he gains more during summer. We're not doing badly, as my mom is fine financially, but I think it contributes to him feeling worthless), he thinks my grandma's health is deteriorating, his sister has just retired (she's a little crazy and she keeps coming at our house)...  
I obviously can't solve the various problems he has in his life but how can I cheer him up? Should I try and spend more time with him, or leave him alone? Any advice is welcome. "
1181,estp,"Just be there for him. Talk to him and don't draw attention to the problems per se unless he brings the issues up. If he wants to spend time with you, do so. If he doesn't, respect that. When I find myself in ruts like that, I just know I'm in for a grind and I do what I can to fix my situation, but I know one day I'm going to wake up and snap out of it, because that's just how it is. 
Basically, respect his wishes and take his feedback as law. We like to handle our emotions ourselves, but sometimes we like a little help and of course it's nice to know those around us care. Just don't push, if he says no every time or you're asking too often, lay off for a while. Trust your gut but know when to set it aside and let him do his thing "
1182,estp,"I don’t react well to people deliberately trying to cheer me up. If Im in s bad mood and someone tells me a joke to try and cheer me up it generally makes me more pissed. When I’m in a bad mood I am intensely thinking about what caused it and how to fix it. Anything that distract from my train of thought generally upsets me even more. 
I’d say best thing to do is just to leave him alone, maybe ask if he’s feeling better in an hour or two. Eventually he’ll come around by his own accord. 
Yes I realise by the time I’ve written this the moment has long gone but I figured I’d put this here for future reference.  "
1183,estp,"As an ESTP, I like shooters, I like the fast paced and competitive side (much like all my ESTPs colleagues here). 
But my preferred type is RPG- action adventure, like Skyrim, the Witcher, Fallout. I like them because I don't get bored. The storyline is deep, the gameplay is fun, you have the freedom to do (almost) what you want. 
I feel like with other games even with shooters sometimes I get bored super easily. I buy them, play them intensely for a few days and get bored once I've tried all gameplay loop and mechanism. 
I need something exciting and new all the time otherwise I drop it fast and move on "
1184,estp,"As an ESTP I like to play competitive shooters so I can compare my skill rating with others (shooters have shorter games than moba so it will take less time from my life). Also base building games where I can make own systems and structures. And some timekiller browser based games which have achievements so I feel great after achieving those. And of course big AAA games like GTA, Witcher etc when I have free days.
As far as I have seen similar threads, where people study game preferences, there is always all the games featured. Every people play different styles on different days and moods.
The real question you want to ask is something like this: ""Describe what video games do you play. Why and when do you play those?"""
1185,estp,"my biggest time sink was borderlands 2, that was like crack to me. Also a big fan of Overwatch and call of duty. I never bothered with the story I just enjoy killing people. 
so yeah, +1 for shooters here as well."
1186,estp,"Once I find a game I really like I binge until there's nothing left of interest to me, on the flip side an INFP friend of mine likes mixing and matching the games he plays on a regular basis. Maybe there is a correlation?"
1187,estp,"Action, fighting, RPG, adventure, visual novel, and recently FPS with Overwatch, but I wouldn't consider that your typical FPS.
I've taken a break from tournament play due to personal life and just not enjoying the local toxicity."
1188,estp,"Hey guys, INFP here according to the index. Since I'm supposed to be the 'polar opposite' to you I'm really interested in how you would ""see the world"". See I constantly have this ongoing monologue in my head, like me talking to myself, kind of shutting out the external world to an extent. I would guess this is different  with someone who is a) extroverted and b) sensory over intuitive.I really believe in trying to learn something from those people different from yourself. I frequently get lost in my head and ignore my surroundings due to all these interesting ideas and scenarios I make up for myself. My questions to you: Do you ever get lost in thought in the same way that say someone like me? Do you tend to think in pictures or in words? And if you don't think in words do you think it's because your thought process runs to fast for you to have this kind of ""monologue"" I experience?
Would be really interesting to get some insight in how you guys would see the world differently. Probably a good way to dismantle any stereotypes there might be too. Appreciate any answers!"
1189,estp,"If i get lost in thought, it’s just me going over things I have to do, things that happened during the day, or I’m piecing together how things work. If I want to relax or sleep, I have to force myself to daydream and imagine.  
Random but an example that happened today of a thought I had: “does the amount of muscle mass you have help women deliver a child?” googles it briefly and skims the title of two articles for conclusion
If I don’t find an answer in 2 minutes, I’m distracted and move onto my next thought or action. 
I don’t always think in words as much, maybe more in memories? Is that considered pictures idk? I do agree that the thought process and logical understanding is too fast/complex for a monologue explanation. No clue if this made sense hope it helped. "
1190,estp,"thought processes tend to be at extreme ends of one another.  
I go over possible events, at its best outcome and at its worst outcome and then mentally prepare for the both of them.  
I get ""lost in thought"" but not in its typical sense, i won't just sit and think. More than likely, ill be moving while I think, doing everyday activities.   
I think in both words and pictures, but words being of discussion/monologue with others. If I talk to myself, its a few words and then I get on with whatever I was doing.   
As to learning from other people, I don't seek out to learn from others, it just happens.  
hope this helps
​"
1191,estp,"The way I handle a problem is to first stay calm and determine what the problem is.
​
Then measure the problem to see if it's big or small as this will determine in the ""HOW"" will I solve it.
​
So if it's a small one, then I just go ahead and tackle it. Mainly through trial and error until the problem is solved. Learn as I go style.
​
If it's a big one, then I might look for the advice of other people who have experienced a similar issue, or I will do further research on my own.
​
Once I feel confident with a solution, then I will go ahead and apply it and then pray 13 hail Marys that it will work.
​
If it doesn't work out, then I just try to think on what could have gone wrong and how can I do better next time ? Then try again with the new wisdom acquired.
​"
1192,estp,"I overthink tiny/somewhat insignificant things, like crushes, questions in exams (the question will be 1 + x = 8, x = ____ and I’ll be sitting there for 10 mins being like, this must be a trick question, it can’t be that easy etc.)
Pictures 
Looking at a ton of words just bores me/I can’t concentrate, like you expect me to read that whole page about secondary cartilaginous joints? No, not happening
But for the most part, I don’t really think, I just go go go (for most things, not huge life changing choices). "
1193,estp,Sure helped! Yeah I thought about the whole thing about thinking in words often being to slow a process. I tend to do that. Which is why I'm generally not too good in tough traffic lol. My father though (Who is an extroverted sensing-dom too) seems to do all of those high speed decisions very effortlessly. These kinds of things made me think just about this. 
1194,estp,"Thanks! I find it interesting when people think in pictures, which I seem to rarely do. I’m pretty bad actually for example at rembering how places I’ve been looked and all of that. What I seem to have though is a quite good auditory memory, which probably is why I’m really into music. 
Don't know how if this rather is a personal thing, but it seems to me a lot of infp's are prone to enjoy expressing themselves in words and writing, maybe something that accounts for ""feelers"" in general. "
1195,estp,"Right .., explanations of our logic paths aren’t easy to explain verbally but I’ll try. In my head there’s a web of logic explaining why things happen. I don’t sit down and think about them or try to explain them, they’re just there. Thats the underlying logic web that flickers through my brain as the present occurs. I can better predict what will immediately happen but shitty at long term strategic predictions because my brain only does well in close vicinities. 
ESTPs are good at the now. Enjoying it, managing it, improving it, creating it. 
And I love skirting around traffic (if I’m not actually in a rush). "
1196,estp,"I enjoyed that video so much, thanks. I agree Scott is an ESTP, I think so. And that's not the first time I've known an ESTP to use a baseball bat as a weapon. lol
This guy is probably  an ESTP.
And this guy too. "
1197,estp,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
1198,estp,"Hey, guys! 
What's the best way to show ESTP you like them? 
I like this ESTP guy (I am INFJ by the way), and I am sensing that he likes me back. We usually comment each other on facebook, and when we meet in a group of people I feel like he pays special attention to talking and interacting with me.
I can proceed to subtly flirt with him, but I can also straightforwardly ask him out. I am quite confident in that way and am not afraid of rejection, at least I'll move on.
What would you recommend? Do you like straightforward people or is it a turn off? "
1199,estp,"Go ahead and tell him you like him.
Sure, flirting is fun, but no need to 'beat around the bush' with ESTPs. Being straight-to-the-point isn't a turn-off, atleast to me, but shows confidence and is a more effective way to communicate. Good luck!"
1200,estp,"Flirt and please be straight forward. Ask questions about him to show that you're interested in who he is and joke a bit with him too (maybe even a little suggestively). ESTP's love talking and if you can make them laugh, I think it'll go well :)"
1201,estp,"Ok so people here have been saying to be straight forward with ESTPs.
I have been pretty much doing all of what has been suggested here (being extremely straight forward and suggestive) and he's been very responsive at times. But then he is really avoidant when it comes to setting up a date to actually meet, eventhough he says he wants to. Then there's times when he doesn't respond to any messages in weeks just to continue sending me hot suggestive messages for several days. I don't want to be the one always calling because when I suggest a concrete time to meet via text it is left unanswered, but maybe that's what it takes?"
1202,estp,"Everyone at my work was MBTI tested and then required to  perform a self-verification through several exercises. I tested ENTP but self-verified as ESTP, but I'm still not sure.
I have always had a strong ""intuition,"" but what I mean by that word is a physical sensation in my gut or body that lets me know if something is not right. I do prefer to stay present and grounded, but I can't deny that strong intuitive urge that I sometimes get without explanation or facts to back it up. I often find that the facts later reveal themselves. 
What is meant by intuition and how do you apply it to your ESTP type?"
1203,estp,"You can be an estp and have a more developed Ni than an INxJ. The order is about preference not quality of your using the function. Like, my Te is pretty damn good, but I just don't see the point in it on a day to day basis that a Te-Fi type would. Also yes, you sound like an stp."
1204,estp,"xNFPs and xSTPs are known to run into problems.
I don't have too much experience dealing with xSTPs myself, but I guess my advice would be to keep it light and humorous. Don't try and get into your personal values too much, and don't get too philosophical.
Keep things fun and action oriented."
1205,estp,"As an infp with an istj mother I know the feeling.  I think the only advice I can give you is just get on with it best you can.  You don't really give us much info as to what the two of you struggle to agree on.  But at the end of the day just because he's your father doesn't mean he's perfect, the two of you will probably never see completely eye to eye, as you are so different.  You just need to try to build the best possible bridges for you two to help each other as best as possible and accept that you won't always get along."
1206,estp,"Hey! I'm and ENFP and I have an ESTP father too! I know how you feel. What I've found, is try not to talk deeply about things, because they won't really get it. The biggest problem is they never make a plan. While ENFPs don't always try to make a plan, we tend to do it when we need to. The same cannot be aid for ESTPs. Instead, try showing them the problem in the moment. As for your specific problems, I'm not really sure how to help. I guess you could try showing him how long it takes to do stuff on the computer on a day off or something, but I don't really know about the others. I don't know if you are religious, but if you are, I would pray about it. Good luck, I hope you and your father work things out. "
1207,estp,"I (an INFP) know about 3 different ESTPS and an ISTP in my life and I've noticed a commonality between them. In my experience, they really don't seem to give a shit about ethics, morality, or philosophy. When they give their opinion on some issue or another, there's always this sense that they really don't give a shit what they're saying; it's as if they're just trying to amuse themselves. So I have to agree with Mr. Choogly here, take it easy and ignore any moral transgressions that may be perpetrated by the ESTP. I actually quite enjoy their company, they're fun to drink with. As a rule, I tend to enjoy the company of Perceivers, I enjoy the chaos."
1208,estp,"Some things that top the list. 
Trying new ways to do things
New ideas to make money for the company/family
Getting him to understand that computer work isn't magic and can take just as long to finish as physical work
Helping him to focus on pride in the brand instead of being a ""used car salesman"""
1209,estp,"New ideas to make money for the company/family  
I can already see the problem here - ESTP father being dismissive of ENFP ideas. This isn't atypical. If you're the type to generate new ideas all the time (""What about this? What about that? All these possibilities!""), you have to understand that simply stating your idea isn't enough. Nor is your father interested in pursuing every 'possibility' that you can generate.  
This isn't to say you're not coming up with good ideas. But he most likely believes you're just generating random, un-developed, spontaneous ideas. It's typical of Ne (Extroverted Intuition) users to be able to come up with a fleeting, creative idea - but can't back it up.  
What you need to do is pick an idea that you really think can go somewhere, and develop it. Tell him you have an idea to present to him, and ask him for 5 minutes - then make a formal presentation to him. Launching idea after idea at him is only going to make him more dismissive of you. You have to prove to him and persuade him that your idea could actually go somewhere. I'm sure this will be difficult given the father-child relationship - but try your best.  
Remember, ESTPs don't care about possibly exploring every little idea that pops into your head. They care about what works, what's real, and what has value. If you can prove that your ideas have merit to a realist ESTP, he will respect it. "
1210,estp,"Clearly every case varies person by person imo. 
ESTPs are amazing lovers and they can be great partners too. 
If you quit being “superavailable,” he will find a way to be with you if he cares to. You can’t force anything. 
You might realize he doesn’t care about you nearly as much as you care about him. If that’s the case, respect yourself and leave. ESTPs will take advantage of your loyalty/love if you let them. "
1211,estp,"Stop thinking about what you think you should be, and just do you. Generic advice, I know, but if you change yourself he can't know you, and if he can't know you, he can't love you. 
He doesnt even know, but if he wants you he'll tell you. And if he's anything like me, he'll tell you exactly what he wants from you. If he doesn't want what you want, then there's nothing you can do. 
Ni is very stubborn. I've seen a lot of my Ne friends in denial that they can change an Ni user's mind, you can't. He wants what he wants, but he probably doesn't know what he wants yet. 
All you can do is be completely real and see if he wants you. It really isn't up to you or him, it just is or isn't. But if you want it, you've gotta give it a shot.
Edit: and keep in mind, ENTPs and ESTPs are strong, opposed forces. ENTPs are always in the future preserving the past with Ne-Si, ESTPs are always in the now changing the future. Both good, but very different life approaches. In my experience, enxps are great friends, but when it comes to going deeper, it's hard for them to sacrifice their internal perceptions, because really you can't. You could come to terms with it, but love won't be easy."
1212,estp,"As an entp female who's dated a few ESTPs when young and foolish  (because we have similar energies and openness and attract each other, that's true) the best advise I can give you is ignore whatever he says and look at how he behaves in the big picture. If he ignores you, he's not that into you. If he goes out of his way to do stuff for you, it means something. It's that simple with them. Bask in the sweet talking bouts, but don't let them fool you. If they don't fit his general attitude, it's bs. And oh do they love bs. It's not even malevolent, it's quite honest actually, but it's in the moment thing unless (again) all the rest adds up. Use this as an opportunity to sharpen that Ti. Oh and fuck his brains of course. "
1213,estp,"Hey, here is the first step you need to do 1) stop and breathe ok. You are putting out some strong vibes dial it back a bit. Just do you and if the guy is interested in what you are selling he'll come back, and if not move on. "
1214,estp,"So yeah. What you basically told me is that he isn't that into me. *sad me lol
Thanks a lot for your answer though <3 love your reaction and background.
But yeah, I will do that last thing I think."
1215,estp,"im with an estp and he's been the most loyal, trustworthy, open/honest person I've ever been with. The key is patience and communication. Be patient with them because ESTP's are very self focused and live in the moment... communicate because they're usually really open and to the point.  "
1216,estp,"Thats the main personality trait of ESTPs
They live in the moment ‘literally’, so if you’re not around him he doesn’t even try to remember you unless something about you comes his way.
It doesn’t mean you gotta stick around him always. If he likes you he’ll come around and do all the working 10/10 but if he doubts your reciprocation probably he’ll never make an effort to see you again, because they have so much going and hate to waste time on something that doesn’t have a future. Playing mind games would be totally useless!
Also ESTP guys love individualist girls with high family values(INFJ, ISFJ) but they shouldn’t work on common fields because they are highly competitive and once they get better than them, the charm is LOST. They’re very picky to commit long term and pretty much always open for a casual unnamed relationship but once they commit its for life (something like a Swan, mating for life)"
1217,estp,"Well, sounds like something you should try to talk out with him. Definitely no guarantee that'll go well, but analyze a relationship to death and you'll almost always come to the conclusion that it isn't going well. Tell him what you want and be ready for him not to want it. Just go for it."
1218,estp,"Hey, vita2day, just a quick heads-up:
therefor is actually spelled therefore. You can remember it by ends with -fore.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1219,estp,"Seems like you have your answer. If you think something isn't adding up, then there's no harm in really finding out if he's hiding feelings. If he is he probably doesn't know it, so that'd be a task to dig out of him. Like, he'd have to have a pretty huge epiphany about feeling and all that, so good luck. But if you actually love the guy then go for it, there's always more fish in the sea, but at some point you gotta follow your heart."
1220,estp,"I think he knows he has feelings for me. At least he says he does. He just doesnt want to fit them into his life and I think that's the most idiotic view I have ever heard in my life. 
Even though it probably makes sense in a weird way."
1221,estp,"Because he can't choose who he has feelings for but he wants to choose what fits his life, if that makes sense?
Anyway haven't heard of him for quite a while. so probably he has just forgotten me. gotten swept up in his life or smth :("
1222,estp,"I don't know, cause you really can't choose how you feel about people. It's too bad that it worked out the way it seems like it did. You never know, maybe your paths will cross and you'll get another chance. I've dealt with heartbreak too, it's not fun. "
1223,estp,"Thanks, I hope so. Although After every time I meet him I feel heartbroken again. I don't know why he allows me to be like this. Guess I will just have to accept he either doesn't care, doesn't want to care or thinks it shouldn't matter. Doesn't change the situation but I guess I am ok."
1224,estp,"Help! I'm an INFP newly married to ESTP husband. When we were dating we had a lot of sex. He couldn't keep his hands off me and typically had an erection any time we were near each other. Lol. I thought our sex drives were a good match. 
We abstained for a while before marriage and it was really difficult. We talked about having sex after marriage, fantasies, doing it ""like rabbits"" (his words) etc. He knew I wanted it every day. I would kind of joke about that and he would always say ""no"" but I figured it would be like earlier in our relationship when we had it several times a week, sometimes every day.  
Well, we didn't have sex on our wedding night. Then only a couple of times that first week and he seemed like he didn't really want to do it. I was confused so a week into our marriage I told him it seemed like he didn't want it as much as me so what did he want me to do? Should I initiate? (He has always said prior to marriage he would love for me to do that.)  He got kind of mad about it and said he was aware how much I wanted it and we shouldn't talk about it. I ended up crying and he left me to go sleep on the couch!  Then I was afraid to bring it up.  We've talked a little bit since then but I dont want to say too much and push him away.  Mentioning sex at all seems to turn him off. Like I dont even think I could send him a flirty text or pics.
I don't initiate because if I start touching him he will stop me. He doesn't like to kiss. So I just suppress my desires so I dont go crazy and I wait until he is ready. Then I have to get turned on quickly because he is fast and aggressive.  Sometimes it's hard for me to finish due to lack of foreplay and he gets frustrated because he could be done in a few minutes.  So that adds to the problem.
I'm trying to figure out how to get him back to his normal sex loving ESTP self. If he would allow me to initiate I could get him going but he seems almost stubborn about not having sex as often as I'd like. A couple of times he has seemed to relax a bit and acts like himself (sex 2 days in a row, maybe 3x a week) then we go a few weeks only having sex once a week. 
I think some of it is that he is under a lot if pressure from all the added responsibilities but he puts a lot of pressure on himself. I have a hard time getting him to relax. But I don't know what to do about that. 
Do you have any advice? "
1225,estp,"You might want to try r/deadbedrooms instead. Some people lose interest after marriage, like the “chase” is gone— seems like a semi-common theme over on that sub. Is there anything particularly stressful going on in his life currently, that could cause a loss of libido. Bottom line is communication is key here, you have to talk about it. Therapy sounds like a good idea, the sooner the better lest you wake up ten years from now stuck in a miserable marriage. "
1226,estp,"Hiii, I am an ESTP male dating an INFP female for a little over a year and a half. I would like to start by saying my gf is amazing and has taught me new-found appreciation for INFPs and for people who empathize naturally.. which we ESTPs do not....
I was wondering the timeline of your relationship? The thing about ESTP fantasies is they are much bigger and doable in our heads than reality usually permits..
Why didn’t you have sex on your wedding night...? That seems off.. Also, when I was in college and had a friends with benefits situation going on, once every 1.5 weeks was what I preferred. It didn’t start that way, but that’s eventually where it ended up via my choice. Also also, he left you to go sleep on the couch after he made you cry?! I hope he can learn to appreciate the times you are actually willing to divulge your inner feelings to him. Those divulgences are hard to come by and should be cherished, even if they are hard for the ESTP to comprehend and swallow. Keep sharing your feelings no matter how they make him feel !!! Stay strong and get what you want !!"
1227,estp,"He's probably going through stress and anxiety. Does he go to the gym at all? Yoga would help too. But estp loses desire when he is locked into a cage with strict boundaries. Maybe his job, or maybe you guys need a vacation, that always helps reset the mind of an estp. Also maybe try being aggressive overly so if possible, that will excite him more than anything, gotta tap into that tert si and be ferocious. But remember that is just the ignition when he gets started give him the keys to the ferrari. Try and make it look as attractive as possible, maybe do light workouts to tone your body. As long as he is a normal functioning adult he won't need to relax that is not the estp way lol"
1228,estp,"tap into your evolutionary side. FEEL your energy ramping up, feed off his energy, feed it into yours. fuck like rabbits, don't think about anything and just let nature take its course while you engage in the most intimate thing a man and woman can do.   
if hes being lame and isnt doing his job, then do yours better. he will mimic your energy, vice versa "
1229,estp,"This is a little different than the typical waning over time thing that happens in some marriages. He literally changed overnight. I agree with your advice about communication/counseling but also looking to tap into some ideas for his weird ESTP needs. 
 Because we are so opposite in our ways of thinking I'm at a loss."
1230,estp,"Thanks for your input. I love the INFP/ESTP dynamic as challenging as it is. We have only known each other 10 months but we are both near 40, have kids and past relationships with psychos. He never married though,  so hes coming from a place of always being 100% independent and alone. It's a big adjustment for him. He feels a loss of freedom regardless of how much space I give him. That's another factor. 
I know he loves me and cares about my feelings but he is often clueless.  He is open to learning and makes changes.  That's one thing I've always loved about him. He constantly tries to improve. He has trouble talking about feelings so his first reaction is to abandon ship (like go sleep on the couch) but hes getting better. 
So I think the reason we didn't have sex on the wedding night is because it bothered him that everyone kept making comments about it, like it was expected. He said it bothered him and that we should just not do it to prove them wrong.  I thought he was joking when he said that but he did put it off until the next morning.  Idk. He's weird like that. We were tired so it wasn't a huge deal but I was kinda confused as to why he didn't want to attack me like he did before we were married. Then that vibe just continued. 
So to update I did manage to get some sex this morning and he promised more later tonight. I asked for it, so I guess I'll try being more open.  I'm still trying to think of things that would turn him on without pressuring him.  I dont know how to pretend I dont want it all the time. Lol."
1231,estp,"Good advice, except ESTPs have four functions Se, Ti, then a tert Fe and weak Ni.
Si manifests in ESTPs as:
Can usually manage to create for themselves an environment of comfort,  but said comfort extends to very little, as they see no need to occupy  themselves with creating excessively cosy atmospheres. Wheras those with Si in thier function stack value comfort and creating cosy atmostpheres   
Si in the function stack, do not like Aggression nor do they like being aggressive, Si is wholesome and nostalgic and comfy, and likes quirkiness and cuteness, Si-Ne axis   
Everything else you say is correct though.  "
1232,estp,This is all I have wanted to do but feel trapped into just waiting on him and being boring! I hate it!  Maybe I can get over my fear of being rejected and fear of pushing him away and just see if going wild would work. I dont pursue him aggressively and tend to just shy away when he acts like he doesn't want me to touch him.
1233,estp,"My estp wants things to always feel fun, so that’s why I’m thinking maybe now that you’re married some of the fun is gone for him. Maybe try a “cat and mouse” game and see if you can get him interested that way. "
1234,estp,"I love it as well, and it is challenging at times ! Is your husband specifically asking for that space? Sometimes my lady will stop talking to me and tell me later she was giving me space she could tell I needed even though I did not ask for it. Have thought to myself a couple times and once out loud to her that it was she who needed space in those moments but just didn’t know how to convey that to me. Ceasing communication with seemingly no reason or end in sight is a great way to annoy me :) The ESTP is very dependent on others but also fiercely independent and will pretty much always do what he wants to do.. kind of a weird juxtaposition which makes us seem (or be) selfish at times :/
My gf loves I am always improving, open to learning, etc Very cute you’ve got the same thing going on ! Yeah, keep working with him on being in touch with his emotions and, harder still, considering the feelings of others. I could try day in and day out to improve this aspect of my personality until my dying day, and I wouldn’t even reach a tenth of my gfs current emotional intelligence, heh. She is wise beyond her years and in ways I will probably never be....
One of my community college girlfriends noticed I really wanted to be in control of when below the belt action would happen.. Something else I’ve had to work at over time. It shouldn’t happen on one partners whims alone, but it is a necessary component in a healthy relationship.
Congrats on the sex ! Being open is good.. We sure as shit don’t read minds, and INFPs, while experiencing a wealth of inner emotions at any given moment, are not exactly famous for sharing them, heh. Pretty cool you want it all the time tho lol !! ESTPs do love that good-good sensory input.. if you appeal to our senses sexually, you’ll have a better time than if you keep floating the same idea out. Scheduling sex can make it feel like a chore to me, but if my lady gives me enough of the right sensory input, she doesn’t even need to tell me she wants to have sex. I just get all excited like omg I’m probably about to do it !! She also has a sex-salt lamp that she turns on when she wants to do it. That can help shed light on what she’s trying to have go down haha. Sorry for the novel 🙃"
1235,estp,"Go for it fuck ur fears. To lighten up a full on going wild moment, give little hints throughout the day. A few cute glances and random make outs will get the idea in his mind and perhaps u won't have to make the ""move"" after all. Get creative have fun "
1236,estp,"I like your novels. I love hearing your estp perspective. The part about being dependent yet independent is spot on. Hes like that with a lot of things.  He wants others to help him yet then he pushes us away because he wants to be independent. Same with sex... he will say he wants me to initiate but then he stops me. Arrrrggghhh.  We had a long talk today and he revealed a lot of his feelings and it really wore him out and he hated it. But it was good. Essentially he is too stressed out to have sex. I never say anything about sex. I just get close to him and touch him without being pushy. I know he still gets turned on but then wont do it with me so I need to figure out how to work with that. It's not like I'm trying to get him to do something that he doesn't enjoy. Lol.  I think maybe he sees it as more work. 
If I turned on my salt lamp for sex it would always be on. Lol. Actually I'd probably get to every 3 days or so if it were regular. I think that would work for him but it's the longer gaps of 6 to 10 days that kill me and make me want it 2x a day or 3 days in a row. I need to figure out how to tell him that because I dont think he would have a problem with 2 to 3 times a week. Maybe he just thinks I won't be happy if it's not every day and that overwhelms him."
1237,estp,"Sadly i dont have my enneagram result but i guess i would be an 8 too.
In my past about 4-6 years ago i had some trouble controlling my temper i was just really impulsive. Now for 3 years i smoke weed and it really helped calm me down and chill about alot of things but i get lazy when i over use it.
I never snaped someone. Never felt the need but wasnt a typical Estp in my past. Overprotective mother made me week.  "
1238,estp,"I'm a 8w9 and not really do I have anger issues and/or problems. I would say, when I do get angry its explosive akin to a volcano erupting. But the thing is that it is rare for me to get really heated and angry. I'm generally calm and relaxed at all times, but hell everyone has a limit. "
1239,estp,"ESTP 8w9. Used to be very impulsive and quick to anger in my teen years, it just went away as I grew older and gave less shits. Being wing 9 might have contributed to mitigating my temper too, being somewhat peace loving and often going along with others."
1240,estp,"8w7 and yes, I've had a lot of blow ups, many of them well warranted. Drinking always made me much more aggressive. Becoming a father calmed me down a lot, as did becoming a felon (repeat offending ain't no joke).
What specific info are u looking for? Broad question, and I've got a lot of experience in this shit lol. "
1241,estp,"Hey, n0ksA, just a quick heads-up:
alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1242,estp,"nice iv been trying to research the most fierce types.an definitly estps and entjs are top two.alexandra the great was estp,and statisticaly stps are the highest personality types in prision.so its probably between estps and entjs"
1243,estp,"
Lay on the ground and literally feel the weight of everything on you. Then, get up. 
Go sweat. Now that you have literally stood up in the face of adversity, take it to the next level. Move in the face of adversity (run, swim, bike, whatever). 
Take a shower and go start doing that thing that had you psychologically pinned to the ground earlier. (Even if it’s a small step)

Repeat as you see fit. I find that the first step in moving past something is literally starting to move. Once you get going it’s easy to keep going. 
All that object in motion shit is real. "
1244,estp,"I don't know the technical term, but we have the same cognitive functions, in an inverted order. I got Ni, Fe, Ti, Se and you have Se, Ti, Fe, Ni.
I'm curious to know how you Se, Ti and Se-Ti combinaison manifests themselves. What comes easily to you? What situations are hard or complicated?
For anyone willing to help me out :)
Thanks in advance!"
1245,estp,"It's as if we were two sides of the same coin. INFJs try to understand the world so that they can grasp reality; and we want everything to have meaning. 
Then many opposite behaviours. Blunt to a Fault; huge trouble to acknowledge others' feeling or even presence. We also have trouble planning in the mid term. X years from now equals ""Dream"" we can deal with that! 
The next week, yes, it can be planned. But everything between a couple of weeks away and ""10 years dream"" is super blurry.
Trying out new stuff is exciting,  even if it means scary because it's a new situation.  We thrive on those.  We do feel fear when it comes to meeting people and trying new activities.  It's just that we easily plow through it anyway.  Then the power of Habits kicks in and it becomes easy...
INFJs are super fascinating,  because many Estps would love to have your Ni, it looks like a super power!"
1246,estp,"/u/sabotsailor and /u/ESTPresence have nailed it for the most part, agreed.
Social interactions are like being so familiar with a race track, you can drive the whole thing blindfolded with inverted steering. It's cake. Little to no emotion, no sympathy, blunt and honest.
This piece: 
is perfect. Goes along with my little analogy, you can see straight through people in a way and determine what and where they're going with something based on how they look, sound, and their actions. You can catch their bullshit before it falls right out of their mouth! 
Very willing to say ""fuck it, we'll do it live"", always have an idea for the future. Easily able to think on our feet, or at least I am. Flexible and reactive, never really structured. 
My favorite and most relatable emotion is adrenaline and the rush with it. 
I'm not claustrophobic at all, but I could see it. I also have a large bed but still sleep on one side of it, probably bi products of the military. 
Feel free to ask anything else"
1247,estp,"I'm like that too. I'm clueless when it comes to my own future whereas I can tell if someone else does and keeps doing something when they'll probably end up.
Can also relate. (I promise, I'm not a closeted ESTP!)
Yeah, I'm really getting a huge kick out of that Ni! It kinda is like a superpower..! All the following is not definitive, and yet : We can see where situations and habits or anything will lead to, but also where it most likely comes from (or at least have different hypotheses).
But enough of me, my question is mostly about how you express and balance the Se. Any thoughts? u/ESTPresence (Love the name btw!!)"
1248,estp,"Oh my gosh! That is perfect. And yes adrenaline is my favorite. I love caffeine and any activity that involves quick thinking and precise action. 
I go to bars and flirt because it is fun. It's fun to watch someone's body language as you test out lines and actions. It's like figuring out a puzzle and getting the rhythm. Once you find the trick, you win the game and have fun with her. "
1249,estp,"Thanks for taking the time!
Here's one: When I experience the Se, it's usually not in a ""controlled"" environnement. It's usually through the inferior grip. It manifests mostly in craving skin contact. Being married, it's not an issue, but I'm wondering if you'd have any insight to balance this one-sided craving for physical touch. Would combining with another sense help? Which one is the most likely to dissipate the one-sidedness of the crave? Any ideas coming to mind?"
1250,estp,"Se is our ""essence"". We feel everything, the objects, the people, different kind of ""energy"" most of the time. It's like Daredevil, except not blind and using sight a lot haha
This is mostly true when surrounded with people. I hate crowds and crowded areas. Time square is the bane of my existence.  I never have enough space.  If I'm in a park or a meadow, a square,  by myself,  then I can breathe!  
I would assume it's common for Se Dom. We just learn to live with the claustrophobia... 
When I sleep by myself on a queen bed... This is soooooooooo good!!! 
Then, there is this idea of ""flow"" from Se. But, for Se Dom it's almost subconscious.  We do not turn Se on and off like an auxiliary function.  It's just there. Hence,  the stereotype of body language reading.  This is true. It's super easy with a bit of focus to see everything going on with someone else 's body. Micro expression,  small hand movements,  even breathing speed and intensity. Up to us to determine (with Ti) What that means...  Or we can just ask bluntly ""you made a cringy face just now, what is that for?"" which, believe it or not, is very well received by people.  It shows you actually care xD
There's a lot more to it but I have to leave reddit now :p 
Thx btw,  I find this name duper fun ;)"
1251,estp,"I like to destroy things and play violent sports like American football or lacrosse for instance, but no I don't like being touched much. I'm about to be engaged (Oh boy) and my girl is always wanting to be super touchy, I'm not super into that but it's not just because I'm being touched. Holding hands or holding onto someone is confining, I like to be able to move unrestricted "
1252,estp,"It's so strange. I feel like I do the same thing.. I observe a lot, a lot. I see the slightest change, but it usually starts my Ni function and evaluate the reason for the change.
Can your own body (not psyche) be of this external world, or are you limited to what's outside even your own senses?
So fascinating! Thanks for your time, and maybe for the next time too!"
1253,estp,"Ahhh, makes sense too. I've also experienced this.
Then, I guess it translates into the desire for instant gratification, maybe that's more relatable? Same question though. Your answer's still sports?"
1254,estp,"What I grasp from your second paragraph is questioning of reality.  (maybe I'm wrong)
It sounds very Ne to me. ""what else could it be?"" 
Estps do not have this problem. Reality is the stuff we see with our own eyes and that we feel with our bare hands. There is no questions here, it just is...
That may be why Se Dom are so grounded. This reality is my baseline, what I have to work with. Then we get creative with that.
What Ni does to us, is that is drives us to wonder. Reality is so certain that, we hope there's something more to it. I would argue that Estps are quite spiritual people. The idea of the spiritual, the magic, the unconventional, is super enticing. 
This is where the balancing Se that you were mentioning comes into play. 
It's a struggle between the real life and the ""what if"".
I guess part of growing up is appreciating every little moment with our Se, ""stopping and smelling the roses"" haha
But I believe it's good to still ponder about our existences and how the world works. Stuff like mortality,  Buddhism,  philosophy on morality,  transhumanism, the effect of the media and how humans can be manipulated...
Great stuff! This is why I enjoy INFJs' company in general. Nothing seems too deep into the rabbit Hole! There's just a limit in how much Ni I can take in one shot haha 
1h stuck with this, I'll go headache for the night! "
1255,estp,"As far as touch goes? I like to be touchy when it's appropriate. In bed? Sure. I'm not going anywhere, all I'm trying to do is lay there. 
Walking around? At best I'll loosely hold her hand or put my arm around her shoulder so I can still freely move or take it away.
Sports are violent and I can still smash people or get smashed and it's awesome and works Se and adrenaline in multiple ways, it's not really like ""ooh it was so nice to have contact with that person"""
1256,estp,"We are to be taken in doses ;)
My actual question though is: is your body part of the external world or internal word. Does your keen observation of the outer world include observations about your own body? It's not an Ne question, it's about Sensation. Do you sense your own body as you sense the outer world?"
1257,estp,"Oh ok, I did not get the question! You should have started with the last sentence :p 
No. Se is all about losing oneself to the environment. Si is the perfect opposite here, focusing on the self while being with the outer world. 
A good analogy for this is to see Si as water, adapting to the environment around itself. We'll aware of its own shape. Water can go anywhere,  it just adapts!  Any shape of container,  it will take it.
On the other hand, Se would be a rock. A rock is part of the world, is rarely shaped or moved by the world. It keeps its own form and abilities. Yes, with many storms or cataclysmic circumstances it can wither. But it will almost always be the same. 
That is pure Se, you are one with the world around you, without being self conscious at all. What you are and how you appear to the world does not matter, there's just this sense of ""oneness"" 
In a weird way, Ni can make one feel that way as well. But it's as if Ni is the spiritual side,and Se the bodily sensation side...
When I have a peaceful walk in a park or along the beach by myself, if I let go. I do feel this connection to the physical world. It's great! Hmmm I want to do it more now haha 
Welp,I'm going for a walk xD"
1258,estp,"Haha! I'm doing research on something new to me so my head's full of stuff that's waiting to be ordered..!
I'll hit you up tomorrow or the next day to let you study. Fe at work, trying to help you, hehe"
1259,estp,"To balance your Ni, you can have Se activities. Going out meeting people, dancing lessons (couple dances; argentine tango is my #1 for the Se connection you create).  Improv comedy is also really useful to learn to be connected to the moment and to your partners. I found that amazing at developing both your dominant and Inferior functions. 
Any activities related to the environment as well, like cooking,  focusing on the smell, the texture,  adapting as you go.( not following a recipe, hell no!!!) 
Fighting sports or even fencing could work.
If you want to get connected to your sensations though, (more an Si thing), I would recommend mindfulness meditation. 
Focus-type meditation might work better to learn to connect to the now.
Funny enough, I've always found that Ni is quite connected to the now, even if it has the ""dead eyes"" it just fills the now with more stuff.(purely based on observations...) 
If you ever focus on your senses, I think you lose the essence of Se and connect more to Si. 
Se will first melt with the environment, forgetting oneself,then try stuff out. There are a lot of what ifs with Se!  
I could rant more and more on Se, buy I think those paragraphs show what it is..."
1260,estp,"Thank you so much for this!
As for our ""now"", I'd say we view it more in a relational, almost spiritual sense, instead of a ""now"" of our senses (though that too, just not primarily).
I guess what I meant is not so much to focus on my senses, but focus what it is sensing; if that makes more sense.
Thank you so much again for taking the time!! (These comments are saved, hehe)"
1261,estp,"Yeah, Ni is super weird, I feel like the force is with me when it's here... It's the moment but being spectator of it, and having flashes of what could be... I love when I can channel my Ni, it's always a blast. I feel the ""oneness"" with the world xD 
Maybe it's just my primitive vision of it... I'd be curious to read how it manifests with you..."
1262,estp,"So Ive been a bit interested in MBTI for a while now, last time I took a test I got ESTP but I took one today and got ENTP. I’ve always thought ESTP May be wrong for me but ENTP dose t sound quite right neither. I’ll describe myself now to try to help. •I like to read books I’m reading lord of the Rings for the third time now • I really enjoy going to parties and may party a bit too much, I got caught for underage the other day • I’ve played sports my entire life, playing football in both high school and College •I’m extremely good at History having never gotten under a A in class • I want to explore the world • I’m getting into Philosophy and have been reading up on Nietsche • some people say I have a bit of a death wish I’ve gone Skydiving, bungee jumping, drink way too much, do too much drugs, drive too fast • I read comics sometimes, The Killing Joke is my favorite • I’m pretty good with the opposite sex, hooking up with someone every few weeks but avoid real relationships because I don’t want to be tied down • I can play Video Games for hours but often feel like I’m wasting time when I do it (assassin’s creed is my favorite) • I watch a lot of movies and am very interested in it (Jack Sparrow is my idol and I can name every Marvel movie in order) • I am terrible at debating and sometimes have trouble keeping a conversation going • In High School I could freely move among the clicks having friends with the jocks, band geeks and weirdos • if I’m by myself for too long I get kinda depressed but in College I’ve been having trouble making friends 
I think this is about everything, thanks for helping anyone that does"
1263,estp,"INtuiting types are maternal, and feminine, emotionally.  N's are nurturing, probably because of high estrogen in the limbic system.
Sensing types are the more masculine type, emotionally.  A little socially uncomfortable when it comes to taking care of other people.
Perceiving types are sort of similar, but in the philosophical arena, instead of the emotional (second person) one.  If your theories about the universe are ""woo woo"" and ""crazy"" when it comes to mainstream science, then you're a Perceiving type.  It's quite rare.  Much rarer than you'd think from the pop culture MBTI type tests.
Judging are the more normal types, who have more normal ideas about life, and who are more stressed out, and masculine when it comes to how to approach the universe, using logic and practical solutions that have evidence of working out well.
Thinking types are all about experimenting with possible solutions, innovating as a way to find new ones that work better.  While Feeling types are more about studying what other folks have to say about theories and are usually very capable in school.  (Thinking types often annoy teachers with too many challenges to their authority, and sometimes get bored with following some rigid instruction.)
Given your description up there, I'd say you're an ESFP maybe.  The skydiving thing is ES.  The hanging around with lots of diverse groups in school is more of an FP."
1264,estp,"Whelp I guess someone has to get it started. [This is the most recent picture I have] (http://i.imgur.com/hIXsD2o.jpg). It was from last weekend before I hit up a club.

This is what I've uploaded so far for the phenotypes, it's pretty interesting: http://imgur.com/a/zczNx/all"

Also this is a really small sub (sadly) so I'd be surprised if anyone else ended up posting. Sorry. 
Edit: Also if you'd like a different picture to help out with your project I'd be glad to help"

You guys are too busy running around outside lol. If you have pictures of other ESTPs that would help, because I don't need more than one picture per person. Thanks for your help though!
I'll post the completed album of all 16 types to the mbti sub tomorrow"
1269,estp,"depends on the girl. If she's shy, I'll slowly show interest in their life.
If she's normal or extroverted, I'll ask her out.
Remember, usually guys get stuck in the friendzone and girls get stuck in the fuck zone"
1270,estp,"Am I just really high?
I feel like when I am really relaxed like when I'm stoned, and I get to use those Ni introspective juices flowing through me and I combine that with a Se activity like sports or something I get this really satisfying almost euphoric ability where I can almost visualize my kinesthetic ability and perform really highly. Or am I just too high?"
1271,estp,"I've definitely had this. It even happens with conversations, it's almost like I'm watching myself from the outside while being perfectly aware of everything I'm doing, as if I were choreographing it the whole way through. And I don't use drugs, so I can safely say that's not it."
1272,estp,"Yes, I think so. I see it happen with an ESTP and they come off as a creative genius to me. That's interesting because when I have Se join in on my Ni, it feels like I'm in a dream, like I'm actualizing my dreams. I feel adrenaline pumping through me, my heart starts beating faster, and it's overwhelming-- like, I can do this. This is completely possible."
1273,estp,"I have noticed somthing about me that I am not sure why it is there. Here is an example of this that has happened many times. 
I'm playing basketball with a few friends. It's all well and good, but I accidentally run into somebody smaller than me when focused on the ball. Not purposefully or remotely aggressively, but it happens. Anyway, they fall down and are holding the part of their body that hurts. You feel bad about knocking them down and for some reason you act as though a part of your body hurts, too. If you both fall down, you might grip your knee and moan, but act as though you can tough it out and get up. I don't know if I do this to avoid people getting mad/putting blame on me. 
On the other end of the spectrum, if you fall down while walking or something stupid, you get up as soon as possible and try your best not to look hurt for fear of getting embarrassed. 
As long as I'm talking about these two traits of mine, I might as well mention that I get incredibly irritated by people who I can see through. When one puts on a facade or something that others fall for, I get really mad at them. It is so easy for me to see through people and see their motives for doing stuff. 
Possibly due to this general understanding of people on aomethinf deeper level, i can give really good relationship advice to my friend when he like a girl. I can tell him what to say, I can point out things that go way over his head, and I can make conclutions about the other party very easily. 
I find that I am very socially skilled and am able to make witty responses fairly quickly and am generally a funny guy. I think highly of myself, too. 
Anyways, sorry for the rant and stuff but what do you guys think? Can you guys relate?"
1274,estp,"So it's start of the fall semester, let's talk about the people we HATE to be with in school.
Me

Those kids who try soo hard on the first say to relate to the teacher and be friendly with them, like I get it, you want to be the teacher pet and/or get that letter of recommendation.
Those kids who ask the teacher before class ends if there is any homework today.
Kids who try to show off how much they ""know"" about the subject / correcting the teacher a lot.
Kids who ask a lot of dumb / basic questions ~~that are common knowledge esp. for the upper level courses. I mean, how did you even get into this class if you didn't know X.~~ (I mean the kid who asks a lot of questions but don't bother to work the problem themselves kind)

You can also talk about teachers!!11
I dislike teachers who

Are long winded in their speech and won't get to the point
Don't let us actually do something with what we learned, until probably the very end of class
Put a lot of excess/dumb rules and regulations to things that don't really matter (how the text on the paper should be formatted / what color ink we use / etc. ) with no good reason why
Keep talking but it's not related to the subject at hand (unless it's funny and/or interesting k)

Type stuff of your own
Type stuff if you relate"
1275,estp,"This is topical since I'm sitting in lecture right now and this dude hasn't stopped talking since we fuckin got here, but his rambling stretch of the word lecture has zero structure. It's literally impossible to type any sort of notes on this, thankfully attendance isn't mandatory "
1276,estp,"Fucking preps. Two-faced, passive-aggressive motherfuckers talking shit behind your back because they think you’re a dumbass for being too loose. I’m in the same classes as you, that’s probably a hint that I’m just as smart to the teachers"
1277,estp,"I'm out of school now (thank God), but hated strict discipline. Mainly because it destroyed my assertiveness for years after being bullied by a teacher.
I also hated people who were overly cliquey, whether in the ""I'm not talking to you because you're too popular"" sense or ""I'm not talking to you because you're not popular enough"". The other thing was people being silent in class, people don't realise that if you don't answer the teacher still makes you answer but gets grouchier."
1278,estp,"exactly the same...all these girls my best friend is friends with hate me cuz I’m “stupid” (not afraid to try a question and get it wrong/don’t spend my whole life dedicated to school) and every time I say something they try to challenge it while like angrily glaring at me, even when I’m right... "
1279,estp,"This perspective bother's me:
""Kids who ask a lot of dumb / basic questions that are common knowledge esp. for the upper level courses. I mean, how did you even get into this class if you didn't know X.""
I've been in courses where I started out weak and ask dumb questions, hell I'm a guy who engaged in the teacher's lecture and was wrong, but in a learning environment you can't be self conscious and think about what other people are thinking about you. You have to look out for yourself and speak up if you're lost, what's annoying is if someone is lost week after week and they're clearly not looking for help outside of class. At the end of the day we go to school to learn. One of the best way's to learn is to test yourself, to make mistakes and learn from them. I've come back from having weak foundations in a class and starting poorly to finishing with a great grade  because I wasn't afraid to ""ask dumb questions"" (compared to what?) and I have been wrong plenty of times. School isn't a popularity contest (can be if you let it be) it's about learning, engaging in the material. If you meet cool people along the way it's great, but getting caught up in drama, gossip or belittling people that put in the effort is weak.  "
1280,estp,"Estp here, 
(Btw how do you get that cool thing by your name that shows your personality? Thx)
Used to be an istj when I wrote these things and even then I still hated school (high school) when apparently your supposed to like schedules/reliability.
This was during junior/sophomore year and I remember this one gripe/complaint over anything else, I'll leave a little excerpt here from my notes (no way I'm posting the whole file lol)
""It's not that people back then knew more. In fact we have much more solid information then they ever did. It was more the rate that people were learning. ""
I always felt held back, was in honors classes, had good grades, never failed a class, great supportive parents and all that but could never learn anything interesting because somebody would hold back the class, sometimes it was me
It's just a flawed system. A whole class learning something instead of the individual 
""People back then"" what did I mean by that? What was I talking about?
People throughout history ""grew up"" at an EXTREMELY fast rate compared to today. It's why you become an adult at 18 in the U.S at least.
A lot of people would stay in school for 16 years learning essential life skills (reading writing) and work in the field all day then get their own. My great grandfather even had his own house/wife at 16 
It wasn't the content, it was the rate. And our system is majorly flawed in that way (although I would prefer different content as well lol)"
1281,estp,"I'm the student that could be a teachers pet but is a bit of a rebel and sometimes a disappointment, yet the teacher still roots for because I'm real and always do a great job (when I want to) because I tend to be a slacker, but not a trouble maker, but I do stir drama.
In fact, not having me in class can be a bit boring. Friends with everyone except the too goodie goodie ones, although they do like me too even though some would never admit. Hate the bullies but they do respect me. 
TLDR: Bart Simpson"
1282,estp,"Yeah I just had that teacher today. My brain cells were melting trying to figure out what was relevant to write down and what wasn't. Then after like an hour or so of nothing really important, I decided ""well screw this"" and left early so I could just read the chapter on my own about wtf he is talking about."
1283,estp,"Lmao same
IDK about the last one, I like to keep it silent and let the smart kid answer the question first, and then if he is wrong, I give my answer. Must be the ego boost I get when I destroy the smart kid after the teacher says ""yes that is the answer I'm looking for""."
1284,estp,"I'm talking about the kid who keeps asking questions, and not bothering to look at their own work to see where it's gone wrong. Lol yeah I do ask questions that might seem dumb, those are a different category. Might have to reword it."
1285,estp,"Or something else. I’m a mess of a person going through depression, anxiety, paranoia on top of thinking I might have autism or bipolar disorder and probably impossible to type but I think MBTI is fascinating so here we go regardless 
I’m gonna try and describe myself when I’m not experiencing these mental issues which is a challenge considering it’s been two years (and honestly that’s not even true, it’s been far more) since I have “officially” been going through this, but the person I am without these disorders obviously more indicative of how I really am
For the longest time I thought I was introvert because people and my interactions with them annoyed me, but turns out I actually think I’m an extrovert with social anxiety. But nothing is more intoxicating to me than someone completely understanding me and being around people who like me for who I am. Not to mention if I’m around people who don’t understand me I literally go insane/am without someone who understands me too long. However it’s incredibly hard to me to find those people without dedicating a lot of time and energy to finding these relationships, and I’m lazy and don’t have that energy (maybe I’m an introvert after all) and therefore don’t experience this feeling often, and feel hollow most of the time because of an absence of it, to the point where I go periods of forgetting I ever could feel that and need to it to feel like myself and a functional human being.
I personally think I’m good at keeping conversations going, starting them, ending them, etc, however when I begin to suspect the other person doesn’t like me/finds me weird/isn’t enthused with the conversation I shut down and become the most reserved and standoffish version of myself. 
For the longest time I thought I was the kind of person who found joy in planning for the future, thinking about the future, but I’ve begun to realize I only hype myself up to be completely dissapijnted because reality never lives up to my imagination. I find the healthiest version of myself has no expectations and finds much more joy living in the present and being fully grounded. I still have an active and overwhelmingly powerful imagination but I find it’s far more self satisfying to keep that side of me to myself, I.e. I truly don’t believe there’s any social benefit to being imaginative, yet I don’t think it’s a negative quality, just something reserved for you.
I’m overwhelmingly a thinker over a feeler. Even when happiest I have a hard time expressing emotion and find more solace in keeping what I’m exactly feeling within while expressing a more “easy to digest” feeling around others through words and actions. I strongly sympathize and slightly empathize with strong displays of emotion but don’t think words or actions can provide the necessary support, and therefore resent anyone who does try to comfort me with words or actions when I am feeling something overwhelming. The most rewarding and comforting thing is for someone to just be with you without needing to provide something or interfere with what you’re feeling. Unfortunately it’s near impossible to find these types of friendships/relationships in my experience.
My learning style is definitely individualistic. I hate teamwork and prefer to do everything myself. In a group project I either take over or do nothing, finding a middle ground by partly contributed always leaves me pissed off. It’s hard not to sound like a prick but I’ve always been good at school and getting good grades. I’m smart but not top of my class. I tend to need more time to get things done but I have always had a knack for knowing exactly what something wants out of me (even if I disagree with what they want) and providing that easily (I hate people yet I’m a people pleaser?) I don’t like being given free reign in a project because it means more work, but my output is always more rewarding than if I had guidelines, and I admire what I’ve created more. Specifically when it comes to school I’ve been above average to, sigh, pretty damn good at most subjects, I like learning about history most, “doing” English most, and don’t hate math but need more time than most at my skill level to complete it. 
I’m open minded because I’m almost annoyingly able to put myself in someone’s else’s shoes immediately. Arguments with me involve lots of interpretations of what the other person is saying, trying to nail exactly what they’re saying, acknowledging the counter argument, refuting it, and basically using every critical thinking skill I have to justify and hopefully persuade the other person. I can’t stand arguments based in emotion even thought I know there’s no ulterior motive to them, and that someone can’t help but base an argument in emotion when the subject is inherently emotional. I tend to find when I do the same my arguments aren’t taking seriously and I’m dismissed as being emotional ironically, so maybe my insecurity of not “delivering”an emotional argument correctly makes me resent those who can, do, and stick by these feelings instead of changing them every 0.2 seconds. The only people I truly hate are overly judgmental people, I feel so claustrophobic around them I can’t stand it. I’m obsessed with how people see me and if I feel someone sees my negatively everything in me wants to prove them wrong (if I see something in them that I admire) if I see nothing in them I admire all I want to do is tear into them viciously.
Speaking of change I tend to switch interests although i do have several permanent hyper focuses that I’ve always had since childhood, but other more surface level hobbies and fascinations change constantly. I love to interpret things that I’m learning in my own way, connect the dots in my own way, creates charts, diagrams illustrating my thought process, etc
This post is a mess because I had the worst fuckkng day of my life yesterday and I don’t say that lightly. I’m basically separate for someone to diagnose me, tell me who I am, tell me what I’m good at, what I need to change, etc. A therapist can only do so much. 
I could go and on cause my favorite pastime is analyzing myself (or at when I’m in the depressed mess of a state that I’m in) but I figure anyone with a normal attention span is over me at this point."
1286,estp,"First thing first, kiddo you are self diagonosing way to much. No one can suffer from every mental illness on the planet. if you ask me why I think yourself diagnosing it's because you put autism in the same category as mental illness which it isn't and you say that you can completely empathize with other people which you would be mostly unable to do if you were autistic. 
Ok. MBTI wise:
You sound like an INTP to me. Friendly but reserved and maybe not too eutusiastic. I am an ESTP and unlike you, like working in a team. I am autistic ( officialy diagnosed) which makes me a little awkward, but I manage. I not that good at sciences but very good at all areas involving humanities. You seem to describe yourself in many words, hinting to me that you are intuitive. Sensors, like me, do not analyse themselves very often."
1287,estp,"You think? The thing is I don’t feel like I get energy from being alone, I like to be alone, but I don’t feel energized from time. I get energy being around people and all engaging in something together 
I go back and forth on my dominant function, at my happiest I definitely use Se, but rn, and certainly the motivation for making this post, is Ti based"
1288,estp,"lol what the actual fuck
wait nvm you’re clearly a sociopath or a troll. I’ll give it to you you’ve got a fascinating personality, your comment history is one of the most entertaining reads I’ve had in a long time. "
1289,estp,"Hey, 100, just a quick heads-up:
curiousity is actually spelled curiosity. You can remember it by -os- in the middle.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1290,estp,"People really need to stop referring me to that “word”
I ain’t no troll either.
I’m just here to guide others and then push them down before they get to the end so I don’t have to do the heavy work myself!
Edit; most of my comments are referring to a meme I tried to create and stupid people."
1291,estp,"I get restless a lot. I can't sit still for very long at all and in high school i was the guy who would always bounce his leg under his desk. My restlessness/boredom has also somewhat shaped my lifestyle. My favorite days are busy days from sunrise to sunset. I find that filling my day with different activities makes me feel great whereas if i just watch TV or have ""down time"" i shortly begin to feel lethargic and even a little depressed. I completely don't understand the idea of ""down time"" So yes i do struggle with boredom at my 9-5 right now."
1292,estp,"Between poker, tetris and netflix - I can always find something to do. If those aren't cutting it, then the gym or a personal project fills my time.
In the wise words of Kendrick Lamar: ""Get some ambition while you're bored"""
1293,estp,"edit: 6/30 ESTPs have taken this survey. I need 24 more. Thanks!
Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
1294,estp,"Hi ; I recently learned I am an ESTP and it suits me well besides the emotion part I am pretty emotional when I want to be.
I'm like a mix personally. I can be emotional and laid back but I am full of energy around others.
I made my girlfriend take the ESTP test and she is an ESTP as well and we work well together? Is that right? Should this theoretically work? 
​
TL;DR - My gf is a ESTP and so am I? Is it suppose to work? I thought we where suppose to like Introverts. "
1295,estp,"Theory:
It is supposed to be J types with P types + objective types with objective types (and vice versa for the subjective types).
​
So, ESTP's best matches are:
ENTJ, ESFJ, ISTJ, INFJ.
​
That's the theory, and it happens to match all my observations. But then who knows, maybe types can be paired with themselves too.
​
In reality:
If you feel in love, and you feel loved, then it's a good match! Don't question the match. Maybe dig more into your type and hers, and let us curious individuals know what you find! Especially for ESTP, look for those four types I mentioned, it may help you find out.
​"
1296,estp,It's totally okay to be a more feeling ESTP. I relate to you as well. For the most part energetic and down to earth but I can be emotional and relate to feelings when I need to be. The 16 personalities tests (assuming that's the test you took) only focuses on your traits so it won't be 100 percent accurate (still very close!!!) but you also have your functions. And my functions as an ESTP might be different than another ESTP's function. Also its always a good thing to remember there are more than 16 different types of people on earth. We all have our different upbringings which may determine how we think. I wouldn't exclusively look for a certain personality type in a partner. As long as you feel loved and they feel loved then I think that's all that matters. At least that's my best advice. 
1297,estp,"We don't care what the test says :P
It's just rather interesting to me personally how personally types are sectored infact. Our sense of humor and ability to cheer each other up and see our body languages is phenomenal we get each other so well. Yet I am very good at persuading even her parents (especially her). I just found it interesting is all. "
1298,estp,Actually my numbers are pretty close. They shift a lot. At the current point in time if I were to retake the test I would get a 52 percent thinking and 48 percent feeling. Every once in a while though I do get ESFP as a result. But since I'm usually ESTP that's what I say I am. Although I wouldn't mind it if I was viewed as an ESFP.
1299,estp,"Recently found out that I get along famously with ESTPs.
I'd give you my info but...trust is something I don't believe in.
So, heres my PSN Username: Mortaldeadking < I'm 17 so after a certain age limit it'll be considered some Chris Hanson shit. So, if you've PSN and your between 15-24 we must play Red Dead 2 Online together. See you there bro!"
1300,estp,"Hey everyone, 
I'm planning on starting a Medium publication, around some custom content for various personality types. Content that might relate to just a specific personality type (e.g. INTPs, ESTPs) in a blog type format. 
I have ideas, if interested! :)"
1301,estp,"I speak to my people. The ESTP.
I found myself compelled to write this post, given that the /r/INTJ subreddit has dozens of posts, and our personality type has none.
Naturally, my conclusion on that is the following:
""Well obviously INTJ's are going to be better at realizing that there are others with their personality traits, because thinking about these concepts is one of their personality traits.""
Let's start getting to know each other with some personality traits that we supposedly share.
According to Wikipedia, we are often considered:

Outgoing
Charming
Witty
Fun
Generous
Observant
Socially sophisticated
Resourceful
Troubleshooter
Unpredictable
Action oriented
Clever

If I could emphasize one that I identify the most with, it would be the final one: ""Clever.""
Our Myers-Briggs description:
Our Keirsey description:
According to Keirsey, based on observations of behavior, notable Promoters might include John F. Kennedy, Teddy Roosevelt, Madonna, and Donald Trump.
Even more notable and something that I identified with as soon as I read it, was on the Artisan temperament page:
And finally from the same page:

I am naturally disappointed to see that none of my fellow ESTP's have come across the thought, ""Hey, other people could think like me."" I would tend to sadly say (with some experience don't forget), that we are particularly self-centred people, who don't even begin to consider that we are not unique. We are better my friends, just not than each other.
With that being said, I think we are extremely valuable as partners, socially or romantically. If I ally myself with somebody I trust; I will go to the bitter end on it unless I perceive that trust to be lost. To other personality types who may be reading this and want to get onto an ESTP's good side, I would suggest the following (since I am speaking for myself, I will use ""I"" as a pronoun):


Let me speak as much I want to. Sure I'm good at explaining things, but let me explain a couple times if I have to, just to feel good about getting the message across in the most comprehensible way.


Speak to me verbally with with a little bit of warning. If you have an argument to pick with me and want me to be comfortable, do it in person or over voice-communication. I am better at explaining myself immediately with my voice, but then much more comprehensively with text (if I can get into the right head-space). I honestly think I'm just cocky with words; I perceive myself to be much more articulate than most other personality types, and this brings me confidence when dealing with conflict.


I'm sure there are many more things I could say... but first you have to all find me. If you have a friend who you think could be an ESTP, please send them here!"
1302,estp,"Oooh! Oh! Oh! Hey! Hai!!
So I'm not an ESTP, but my husband is.  And I know him very well. First of all, your communication style makes me think he might've written this except I know for a fact he does not go on reddit (there's too much and he's too add). Second, I am completely unsurprised that you would suddenly have the desire to post something about ESTP's to foster communication on a whim. Third, the fact that you were so incredibly thorough in the completion of your whim just furthers your ESTPness.  And lastly, I don't think many ESTPs care about this stuff because there isn't a direct use for the theories... Right now.  But if you would like to develop your third and fourth functions to become a more complete and wholly awesome ESTP, feel free to ask me any questions or whatnot because our functions are the same but in opposite order!  Your last is my first and vice versa."
1303,estp,"Lmao well Im an ESTP as well,  although I have more faith in Myers-Briggs typings. The problem with trying to communicate with ESTPs is you guys are looking in the wrong places. ESTPs dont want to discuss being ESTPs because that would be counter-intuitive. There are many many other places on reddit where you can find them though. Theres a million on /r/spacedicks which is in the end a dead end although still fun to visit, but I have found quite a bit in creative areas. There are a decent amount on /r/cypher which is primarily a writing place for rap writtens. Also you can find huge groups of them in any /r/circlejerk on reddit. But yeah thought the author of this deserved some credit although his efforts are futile. "
1304,estp,"I'm an ENTP also but I'm married to an ESTP so I'll give this a shot.  I recommend physical activity like working out. My ESTP seems to get anxious when he's not confident or sure of himself... Martial arts, working out, and playing sports all seem to help him with those things. "
1305,estp,"I am estp with a fair amount of social anxiety. I always tried to mask the anxiety with alcohol which lead to embarassing drunk person behavior which lead to MORE anxiety at the next event.  I recently came to the realization that I don't have to be the center of attention and I have fewer social regrets when I stay sober (or near sober).
I can relate to what fuzzylettuce said too. I tend to feel like my flaws are amplified so working out and taking care of my appearance has helped as well."
1306,estp,"I've never been there so I wouldn't know but I think letting him build confidence for himself is good. A way to achieve that would probably be to give him something to succeed at. Whether it be sports, music, etc. as long as he gets good enough at it to gain self-confidence.. His situation should improve imo"
1307,estp,"^(Which makes this the 4th lowest MBTI sub... uhh.... Good job accomplishing stuff in real life everyone! Keep up the good work.)  
Here, have some detailed stats. (UTC, not including mobile traffic)  
Flairs:  

ESTP: 11  
INTP: 4  
ENTP/INFJ: 3  
INTJ/INFP: 2  
ENFP/ENTJ/ISTP/ISFP: 1
"
1308,estp,Wow I never read that personality type description before. I actually can relate to that just as much if not more than ESTP. Now I don't know what I am lol. I think you are definitely right about Pratt.
1309,estp,"I used to be really uncertain in distinguishing te/fi from fe/ti. Some things I can always pick out in Ti is that when they appear extremely self confident/justified, it is from a purely rational standpoint. Same goes for Fi users when they justify something based on their values system- they appear extremely confident. 
Ti/Fe users can seem a bit dissociated when having debates. Imo Fi/Te users are careful to consider all the values of themselves and those close to them  (i.e. Friends, family and people who experience emotions that the Fi user can empathize with). 
Chris Pratt is adorable. He's witty, charismatic and tears at your heartstrings sometimes. Total ESFP"
1310,estp,"Hey guys I'm sort of confused whether I'm ESTP or ENTP. Apparently socionics is ""more accurate"" but I end up relating to the ILE/ENTp description more.
Anyways what do you ESTPs find different with ENTPs?
I am close with an ENTP friend of mines, let me try and list stuff.

ENTPs care about KNAWLEDGE that doesn't really have much use IRL
ENTPs get butthurt about incorrect facts about their particular interests and make a big fuss about correcting person/it.
ENTPs tend to be more lazy and don't want to go out much (vidya gaems amirite)
ENTPs are a master at making lots of excuses about not doing things 
ENTPs when sad, blame themselves, give up, and go negative spiral to find roasts of themselves to vent about
ENTPs tend to make less drastic decisions (pussies) despite it being a solution
ENTPs secretly worry about everyone judging them bad meanwhile IDGAF unless they are close to me

Tell me if you guys relate ENTP or ESTP and list some more things you find relevant. Thanks guys."
1311,estp,"I say the lazier, the more likely an easier solution will be developed. Smart work
Well ESTPs are a bit sportsy, bulldog like by nature, rough, want to be tough, inclined to follow the Hulk mentality, and quite conventional. Se vs Ne will tell you guys apart quite well. I will note as an INFJ who's witnessed other INFJs getting it on with ESTPs tend to have this connection, whereas the ESTP is like a vulnerable child at his or her deepest core or center. They have this exterior persona to be the top dog per se, but on the inside it's like a puppy. They try to be intimidating. I'm not really impressed by their nature one bit. Would I fear them? Nope, not at all. They do have intelligence, but I don't consider it on par or a challenge worth the time investing in. With good reason for that as their dominant function is Se. I'm okay with that! :)
ENTPs on the other hand, they're actually quite the kind demon in my eyes! I admire their bluntness, calculations, fun, spontaneous yet efficient at flowing through reason, and still at their laziness, they still achieve some great stuff! Ah, I do get entertained by their devilish nature, how they dismantle the reality of one's perception, how they can be the Joker and turn into a really good friend the next second to make revelations. Their random videos of sexual stuff, memes, jokes, on a random whim... A bit too different from me, but... To tell you quite frankly they're the second type I fear most next to INTP who have Ti dominant feature. They have this knack of curiosity of analyzing the coolest intuitive concepts, divulge in ways ideas could be implemented, and have an understating of humanity to the point they may influence ideology if they pull through in great effort. 
To add ESTPs are pretty sportys, ENTPs tend to be in places like debate clubs in conclusion! :)"
1312,estp,"Ok, first thing, fuck you, you oblivious cunt.
Cough Cough
Anyway! 
I’m ENTP and I NEVER blame myself and put myself down for anything! 
People are like bread and the blame is like the butter.
I also make drastic decisions quite frequently.
Also, I don’t give a shit what other people think of me.
Why should I care about what someone else thinks about me when in reality they’re in the same position in life as myself and have no authority over me (even if they technically do)
You aren’t the brightest light on the Christmas tree are you?
I bet you’re that one bulb that is so dim it might as well be considered dead.
Edit; I’m gonna type you as “ENTP” so everything you said will automatically reflect on you..."
1313,estp,"Ah, yes, what a fool proof way of distinguishing Ne-Si from Se-Ni. 
Sounds like you're projecting subjective experiences with your ENTP friend onto the cognitive functions.
Come back when your knowledge of MBTI surpasses the 16personalities test."
1314,estp,"I am an ISFJ.
The ESTP I know is basically my aunt (complicated). She had a rough life growing up poor for a long time (to the point she had to learn to climb trees to steal food from other people's trees) but eventually my parents took her in when I was year old in exchange for having a permanent baby sitter and house cleaner (she gets paid!).  She's the same age as my mom, and has 3 kids of her own that live in another country that she has to keep track and occasionally help them financially.
One of the things I've always admired was how relaxed and easygoing and how easy it is for her to go with the flow (unlike me, my brother and parents we can be kinda closeminded/judgmental at times). She has an amazing sense of humor, it's really easy to get her to laugh. She can take jokes really well but she's capable of dishing some blunt/savage jokes herself. 
I've moved out from my parents house recently but she still lives with my parents. Just recently for almost half a year my (xSFJ?) grandmother from my moms side visited. She means well but can be pretty demanding of what she wants and also is in pretty bad physical condition. The ESTP kinda ended up being her caretaker since my mom and dad have full time jobs. However, ESTP never complained to our mom and dad and always did everything in her power to take care of her well despite the grandma's overbearing attitude at times. When I had lunch with the ESTP after my grandma left the worst ESTP complained was ""Yeah, it sucked."" and that was it.
I don't know how it is for other ESTPs but I just admire the amount of patience and diligence she had when she wants/needs to do something. When my brother and I were kids, she would sometimes walk to Burger King get food for us WITH HER OWN MONEY and bring it to us at school which I was very grateful for.
She doesn't have a driver's license so generally she has to really on family or friends to drive her around places or she has to walk. However she geniunely enjoys walking, (window) shopping and hanging out with friends out of town so I'm glad my parents sometimes let her loose often without scolding since she naturally loves going out.
I know a bunch of ESTPs get stereotyped as those liars, cheaters, obnoxious, athletes, impulsive, stupid, etc.. However, after being half-raised by her my whole life I know how ESTPs really are. I'm grateful for the main ESTP in my life and respect  that you guys are down to earth, honest and willing to do what you can to get things done for people you care about. I feel like you guys' tertiary Fe is really underrated. I guess it may not show in undeveloped/immature ESTPs but I really like the mix of External Feeings / Values  mixed with Se-Ti easygoing honesty. It makes for someone who's really easy to get along and lovable.
Thank you ESTPs."
1315,estp,"Well, thx! It's rare to get praised like this...
I would argue that this loyalty and commitment comes from our Fi and not Fe. Fe is more how we come out to people, with a smile on our face and try to accommodate them.
Once we truly care, you get one of our drivers with Ni, our buried Fi which represents our ""code of honor"". This is what gives this ""knightly devotion"" to the people we love. If you are this close to an Estp,  good for you! 
He/she will never let you down."
1316,estp,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
1317,estp,"Wow. This seems really insulting.
(I'm an INFP)
S's aren't heartless sex fiends. If they aren't into you, they aren't into you. If they're up for a good time, and you are too, why not? But ""I do"" means ""I do""
We all want the same thing. A deep meaningful connection intellectually, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. And compatible  life goals and morals, I'm sure. If you don't have those things, what's the point? I would imagine that if there is a ""type"" that would be cool with an open relationship, S's might MIGHT fall into that. But they value loyalty. 
Period.
I can't imagine ever cheating. I'd rather just be alone. I imagine that S's would too. You can do whatever you want when you're alone. If other people are up for it. Makes sense to me. And I'd never be into that, personally. But I can see it.
You might as well be asking if there are any existing S virgins. IMO.
That moment of undress... that's too personal.
This coming from a chick that has interesting conversations about her boyfriends testicles. Hahahaha!!!
I love that moment of undress with him.
I'm positive it would hurt for him to go there with someone else. There's no way. "
1318,estp,"I know this is old but whatever
I've come close, definitely walked the line. I slept with another girl like three days before entering a serious relationship. I've done that several times actually
If it wasn't for my undying loyalty and love for my current significant other, there's been some times where I'd say no but definitely have to remind myself it's not worth throwing away what I have. 
Really, if I were to cheat, I'd break up with whoever I was with that day or the following. I'd be honest about it though and own it"
1319,estp,"But you can't really answer an ESTP question as an INFP. NF values are too strong and an S especially an ESTP would not act as we do. They function differently and are a lot more impulsive. I'm not saying this means they are going to cheat, what I'm saying is that it is possible if wrongly acted upon their functions. It would feel different and probably go about it in a different way than if it were us, but you can't just say thats its insulting. Its a general question towards an S type (and the user already stated that it was asked on an N dominated forum) so its not like the user was biased. "
1320,estp,"Thank you so much for your response, as well as your honesty.
While I personally don't believe cheating is ever okay (super idealist over here) I can fully understand feeling like you're in a loveless relationship, and how it wouldn't feel the same as if you were cheating on someone you were completely and utterly in love with.
I posted this question to all the S pages, and have gotten a slew of answers back, including honest, short, long, insulted (see above response.) I appreciate your viewpoint on me asking what I did. It was very encouraging."
1321,estp,"I didn't say that they were stronger than S values, I'm saying that for many NFs they're too strong to ignore which would cause Farfulpippik to think its unfathomable and offensive to cheat. I'm stating that her NF compass and brain isn't looking through the S lens its looking through Fi values, which in this case deems cheating as horrid. "
1322,estp,"Define NF values. Are you talking about the cognitive functions or values relating to morals? Or something else? 
You say that ""NF values are too strong"" for NFs to ignore. Do you think that S types find it easier to ignore their values (you also said they are more ""impulsive"")?"
1323,estp,"So I used to test ISTP
A little about myself:
24 years old, grew up in a strict Asian household with an unhealthy ESFJ mother and IxTJ father. Emphasis on unhealthy ESFJ
As a child, I was told I was too hyperactive and confrontational. My mother convinced me that something was wrong with me because I lived in the moment and was not careful with my words. I offended her and my IxFP brothers like they were made of eggshells. I grew up with severe self esteem issues and social anxiety. I jumped between different career plans because my mother told me to study something I didn't want to, and I actually listened to her. I lived at home and commuted to college. The plus side is I was able to focus on school and get As.
Fast forward to today. I'm in a second degree accelerated bachelor's program in a prestigious school in the greatest city in the world, surrounded by intelligent and open minded individuals, with NYC as my backyard.
Being away from my family for the most part, I've started noticing that I am more social than ever. I have a natural ability to make people laugh. I can use a multitude of curse words and not offend people. I've always been good at sports, but I've also started noticing that I now enjoy them more, along with dancing. I have more friends than ever and barhopping without feeling socially drained feels great. I'm starting to realize the awesomeness of being an Se dom
So now here I am, in my bachelor's program. I am supposed to get my degree in 12 months. My grades are decent, but no where near as good as they used to be. 
My question is how do ESTPs do well in higher education? 
The temptation of living out the ESTP stereotype is strong, especially since I've been suppressed by my mother for most of my life, and staying in and studying gets monotonous."
1324,estp,"Your question is dumb. 
People who do well, regardless of their type, do so by studying and doing homework. Simple as that.
Use this time to form a circle of friends with whom you'd make business in the future. 
Go out and have fun but don't do cocaine or other hard drugs before finishing your degree. Focus on finishing your degree with decent grades and enough fun to keep stress down"
1325,estp,"Not an ESTP but am dating one. Also Asian :)
My ESTP did well in higher education by viewing it as a challenge, a competition of sorts. Who can get the better grades? Who can secure the better internships? Who can land jobs considered more prestigious / lead to higher salaries? And best of all, who can drink the most but can still get the best grades?"
1326,estp,"hey to all you lovely estps. before i ask my qustion would like to give a preview of my life
im a 20 years old i work in my father's dress shop who's managed by my brother. i was never good at school so i didn't continue after i graduate. i don't have any useful skill other than i know how to speak english in a third world country ( i suck in english grammar and i don't understand most words )
the reason that i post here is because i dont feel im a estp. but i done so many test and the result was the same so i thought i ask here.
the first thing that bothers me is that im not that active or full of energy i spend most of the day sleeping in my work place.
the second thing is that i'm not social in fact i never was. i don't have the talent to talk to people in a way that they like to listen. the best example i can give is after 20 years of my life i never had a girlfriend ( there was only 1 time i got a girl number but she stop answering my messages after 3 days i really don't know why :D )
i never risk. im too scared of taking a risk so im not that kind guy that do crazy things
i dont think fast in critical situation and i don't like challenges. if someone challenge me to something i try my best to avoid it.
i don't like sports because i was never good at it
is there something wrong with me or the MTI tests?"
1327,estp,"I was kinda thinking you maybe sounded a bit like me growing up until you said 
estps live for these kind of situations. "
1328,estp,"I'm an F parent with a preteen girl who fits the description of an ESTP child. (IDK if she is, but she's definitely an E - TP. ) Any advice on effective parenting ? Looking back..what discipline worked for you and what didn't ? "
1329,estp,"Honesty. My dad is ESFP and my mom is INTJ. Both of them puts honesty above all.
Example: I borrow my dads new bike when they are on holiday. I do not have the license to drive it. When I park it I call my dad and tells him the bike runs smoothly We talk about it for a bit before he goes ""OK, thanks for telling me, I would like you not to drive it again illegaly!"" And I go ""OK, have fun on the holiday"" and I do not touch it.
So open dialog, if a rule is broken it is broken, no point nagging about it. But talk about how the experience was and ask to not do it again/think about safety. 
In Regards to school work I was always told to not close doors. Say I know I need a D to get into whatever. No point working harder! I was told that ""it is OK to get a D, but maybe later I would like to do something different. And maybe I needed a C or a B to get in. It would suck to look back and know that I actually fucked it up for my self?!""
Stupid rules with no point does not work. If you explain the rule and maybe make a compromisse. But never go ""you can't do this"" end. 
My mom told me that the toilet cant flush deodorant when I was 5. So I tested. Had she Said something like ""maybe it works, maybe it wont work. But the deodorant cost money, and if it doesent work We do not have a toilet, so I would prefere to not test it"" I might not have done it. Because I remember doing it to prove it could be done (×2)."
1330,estp,"There needs to be a logical sanction when she makes a mistake. Moral argument will have little effect on her. Emotional punishment will only confuse her.
For example,
If she steals a friend's toy, you can't scold her saying ""You did wrong. That is bad. You are a bad girl. You disappoint me."" or something like that. She'll just think you are bullying her.
You should say, ""You did wrong. It is bad because when your friend finds out, she will not trust you. She may even stop being your friend. She may tell on you to other people. Then other people will not trust you. It is bad because it will be a habit if you don't stop it now, and there will be severe punishment when you grow up. It is a bad behavior because it will harm your life. You need to stop doing this.""
You should talk to her logic. That's the key to her heart."
1331,estp,"My parents had to use a lot of corporal punishment on me, the beatings helped in hindsight and I didn't respond to anything else. Afterwards they pushed me to live and die by my strengths, so push your daughter to do the same. There are some things you won't be able to control. I always understood that my parents loved me and supported me so I was gonna do what I wanted to do as far as school and careers and whatever else that fit my interests and goals, and whether or not I took their advice was up to me and they'd follow me through it regardless "
1332,estp,"Help her see consequences in advance. 
Nothing worse than doing something I didn't know was against the rules (because we didn't have a rule) and then get in trouble. 
Honestly ""punishments"" never worked. I was easily entertained even in my room without my phone. 
Taking away privileges like ""no you can't go on that trip because you didn't clean your room"" would just make me resentful. 
Be willing to debate the reasons why rules are in place. I HATED ""because I'm your dad and I said so""
Be ready to let some control go, we're capable and like to show it. We forge our own way and honestly just like to know there's a safety net if we fail. 
The good things my mom said to me growing up;
-you can be anything you want just be ready to work for it 
-idc if you're forty if you need a bed and a meal I will help you
-if you're ever in trouble with the law please don't be afraid to call me. I won't be mad, your safety is just the most important thing "
1333,estp,"Sounds like my kid lol! If I tell her she can't do something without an explanation (which I learned the hard way not to do) .. it's like she says ""CHALLENGE ACCEPTED"" in her head lol. Thanks for the advice. I'll try this . "
1334,estp,"Good luck, and it is not taming. Just dont be an ass :p 
Try adult to adult communication (I feel / what do you mean / when you say that I hear... can you elaborate / question words). If she goes kid communication (I need / not fair / why do I have to), ask what she means, pull her back to adult. Try to avoid parent talk (you never / I always have to / etc).
I notised someone else Said they got a more physical reminder of the rules. Think: what do you want your girl to do when she is piss drunk at a party? Camp outside out of fear or call you to get a ride. Her ""challenge accepted"" attitude can make her sett internal goals and kick ass. But shit can get borring fast. Make small games in mundane tasks, and join the competition. I did that shit for work and now uni. 
From a 31 year old Norwegian with problems writing, that T can help controll the P. 
Read this: http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ESTP.html the weeknes part helped me a lot. And also if you take the test it is a big chanse she will take it. It is good To talk about this with an adult and get help to understand that Even if it is 99% correct you can change and evolve what you want to evolve"
1335,estp,"Star Wars
​
LOTR movies are very lengthy, and not much action happens besides maybe a couple of scenes within that 3-4 hour time stretch. Star Wars has great music, great sound effects, action scenes, good story, and shifts between different characters' plots here and there to keep it interesting. Also, Han Solo shoots first."
1336,estp,"Hello, /r/ESTP.
I live in an HOA community.  We have neighborhood agreements in place about parking: each person is allowed one spot in front of their unit.  In addition, each person has a remote garage for their personal use.  There is also a guest-parking area that is remote from the living units. 
Not everyone keeps their personal car by their units at all times.  Some do.  Some park their personal car in their remote garage, leaving the space in front of their unit open for visitors or as a less-encumbered view of a nearby lake.  
One of our neighbors is an ESTP.  They recognize that it's a community rule to only use one parking place in front of their unit.  
But.  
Since the space in front of the next door unit is seldom used, it is logical to have visiting friends and family park there (not as far to walk as the guest parking area). 
The person whose space they are using has serious boundary issues.  She believes it is wrong for the ESTP to park in the space due to community ""rules.""  She prefers to keep it open for the view or for visitors.  The ESTP using her space is a constant aggravation to her.  She has asked the ESTP to cease and desist, and cannot understand why they continue to park there. 
The ESTP  doesn't care about the neighborhood rule: it's convenient for their guests to park there, and it's logical that the space should be used rather than empty.  They don't care about the rule, but about the convenience of themselves and their guests. 
I am on the HOA board, and am tired of receiving complaints about the parking.  I understand the ESTP's logic, but it does go against the community rule.
I'm hoping you can give me some ideas on how to persuade the ESTP to follow the community rule.   I can't think of any benefit to them of following it.   
Thank you for your time and your suggestions.  
tl;dr:  the title says it."
1337,estp,"One of the reasons I've always hated the idea of an HOA; the only stories I've ever heard have been negative regarding the organization as a whole.
Cool, so you have an unwritten 'agreement' about how you all think parking should work. Neato. But whoops! We let someone in who doesn't like a policy set by a homeowners association; oh no, that never happens!
Yep, it does. Especially if the rule is very vague, and doesn't actually enforce your preferences. So good for him, he found a loophole that benefits him and doesn't actually go against any policies he signed on or agreed to.
So either approach him directly telling him your thoughts and those of the community without being passive/flighty, or change the rules so he isn't allowed to do that."
1338,estp,"If it's not an explicitly written rule, then it's not an enforceable rule. It's like how an agreement is not the same as a legally binding contract. 
So the simple thing is to either say there is indeed no rule for it or make it an explicit rule."
1339,estp,"[ENTJ] I don't really see the purpose of the rule for one... and like others have said: if it's not explicitly a rule, then you can't really do much about it.  
And personally speaking, I think it's a rather petty rule..."
1340,estp,"I can't imagine living in an HOA...& I imagine that your ESTP HATES IT!
What would work for me is to know how much of a pain in the ass it is for you to deal with this BS...unless he dislikes you & your board. I hate making people I like do more work than necessary, but on the contrary: if I dislike you then I'd revel in it. "
1341,estp,"yeah, we've been upgrading our covenants and rules and regulations.  But even once the upgrade takes effect, we're a small HOA in an old-fashioned community: the idea of taking anyone to court or fining anyone for not complying would be  VERY foreign to us.  So I'm just trying to figure out how to get everyone to want to get along.  (We'd rather resolve the issue by talking and working together rather than escalating into a penalty phase.)
My personal problem is that I grew up in a household that was way into gas lighting and passive-agressive manipulation.  I definitely don't want to play those manipulation games with anyone, yet it's the way I grew up and how I understand how to influence people... it's like a default setting.  I know that's a big problem, and I'm trying to figure out ways to correctly interact with people.  But if I can't get someone to see my point of view, the manipulation is a default setting that pops out.  You and I both know that Does Not Work (is the opposite of effective) with ESTP.  
So I belive the correct course of action is logical reasoning.  But I can't think of any logical arguments why they shouldn't park there.  
To me, ""It upsets your neighbors"" is a logical argument.  But it's not sufficient for my ESTP neighbor. 
Any other advice, or do you see any other benefits to him of parking like his neighbors do?"
1342,estp,"thanks for your reply.  I agree on the petty.  
I feel like I've chosen a cage to live in, sometimes, living in an HOA.  HOA = letting your neighbors (by popular vote) choose whether you can hang laundry outside or not, or whether you can park your bike on your porch, etc.   If I want to paint my house, it has to match everyone else's.  Too many rules."
1343,estp,"I think that HOAs just consist of a bunch of arbitrary rules that aren't based on solid reasoning... I mean, how does having matching colors on houses make the neighborhood better?  It doesn't... it's restricting, and I find them meddlesome.  If the yard is clean and tasteful, then why is it a problem when the houses look different? Fuck HOAs... ugh.  
This example is honestly part of the reason why I'm not really all for ""democracy"" or popular vote systems; it doesn't necessarily represent what's in the best interests for everyone involved. "
1344,estp,"actually I just gotta give you a heads up before karate kick yourself, entps are part of the rational group for a reason. They are great at making BS and don't take any of it. TBH I think an entp would side with the estp, now THAT would be a real headache. "
1345,estp,"I have this theory that MBTI types can be traced geographically. Seeing as certain types match well with other types. 
Obviously I can't prove this.
But, I've met a lot of Irish ESTP's- just go to Boston sometime. It could be a thing"
1346,estp,"ESTPs are known for enjoying the chase,but do you enjoy it when you're the one being chased? What is your reaction when someone is openly trying to pursue you romantically? Does it flatter you or does it turn you off? How do you behave then?"
1347,estp,"... i am the hunter... you wanna hunt me i will fight you...test you... Maybe be kind of mean... or maybe be kind of annoyed. Impress me and you might have an in. Otherwise get out of my way.
Best chance is to just be my friend and have adventures with me... be a bit flirty but JUST out of my grasp... i will chase. I will impress... i will catch. Or move on. "
1348,estp,"I'm usually oblivious to it, except if there is excess physical contact . Usually I can't tell if a women is chasing me, but recently one of my female friends was walking next to me and basically rubbing up against me. I may be oblivious, but I'm not stupid. Once I figure out someone is chasing me, I usually enjoy it."
1349,estp,"Hahaha. The thing you gotta know about ESTPs is we will come onto the online forms every now in a blue moon. We are the adventurers, thrills seekers and do-ers. So our online presence would be the weakest IMO out of all the types. 
 
Granted when we're bored and out of things to conquer we'll mossy on over here haha 
 
 
As you can tell from seeing my comment from 2 months ago like 7-8 threads down in the infj one haha."
1350,estp,"Whether you've been following us or have no idea who we are, hi! We're two opinionated best friends using personality typing to understand themselves and the world. I'm an ENTP and Meredith's an ESFP. We're learners and hobbyists, not experts.

In our fourth episode we discuss the first of the four type families: Those that share SP, also known as Explorers or Artisans. We note themes across all SP types and then dive into ESFP, ESTP, ISTP and ISFP. Mad shoutouts to ESTPs in there ;)
Please let me know what you think, either here or review us on iTunes!"
1351,estp,"My experience as an ESTP seems to differ from most I've seen on internet posts. My understanding is we're incredibly virtuous, and nice at heart, we don't turn rage outwards. We have two extremes when stress gets to us- letting our extrovert side take over, resulting in us being arrogant and overwhelmingly friendly; and, when our introvert side takes over, and results in us closing up, no eye contact, and loss of motivation. Does this sound like other people? I know extraversion/introversion can differ among those- but I think I'm split down the middle-leaning more towards extroversion. And, I think having those swings, and both makes me incredibly hard to read. But, overall I think we're some of the nicest people out there, just really misunderstood."
1352,estp,"I think I am a very good willed person, I probably wouldn't ever be considered overly nice but I definitely don't intentionally hurt people. 
I don't really understand the hate we get from the MBTI community. I feel as though they think we're all Derrick Zoolander or something but in reality every ESTP I've ever met has been fairly intelligent. I feel as though I kind of have to be because I want to have a base knowledge about every topic so that I can create conversation with as many people as possible. And that's my particular ice breaker, I find something they enjoy and then I speak about it just enough to peak their interest.
It has resulted in me knowing a bit about almost everything.  "
1353,estp,"I feel the exact way. I'm a nice person dammit! Haha.. but those drastic swings really are brutal. 
People remember how others make them feel, and the tertiary Fe is often seen through uncontrolled anger rather than our attempts to be compassionate. It is hard to maintain a consistent Fe when Se is bouncing around everywhere."
1354,estp,"I think ESTPs definitely get a bad rep. Their humor is so blunt and dumb that people underestimate their intellectual ability. But whenever I've gotten close to an ESTP, I'm always amazed by his Ti. It's like ""woah, where'd that analyzation come from?"" 
I don't know if I'd call ESTPs especially nice though. I think y'all can be just as ASPD as us ENTPs."
1355,estp,INTP's perspective: I had an ESTP friend who had endless hilarious jokes and vivacious energy. I basically just sat there and let her and my other friend chat. I liked to observe their reactions. It was much more entertaining than listening to the teacher go over poetry meter rules YET AGAIN in English. I liked having the privilege of laughing along with them without having to contribute many words to the conversation. That was a pretty ideal social interaction. 
1356,estp,"I completely agree. I feel that sooooo many 'NT' types look down on us for not being smart... I read this little saying that said, "" 'NT's' I see you smirking at me like you think I don't know anything""... I feel like most don't get us and try to write us off as the wild animals who have no control whatsoever. However, ESTP's are quite smart and can be very manipulative... alot of my friends underestimate me and are surprised when I come out on top (though I kind of love the challenge of those underestimating me). However, I think what also contributes to the bad rep is we can be a bit hard to understand and know. I love when I find other ESTP's, especially with developed Ti... I feel, safe (if that's the right word) to share my thoughts; cause they, for the most part, understand to a good degree."
1357,estp,"[I should preface this by disclosing my ENTP-ness] 
ESTPs get a bad rep in life as well. You stupid fucks are polarizing people (but very charismatic). 
I've had great (and highly illegal) times w/ ESTPs, but I'll be damned if you guys don't project cheesy amounts of bravado/ego.  
Less patient personality types write you off almost immediately, because you don't come off as genuine. 
Personally, I usually vibe with ESTPs. I just find it hard to keep your attention long enough to have a really enjoyable, sustained conversation."
1358,estp,Yes to this! My interests are all pretty mainstream I realize but I always have something to talk about.
1359,estp,"I guess nice isn't the word I was thinking about, it's more just a general optimism and genuine care for people. People always say I have the biggest smile and the most infectious laugh. I don't think that part of us is reflected in conversation because we're talking so fast; we're filled with charm and have strong personalities so people assume we're manipulative; but I think that's far from the truth. I don't know so much about the ASPD part, I can't think of a time where I've ever wanted to intentionally hurt something. But then again, maybe this is just me and not all ESTP's"
1360,estp,"I'm going to have to side with your fiance on this one, but there needs to be some limits. Obviously, having no life preserver, especially on a four year old is a bad idea. I say use the helicoptering to your advantage by coming along. Ideally, you being around should help balance out these scenarios."
1361,estp,Awe thats kind of cute that he wants to be a part of the little guys life.  Try not to worry too much 😂 I know you mean well because you love him but just trust that God will take care of him ans try not to be too frustrated avout the situation.
1362,estp,"Congratulations on your ESTP boy ! haha I'm sorry to say that you will worry for the rest of your life. I mean as a mom you will already worry naturally but having a ESTP as a child is a source of worry because of they constant quest for thrill and adventures. 
The thing is, your son must have a great relationship with your ISTP fiancé, they both are hands on, adventures, sensing people. In a way it's great that you ISTP fiancé is showing and teaching your son how to channel his ESTP needs for constant activities and stimulation. It's better that your son is informed and taught how to properly use the correct tools and indeed recognize the danger at a young age. Because not matter what you do or say, he will eventually just go for it. So better be prepared now. 
What you CAN do nevertheless is setting the limits with your ISTP partners. For example, yes you can teach our kids how to built a tree house, but you have to make sure they are wearing helmets on when doing so. 
Wish you all the best :)"
1363,estp,"Did anyone else have a tough time writing papers in highschool? I can articulate myself perfectly when just talking, but as soon as it comes to writing a structured paper I get insane writer's block. "
1364,estp,"Same problem here, the Teachers comment is always like “great points but too anecdotal. Tone is way too informal” well my essay score still turns out better than half the class. I think maybe the teacher was bored of reading normal essays anyways "
1365,estp,"Write in your speaking voice then leave the (heavy) editing for later.
I could never plan out that I wanted to write in outlines, so I just free-thought it, jotting down ideas of what I wanted to write during the writing process. I'm more likely to use different color font to organize my writing (then switch it back to black before submitting it) than an actual outline. 
I did this though grad school and graduated. I even had a few teachers comment how easy the paper was to read because she could 'hear my voice' behind the words. "
1366,estp,"Structure is always a problem, especially for ESTP. What works for me is to plan it beforehand. It feels real stupid to do, and usually I just do whatever and it looks good. But especially when structure is vital I basically make a draft first, where structure can lack and have a plan (Introduction - First part - Second part etc) next to it. After that I sort of pick and choose."
1367,estp,"I'm a research scientist and I write papers all day every day. I rock this. I don't believe that personality limits anyone. You can do it. You probably were not taught well.  I started writing research papers in middle school, so by high school I was confident (yea for public ed!). If you learn how to organize your information, thoroughly research and know what you want to write, then stick to the intro paragraph, three main points (or whatever the assignment calls for), and conclusion, you're golden. Also, here are the steps: 1. Understand what is being asked of you. 2. do research 3. Write your main idea, 4. Write an outline 5. Write first and last paragraphs, 6, write main ideas for each paragraph (insert them into the outline) then write your paper and conclusion. "
1368,estp,My ex was estp and he would be so not subtle with this. If i told him i liked this way of living (not his way at all) few days later he would start talking about how that’s his way of living and i am like huh? Lol
1369,estp,"some people make it even easier by displaying their aposematic features. 
Most of the time yeah, you don't even have to talk to them to roughly know what kind of person they are"
1370,estp,"Oh i know all about that. He actually even once told me ‘we are not gonna stop arguing until you agree with my opinion’ while i was being like ‘that’s your opinion and this is mine, agree to disagree’ lol tiring days"
1371,estp,My sister and mother are infjs. They drive me completely up the wall. I never ever get to be right about anything because it's 2 against 1. I also always find myself stating an argument and then when I'm over it 30 minutes later they are still discussing it amongst themselves. It drives me crazy. They are also very co-depdent with each other so it's always them and me. Very frustrating..
1372,estp,"I've been to INFJ's in my life only recently. I met a couple INFJs in the past 5 months, one of them has become one of my best friends, I could take a bullet for her, the other one I haven't invested that much yet, but the same ""smoothness"" appears when we interact with each other.
Overall I'd say that the interactions are almost always great. It depends mostly on the maturity of both the INFJ and ESTP. 
I could definitely see an ESTP dismiss the INFJ quickly and vice versa, because one is too crazy moving from places to places (us ESTP) and that's super shallow and tiring for the INFJ. On the other hand, to see this person sitting there and do nothing in his/her life(the INFJ) seems like a waste of my time for ESTPs.
Once you get through this barrier... 
INFJs are super funny, they have those Ni moments when they say stupid shit out of nowhere, the most ridiculous and over the top jokes, to which we can as ESTP one up them, and carry on the stupidity. How many times have we gone waaaaaaaayy too far with my INFJ friends, with the other around finding us too stupid or sick or gross xD Nothing seems to offend INFJs, or if that does, they will tell you so that you know where the line is. They also know a lot about people and how to behave in society, or at least how to pretend haha. Also to get in touch with your being, pushing each other, the ESTP will push the INFJ to get out of his/her shell and try stuff by being supportive and positive. And the INFJ will teach the ESTP patience and listening of the others' emotions/ states.
This relationship is just an amazing experience, INFJS I love you!!!
I wonder what the experience of others would be... How about you with your brother?"
1373,estp,"I understand a bit. My sister is INFP and my ISFJ mom makes it her duty to protect her from me. All I do is speak truth, and the flower child can't handle it. My mom loves that she needs her and my sister loves not having to deal with realities difficulties. If it was for my ENFP dad growing up being an EP with me I would've moved out early. "
1374,estp,"I feel your pain. Whenever my brother is doing anything, I can't do anything to stop him or change his mind or get involved. And he used to invite his friends over all the time, basically denying me access to the basement with all of our cool stuff and video games once or twice a week."
1375,estp,"My brother... isn't the kindest towards me normally. We've had many a fight, and he takes dominance over me whenever possible and succeeds due to him being 2 years older than me, But when he's in a good mood and opens up, he's awesome. We watch videos together, I'll play video games and he'll be sitting in the background commentating with puns and funny stuff, he shows me stuff he's found, I show him stuff I've found... and after all of that, he's also been a great person to talk to as of late. He helps me figure out how I feel about things and why, and he's really helped me discover who I am, too. He's the one who introduced me to this whole 16 personalities thing, and it's helped me a lot. So, yeah. Sort of a similar experience to yours, generally. He has a tough shell he hides in, but once he breaks out, he's an awesome guy."
1376,estp,"Haha that sounds awesome! Great relationship even if it might be hard sometimes.  The cool thing with INFJs is that we kindov have to ""work"" for the relationship which helps us learn patience.
I chose to put them in a bright light only but...
The truth is INFJs are quite cold inside... They have this tender and gentle exterior that they tend to display to most people. A quite cold and really harsh interior layer you get to once you get to know them. But if you finally attain to their core, of which they show to almost no one(super hard for them to truly let go and share) they are usually one of the most humane people there is. 
So... I guess it's easier to get to this part as brothers but still demands time haha.
As for other INFJs,  that's a big hassle!
I wonder what you INFJs lurkers think about that one :p"
1377,estp,"i feel like you got it totally backwards. for my experience, it's ice first. unless by ice layer you mean our unshakable belief in our beliefs. for example we're the ones who would take yeller out behind the woodshed and probably not cry. what we would have done would be less bad than letting him go on. atleast for me. if i'm totally clear on something logically within my belief system, i can appear like ice i suppose. "
1378,estp,"I'm wondering if ESTPs (or Se high stack) would watch a tv show (or stream, whatever you're into) at the same time as reading, writing or performing some other task that requires a pretty high level of focus.
I'd like to know if you do watch something while doing other tasks how well do you pay attention to it?"
1379,estp,"So like... your question phrases it the wrong way round i think. Instead of multi tasking it's filling the gaps in the main activity.
Let me put it like this. The tv noise fills in the gaps between the times when i'm focusing on the actual thing i'm doing. So i might put it there for downtime - in between moments. Or just to look at while i rest my eyes. Literally a brief distraction. I wouldn't consider myself able to tell you what was going on in the show - unless i've seen it before.
I sometimes put on a video to fall asleep (better than lying there bored).
There are also plenty of things that you can watch and ignore until the bits you like are arriving.
If i have to rewatch something because there's not much new to watch then i could get bored and start reading the web while having moved the video to the side.
Have you ever watched something absentmindedly and only really tuned your real attention into it for the bits you like?"
1380,estp,"I generally don't like it being extremely quiet and still so I need something to keep my nerves down when I have to do school work. Even in class I have to get up at least once a lecture. Doesn't help I hate the material.
Anyway, outside of school, it depends. If I'm in crunch time where I need to study something, I try to cutoff all external stimuli like TV and music. If it's something physical, I need noise to keep the mind and body stimulated."
1381,estp,"Awesome this is exactly what I'm looking for - difference in perception. Thanks.
Also to answer your question for sure. I'm usually watching at least one show while doing anything at home and if I have to 80%+ focus on something then I'll only be watching the show when I split my attention"
1382,estp,"I know that obviously ESTPs have stronger Se than ISTPs, but since thats a ISTPs first perception function would ISTPs see the world as vivid and be as in the moment as ESTPs? Or would it be toned down and kinda foggy if thats the right word like how a INTJ or ENTJs Se would be? "
1383,estp,"There is a big difference between dominant and auxiliary function (and no, they don't ever switch places and an ISTP doesn't go to being an ESTP or vice versa). The auxiliary function is much more flexible and can be turned on and off at person's wish. It's applied to the specific situation at hand. The dominant function is always there. It never turns off and you cannot make it turn off (not even in your sleep). It's static, it doesn't have much flexibility, and all it does is observe and make conclusions. So one is observing and concluding, the other is actively influencing situations around you. Dominant function vs Auxiliary function - just insert Se into these descriptions."
1384,estp,"ESTP and ISTP are pretty different. Sometimes bad tests can end up mislabeling them. If I answer a lot of ""introvert v extrovert"" Im always on the line and very often it can be one question pushes me over the line for either one. 
In general, I feel like its easier to tell types by peoples motivations for their actions rather than the actions themselves. 
Im an ESTP and my brother is an ISTP. One thing I find to be very true is ISTP likes to seek out action and adventure (skydiving, rollercoasters, etc) whereas the ESTP tends to look at life in general as a constant adventure or a game.
ISTP also tend to be very focused and specific and will utilize a lot of energy on one or a few very specific things, whereas ESTP tends to be very broad and doesnt necessarily dive as deep into things, but tends to have many more interests and/or plates spinning.
ESTP tends to be super blunt in their manner of speech bordering on offensive. lol ISTP is far more measured.
As leaders, ESTP tends to focus on how people work together: How can i maximize the teams strengths to succeed. Whereas ISTP tends to focus on either themselves or how things/objects work together. (How can i maximize my own abilities to get the most use out of myself to help the team?)
(not the best example, but...)
Lebron James - ESTP (team player, team ball = team win)
Kobe Bryant - ISTP (my focus, my skill = team win)"
1385,estp,"The biggest difference I have seen in myself and my friend/mentor (ISTP) is that he is bit more intellectual than me. He enjoys staying on top of the business world, stocks, politics, news, etc. Where I live much more in the real world. But he very much has the real-world interests (such as gardening, flying his plane, etc.)"
1386,estp,"I tend to appear to be socially introverted when I first get to know people (especially in large groups or parties when I dont know anyone) Its generally becuase Im trying to take everything in to figure out how best to interact with my environment. 
I HATE small talk, not even necessarily becuase Im not good at it, but I just dont give a shit and I cant really pretend to care. 
However, if I have can have even one person as a wingman/buffer I can be chatty cathy social butterfly all night."
1387,estp,"I'm a bit late to this thread but as an ambiverted ESTP formerly mistyped as an ISTP, hello! 
In terms of the classic ""where you get your energy"" type of introversion/extroversion questions, I always score as an introvert. A long day surrounded by people is extremely draining for me, and I definitely need time alone. I guess in that sense I could be considered ""very socially introverted"". My family certainly thinks so, I was often really withdrawn/quiet/tired at home. I enjoy being social but don't need to be, and enjoy being by myself just as much. However, I am generally loud and outspoken, make friends easily, and am not shy by any means.
So yes, I think ESTPs can be social ntroverts, though it's pretty uncommon. Social introversion and cognitive introversion are not the same thing. Besides just behavioral patterns, I'd recommend taking a look at cognitive functions if you haven't already, it's what made me realize I'm ESTP. Do you think you are Se or Ti dominant? Fe or Ni inferior?
Hope that helps."
1388,estp,"I have a friend and this has happened twice now:
Them: ""How have you been?""
Me: ""I don't know normally I just text you what's going on.""
EDIT: I think after the second time this person realized that they over the last couple of years had maneuvered their way into being my go to friend."
1389,estp,"I'm pretty much convinced that I am an ESTP. I think it's pretty clear that Se is my dominant function and Ni my inferior; I'm excellent at observing, taking in a lot of info very quickly, acting immediately, dealing with stressful situations, and living in the moment. I'd say some of my biggest weaknesses are lack of originality (give me an idea and I will do something with it, but I struggle with coming up with unique ideas on my own - I work really well with my INTJ best friend because of her sudden flashes of brilliant creativity) and foresight (frequently doing stupid shit and making stupid mistakes that could've been avoided), both of which are Ni-related. On the other hand, Fe is probably not my inferior function. I generally feel very comfortable and confident in social situations and know how to act among different people. Aside from the fact that I'm less socially extroverted than the average ESTP, I relate to nearly all the typical traits. And don't get me wrong, I'm not quiet by any means haha, I just also appreciate alone time. I'm quite talkative, excitable, and usually find it hard to sit still. Most of the ISTPs I know are generally much less open and perhaps calmer.
So yeah, just felt like I should explain that one! I'm also Enneagram 8w7 if that helps."
1390,estp,"If I understand Jung's description, you are essentially HYPER aware of your surroundings, be it sounds, visual material, touch, etc. Any sensation essentially, but is it the sensation you experience externally or is it the sensation you feel on your body(think bright blue blanket across the room popping out vs the feeling of actually touching the blanket).
Ne dominants are led all the time by a feeling of expectation, and Ne aux for Ti in my case is as well. It's a bit like pulling away a curtain to reveal what's behind it. For the Ne dominant they imagine all the things that could be behind the curtain, these thoughts fascinate them. They then use Ti to bring life to these thoughts. Like taking a shower and the Ne dominant thinks ""what if there is a lion sitting there when I get out of the shower"" and their Ti-aux rationalizes it after-the-thought like ""there is a lion because Suzy, my wife, has been talking about getting a pet so she bought one and unlocked the doors to let it in.""
While they entertain these possibilities, they don't confirm/believe in any of them. Which is why they have an overwhelming motivation to pull the curtain to actually find out. In the Ti dominant case, a thought will stand out to me and I'll Ti logic the fuck out of it to find what Ne perceived.
How does this all work for ESTP? Is Ti aux a guess at the sensations you would experience if you touched the blanket and using Ti to explain those ideas. Or is Ti used to explain what the sensation is? Like how does Ti work for Se? And how does Se compare to Ne as described?
Is Ti used to figure out how you could experience those sensations perceived, yet as you do that process other sensations are constantly pulling your attention away? Dragging you to the next thing and the next thing over and over. So Se-Ti sees a blanket on top of a huge tower and Ti is like ""crack on wall left side, another crack a few meters up to the right, grab crack left hand, climb to next crack boom boom boom."" has blanket, on top of huge tower ""Do a flip!""-Bender(an ESTP)
It would probably be more streamlined than Ne without the Ne problem of constant thought association like bowl-"
1391,estp,"External sensation, internally my body may be in pain but I'll just ignore it. We can use ti independently of se like just doing math homework. Ti does categorize sensations that we feel but mostly we'll just bypass it especially when we're with people we like. Ti can be very active when its crunch time but we mostly use it to finish something as fast as possible ie the best shortcut or path to success"
1392,estp,"Right, but how is it experienced? Like its sensation. And its objective sensation. Let's say you look at an object, is the white plastic of the cup a sensation? Or the feel of the plastic cup?
And how does it differ? Ti is like an equation, and IF the equation is correct(which it tends not to be hence subjective), it naturally gives rise to Te data. To illustrate: 
Ti: F= M G^1 G^2.    (The equation of gravity)
Naturally gives rise to
Te: Earth's gravity=9.8m/s
So if you were going to compare Se and Si in the same manner, where Se is an objective sensation and Si is what gives rise to Se when it references a correct model, wtf would they look like/be experienced like?
Similarly, for intuition: you get a feeling of value being a thing. Hypothetically we'll say you feel like behind a curtain there is something really important.
The Ne user: entertains possibilities such as(maybe a lion, or a serial killer, or a puppy) but eventually pulls back the curtain
The Ni user goes: it's a lion. They don't need to pull back the curtain because they think they know(but again they tend to be incorrect just like other subjective functions)"
1393,estp,"Both things listed are sensations since their perceived through the senses. Si is related to all temporalities experiences by the agent, which comprises knowing your bodily state and experiences you’ve collected through time. Se is much more interpersonal in terms of its relation with the external world. Se is all about impact, and can be referred to as the doing of shit, which comprises receiving a variety of different sensory stimuli, namely, drugs. As far as I can tell, our knowledge about the functions are extremely different. I would say my definitions present clearer delineations, and have more logical merit."
1394,estp,"I'm almost 18, so I'll throw in a response to this. 
What am I like?
-I take very few things in life seriously, aside from my health, what I like to do, and work.
-Arguments make me laugh, and I rarely stress over school. 
-However, I am always the most responsible one in the group.
-I'm quiet while I'm at school and work, but really outgoing anywhere else. I just don't think school or work is the place to be goofing around, I don't want to make my teacher's/manager's life any harder than it already is. 
-I party a lot because I really enjoy hanging out with my boys, and I like messing around with girls. 
-Relationships, anything long term scares me.
-I have awful time management and procrastinate like hell sometimes when it comes to school stuff.
-I'm really friendly, rarely ever get mad with people (I still get road rage and video game rage like everybody else). 
-As much as I love my parents, I want to move out more than anything in the world. I feel so restricted and held back by living with them. But, that's just too expensive to do nowadays.
-I like playing sports for fun, I'm not that competitive.
-Cities fascinate me, I'd love to live in one. there is so much going on, and so many people"
1395,estp,"Really really shy dude. Couldn't go to parties I was scared shitless.  Girls, forget about it, way too scared as well. I wouldn't do anything that could have compromise my comfort.
Estps are little bitches growing up...
Until we discover our Se superpower ;) 
Then we explore a lot with it... Or not and we just develop a really good Ti. But to become healthy we need both, and since we tend to do one thing at the time, it's one then the other..."
1396,estp,"complete loser. more intelligent than average (was always in the top sets in school) and seemed to be more mature than my peers. but yeah, chubby and a loser. 
Its weird to think back to how I was seeing as I'm almost the complete opposite now. I started changing mentally when I left for Uni. "
1397,estp,"Honestly, the whole thing was strange as I was very far from your typical teenager. As it turns out, I basically had a puberty pause from 16 to 21. So anyway, to answer your question.

I questioned all authority and especially religious authority, but I was never rebellious.
I have always operated outside of cliques which my area is full of even outside of the high school age group. As such, I've always been very fly solo yet wanted my own crew.
Had a period of a race identity questioning as I was the only Hispanic in the area and I didn't look Hispanic to anyone. Got over it during college.
Always acted on my best behavior and was always incredibly scared to break any rules.
Was one of the smaller ones build wise yet somehow solid. Cue puberty part 2 where I'm huge.
I only went to one party and was flat out shocked and bored by all the teenagers drinking with their parents present.
I was never invited to anything.
I was, for a lack of better words, eccentric. Some joked I was most likely to shoot up the school. 

Compared to now, at the age of 26, some things are still the same, but I'm much more confrontational with authority and more actively seek to dominate. I'd say a lot of my personality was there back then, but it didn't show up often because I repressed a lot of it."
1398,estp,"Just commented on a separate post in this sub but the story applies here as well:
I went to a private school with a strict dress code. On days following report cards, we would get a ""dress down"" day (basically we could wear jeans) if we had a parent's signature on our report card.
While this thrilled all of my classmates, I didn't like the idea of this reward system (it felt like giving a rat a piece of cheese for following a maze). Even though I got straight A's, I wouldn't get my parent's signature and would show up to school in full dress code. I would get off to the fact that I wasn't breaking any rules while still sticking it to school that they couldn't control me with rewards.
TL;DR: I was a very angsty teenager"
1399,estp,"Very true with the exception of girls. I was popular in high school mainly due to the girls I dated. It wasn't until I turned 19/20 when I really blossomed. Tons of partying, drinking, etc. Always invited to after hour events. Up until about 25, the one constant was women I dated had deep connections with social events. It's crazy because I need time to recharge after heavy nights. I need to be alone."
1400,estp,"All I've ever done is sports, mainly boxing, which I won a state olympic championship for. I've done football and soccer on the side.
Now I'll just smoke and do rec sports and outdoorsy shit with my friends.
Oh, and I've also been playing video games on the PC for most of my life. That's one thing that I stay competitive with. I'll sometimes play in small tournaments, and stuff like that. "
1401,estp,"Oh, it makes total sense for the recharge part... We are party animals, always at the center of attention and energy of the room. But after going on for a while, those moments alone are so important. Personaly, it's long walks in a city, going in parks and/ or coffee shops by myself. Anything to do as long as it's with the outside environment ;) 
I think, as we are growing older, that we can truly understand better the connection between human beings. Getting in touch with our vulnerable Fi maybe? Just a theory"
1402,estp,"You're just thinking of things the wrong way. It's not about being badass or trying to break rules, it's that many of the societal rules that apply to others literally do not apply in the same way for an ESTP. 
When you can think as quickly, logically, and out-of-the-box as we can, immediately win people over like we can, and are willing to take risks like we are, you view the world through a different lens. 
As a teen I was a good kid but a poor student, but was always in ""gifted"" classes when I was younger because I was very bright and engaging. Being assigned a subject I had to learn didn't interest me much (especially as I got into my teens). I always prefer to pick my subject and the level of depth I will dive into information. Wikipedia and Reddit have become a godsend for me and i can get lost for hours learning how things and people work. I prefer practical, hands on learning or engaging question/answer sessions to lecture, and often challenged teachers in ways that pointed out the flaws in their arguments in a way that was pointed but not overtly disrespectful. I have a way with words, like verbal judo, which keeps anyone I'm debating off balance. I hate/hated hypocrisy and selective enforcement of laws/rules, this is why I felt it was OK to allow the rules to not apply to me. As a teen raised holy hell against anything that I felt was against my personal morals, which varied modestly from the morals of society as a whole.
I knew I would have gotten my ass beat by my father if I had was ever arrested, but that didn't stop me from doing things that should have gotten me in trouble. In my teens I was  pulled over for speeding 15+mph 4 times, marijuana possession once, was at house parties that were busted by the police, several stops for violating our city curfew when I was younger, and walked away without a ticket or arrest each time. Each time. At age 18, I walked into a business unannounced and talked my way into a sales job. When I was single, I could nearly always win women over if I wanted to. The world bends to the will of a confident ESTP. 
You asked if we break a lot of rules, like I said, you're thinking of it all wrong. Rules are for rule followers, not for ESTPs.
Edit- added details."
1403,estp,"You're on to something. Over the past few years I've come to respect other people's feelings. In the past, it was difficult for me to empathize because I don't rely on many feelings. Feelings didn't seem to matter because I couldn't see or touch them. "
1404,estp,"I’m an ExTP 
Some of them are really funny and have the same “no filter” humor that I do. Some are pompous assholes who have nothing better to do than bitch about what everyone else is doing wrong. Personally it really depends on the person — if we’re hanging out in the first place then that means I don’t care about whatever personality flaws you may have— we all have things about us that piss other people off, I’m not gonna fault anyone for that "
1405,estp,"Hahah hmmm... I am always attracted to INTJ guys but they are a lot of dramaaaa. No offense. They tend to like to spill all their life details onto me and I'm like oh gosh... help. I know people say INTJs are cold but I haven't found that to be true. I really do appreciate how they are very direct and unafraid of talking about difficult subjects. In fact, I credit my INTJ ex for encouraging me to communicate better in relationships. "
1406,estp,"Well, I can't comment on the chemistry between you and the person you're eyeing up. What I can say is that I click really well with INTJs for whatever reason. I've met one INTJ woman, I definitely liked her, but for specific reasons not to do with personality type, I never tried to make a move. So I guess there's no reason to think an ESTP girl wouldn't be attracted to an INTJ guy's personality type."
1407,estp,"I’ve had a couple INTJ friends and some relationships with them.
I personally find them very interesting and intelligent individuals. What I like is how they can defend their beliefs adequately and also appreciate lots of non PC humor and be willing to go out and explore/experiment. They can be helpful and provide me honest feedback and perceive things that I can’t (how I’m behaving, what seems to be bothering me, inconsistencies in me, etc.). I love it when the loosen up, let go, and have fun! I find them to be dependable people and true to their words. They are good at judging things as well. Overall, we generally have great chemistry.
The bad parts is that sometimes they can be very defensive or stuck up about their opinions being right and it ends up being a huge argument over who is ignorant and who isn’t. Some INTJs keep a lot of stuff inside and just explode whenever, so be careful. Also you have to respect their personal space, and their tendencies (arrive early please) or they will lose respect for you. Some can like u/sosnazzy said be pompous assholes which is annoying. But overall I think INTJs are really nice it’s just the rough exterior they have but internally they are all fuzzy and warm (if you point this out to an INTJ, they will start getting defensive but we know it’s true :p)"
1408,estp,"Had a weird relationship with one for something like 3 years. Posted about it in r/intj, you can check my history. Bottom line: we aren't in contact anymore, his mind was too closed. Had we actually spoken about things we would be perfect, but alas his ego. "
1409,estp,"I know a couple of INTJs. They are usually quite pompous/condescending. Really fun and interesting at first, but when you begin to see through that, it's not fun at all anymore. In my experience, they're actually quite insecure which is why they seem so insanely awesome and exicint up front. They front load all the things they think make them cool and then when you hear those stories 50 more times over the friendship, it get's boring. They don't seem to actually be going out and doing much. I'm out in the world living and don't want to hear old stories over and over again. 
edit: I'm an ESTP female and have known these things to be true for both genders of INTJ. "
1410,estp,"Because they had found someone true. Its only at this time they open up. They have taken that effort to understand you. But From what you say it sounds as if you dont care enough about it or you have not taken the effort
I have found it the other way around..The ESTP girls in my Uni , i see that its they who have lot of ongoing drama in their lives & its annoying as hell, seems as if they are continualy asking for it go on. So Your point just doesnt make sense. 
​
Anyways thanks for the input, its helpful"
1411,estp,"thank you , this helps & you are very insightful. You described all about us except for that "" very defensive or stuck up about their opinions being right and it ends  up being a huge argument over who is ignorant and who isn’t "" .  Most of us are always open to all kind of possibilities and in every critical situations we want to be proved wrong but our insights turn out right 99% of times & its painful seeing we are right so many times, this has led us to be that way
haha lol so true..i think we care tooo much
They wont . 
Trust me, instead they would be smiling right now reading it
​
​"
1412,estp,"I think it's more like they spill a lot of life details right away Hahah. I'm not sure they tried to understand me because they spill pretty soon after meeting me.. how could there have been time to already understand me? They usually say they feel comfortable around me so it's likely that. I guess I initially find it ""different"" because people usually don't tell you such intimate things so soon. 
I would think that ESTPs are usually more dramatic for sure. However, I had drama w INTJs because the ones I have known tend to make a big deal out of small things. I have never met a healthy INTJ... perhaps it would be different. The INTJs I know all had family issues and such. Overall, INTJ and ESTP relationships are definitely an opposites attract type of thing though. "
1413,estp,"hahaha
their analytical power is not to be underestimated, INTJs tend to analyse right from start, the reason why only few people are able to get in their sacred inner circle
agree they might be immature & unhealthy & having less understanding or it would have been a different experience for you"
1414,estp,"Brassy, loud, entertaining, and joyful. Very project-oriented. I tend to bite off more than I can chew sometimes. I like to live in the moment when it comes to socializing but I can be a long-term thinker when it comes to organization and life-goals. 
I'm not sensitive. Snarky, welcoming of criticism but quick to brush off adversary. I don't hold things against people or hold grudges but I do tend to predict behaviors based on history--I just learn to work around it. I make judgments based on how the world (and people) work, but I don't blame them for being the way they are. 
Let me know if you have more questions. "
1415,estp,"I consider myself chill although my friends tell me I'm pretty intense. 
I'm full of energy, always up for the party or adventures or just something new. My friends will always be about ""chill beers"" when I'll be ordering tequila shots. 
I'm very open minded, have a very unique perception of morality. 
I'm kinda of a rule breaker, but only actually break rules when rules come in the way of what i want or what I need to do to get what I want. I don't just break rules for the fun of it. 
Very rational, a bit too blunt in the way I say things, people says that I can be mean, but I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just trying to be honest here ! 
In relationship will always go for what I can't have, because having what I can have is way too easy, and where's the fun in that right? "
1416,estp,"she is 15y/o and is an asian if that helps! :D
if i remember correctly, when she was young she would always cry at new and strange environments like in nursery but will then be very energetic when she gets used to it. i also remember clearly that she was very loud with her cousin (or people she's familiar with) that's around her age and she would always boss them around and do all sorts of crazy things that's inappropriate. 
she now finds it hard to verbalise her thoughts well and often get into clashes with overly-sensitive people. i've heard that many of her friends call her insensitive and unemphathetic when she told me that she was trying to help them ""in another way"" and that her actions were often misunderstood as that. she also has trouble with authority and rebels hard, especially with people that tries to control her or limit her actions. she told me that she knows little of her feelings and doesn't like wallowing in them. i'm convinced by now that she is an ExTP, except that ENTP is very possible as well. 
she seeks adrenaline-pumping activites but has limited access to it giving her place of residence and thus dedicates herself to working out. she's extremely determined and feels out of place when she doesn't work out for a few days. she has pretty good reflexes but sometimes acts before she thinks, leading to trouble.
i wouldn't exactly call her a ""leader"" or ""alpha"" as most ESTPs are described as, since she has severe anxiety around most guys and some strangers (though she acts like nothing is bothering her) and unless she's familiar with people she wouldn't boss people around since she tries her best to Fe even though she still shows some of those tendencies when she isn't anxious or in depression. she is quiet around people she doesn't mix well with or when she thought they wouldn't click with her. she is also quick to make assumptions and is prone to overthinking at times to the point of paronia. she used to claim to see ""ghosts and spirits"" and is still afraid of these kind of things. she can analyze well and predict what someone else is thinking or going to do as well. 
she is haunted by her past and uses it as a guide for the present and future. she will also react very aggressively when she thinks that something similar to the past is happening again and will use everything in her to prevent it. she is also very quick to learn physical things, and doesn't like to be last. she also tries to be top in everything though she fails at times. 
please help me determine if she is in fact estp, thank you!"
1417,estp,"So I originally took the Myers Briggs and got INFP on 2 separate occasions. I actually felt I identified fairly closely with it. I tend to go through  mood shifts which occur without a trigger and send me into a depressive state for indefinite amount of time but usually at least a couple weeks minimum. After the state ends I climb back up into a normal state.  
So the first two times I took this test we're both in depressive states which resulted in INFP. After feeling back in a normal state I decided to wait a few weeks before retaking the test to ensure it wasn't a fluke. I answered as honestly as I could and got ESTP.  It seems like I identify well with this personality type too which seems weird. I don't feel I identify with much from the other personality types. Is it possible to have two different personality types based on chemical balance/inbalance in the brain? It seems some of the traits from ESTP and INFP (though only a few) may overlap a bit. Primarily I think the main difference I've noticed is my extroverted vs introverted side, my inability to sit idle or relax, my bluntness in observation and conversation (without worrying about the consequences or feeling awkward or ashamed about it)."
1418,estp,I would ask the INFP sub. This sub is pretty dead. Imo you can identify with whatever floats your boat as long as it helps you grow as a person. Don’t categorize yourself just because there is a test with categories. You are an individual.
1419,estp,"I don’t think it’s possible for anyone to completely rearrange their functional stack and fundamental patterns of thinking and values...each type has all 8 cognitive functions in their respective positions and roles, and sometimes different functions may start to manifest in us for whatever reason, but that doesn’t merit a personality change, it’s far less severe. If you share traits of both infp and estp, perhaps you have strong Se and Fi? Maybe consider studying up on isfp and esfp. 
This is a description of how Se behaves in an infp and intp:
“The individual tends to overreact to aggressive or confrontational behavior, taking it as a personal threat when it may only be a knee-jerk reaction or the result of a bad mood.
He tends to avoid intruding on others' space or engaging in behavior that may be perceived as coercive, and tries hard to handle his needs by being disciplined and well-prepared himself - rather than relying on others to do things for him. If these strategies fail, his efforts at dealing with the resulting conflict make him look actively pushy in a way that appears awkward and unnatural to others. This opens him up to painful criticism and feelings of weakness and helplessness.
He is able to moralize and instruct others about what they should do and why, but he is not prepared for others' active resistance or refusal to do as he says. In his mind, this would require him to put aside reason and good feelings and simply make the other person do what is necessary. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to do.”
Se in esfp and estp:
“The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to ""make things happen"" more effectively.
He is keenly aware of territorial conflicts and confrontational behavior occurring around him. He very quickly becomes confrontational when others try to make him move or get him to do something in an aggressive or confrontational way. He quickly recognizes when people are trying to get each other to do something or are trying to organize him for some purpose. He also spontaneously uses aggression to achieve his own goals.
He wants to make all decisions himself about what he will do, wear, eat, look like, etc., and resents any attempts by others to make these decisions for him. However, he is willing to make use of other peoples' ideas, advice, and creativity, as long as he plays the most visible role.
He enjoys testing his will in challenging situations and views life as a sort of obstacle course, full of adversity and challenges, that must be weathered and conquered.”
And finally Se in isfp and istp:
“The individual takes direct action to accomplish his goals and desires in the face of external obstacles, and also the interests of his close friends, family, or associates. This may involve prodding others to take necessary action, deliberately applying pressure in specific situations, or abruptly taking on an organizational role. The individual does not generally seek out confrontation, but he is also not afraid of it.
He takes his responsibilities seriously and tends to perform them diligently and with care. He expects the same of others.”"
1420,estp,"So this is an update to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/estp/comments/3zzko3/the_best_way_to_say_to_estp_you_like_them/ 
I actually had the guts to ask this ESTP guy out and it was really nice. He replied ""with pleasure"", picked me up at my place. We drove around the city, drank wine and ate chocolate. He really opened up. Told me eveything about his life, including some tragic stories. I also all of a sudden opened up about inner stuff, people don't normally talk about on dates. 
We didn't kiss though, which I found strange, because there were several moments where I thought it would be appropriate. He didn't go for it, I didn't want to initiate. 
Anyway, it's been  5 days since then, but he didn't text me about the second date. I mean we comment and like each other on Facebook as usual, but I really hoped he would initiate this time, because I initiated the first one.   
I am not sure what to think. ESTPs can you help me decipher this? Is he into me or not?"
1421,estp,"Not everyone is the same, and ESTP is a lot of people. Beeing forward burned me bad with a good friend of mine, kinda ruined it for more people then she and I. So I stopped beliving girls wanted to be more than friends. 
Also I did not care much either way, as long as I had friends around me and shit to do I did not care. If I liked someone I did not bother with the hassel of feelings.
Later I had a girl push a bit and it almost worked out, but I needed that push to actually see that she was intrested. If he is like me, ask for one more date, he will propably say yes or inform you that he is not interested. If you still get no info, ask him, and he will answer strait. If you push for physical comfirmation he might just roll with it. 
I know as I get older I like to just say things as it is, and have it in the open. With people I like more so, because I know that I just push shit down, happy or sad. Makes me look like I dont give two fucks, and it works for me most of the time.
TL;DR: Dont be afraid to take the lead. ESTP (or at least me) might push down everything and be happy with friends."
1422,estp,"Yeah, I think you're right. I actually asked him again and he said yes. I am glad but this still confuses me a lot. Although I think ESTP is not someone who goes on dates just to be polite. Or does he? "
1423,estp,"That is what I find scary about personality types. We might look somewhat simelar, and react simelar. But we are different, and care about different stuff, and have different backgrounds that give us a way different perspective on life. 
I used to have a teacher that I belive was ESTP (from when I took a class in it) and we did not match, we were bumping heads all the time because we were in two way different places."
1424,estp,"I.. Go on dates for the heck of it unless I genuinely do not like spending time with that person. What's fun is fun and there's no reason to turn it down, you know?
But then again, if I were interested in someone, I'll make it obvious. I may not initiate anything, but through my demeanor and phrasing I'll let the other person know that I am interested in her more than just as a friend. "
1425,estp,"It is very gray. Basically the standard theme but less blinding and with more material design. Have I told you guys how much I love material design? Well now I did.
My perfectionism isn't quite satisfied, but I figured I might as well use it now before they change everything"
1426,estp,"Sure
And the comments page"
1427,estp,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.
My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.
I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.
Cheers!

1428,estp,"I don't know if it's just me but this sometimes seems to just be an extroverted perceiver problem in general, maybe it's different for different ones though because for me people seem to draw the line between idea person and nice person so the details or particulars might be different"
1429,estp,"Yeah, I was the “smart kid” in my school (shit school obviously) but I started to get a reputation for fucking around a lot and being funny so by the time I was in high school I had that reputation. Some people who don’t get that jokes can wear out would try to get me to murder comedy by having me repeating jokes and shit over and over again while others tried to get me to help them with projects. My best friends would be the ones to let me be smart and fun at the same time, so it’s a good litmus test, I guess."
1430,estp,"I feel like my close friends know I’m both, but in terms of impressions I’m pretty sure people think I’m either or. In class and work/academics related situations I feel like people think I’m robotic, and in other situations I feel that people think I’m a total idiot. It’s hard coming across as extroverted without coming across as dumb though from what I’ve noticed "
1431,estp,"Tertiary Fe means ESTPs are not good at receiving, understanding and navigating the emotions of others. Yes it is very healthy for ESTPs to develop their Fe, it balances out their sometimes overly forceful and rational way of perceiving the world. 
Fe is empathy and a connection to something greater other than themselves. "
1432,estp,"I found myself and other estps to be extremely confident while using Se -ti but we can get very hurt, fearful and emotional while accessing our Fe. Our Fe seems to be very childish and for someone who predominantly prefers Ti along with se using Fe seems very uncomfortable and forceful . This happens only during times of extreme stress inorder to bypass this I developed Fi but developing Fe and not ignoring it completely seems to be a healthier option for the growth of a estp .
So wanted to know how you guys go about using Fe and what and how it interfers with since its lower in our stack compared to Se and Ti. "
1433,estp,"I don't think I generally care enough about others to become socially anxious. 
For me, it only happens when I'm in love. It's funny you mention childish. I turn into a little schoolboy when I have a crush on someone"
1434,estp,"Yes, this can sometimes make ESTPs paranoid and distrustful of strangers, those that are outside their 'group'. 
But this is a skill that can definitely be developed!
And I dont mind that about ESTPs, I can read others emotions quite well and I let the ESTP know what's going on emotionally with others."
1435,estp,It's the case with me when I'm not stressed and I'm feeling my best but when I'm stressed there is this se- Fe loop where Fe is directly used by skipping Ti. It's weird to use Fe without the intervention of Ti. Has this happened with you 
1436,estp,"Can't say I suffer under stress that much. But as I said, I'm usually a very rational person, but when I'm in love I tend to not think at all, and perhaps use an Se-Fe loop as you call it - not really familiar with that vocabulary."
1437,estp,"So I'm usually a pretty nice / passive person and don't usually assert myself over others. When they speak, I'm usually willing to listen and make harmony with what they are saying. However, this person in particular continues to push the boundary of what I will and won't allow. I get this huge ball of anger and anxiety in my stomach and I know I'm going to have to stop this person in their tracks the next time they speak to me. Any advice on how you handle situations like these? I'm not very good with confrontation and I keep riling myself up unnecessarily by thinking of future scenarios between myself and this person.  
Thanks.  
EDIT: The person is a family friend who is older than me. We're both adults.  "
1438,estp,"There are three ways to deal with a conflict, you can either play their soft side, and make them cooperate with you because they want to. You can force them to cooperate with you or you can form some type of compromise to gain a mutual advantage. How you tackle your problem depends on the situation.
But what you need to do first is communicate. Have you made it clear that (s)he is pushing your boundaries? I also like to push peoples' boundaries, but to me it's just often just a game and I don't take it too seriously. "
1439,estp,"Don't lash out. I did something similar after reaching boiling point and I ended up in jail for the night. Instead, communicate but be confident. Don't let it get physical, you'll feel guilty afterwards and regret it even happened. Speak candidly and tell this person they're pissing you off, tell them that it's in nobody's best interest. Good luck buddy."
1440,estp,"I have many INFJ friends and it's always so interesting to see how differently their thought process is compared to myself- 
I'm usually pretty non confrontational, but if I feel it's going to have to happen at some point, I usually try to get a grasp of the conversation I'm going to have,
then I'll put together a couple of points that validate my thought process, then I forget about it. 
Seems like I always do better in that kind of situation if I go into it without any preconceived ideas of how the conversation will go"
1441,estp,"I have to tell an ESTP some likely bad news. I am worried he will not take it well because he is kind of a ranty person and finds it hard to let things go.  How can I break this to you in the best way? Text? FaceTime? 
Edit: in person not possible bc of long distance. Can’t do it in person bc long distance. Options are to say something “like we need to talk” over text and ask to FaceTime or ask to FaceTime and just say it straight out or to text all the details out immediately."
1442,estp,Can’t do it in person bc long distance. Options are to say something “like we need to talk” over text and ask to FaceTime or ask to FaceTime and just say it straight out or to text all the details out immediately.
1443,estp,"Saying 'we need to talk' scares almost everyone. I'd say, 'hey, do you have time to talk about something more personal' or 'are you sitting down, I have some heavy news' then say what you have to say. 
When I hear bad news, I usually withdraw to process what just happened. Let your friend know that you can discuss it now or they have time to think things over."
1444,estp,Would love a concrete example.. Chris Traeger from Parks and Rec maybe? Ive consciously tried to develop my Fe for years now.. It has become stronger and I don’t mind feeling strange. I think my Fe and Ni could and will always need work tho..
1445,estp,"Sure ! It really helps out with F types a lot.. I date an F type and when I’m being selfish and/or insensitive, she is quick to call me out on that shit. It used to be a bigger deal, but after some explaining she did understand my brain is not naturally geared towards fully considering the feelings of others, and, bless her, she pitied me and coaches me every once in awhile on being more sensitive and in touch with my emotions. Her first advice was to “fake it til I make it” in terms of my response to emotional input from others. Just because I can’t immediately feel what someone else is feeling doesn’t mean I can’t or won’t feel that way in time, or that because I don’t feel the same way as them that their feelings are irrelevant to me. It helps me listen to what people are actually saying, and to consider more why someone might be feeling the way they do. It helps me think outside myself. And while it has gotten better and it does make me feel good when I recognize a person in pain and can help them just by connecting with them emotionally, I am very aware that when I hang out with my ENFJ friends my Fe will never be on the same level as theirs, and truth be told I don’t really want it to.. they are obsessed with how people feel about them/how they feel about people, and it seems fucking exhausting.. sometimes you just gotta tune fuckers out, be yo self, and do your own thing.. or at least I do :)
I broke down in a bar a couple weeks ago because a friends cousin died.. never would have done that before I met my gf. “Faking it” has lead to genuine emotional responses I never thought I had in me or could share with others."
1446,estp,"I’ve recently encountered an interesting ESTP, kinda got addicted to the attention from them. 
Having researched the type, they consider themselves to be a sociopath. I knew it wouldn’t last given the nature of the type. No offence. 
Anyways, I was curious about you guys and your encounters or associations with INTPs. I just want some metadata to think over. 
Hope you can help
Your friendly neighbourhood INTP~"
1447,estp,"We keep relationships that are useful. You need to provide something to them that they don't have themselves or is otherwise harder for them to attain without you, and they will in turn scratch your back so to speak. Everyone I'm friends with has their use or role, like tools in a toolbox. Similarly when they don't perform their function, I don't need it anymore, or I find something better, the tools get replaced or removed. It's not easy, but if you can keep it afloat that ESTP will be the best friend you've ever had"
1448,estp,"My all time best friend was an ENFP with a lot of the same interests and whatnot as me. Similar enough to be familiar, different enough to keep it rolling. Dude is like a brother to me, very synchronous "
1449,estp,"Concider it a toxic relationship, and I’m not one to hold onto to things. Worst part, it’s having a negative effect on me so is worth trying at all?
I’ve been considering letting go anyways. It’s not anything serious, so it’s not exactly a problem.
Thanks for the help. Unfortunately I don’t like proving myself, I’m more of a discovery. "
1450,estp,"I think this is wise of you. The Estps I’ve known want useful people around. Because they can’t handle a lot of intimacy and tend to have shallow attachments, it’s easy for them to ‘replace’ most people. Every now and then they meet someone they have a hard time replacing though. 
If it’s romantic, they often have more of the push-pull relations. I found I generally get along with them and enjoy them, but I’m super loyal to my friends, but also at a bit of a distance. I’m also not huge on intimacy, so we would just chat about easy things and do activities together. It worked well. Ultimately though, I ran into issues where I just didn’t see them as solid people— like you invest in the relationship with them but they are always open to dropping you for something that seems shiny. That’s just not how I think friends should be treated. "
1451,estp,"Anyone live in Syracuse. I would love to meet someone that reflects my personality!  I feel like if I had met someone like that I would understand myself a little better after visually seeing them.  Has anyone else achieve this goal, what were your thoughts?
Thanks
ESTP "
1452,estp,"Yeah i recently moved into a house with another ESTP.
It is very useful to observe the similarity between us. I can also spot some nuance differences due to our personal life experiences and the environments we were raised in. I'm 32 and the housemate is 33. We grew up in different countries.
The other ESTP is likely enneagram 8 whereas i am 7.
Aside from that difference we use very similar language, reasoning style, have similar temperaments, draw very similar conclusions, have similar priorities and interests. We are also both keenly observant and read body language quite easily.
Our method of problem solving, debate strategy and win-win scenario fixing is the same. We even tell stories in similar ways (i.e. the framing and reveal factors to entertain the audience). This was the first thing that made me think that this person is estp; arguing with our landlord.
I was able to confirm Ti aux after seeing this cool character begin to make notes on a video game (no mans sky). Exactly the same way i made notes on starcraft when learning build orders. This might not unusual... to make notes on a video game... but for an impulsive personality that shares lots in common with myself... then it's a confirmation of Se-Ti. Due to the intensity of persona and fairly hedonistic daily activities i have assumed Se dom. And due to the other similarities i settled on estp.
Both of us suffer from lower back pain due to skating and video games.
Both smoke lots of weed. Both are skeptical of mainstream political ideals and the status quo."
1453,estp,Could someone please give examples of what distinguishes them? I usually get results as an ENTP but most tests are rigged to the N side instead of S so I’m confused. I tend to take crazy risks like an ESTP but I am always in my head and have trouble paying attention to things because I’m daydreaming. I also an vey honest and straightforward. I am pretty good at puzzles and figuring things out.
1454,estp,"I'm sort of in the same boat. Have had entp, entj, then estp as results. I tend to think the latter is correct because I'm very sensory. I love to touch things, eat good food and am very good at sensing other people, moods and ambiences. Often in customer meetings I have a wildly different opinion about the outcome than my colleagues because I pay more attention to how they behave rather than what they actually said.
Now, almost everyone enjoy a great meal, but while my peers say it's good I'm having a fucking orgasm in my mouth.
The thing that puts me the most off with the entp type is the devil's advocate thing. That role is simply not me and something I never do. Also debating is tiresome and often boring. I manage 30 people at work and I don't have time for that stuff."
1455,estp,"Do you find it hard to stay on topic when you discuss something?
Are you able to focus on one topic and reach a conclusion?
Does gathering your thoughts become energizing to you?
Do you find it easy to figure out the best method for yourself?
In honesty, your strike me as an ESTP and I'll tell you why when you answer my questions"
1456,estp,"Try carefully reading through socionics profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. These are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to figure out your type.    
ESTP by Gulenko | ESTP by Stratiyevskaya | ESTP subtypes 
ENTP by Gulenko | ENTP by Stratiyevskaya | ENTP subtypes "
1457,estp,I agree with everything except the debate part. I personally like to debate and argue for a side. But that’s only if I have enough energy to care a bit about the topic or I just don’t debate at all. I have opinions for things but if it doesn’t matter to me then I don’t care.
1458,estp,"I can only focus on a topic and have the energy to reach a conclusion if I’m interested in it. 
Gathering my thoughts is a thing genuinely like to do. 
I can always figure out a better method for myself because I try to be efficient and I get pissed when my idea is rejected because I tend to take time into analyzing what’s best for me with logic."
1459,estp,"question to see if you have Ne-Dom
Question to see if you have Se-dom
Question to see if you have Si-inf (if you hate doing this, then you have Ni-inf)
Question to see if you have Ni-inf (I don't know what Ni is like, entirely - I never focused on that cognitive function myself... So this question probably shouldn't have been asked, haha. 
Due to your answers, you seem to be very much an ESTP because ENTPs have crap attention span on topics (Ne) compared to ESTPs. 
Because of Si-inf, ENTPs wouldn't give gathering thoughts easy. They tend to create more ideas and thoughts through their environment. 
As I say to all, take with a grain of salt. Try to use this as a reference to typing yourself"
1460,estp,"A lot of IXFPs I know have psychological problems. They clash hard with both society's, their surrounding's and their own expectations, putting them under a lot of pressure. 
I feel a mix of pity, respect, and puzzlement for them. Sometimes their hesitation on their beliefs annoys me and leaves the impression of immaturity to me, this counts for the unhealthy individuals in particular. Healthy IXFPs are extremely mellow and corky. Aurora Aksnes impresses me over and over again, I feel deep respect for mature Fi."
1461,estp,"Hi everyone,
My husband (INTP) and I (ENFP) have a 13yo son. He also has a 19yo sister (INTJ) and 17yo brother (ENTJ). Recently he was diagnosed with ADD and tested gifted/talented in some areas. Made total sense :)
He’s wonderful in a thousand ways... but also fiercely logical and independent. He’ll become an awesome adult one day.
I’d like some advice from this group because my ENFP ways are so foreign to his. Even his father finds him a challenge. There’s a lot of love/warmth in this home, but there’s always room for more connection.
I adore him but need advice on how to connect with him in ways that make school, family, meds, life more meaningful for him.
He’s more than your average teen... and I’m glad!
(I still get a hug and a smile... when I ask.)
TL;DR How do we all show love/connection to our ESTP son/brother in a way that makes sense to him?"
1462,estp,"Just some thoughts. ESTPs are the type to be most likely misdiagnosed with ADD and ADHD. I’m not saying he was misdiagnosed, but it’s definitely something to be aware of. Everyone thought I had ADHD when I was younger. I too am a ESTP and was a “gifted” student. ESTPs are really good at finding solutions to problems without digging as deep as say an INTP would. Once they have a general sense for the problem and a potential solution, they tend to get bored and move on to the next. This, along with their P tendency to wake up and “take on the day” without a pre-planned schedule like their J counterparts, can make them appear really scattered. 
Whether or not he truly has ADD, I think that our personality type really starts to flourish when our brain matures. It becomes easier to recognize the downfalls of an ESTP and give more focus to one task at a time. Your son is still really young, and he’s probably fascinated by his mind’s ability to find quick but surface-level solutions to problems and then immediately jump to new problems. Let him explore his mind. And maybe start to challenge him on certain topics where he believes he’s found the solution, but hasn’t yet considered points A, B, or C. Since he’s still young, he’ll likely get frustrated by these deep dives but I can guarantee it will be one of the best things you can do for his developing mind. 
Also, if you are able to successfully do this, he’ll develop an incredible sense of respect for you. He probably won’t show it now, but when he’s older he’ll look back and truly appreciate your ability to challenge him and help him grow."
1463,estp,"Mmmmh, interesting question. 
I think that it could be good if u get interested in his activities. Ask him questions, try it maybe. We love a lot to speak about what we love and do.
Also, make him feel that he can talk of anything with you. 
For example, with my parents we never speak about sex, drugs or anything like that.
So be direct with him, tell him that if he got any problems or want to talk of anything (say the tabou words like drugs sex), he doesnt have to hesitate.
But don't force him. He just have to know that u're here in case of need.
Also, but i think u already do that, and it's not only with ESTP, don't judge him on what he does.
U can tell him what u would do, what he had to do, but don't judge.
Be in reflection with him. And explain ur decisions if u punish him. We hate illogic things. 
Idk if it will help you, because idk how I was when I was 13 and idk ur son, but I think it would have worked with me "
1464,estp,"I'm an ESTP guy with an ENFP sister. We're definitely completely opposite in terms of character and especially how we make important decisions in life. 
All I remember from when I was 13, was that I didn't really want anything from my parents. I just wanted them to stay the hell out of my life. As you said, we're fiercely independent. My sister and I both had a lot of friends and we were both sociable, but unlike her, I did not have the need to talk to my parents about my life. I did not feel the need to ""connect"" with them. And even today, I still talk a lot less to them about myself to my parents than she does. 
I guess just being there for him is all you can do, and I wouldn't be too worried about connecting. Just make sure he stays on the right path during his puberty and if he's a good guy, and I'm sure he is, when he starts to mature, he'll also start appreciating you more.  
I think it's typical for ENFPs to feel the need to connect to people, but for us ESTPs that's really not a must, not even with our own parents. 
​"
1465,estp,"Ok, I also am an ESTP with ADHD. (15)
Love for me is when someone is interested in what I'm saying, does things my interest and is genuinely worried when something happened to me and caring. I don't put much value in I love you's if that the thing I hear.
If someone supports my art that's huge for me."
1466,estp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/adhd] I have an amazing son (ADD)...

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
1467,estp,"Ughhh, this x1000000. I was raised in a household of Ne and Si. Absolutely mind blowing how dull life can be when stuck in this environment for too long. Do I have ADHD? Would my 4 year degree and steady job lead you to any conviction? I hope not. "
1468,estp,but for gods sake mean it. so many people say this shit but seriously dont have a clue the kind of shit I want to say. It would blow their minds. 
1469,estp,"Maybe you haven't. But personnally, i had bad periods on my life.
Maybe if i was close to my parents, i would have speak about it with them.
I would have appreciated to feel that i can speak about that with them.
They have a lot of experience and advices to share with me 
Edit : I never did it, maybe i didn't need. But today, i think it's a bad idea to be so distant from my parents about common topic and bad things in my life "
1470,estp,"I know one ESTP who has turned 41 recently but he's really kind of an outlier and not very typical of his type. He has always had a terrible fear of responsibility and enjoys his freedom, so right now he lives in his car and travels from one metropolitan area to another picking up odd jobs here and there for food and gas money, and his free time is spent going out to bars and clubs, working on his old vehicle, taking trips out to nature, writing short stories and poetry, and visiting his family and friends, and friends and acquaintances in different cities he has many. He has always been a player around women, but he's not very dominant and relies on his wit and charm to keep many attracted. Keeps a circle of women around himself through his travels and social media, where he's like a glistening fish that sparkles its scales at them from a distance. He has had many girlfriends in past, but said that he never felt like he wanted to stay with any of them so he broke off most of these relationships after 2-5 years. Now, like any man hitting 40s, he is finding himself still attracted to 20-something women yet they are not as interested in him, as the 10-15 year gap is harder to bridge and a semi-homeless lifestyle for a 40 y.o. is not that attractive to many women no matter the wit and the charm, so he has complained that it has become harder finding a girlfriend for him now. He still pulls girls in clubs for a night or a short escapade but has more difficulty finding a deeper connection. The inferior Ni has caught up with his personal life."
1471,estp,"I'm far from 30 but I have a line of ESTP uncles
(weird cause so far im the first ESTP thats not a guy in my family line and my grandmother confirms that)
Well just like any other theres the ""I grew up, I'm respinsibl- no.. and I'm stinking rich"" and theres the ""I'm shit to my family and in a huge asf debt..did I mention I'm alcoholic?"" and the "" I havent reached 30 and I'm dead"" and ofcourse the ""I'm never home and I'm still single, probably fucked in every country"""
1472,estp,"32 M here. Quit work to studie 100% (I want to do it now and understand the end goal better) and watch my kid. Next semester he starts kindergarden and I will take random jobs and studie. 
It was hard to let go of the ""gotta make money"" mentality. But I am loving it.
And since Uni is 8 hour drive (1hour flight) away I get a ""holiday"" from wife and kid and get to meet new friends.
Guess I will be teaching at late 30. (Norwegian system) either 13-16, 16-18 or a school for 18+(to22ich) where kids pick a fun subjekt and dont get grades (traveling I will make a ""East/West: line and go to SE-Asia and New York)
Or I will do something else. But I know that I will stay with my wife (a promise is a promise). If she leaves I will steal my dads sailingboat and learn to sail, and sail around the world or die trying.
TL;DR: do what makes you happy, change work, not family!"
1473,estp,"I think they're fantastic. A lot of the qualities I lack I tend to respect most in ESTPs. They have a fantastic ability to just do stuff- they don't second guess themselves, they don't seem to worry about popularity so they just do it. One of my best friends is ESTP and hes an incredibly honest and straight shooting guy who can get a grip on people in a heart beat. Sometimes I find them a little too blunt (being the sensitive wee butterflies ENFPs are) but I don't think its intended to be cruel or cold hearted, its just that brutal honestly that everyone needs :)"
1474,estp,"Self improvement hmmmmm I guess there is a focus on that, I'm not really aware of it. I find the times when I get the lowest its where my life is fairly stagnant. I think for ENFPs we have to constantly doing moving forward in our lives and if we aren't we go a little crazy. Its not really something I'm aware of sorry, I suppose I do but its more subconscious if anything. I do however place a big emphasis on seeing my friends improving by shepherding them to reach their full potential, I know my ESTP friend finds me overbearing and irritating sometimes because of this because hes fiercely independent but he can get screwed because I care."
1475,estp,"Hi there!!!! Probably fighting for whatever I believe is right- the truth. Which obviously is not always the right thing, my idea of what is right is wrong for someone else and thats where I trip up sometimes."
1476,estp,I think I should ask you that question since you seem to be commenting it on every MBTI post since fucking christmas. If I did like dick (sorry to disappoint) I wouldn't discriminate. Now be gone child.
1477,estp,Very important because it wastes my valuable time. Sometimes need to go places with someone and then they change their minds. Other times in ready for a vacation and have it all planned out but they can't make it because over thought it. 
1478,estp,"Hey guys,
It’s me. A random person on the internet. Ik it’s rather strange that I’m just here, sharing my story.
I know this probably wont be viewed- like ever- but I decided to share anyways. 
I would like to warn you, I’m not that great with feelings. Ive spent years understanding myself and I’d like to say i have some decent emotional intelligence, and I apologize if this isn’t very warm.
I suppose its easier to do on the internet anyways, I don’t know any of you all and I will probably never meet any of you. But i want any of you that are struggling with mental health to know that I may not know your situation, or whats in ur head, but I get you. In some ways at least I’m sure we have a little common ground.
I know you probably think that its just me already all better but I’m NOT all better. I’m still struggling, I’m still having my lows. In fact, I’m going through a tough low today.
I started to struggle with depression and anxiety about three years ago. It’s not uncommon, as an INTP, to not know that this strange thing you are going through is in fact depression. Everything was just kind of-meh. I became even more anxious than i used to and I’d be terrified of speaking to half the people I met. My grades started slipping and I lost control. 
This escalated throughout the past few years. Last year, I remember going to an apartment that a relative owned on the 17th floor, and almost jumping. They had one of those shorter railings where with a little jump I could have gone over. I don’t say this to scare you, but to explain my situation. Now here is some background. I grew up with two incredibly conservative Asian parents, one of which was abusive.  Today, I’m still scared of a lot of men with large builds but I’m recovering. Last year was definitely the worst. I remember wanting to cry, but being unable to let anything out. I was even urged to drink away my problems. Almost every day I wanted to do it, and every time i felt like i was better, the low would hit me twenty times harder. It felt completely hopeless, I felt like life wasn’t worth the pain.
Summer was strange for me, i forced myself to read and I felt as if i recovered, but it was still there, haunting me. This year was a bunch of ups and lows. Ive always felt that even if i try my very best, in this condition, I still couldn’t succeed. Depression destroyed my ability to focus in class(even though that wasnt too great to begin with) and drained my energy drastically. I couldn’t sleep at night ever, and then I’d end up waking up at noon, something I never used to do. I rarely got more than 4 hours asleep and I would often fall asleep in class. My memory also failed, i used to have a really incredible memory where I could remember everything but that was gone, and its still gone for me.
I had built up a facade, a protective method to not let myself appear vulnerable. In some classes I’d be so crazy and immature I’d act like a madman. Sure pissed off a lot of people. It was like some crazy ESFJ me(i am an intp tho) and it was exhausting. I’d barely be able to stay awake and after it would happen i would regret everything. 
A talk from a family member actually helped a little. I realized I needed to get my life under my own control and plan for the days that would be the most terrible of my life. I still remember what he said “if in a month, 15 of the days will be bad days, you need to make the good days count twice as much to make up for it.” Thats what i began to do. I did my work a few days ahead on my good days so that I had a cushion to fall on for the bad. I still have lows, but I’m working on wanting to get better. I know it sounds crazy, but really think about it. Sometimes whats stopping us from getting better is that we started to define with depression. We were used to living with it. Without it, we don’t know who we really are. I get that its not the same for everyone, but Ive heard things like this from a lot of people.
Another reddit post also kind of woke me up. It talked about three main things. Forgiving yourself, acceptance, and every day being a nonzero day. I currently cant find that post, but i thought it was important. I realized that just thinking about all my failures made it all worse. I had to accept that it happened and keep going. It’s a never ending loop and Ive been working to crawl my way out of it. Here i am now, still in a low, but now I feel like I have something to fight for, an opportunity. I think I’ve kind of accepted that i cant work at my full potential currently, but I sure will try my best on my good days, because they are all I have of this stage of my life.
Ive kind of learned to stop listening to the pressures of my parents because they only get me into more lows. I had to WANT this for myself. I don’t know if I do but I do want a future.
I guess i want to see something ahead of me. But I’m also scared. What if I don’t succeed? I guess the future is so unpredictable and I truly hope that I’ll be okay. I’m not saying my method will work for you guys. EVery one of you has a different situation and your problems are all equally important. Maybe I posted this story for myself, I’m not sure. Maybe it was for closure. I sure left out a lot. I don’t know if I had the words to really explain it in more detail. That was just an idea of who I am i suppose. But, I do want to let you guys know that I am here. I understand those feelings, when your ears are pounding and you are nauseous and the room is spinning in a panic attack. I know those nights where you either cry a river or you cant cry because you feel so upset in a low and you want it all to end. I get the feeling of how scary it is when you think that the person you value the most could be leaving you, and its all your fault. I still feel this today.
All this is a part of my own daily life, and Its still an uphill struggle. But while I’m climbing this mountain, i can slowly see the summit. I know this may all sound meaningless to you guys. I get it. That was me, and it is still me sometimes. The only thing I can say is that even if the future is blurry and you think you know you’ll fail, you have nothing to lose when fighting. I know its hard to believe and even harder to start. I just wish i told myself this a lot earlier and I could have fulfilled opportunities that I wasted. If you ever want to talk to me, I’m here to listen. I;m not good with feelings but in this generation, I feel like we need to get our stories out and understand the importance of mental health. It is an illness, just like the flu.
I don’t really have a conclusion, to be honest. I guess ill just end it here. This is my story, and I really hope that by telling this I could help even just one person, even if it is in a tiny way. Goodbye guys and Ill answer any questions you have. (Also, you may see this post on other Reddit’s) "
1479,estp,"
Be direct about everthing, no hiddin agendas
take them on adventures, or go along when they want to go
Dont try to “limit” their freedom. 
Dont overcomplicate things and problems, for them its “just what it is”.

ENTP female with ESTP boyfriend. "
1480,estp,"Also, we have inferior Ni so we are sometimes prone to fear of the future, or assuming the worst case. We'll rarely say that openly (unless you're very close), so sometimes telling us things will be fine is good. Or better yet, encouraging us to do things we don't want to do, so we stop thinking about what might happen, and start seeing what actually happens."
1481,estp,"Something I've noticed that my ENFP friend does whenever I'm feeling down, which always works, is taking me somewhere. Be it the park, a museum, the mall, a friend's place, a restaurant, you name it!  Any experience always cheers me up. Especially if it's something completely new to me. But this is more if the ESTP is already unhappy.
Some tips for keeping them happy and content.
- Try not to shoot down the ESTP's every idea/take part in their impulsive desires every now and then/indulge in their hobbies with them.
- Say what's on your mind, instead of beating around the bush. If they ask you if you're upset, then don't say ""No"" if you are, in fact, upset.
- Ask them for help with a problem. Nothing is more exciting than trying to think of new and effective solutions.
- Don't expect them to talk feelings all the time, as this can be very uncomfortable and draining for most ESTPs.
- Accept them for who they are. ESTPs are generally very tolerant and not very likely to judge you, and prefers the same treatment. They might give you shit about some things, but it's really just banter. Deep down they don't care."
1482,estp,"Wow that is very accurate! (I'm ESTP)
Also, my crush is an ENTP ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°). Got any advice on getting things going with them? I straight up told him that I find him a clever person and that I like him, and we talked for a bit... but then nothing I guess. ( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)"
1483,estp,"Are you a journey drinker or a destination drinker as well? Personally, I want to go from sober to hammered in as little time possible, it's either that or I don't drink. I prefer hard liquors, vodka and whiskey generally. I mostly do shots and drink very stiff mixed drinks or neat whiskey"
1484,estp,"Tanqueray, soda water, lime juice. 
I don't really drink unless I am in a social situation. But I am typically the one who will get the most intoxicated... for no reason... on a Tuesday. If I'm drinking, I'm DRINKING."
1485,estp,"Vodka Redbulls, Vegas Bombs, occasionally sex on the beach when I'm making drinks for the girls. That way I can play it off like I just had the ingredients out so might as well make it for myself too. "
1486,estp,"I agree with his take on extraverted sensing, you see this clearly in ESFPs who want to be the life of the party and give people good experiences. This is because of their dominant Se function. Thank-you for sharing this, im going to be looking at more of his videos"
1487,estp,"Happy 2015 to all ESTP's who are probably still going hard! I've been trying to set some goals and action planes for the new year and wanted some discussion in the area of goals and discipline. I know we all have a real natural ability to just accomplish a lot throughout the given year. Where I have struggled in the past is with discipline and consistency. I never have enough patience to see a goal all the way through because I'll try and shortcut something, or just get bored with it and find something else to do. So my two questions are:
What do you guys do to stay consistent with your goals throughout the year?
What kind of goals do other ESTP's have this year?"
1488,estp,"I'm an ESFP... looks like this sub is even more dead than ours.
My goals are always in the back of my mind and I'm always working toward them, I don't wait to start them on New Year's, so that is what helps me stay consistent."
1489,estp,"ESTP here. Something I've realized about myself is I love organizing everything- my room, when clean is extremely spacey and efficient because I found the right place for everything- it sounds OCD but it's something I do naturally when I take everything in. 
What I'm trying to get at, is that when I have a passionate goal in mind, it helps to think about it for a second, and figure out the direction I plan on taking with it. Then, I break it down into different steps to make sure it gets done on a timeframe. 
Naturally, I still struggle with sticking with my direction without getting bored. But, I've started using a calendar app, and connected it with my phone. It sends reminders on when I get things done, and I put a little note reminding me it's relevant importance to my goal. The motivation I get isn't as natural and effective as if I chose to do it on my own, but it gives me a fun sense of action because I've already planned it into my head.
I know it's wordy but, I hope my perspective helps. Keep it easy"
1490,estp,"For me, its not a desk job issue, but more of a 'is this work redundant or routine', which we can all agree that would be hell.
I have a desk job and absolutely love it. Working with the public in a non profit really does spice up life. I never know what types of dire situations people will come in with and I have to get creative to help them. It keeps me on my toes. Plus I have a standing desk so I can move, sway, and fidget as much as needed without bothering others."
1491,estp,"I think it's fucking hard, but luckily my job is about 50% away from the desk and is pretty damn exciting. Don't know how many fun desk jobs are out there, but mine is! I'm a server at night as well which I LOVE. "
1492,estp,"My brother has failed the majority of his classes so far and he doesn't seem to care about anything that doesn't involve drugs or video games. He's currently a sophomore in high school and the year just started. It's a fresh start and I really want him to take advantage of his time while he still can. He's smart as shit and is completely capable of doing well but he lacks the interest. Is there anything I can do to get him interested in school. I tell him constantly that I will help him with whatever he needs help with. He lives completely in the moment which isn't a bad thing, but it does become an issue when he starts to face criminal charges. I don't want him to end up like his dad; being fired from every job, always contemplating suicide."
1493,estp,"Are you my brother? Probably not considering that I'm an only child and finished school 2 years ago. I'll be honest, I winged it to the end, and managed to get into the uni of my choice. There was literally nothing that could motivate me. Maybe if a person I disliked would say they are better than me, I would bust my ass to prove them wrong. It's just that most of the subjects were so pointless. I didn't fail any of my classes though cause my mother would kill me.
Now that I'm in Uni I'm studying the subject of my choice so it's a lot better. So I think one of the things you guys can do is change his classes to things he wants to do (if the school allows that). About the arresting thing,  after it happens once, one gets A LOT more careful."
1494,estp,"I slacked my way through university, failed a class but graduated on time. I had to find the thing that I always loved and turn it into a career that matched my skill set. Maybe you should casually drop some college (or I guess Americans call it community college?) brochures that have video game design programs, or something hands on that he may excel at. Another option may be to have his guidance councillor talk to him. Don't know if that is possible but I know for myself, I am more willing to act on criticism from strangers rather than family/friends. Also maybe being in some sort of school club/activity/sport that your parents don't ground him from can change his mind about taking a more active role in his own life. Having some sort of physical activity or sport really helps me get motivated in other parts of my life. 
I have to say though, if it weren't for my family pushing me to become something I probably would not have worked hard to get into university in the first place. If you're in uni or something you should bring up the interesting classes you can take and how different the experience is from high school. Give him a reason to want to get out of there, praise him for his achievements at school and keep bringing up how much it will benefit his life. 
Edited to add: some sort of competition or prize can really get me going. Being told I can't do something or won't be able to do something really grinds my gears and makes me want to prove them wrong. Not to say you have to bribe him either but maybe helping him reach some sort of goal means you guys can do an activity together? It would depend on your brother and what he likes but right now my motivation to reach a goal is getting a tattoo :P "
1495,estp,"well shit =/. The high school that he goes to has engineering and a metal shop. I told him that I had a lot of fun in those classes and it's really hands on but he told me he has no interest in working that hard because of the math and technical reports. Aside from those there isn't much variety. I really wish I could find something to motivate him. Some sort of long term goal that he would be interested in enough to change his direction but he's expressed no desires for the future. Whenever he starts to fail in school our parents ground him. This means that he isn't allowed to do anything; No television, video games, friends, leaving the house. He's been grounded so many times and for such long periods of time (almost a year now) that he just doesn't give a shit about it any more. He just sits there appearing to be absent minded. This doesn't help with anything except demotivate him even further. I've tried to reason with my parents but that are dead-set in their ways.   "
1496,estp,"""Math and technical reports"" holly crap, that's one hell of a way to kill all the fun. And ignoring the punishment... it's like I'm reading about myself here. I'm sorry I'm not being helpful here, I still haven't figured out how to keep myself on goal. I think it's pretty cool that he has a sibling like you that wants to look out for him. I wish I did."
1497,estp,"wow we need more ESTP's on reddit...anyways, this ENFP girl I'm friends with seems to be really into me one day, and the next day shes not. We talk about alot of stuff and we spend a lot of time together, even staying up until 4 am just chit chatting. I dont mind doing all this stuff, but if its just to be friends... I wont waste my time. So the other day I told her that shes very important to me and she just says ""hahaha why am I important to you?"" ..I'm like wtf man, I was expecting her to be so happy that I considered her special and stuff but instead I get that crap so I responded ""Why you dont wanna be?"" and she says ""Of course I do, but I just dont see how or why I am""... Is she stupid? We spent lots of time together, I mean alot, and we've had sexual encounters and  stuff like WTF. At this point of the convo I was stunned so I used my ESTP powers and talked my way ut of it and basically called her a good friend. I'm not going to answer anymore of her texts until I find a solution. She's kind of a big flirt, almost even slutty, but with me it seems she really does like me.. is she just playing me? Please help. BTW: She's part of a social circle I organize, I dont want any awkwardness..., oh and i also asked the enfp forum, they werent much help"
1498,estp,"Dude, don't even. ESTP and ENFP relationships are hopeless. 
You both might have a lot in common at first. After all, you can both be described as impulsive, fun-loving, charmers who are kids at heart. Always up for the ups in life and you are both people-oriented person, life of party blablabla. 
BUT you both have different ways of communicating and expressing things/emotions. 
She's asking you ""why am I important to you"", which is pretty obvious to you because you show it by actions (spending time with her, doing things together), but she needs a lot of positive affirmations that will not only come by actions but by words, by feelings. 
The worst is you are very much a realist, so when you try to communicate, you use facts and rational thinking. So whenever you will say something that you judge honest and true, you might be ""too blunt"" (that tend to happen a lot with us) and she might (certainly) take it as a criticism. And if there's one thing ENFP hates, it's criticism! The comment might come across as a personal attack against her personal beliefs or identity. 
On another hand , she will be focus more on exploring ideas and possibilities, that why you having the feeling that she's ""playing hot and cold"". ENFP are just like that, they are a living contradiction living with a ""the grass is greener elsewhere"" effect in their mind and always seeking for freedom. 
You also seek for freedom and fun and liberty, but when you're into someone or want something, you want it NOW. 
You guys have different core values and way of understanding things, she will find you too bossy and you will find her too delusional or erratic. And you both will too often misinterpreted what the other says.
So my advice would be to what you do best: just have fun! Don't get too ""intense"" like ESTPs tend to be when they are into something or someone . Don't get sucked in and start overthinking the whole thing, because you don't understand why is she not just straight forward with you and if she likes you why she just doesn't say so or act accordingly and consistently. Will mess up with your mind. 
Good luck bro!"
1499,estp,"ENFP here. Not sure how her tone sounded but I don't understand why her question offended you. It sounds like you guys were fwb at the time and she saw you two as just that. So when you decided to tell her she's special she wanted to know why. If she's special since of  her personality, (she's been there for you or something) then just say it. It sounds like you're applying value to a simple question. 
She didn't deny it.
If you want to know if she's serious or not just ask. ENFPs are usually straightforward. It'll be a better answer than random strangers deducing from the limited info we know about her.
I asked an ESTP who was interested in me the same question. He basically said because I looked good. His response let me know he probably didn't want something serious. She may want to know if you want to become serious or not. Like before, just ask her and don't beat around."
1500,estp,"You probably won't read this but I'm ENFP and for the last 10 months I've been being pursued by this ESTP. I believe I understand his needs. He's so affectionate and I understand that I won't always have his full attention but so far it's worth it. He's told me that he cheats and I've told him I've got emotional problems that I can't even always justify. 
I honestly love him as a person because I've learned a lot from him and he helps me feel like myself. He notices details about me that no one else around me can. I'm learning to pull back emotionally from him the same way I think he does with me. I understand if I want to keep him I should respect his adorable unconventional values. 
My ESTP is pretty mature though and I'm adorable young and stimulating. "
1501,estp,"I’m not always sure my type is a perfect fit, sometimes J and occasionally I, but what I know I can’t access is the sensory aspect.  For anything I do from acting to drawing and even just speaking, I realize I’m looking for meaning, or expressing deeper ideas.  But I know full well I can’t progress if I can’t shorten the time between seeing a stimulus and executing an impulse to that.  
So how can I exercise my sensory function?"
1502,estp,"Try skydiving or something. I guarantee you won’t be able to think about hidden meanings when your brain is overloaded with adrenaline.

No matter what planet you go to the Te dom is gonna pull out a god damn measuring tape and be like...what's the real gravity here...rather than trusting the equation. Only after big societal support will they use the equation and even then they would still doubt.
Projecting this model onto ESTP, wouldn't you like never learn? Suppose I put you in a pure white walled room and lock the door. I drop a plastic cup in the room. You desire to touch it(Se, collect sensation). Then I drop another cup. Then another. And another...and...another. Wouldn't you just keep feeling the cups to collect the sensations? If the Xe(Se in this case) functions never assume, then why wouldn't the ESTP essentially never learn? I mean no two cups are exactly identical."
1504,estp,"Are you really dropping into an ESTP sub to ask us to run a weird abstract thought experiment with you? If you put me in weird room and kept dropping cups on the floor, I would attempt to break out of the room. I might try to use the cups to break out of the room. I would go looking for you to have a discussion and/or punch you in the face for putting me in a room with cups. 
Is this the feedback you are looking for?"
1505,estp,"Is this assuming the estp has no other function than Se, and even their Se is one-dimensional? All types have all cognitive functions in their relative role that all work together to get them out of this theoretical room."
1506,estp,"Functions don't exist by themselves, if one of your functions doesn't assume something, another one will
And I think you're creating too many equations and principles out of thin air. MBTI in general is not a strict set of rules, it's just a way to roughly describe the differences in people's mental preferences(at least how I see it)
Back to your plastic cups, why would we keep feeling them? If they're of the same brand then they are exactly the same. There is absolutely no point in touching every new cup, that sounds like something a person with OCD would do"
1507,estp,"I doubt it's that narrow. They likely won't stay in explore-the-cups-mode for long and start doing things with the cups. Even if no two cup are the same, the small differences are unimportant so they will start thinking of more worthwhile things to do.  
Why would they feel it in the first place? There are other ways to explore cups in a Se way: Squishing them to make a sound, throwing them to figure out flight dynamics, building things for playing with weight and balance, putting them on their ears, submerging themselves once you dropped an insane amount, ..."
1508,estp,"Hahaha that cup stacking was creative as fuck for Se-Ti.
What I was trying to get at it, why wouldn't an ESTP never learn/remember sensations? It seems pretty inefficient, at a glance, to just keep feeling tree after tree after tree while you walk around. No trees are the same and Se isn't supposed to make the assumption of what the tree feels like to touch unlike Si. It's like you'd never be learning if you never made assumptions.
Basically was just trying to understand your perspective on that."
1509,estp,"Well with Se being dominant everything else serves Se(except Ni which is antagonistic). Se has a drive to experience the most intense sensation, but also doesn't make assumptions for what sensations(touch in this case) would arise from the object. No two objects are perfectly identical(like two cups are never perfectly identical)
It's like...okay you're in this white walled room. First you might touch the walls, feel the cracks. Maybe tap them to determine the sound they might to think about what is behind them. But after a while you become bored because you've already touched the walls and felt the cracks. You need something new. So i drop a plastic cup in there. You probably touch it. Then I drop another plastic cup. If I keep working along this assumption that no two plastic cups are the same, and Se doesn't assume what something feels like unless they have felt it before, then would they ever get bored of the cups?
After how many cups dropped in the room can the ESTP say ""I have felt 5000 of those cups...I don't need to feel this new one...I know what it feels like."" Because it sounds like pure Se would never reach that point."
1510,estp,"Exactly, but yet that's how extroverted functions interact with the world. I could give the Te dominant a perfect equation for gravity, yet every time they'd go to a planet they would distrust it and measure it empirically instead. Xe(Se, Ne, Fe, Te) fundamentally distrusts assumptions and subjective models which is what Xi creates.
This may be true, but it seems the functions are quite defined processes. They might not interact like a function stack that we assume as in ""serving the dominant"", but its clear you cant use Se and Ni at the same time. Also that Ni is likely the one to make the perceptive assumption(though idk how cause it isnt sensing). Since Ni is inferior you would expect the ESTP to reoccuringly make the same mistakes over and over."
1511,estp,"He wasnt describing MBTI , he was on typology which is more accurate & when you know what exactly it is in details you will appreciate & relate to the beauty of his thought experiment. Everyone has all 16 functions but each operate at different spectrum , consider each function like  a door which is open to a certain degree & only that much amount of data flows in . 
Consider ESTPs Se function operating at full door open mode"
1512,estp,"I think i got it answered. But basically it's like, if no two plastic cups are perfectly the same, and Se never assumes how an object feels and believes in that until they have touched it since it is objective, then if I kept putting plastic cups would you ever get bored. Would you ever reach a point where you were like ""ugh I've touched 10 million of these...I know what this will feel like"""
1513,estp,"I like this.
I guess I get that, but also am curious what small differenced entails and whether that would imply subjectivity?"
1514,estp,"I know this is all hypothetical...but I don’t think it works like that... Se is more than just simple novelty. Each of the functions are very dynamic. Like, Se also has to do with power and exerting energy."
1515,estp,"the problem here is the assumption you made that Se dom will touch it. He was never given any instructions just locked in the room.
Se is about giving sensation to others . Also we will need to consider their all 8 functions at work not just from Se as we are testing an entity here ESTP and not just a function.
Most probably locking them up will build a negative sensation in them & they will end up using shadow ISTJ
Because they will be insecure of what they want [Ni as inferior , they dont know what they want ] & since noone is in room from whom they could have gathered data as to what to do in such situation the ISTJ will help them bust out of room . Also they dont have awareness  of metaphysics [Ne] so they wont / wont care to understand why you did it  and get back at you for subjecting them to this negative experience [their Demon Ne]  - see rolphi's comment [makes sense 😂]
So good luck if you were trying to make them learn metaphysics & theory . They cant & horribly fail at it"
1516,estp,"Oh no I didn't mean it like that, I was just referencing the actual function so you knew what I was saying. I actually think Ti aux is wildly creative since Se and Ne dom are much more creative than Ti dom. Ti dom is more efficient though, at least once the terrain is understood"
1517,estp,"I mean the ENTP is smart too but they make the same mistakes over and over. It wasn't meant as an insult. Though mbti stereotypes are ESTP is frat boy numero uno.
Anyway I don't know enough about Ni to comment. It was a guess."
1518,estp,"Oh no, I didn't figure you really meant it that way. Just thought it was funny to point out. 
As for the above question regarding trees, I wouldn't necissarily say that ESTPs can't assume a given sensation, but rather that they simply want to experience the sensation again. Just 'cause. 
If there wasn't time or it was otherwise inefficient to do so in some situation, then I'd ignore the possiblity for a repetitious sensation and move on."
1519,estp,"Yeah, that is probably the whole ""gather."" It's like Ne doms will say, I think I know what will happen, but they want to do it anyway because they wanna know what actually will happen because it is objective data. It's not subjective like the ""I think.""  I guess I was kinda confused as to when its like ""okay at what point do you lose interest."" Maybe the hypothetical is flawed because in real life, after the third cup something else had typically gained higher intensity and you chase after that sensation instead.
Si dominants apparently reference some internal model. Idk how that works yet. But they definitely assume and they believe the assumption wholeheartedly. That's why they dont explore."
1520,estp,"Greater life lesson, humans being mechanic are the essence of Ti and is what all of mbti and all of these subreddits are based on. It all goes back to Jung's descriptions.
Here is Si:https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.personalitycafe.com/istj-articles/76890-introverted-sensation-type-si-dom-described-jung.html%3famp=1"
1521,estp,"How do you think an awareness of power relations arise from Se? Do you think it comes from how the layout of objects in their surroundings affect their intensity? Power being a result from intensity, such as standing higher than others to project power."
1522,estp,"That's a good question. If I were to think about it, I'd probably say it has to do with muscle memory. My preferred modus operandi is improvisation; so the more sensations I've gathered prior, the higher my future adaptability will theoretically be. Of course, I'd say that's mostly subconscious. I enjoy sensation because it makes me feel grounded, in contact with reality, and makes me just feel alive."
1523,estp,"I think, in order to really figure out the ESTP, you are going to have to figure out in your thought experiment the outward/other people focus of my attention. I value the sensations about the cup and the room so far as to control that environment. I know it pains you, but in your next thought experiment, if you want me in it, you are going to have to tell me why I'm there and what the social power dynamics there are before I'd ever settle down and touch a cup. 
Also, since in your experiment you said the cups accumulate, you have to realize that there are far more sensations to be had than merely what each cup feels like. I am figuring out how 2 cups are different from 1 cup. How 15 cups are different from 2 cups. Can I build a bed of cups to nap on until the experiment is over?
I heard a funny story regarding this, but if you put a bunch of ESTPs around a table with a bag of M&Ms and tasked us with designing our dream house, and you expect to try to discern higher meaning from our use of colors of M&Ms and how we expressed ourselves or any other such thing, you would find that at the end of the experiment, we all sat around talking, eating M&Ms the whole time having completely forgotten to do the assignment. Yes, experiment a complete failure, but you know what you need to about ESTPs."
1524,estp,"I think the awareness of power can start from within and then it will compare or size up to external objects and people. Willpower is another term closely associated with Se, if that adds clarification. Se seeks to impose its will on the world, sometimes forcefully. It’s also important to remember that Se will behave differently depending on where it is in the functional stack of each type.
For example this is a description of how Se behaves in estp and esfp:
“The individual feels at home among people who are actively doing something and interacting with each other directly (visibly), and is able to organize people, move them around as necessary, and guide them in achieving a specific goal. He or she likes obedience and even subservience in others, since it allows him to ""make things happen"" more effectively.
He is keenly aware of territorial conflicts and confrontational behavior occurring around him. He very quickly becomes confrontational when others try to make him move or get him to do something in an aggressive or confrontational way. He quickly recognizes when people are trying to get each other to do something or are trying to organize him for some purpose. He also spontaneously uses aggression to achieve his own goals.
He wants to make all decisions himself about what he will do, wear, eat, look like, etc., and resents any attempts by others to make these decisions for him. However, he is willing to make use of other peoples' ideas, advice, and creativity, as long as he plays the most visible role.
He enjoys testing his will in challenging situations and views life as a sort of obstacle course, full of adversity and challenges, that must be weathered and conquered.”
Then in intp and infp:
“The individual tends to overreact to aggressive or confrontational behavior, taking it as a personal threat when it may only be a knee-jerk reaction or the result of a bad mood.
He tends to avoid intruding on others' space or engaging in behavior that may be perceived as coercive, and tries hard to handle his needs by being disciplined and well-prepared himself - rather than relying on others to do things for him. If these strategies fail, his efforts at dealing with the resulting conflict make him look actively pushy in a way that appears awkward and unnatural to others. This opens him up to painful criticism and feelings of weakness and helplessness.
He is able to moralize and instruct others about what they should do and why, but he is not prepared for others' active resistance or refusal to do as he says. In his mind, this would require him to put aside reason and good feelings and simply make the other person do what is necessary. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to do.”
Fun tidbit if you watch fullmetal alchemist Ed’s (intp) vulnerable Se is a trademark of his character"
1525,estp,"I once used a toolbox analogy for ISTP vs ESTP. ESTP is like a guy who buys a tool every time he goes into the store. ISTP is the guy who only buys one when he needs it. When they go home the ESTP just tosses the tool onto the pile of tools he has. The ISTP goes home and places it in a spot exactly where he can find it. When they go to grab one from the stack, the ESTP has to sort through stuff he doesn't necessarily need right now, but has way more tools so might have something better. The ISTP finds what he wants instantly but has fewer tools so might not have the right tool for the job."
1526,estp,"Let me give this a try :D  
You are a student and found a leaflet at your college from a small group of researchers asking for subjects for a study in sensory deprivation. Thinking that it would be an interesting experience and wondering if you can game the experiment somehow (and also liking the extra pocket money you'll get for just an hour of your time) you decided to sign up.
On the day of the experiment you are greeted by franksinatraisbest, one of the researchers there. He gives you a short overview of the field they're researching and makes you fill out a paper with your name, age, acknowledgement of the risks, yada yada. He then shows you the room you are supposed to spend the next 40min in: It is completely empty, no chairs, no windows and the only color you see is white. It's quite big tough, so it doesn't feel claustrophobic. Frank wishes you a good time and locks the door behind you. You do something or the other (this is your part, you write it :p) until 10min in a plastic cup drops out of a barely big enough air vent. Every 2min after that another one drops. What do you do?  
How's that? I might have gone a bit overboard..."
1527,estp,"I can and already have with Ne. You can look in my post history for it, it's the latest one on the ENTP forums.
I will admit I am lacking on Ni currently, as I am with Si as well. They are throwing me for a bit of a loop"
1528,estp,"This makes some sense. I can't speak for ISTPs, but seems accurate enough on my end. I always feel like a need to acquire some new sensation or experience once I'm done with some initial one. I don't like experiencing the same things repeatedly. It's like building a collection of sorts."
1529,estp,"Overboard? I think you could have added more. Like, why does the door have to be locked? I'm assuming then that we discussed a safe word in case I needed to get out. Also, I probably can't have my phone with me, because that would ruin everything. In that case, I would have to make sure that I had an emergency contact who knew where I was and when I expected to be done in case Frank is as shady as I think he is. I also have to assume that all eating and other bodily functions are taken care off before so that those don't become a distraction.
Now, for the actual experiment, I tried to put myself in that situation and just observe what I would do instead of direct it. I think that you would have had to address this napping issue. Because unless Frank put it in the paperwork, the chance to take a 40 minute nap and get paid for it is so tempting, I probably couldn't resist it. I would love to see a survey of ESTPs only to see how many of them would nap. I'm guessing it would be 
But let's assume Frank accounted for the napping and I agreed to not do that. I also am assuming the cup is dropping from the ceiling in the middle of the room. For the very first cup, I would probably really start playing with that thing because it would be the only new thing that happened in 10 whole minutes. Playing includes looking at it, but also sniffing it (not tasting it though, I'm not gross), deforming it to make noises, looking for printing or writing, tossing it to test for aerodynamics, etc.
With the second cup, I probably would spend at least a cursory amount of time verifying that they were the same cup, like from the same package.
Once they started dropping in on the regular I would most likely at the beginning making a game of lying down and trying to catch the new cup as it falls with the stack of cups that I already have. Because there are no new sensations from each new cup, there is a chance that each new cup arrival event is new and different enough to make it enough to keep my interest.
After I had around 10 cups and was the complete master of the newly created sport of cup-catching, I think I would switch over to drop-cup-bowling. I think you could build a 1-3-1 or a 1-3-4-3-1 stack of cups directly under the opening just to see what happens when the new cup slams into the structure. I would invent sub-goals and games based on how spread out it gets, like could I get a cup all the way to one of the walls? I would then have about 2 minutes to rebuild the structure now with one more cup, which would be fun to see what works on really getting that distance needed. Then I would get to see it all explode.
Once the experiment was over, I would go debrief with Frank, and I would give him a look like if drop-cup-bowling were a real sport I would wipe the floor with Frank. Even without saying it, I think Frank would get that message. Then I would ask if I could take a cup as a souvenir while strongly implying that I left a special surprise in one of the cups for whoever has to clean them up.
So what have we learned?"
1530,estp,"Because you outwardly experience things constantly, Ti will define the parameters of a solution, but that solution has to be matched up to reality. For example, I need something to grab items off the top shelf in the store. Ti defines the problem and context, but in order to solve the problem it has to reference the external world. Se dominant(ESTP), having experienced vastly more things than the ISTP has a larger store of things to reference for the creation of the actual thing used to solve the problem. Like a grabber. ISTP Se serves their Ti. Everything their Se spots is in service to Ti. They look outward for tools so that they can solve the problem. The ESTP just constantly looks outward regardless of having a problem or not.
Think about going to the supermarket. The ISTP goes ""I need this this this this."" He goes in and gets it. The ESTP goes ""I need this this this this"" but on his way to getting it the hot chick in the isle draws their attention, and then the next thing. Anything that is high insensity sensation because their goal is not what they live for...they live for exploring the outside world even if it costs them efficiency."
1531,estp,"Glorious! We have learned (once more) that ESTPs are the best. Drop-cup-bowling, heh. And thanks for thinking of the things I overlooked. Hey, /u/franksinatraisbest analyse this.  
Do you know why you would only briefly check the second cup and no more? What makes you think it's not important for the others? Just to help him out a bit."
1532,estp,"This is not only infuriating, it is also comedy gold, and wildly creative. I appreciate this more than you could possibly know. I'm interested in your reply to the other commentor who replied to this comment"
1533,estp,"https://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/blburn/is_this_an_accurate_description_of_nedomtiaux/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
This is a large element of Ne. One user disagreed but I don't think they are ENTP. Another one commented that an element is missing yet havn't responded to my comment reply"
1534,estp,"I think my original instinct was that I have seen what a 50 pack of Solo cups looks like, and so my assumption was one of Frank's poor grad students was up in the ceiling with something like that so it's not possible to be interesting.
Upon further reflection, I think the slo-mo high resolution cameras that pervy Frank installed (you didn't think I'd notice?) would see that I without being able to help myself would probably look into the bottom of each cup each time I handled it. It would probably be sub-conscious, but in playing back the scene mentally, I could feel my hand twitch as I picked up a cup to look inside it and then at the bottom. Even the 20th cup most likely. It surprised me, not that my imagining skills are so good I fooled my subconscious brain into moving my hand, but that I would not have guessed that before hand."
1535,estp,"with the intention of not coming off as an arrogant prick- 
do any other ESTP's feel superior to people around them? 
I am friends with a lot of NF types- and their insecurities and volatile confidence makes me think ""If they just thought a little more like me they'd be a lot better off"" 
of course I value all types of people and think everyone has their own special worth and dignity- but when it comes to ""figuring out life"" I generally feel like I've always been better at it than everyone else. 
Thoughts?"
1536,estp,I’m an enfp and I feel supremely confident in myself and my place in the world. I think people who are not naturally confrontational need to put more of an effort into utilizing those emotions and learn to be more confrontational because it will make life much easier for you. Just like estps struggle to express emotion and that side of themselves I feel superior to many people because I can easily maintain strong relationships with people due to my natural ability to communicate. My brother is an estp and we bounce off each other easily it’s great. 
1537,estp,"Yes I feel superior in many instances, but I earned it. I I know I work hard as hell to get to where I am. I feel lucky to have the strength to work this hard, but it doesn’t mean I don’t deserve it. 
I fail just as much as anyone else, if not more. However I get up a lot more times than the average person. That’s a superior trait, but it never makes the fall hurt any less. "
1538,estp,"I love my ENFP friends- 
and you're right about ESTP's and expressing emotion. That's been my biggest path to growth the last few years, learning to 
1. navigate my emotional waters myself 
2. being able to communicate openly about what I'm feeling
 Good thing my NF friends are almost willing to dive into those kinds of talks- so it makes it easier on me. 
I guess one of the reasons I feel superior sometimes is because I feel grounded in the real world- understanding the here and now and how to manipulate my circumstances for my own benefit. (while being extra careful to not manipulate others along the way)  
My ENFP roommate is so ""in his own world"" that I'm blown away how little he thinks about what's actually happening around him and is so caught up in his own emotions rather than the facts. It seems like he may cause himself extra grief because he's so caught up in his emotions rather than being able to separate and analyze a situation practically. I do find myself a little envious on how deeply emotional he is at all times though- sounds exhausting but also a richly human experience."
1539,estp,"I covet the other ESTPs in my life because I think they're fun and clever. Nobody is as resourceful, and as an ESTP myself I find it really easy to see where a line of thinking is headed when I chat up another ESTP.
I think I have three who generally fit the type in my life: my boyfriend, my longtime friend from Germany, and a graphic designer I know. I tend to spend long binges of time with these people, and we discuss hypothetical solutions to real and imaginary problems.
Well actually I have a language barrier with the graphics guy, so we don't hit it off as well."
1540,estp,"Oh its a scary. 
I try and avoid another me at all cost. 
I really like being the strongest personality in the room, other than my chosen infj mastermind I kinda attach to at the time.
They're just so good at using my talents for a mutually beneficial cause haha.
But with another ESTP in the room. It instantly becomes a pissing contest of who's better that can get very dangerous."
1541,estp,"I tend to want to destroy them if they are ass holes/ hurting people... or have fun getting into troble with them Like instant best friends who dont exactly trust each other but will sort of play off of each other In the moment.
Everything is cool while its fun... but if you fuck with my people i will destroy you... my little sister is and infj and my little bro is an infp... why they attract wolves like us... idk."
1542,estp,"I'm an ENFP who used to live with an ESTP roommate, and I really enjoyed how he helped me get out of my head and just enjoy the moment. You guys are also fun as fuck to adventure with! Where would be a good place to find you guys in a city like Chicago?"
1543,estp,"So I got myself a nice thai massage the other day, nothing sexual, just a regular thing. Anyways this nice asian chick pulled me in and started working my body. I told her I wanted something relaxing but that's really not what I got. She foiled me like a piece of paper and worked every muscles with great ""energy"" and dexterity.
While she was busy I started thinking, ""wait this is a little too rough, I should tell her to ease up a little."" But really I did not say anything but, ""no it's really good, go on"".
It wasn't my first massage, I've had all sorts before but this one was different. I didn't space out, I couldn't really think, all I could do was attentively follow her hands on my body. 
Small & slim with a warm smile and a very soft skin... But also strong, commanding and present. Obvious estp but I only realized it once I heard the lyrics of a song playing in my head. ""You can be boss daddy, you can be the boss. I like you a lot. Don't let it stop.""
I wasn't turned on per se but let's be honest that was incredibly erotic. I was completely okay with whatever she'd choose to do to me. And she did, she took control and I let her drive. I didn't think I was capable of welcoming pain in such way. It's always been the other way around but as of now, all I can think of is how much I want her to hurt me. 
It keeps looping in my mind with same typical shit that goes with this kind of encounter. Here's the paradox, I don't want to start imagining all of that. What I really want now is for her or someone like her to shut down all that overthinking. 
It makes me realize how trivial all of this is. Why even go through this endless Ni hell when I could simply give her what she wants, control."
1544,estp,"Friendo you sound like you're discovering sub tendencies, if I'm interpreting your ""overthinking"" correctly.
Two things to do. One, dip your toes into being sexually submissive. Not to this woman, obvs she's a professional and was just working your tension out as any masseuse would. Esp if she's Asian, she will prioritize where your body needs relaxation rather than your verbal commands to stop (source: mom is a masseuse, unless you scream and cry she won't stop if she can tell your back is messed up. LMFAO) Find a bdsm community.  I suggest this because a well-established bdsm community is the safest space for a flowering sub to be taught things without getting hurt by inexperienced doms.  If you're familiar with this, and you're a dom, welcome to the world of being a switch.
Two, if that thought scares you or makes you feel emasculated, maybe use that Ni to dig deeper on why?? "
1545,estp,"I was more thinking about how Se thirsty I really am. how I could totally see myself with an ESTp-Se for my own particular duality needs. I've known well a few ISFPs and ESFPss and even though I found their contact rewarding I can't say I found it fufilling. The absence of choice in opposition to someone who wants to control you is most likely what I need for the time being.
I've been extremely introverted these last few years, not that I was always the most extroverted fellow there is but if there is a balance, I'm fairly far from it. Dating an ESTP for a time would radically shape me.
And yes I enjoyed the pain and I'd prolly let her bite me until blood starts pouring out but I don't think that's enough to make me a sub. I can't see myself walking around with a butt plug waiting for my next order. My masochism is very mild and not easily triggered.
I'm a Victim like all high Ni users and that means a lot of things. I found an archetype of Aggressor that suits me for the moment but I don't believe it means I have found my calling. Rather I'm a sick pervert who enjoy a range of power plays.
I'm trying to clean my own mind of these perpetual abstract projections. Control is everything, master it or it will master you. These ""what if's"" serve no purpose without iniative and honestly I could live a fine life without Ni hell. I'm mostly 90% plotting and 10% action these days.
Please don't ever put these words together. xD"
1546,estp,"So i have been taking some test and i’m 
definitely. The problem is that i hate school soooo much. I want to do stuff and not sit on a chair the whole day. I’m in my last year of my degree but i hate everyday of it. Advice? Really know idea of a career choice. "
1547,estp,Shit sucks but ESTPs can get through all kinda shit and make it through the other side. I thought about dropping out but my degree was probably one of the best things I got. Just gotta take each day as it comes and realise you only get one go so dont fuck it up. Sooner you get it out the way the sooner you can go and fuck around in Thailand or somth.
1548,estp,"Business / Sports. But to have a job in sales you need to follow a education. But i think you don’t learn the business stuff in school. All the great entrepreneurs say that all the time (elon musk, gary vaynerchuck) the list goes on.  "
1549,estp,"You'll need to give some more context if you want people to give you some valuable help.

Where do you live?
Are you able to discipline yourself?How much do you want to work?
Are you good with people?

If you want to make a good career choice, you'll have to know yourself first. Not knowing what you want to do is not a problem if you're young. "
1550,estp,"So I'm an ESTP and I've done school on the side of what I've been doing for about the last ten years. I'll talk about that first and then talk about career stuff, maybe some of it will helpful. 
What works for me is to cheat. I can only do things that I think are fun and that I can figure out how to market - so I try to turn it into a game and figure out exactly what about each thing I'm doing is valuable and marketable. Then I create a situation in which it's way more costly for me to get bored and give up so I have to finish it. I came from being super poor so I find that forcing myself to pay it out of pocket makes me so mad at how expensive it all is (in the US) that I have to finish it out of spite for all the rich brats.
For life, I dunno man - beats me. I'm 27 and I'm on my third career - and I got HERE by flipping a coin. Before this, I had 22 different odd jobs, according to some stuff I had to recently fill out. I've lived in three countries and seven different states, some multiple times, in the last ten years. I'm doing pretty well for myself, I spend money on whatever is fun at the time and I do whatever I want. I think the key is just to never worry too much about planning but to always pick things that add value to your background that are fun. If it looks good that you did it, it's easy to bounce back when you get bored. Military is a double edged sword but if you play it right, you can have a new job every year. Physical things are more stimulating for me, but those are tough to find in the civilian world, so sometimes the best I've found is mechanical things that I can do with my hands like working with cars or computers (or language, depending on how you look at it)."
1551,estp,"Hello,
I’m a 20 year old male from the Netherlands. I’m very social and have a lot of friends and i’m good with people. I attended higher education in business ( sort of college) for a half year and i dropped out. I hated every second of it. Now i’m attending a business degree on a lower level ( education is in levels here) also i hate this. It’s way to easy for me and also not challeging enough. I think i’m quite intelligent I passed high school very easily. I’m smart but just lazy for school. Because of that people call me lazy but i’m the opposite. In a working environment and in sports (soccer) i’m a beast. I do everything to crush you. That said i also lost that kind of motivation / drive outside school because there is not one day i think about the future.  It’s kinda depressing and i’m very lazy and unmotivated now. I want to bring that fire inside of me back. I’m just running away from my problems now instead of fixing them. "
1552,estp,"I think some kind of sales role would definitely be a valid option for your type.   
However, don't give up on your education. I understand it's boring. I've had my fair share of troubles with education as well, but it's an important asset. If you're not particularly interested in your studies, then think about the bigger picture. You develop important friendships during school, you work on a general working discipline which is often much more important than anything you actually learn in school. And to employers, not having a degree just makes you a risky person to hire.

1553,estp,"I'm a female ESTP and considering a career change. I have been a manager in small business my entire life, and self employed for the last 3 years. I am looking for a total career change and want to hear what you do and how much you like (or don't like) it.  Thanks!
**Editing to add my own past career. I do not have higher education. I was a dental practice manager for 14 years. I now manage a small service business.  "
1554,estp,"I’m an ESTP and the National Technical Director for a  franchise company called Colors On Parade 
We teach automotive paint and dent repair and have 300 employees nation wide and are looking to expand aggressively over the next few years 
DM your location if you’re interested and I can get you in touch with an area developer.
It’s a very good living and fulfills the need for creativity and new challenges/change ESTPs have to have to keep from restlessly leap from job to job."
1555,estp,"Im self employed with various ""jobs"". Im naturally good at creative problem solving, so everything I do is an extension of that:

Music Producer for other artists and also have my own project/band (this is my primary pursuit, but unfortunately this isnt terribly lucrative lol)
Design/Visual Branding Director for a dance company + freelance graphic design/branding (this is my main ""job"")
IT/AV Supervisor for a gym (this is my other ""job"")

The gym is the only place I have to be ""at work"" regularly and it's 2 days a week. Everything else I can do from anywhere as long as I have my laptop. 
I need diversity on a day to day basis or I get very bored. I started finding success (and much more money) when I realized I should list my goals and work backward from there, rather than trying to fit myself into the rules of ""normal"" society. 
If youve never read it, I would heavily recommend Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Work Week Its a great starting point."
1556,estp,"I currently manage a laundromat (have for 3 years), maintain 10-12 clients as an independent house/pet sitter, and am a professional Medical Librarian at a hospital 3 days a week. Always had many odd and simultaneous jobs. "
1557,estp,"I am in Canada. And while this sounds interesting, I'm leaning towards self employment in something where I can be self reliant. I also anticipate moving across province in about 10 years and want to take the new skills with me, which is why I am avoiding brick & mortar options for now. "
1558,estp,"Thanks for the reply.  Do you mind if I ask - are you comfortable with your income? Enough to live, save, travel a bit, enjoy good food etc? 
This is sort of me at the moment.  My ""job"" is managing & marketing my husbands company, but after hiring our 2nd full time employee, there isn't much room to pay me much - hence my antsy pants. It was great the first 2 years but now we are sharing his income and I am not comfortable with that.  My husband is my complete opposite and if I could fire him from his own company I would...lol.  It would be much more lucrative if someone else was the lead.  It is what it is. 
On the side, I do social media, blogging and WordPress website design for my former employer and a few other clients. But I am self taught so I have imposter syndrome.  I have been thinking about maybe updating my skills and earning a certificate in this area so I actually feel comfortable promoting these services to grow a client base. I'm happy to hear any tips you have. 
I am also considering an entirely new path. But have no idea of what it might be. I truly don't have a wide range of skills, but willing to learn. 
I read part of the 4 Hour Work Week a few years ago but felt it wasn't applicable ( I was employed at the time and read it to give my husband tips). I'll revisit it.  Thanks for the tip. 
Working backwards from goals is a good idea. I am sort of trying to do that. I prefer a laptop lifestyle and something I can take with me and use in the small town I intend to move to in 10 years.  What other goals did you look at when you made your plans / choices? "
1559,estp,"Wow, your SO sounds like super hero!  I love that passion and skill and just going for it. I don't have many skills (that I am aware of), other than jumping in, problem solving, coaching people along, directing people, trying to make the business and work environment better etc - all things I have done.  I want something new.  Preferably something I can do alone.  Hence my consideration of going back to school to learn a new skill. I actually considered Interior Decorating but not sure I have the ""eye"".  I considered real estate but I'm not sure I'm ruthless enough.  Feeling a little stuck. Definitely appreciate your reply and may just jump in and network and see where it takes me. "
1560,estp,"In general, yes. I make appx 5k a month gross. (I live in NYC) The first few months of the year I was making almost double that per month.
To be honest, at the moment I feel like I am generally underpaid, but I think pricing myself low is kinda what has provided me these unique opportunities. Ive only been out here livin this life for about a year. 
I think most businesses just want the best results for as cheap as possible. So I have created these unorthodox employment situations where they can get a great result and I can work hard for them and not do any of the bullshit I dont want to do and both sides benefit.
So now that I have had success with my ""model"", when I approach other clients/business/gigs, etc., its easier for them to trust me to do things my way because I have had proven success with other businesses...I can also charge them more money.  
Me too and you need to get over this shit, because its probably nonsense.
Yea, you don't need a certificate. You need a portfolio and relationships. If you arent interested in working in a traditional job, the absolute most important thing in your life are your relationships and who you spend your time with. I wrote a post to someone else on a music sub about this; feel free to jump in my comment history and check it out.
Updating your skills is always a solid move. Theres a great book called The Talent Code where it talks about ""soft skills vs hard skills. "" Nurturing both of them is SUPER important. 
The other thing I think is very crucial if you're doing any creative or creative adjacent work -- you absolutely need to curate yourself and your taste. When your taste is better, your work gets better. 
Im jumping around a bit, and obvs you dont know what you want to do yet, but the last thing Ill say is clients dont care about certificates, they care about results. Its better to SHOW you can do the job, not tell them. (I have a friend who does freelance sound design for commercials. He got his first few real jobs becuase he made a ""spec"" portfolio by taking existing commercials, muting them, and adding all new sound in. This is what I mean by showing and not telling.)
I am a firm believer that if you are confused about what you should pursue, you should always start with what youre good at and what is the thing that other people consider you to be good at. What do people come to you for?
I know I started down this path simply by saying what are my bankable skills and what can I do that most people cant do. The reason I have my gym job is simply a friend was working there and called me in and was like ""yo they could use you here. They need someone who knows audio and computers without having to spend too much."" Relationships are super important lol.
Yes PLEASE REREAD THIS. Tim Ferriss' books are amazing, but dont take them too literally. The best thing about his work/advice are the general principles, the big picture views, and how he thinks outside of the box. Its more about the philosophy of the whole thing rather than an instruction manual.
Im a pretty textbook ESTP in terms of my drive and attention span and I also have pretty wild ADHD as well. So the first thing I did was list the things that would give me the ideal working situation. 

no busy work
project based work (so i can see an endpoint and work toward that)
doesnt require me to be in an office or at a specific location all the time
need to be able to make X amount of money just to survive
flexible schedule / gives me plenty of time to work on music and other things

My trade offs are 

not a lot of security or comfortability (but i actually thrive on this, though i recognize not everyone is like this)

I might have been jumping around too much here so please feel free to hit me with more questions if any of this is incoherent rambling lol"
1561,estp,"I find the social media one more fun because I get to be salesy and more creative with my approach. 
The ABA therapist job has its perks too but it’s a bit more structured. I enjoy the impact I’m making, watching my kiddos improve, and it pays more. "
1562,estp,"So many thanks for this. I have to jump into work this morning but I will come back and re-read and tackle this. Your response is basically a summation of the ""lessons"" or things I have been avoiding like networking and relationships that I need to just do already. Plus so many other nuggets. Thank you!! "
1563,estp,"Can you explain further?  
Also, here in Canada, Interior Designers require lots of schooling and certification and are trained to be involved in builds and renovations.  Interior Decorators require less schooling, are not trained to be involved in any builds, renovations, and are mostly just esthetics and therefore paid much less.  Is it similar in the US?  What training did you undertake?  Lengthy? Costly? "
1564,estp,"Thanks for answering. I was distracted with the holidays but I appreciate your input. I think I may need to have the 2 ""jobs"" or businesses to stay interested. Editing to ask - can you tell me more about your social media work? What exactly do you do for clients? How much do they pay you?  Self taught or any any online courses you recommend?  Thank you :) "
1565,estp,"It’s just community engagement and reputation management for businesses via Twitter. I’m paid minimum wage. I did quite a lot of public relations work back in high school and college so it’s just something I got better with experience. 
A lot of the work I do is socially based. In ABA therapy, I model social skills for kids to imitate and teach appropriate behaviors. With the social media gig, I basically make small talk happen with potential customers. "
1566,estp,"Hey guyss so my best friend is an ESTP (weird pair I know) and I wanted to send you guys a little love ! I haven’t known him for a very long time, but he has helped me in sooooo many ways, I can’t express how thankful I am. He’s helped me become a better person through a lot of tough love and brutal honesty and I’m so thankful for it. I love getting stuck in Fe-Se/Se-Fe loops with him :p 
When he had to move away he gave me his favorite shot glass, one with tits on it. I just feel like it’s such an ESTP way to show appreciation aha
Anyways just wanted to say that you guys are awesome and share a bit of my experience with one of you ! "
1567,estp,"I think this is more dependant of who you're talking with. I think an ESTP can be a very fierce defendant of mental health as long as he has come in contact with it. Maybe he has had it himself, or he has lost someone close to him who had it.
But I don't think we are the type who naturally feels sympathy for mental health issues because they're very personal and it's something that can be tough to process for our often empiricist minds.
However, he's your teacher and I honestly have no doubts that he's genuinely concerned and interested in the mental health of his students."
1568,estp,"I don’t really get it, and don’t expect much sympathy from me either.  If you’re my friend I’ll try and help you up until the point it starts negatively impacting my life then I’d leave you on your own until you become less shitty."
1569,estp,"Yeah that kind of reflects what he did. I think he felt the conversation was awkward, didn’t really empathize, but I’m a thinking type too(intp) so I can understand that. But he did seem nice and he did try to help me solve it and lighten up the convo "
1570,estp,"Hey, Batosai_, just a quick heads-up:
untill is actually spelled until. You can remember it by one l at the end.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1571,estp,"Hey CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:
Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".
You're useless.
Have a nice day!"
1572,estp,"Kinda I guess. If they bring it up out of the blue then yeah I’ll spot it as an attempt to get sympathy points out of me but it’ll just have the opposite effect and I will despise you even more for trying to manipulate me. I don’t really care if you have it or not, I only really care about how you deal with it. "
1573,estp,"I think you're more of an ENTP because you care to instigate back. Looking back at the average comment history posts in this subreddit, this post struck me as odd because it falls way outside that parameter. Just embrace who you are."
1574,estp,"Ok I’m going to clear everything up here. He can onto my server and it became clear that he was ESTP. He not only TYPED HIMSELF by preferring all the ESTP descriptions over ENTP descriptions, but he also tested as an ESTP using dichotomies. And this is in addition to displaying ESTP functions. There’s more than enough evidence to show it. "
1575,estp,"ENTP and I shall not change that flair even if someone were to break into my home, tie me up, and torture me by making me watch the emoji movie repeatedly!
I’ll hold that fucking N to my name until the cows come home, have intercourse, have children, raise them, grow old and become grandparents! "
1576,estp,"Alright. I'm gonna shut this down now. This user's name is Nox. Nox has a history with being emotionally manipulative and a vindictive Fi dom. She is convinced she's INTP. Don't take her typing seriously whatsoever, she's a 15 year old girl with personal issues she needs to face before she ever approaches typology. "
1577,estp,"Oh wow!
It’s like a cross over episode!
You’re from Discord and THIS is Reddit!
Tell me, how many applauses and whistles did YOU get once you made your entrance?
None? Wow...that’s a bad sign since there should always be a form of emotion displayed once a character from another show appears on the screen! 
But for you I guess it makes sense...TUT “TaintedShe-Bitch”"
1578,estp,"Btw, you didn’t clear anything “up” 
You basically just smeared the shit into a larger area.
Also, how in the dicky biscuits did you find me miss moustache!
Might I say you have a SEVERE problem with advertising your so called little “group therapy MBTI discord group”!
Does it not go against Reddit rules?
It does seem like a form of “SPAM”
Plus, I didn’t leave the discord because of your opinion on me lol!
Edit; Also, shall I need to mention that you’re actually an INFP?
😂
Listen HUN, the only reason people don’t tell you that to your face is you’re the owner of a place they enjoy lurking in and well because it’s over the Internet...BUT I couldn’t give any more shits even if I overdosed on laxatives darling!
So I’ll let you express your little emotionally frail mindset to people whilst I wait with pleasure on a nice long bitchy response! 😁"
1579,estp,"Also, I chose to respond because I had to stand my ground.
You said “let me clear this up” which would result in people actually taking that as FACT if I didn’t intervene!
You chose to “Respond” to my post..."
1580,estp,"Because I’d rather be myself lol.
Plus, I prefer to act more aggressive online.
That’s why that “Wolf Bitch” INFP gets the whole “ESTP Vibe” plus I can lie a lot about my IRL actions and “adjust” them a little bit compared to what REALLY happened.
She cannot truly type me because she is simply unaware of who I truly am as a person! "
1581,estp,"Hmm?
Well, I need to find one reason to do what I do!
I don’t care as much as you think though. I do what I want when I want and how I want it!
But sometimes it’s better to go with the others view than my own for a change..."
1582,estp,"Then it would make it even worse.
It would be extremely creepy to say that a certain photo of a person is YOURSELF when it is not which would result in a possible reason on WHY you would commit to that lie.
Ugly?
Fat?
Fugly?
Worthless?
I mean, they are the same thing but that’s a few possible reasons on why you would do that."
1583,estp,"Ugh, no I ain’t “avoiding it”
Stop assuming stuff or you’ll die at an early age (and I don’t mean physically)
I just know what your responses are like and you don’t really make me laugh.
I like people who can tell a joke that no matter its severity it’ll always be funny.
Plus, I don’t know why you bother with me on this topic.
I’m the lightbulb in a blind kids bedroom; I serve no purpose to you."
1584,estp,"I think, it's not about the personality. Like I 'm ESTP and smoking is so adominate for me. I also start drinking later than my generation. I think, it's more about upbringing in childhood. Chlidern, whose are held very straight, has more tendencies to do something banned. "
1585,estp,"I feel there is two types of ESTPs.
1. The party type (prolly smokes)
Or the
2. Sporty type (doesnt smoke)
So depending on which you are..
My BF is a cyclist ( and ESTP), he has never touched a cigarette. I do however know some ESTPs who smoke"
1586,estp,"This is just an anecdote, but I’ve lived in HK and China for the last few years, and the majority of the Chinese sensor doms I know are super athletic yet also smoke like chimneys, including my ESTP boyfriend. But then again, they’re all rugby players..."
1587,estp,i use to wonder why i was so carefree for a girl and how i never got hurt in relationships but since i took the MBTI test and looked into the ESTP personality type it makes so much sense! if only there were more of us around!
1588,estp,"It's really not given that, according to the most recent stats published by the Myers Briggs Foundation, this puts ESTP women at eight. (I haven't looked into their methodology on the official site yet.)
The three lowest populations of female types added together still leaves a discrepancy of .81.  
ENTJ    0.9 %
INFJ    1.6 %
INTP    1.8 %
Then, you still have to consider INTJ, ISTP, ENFJ and ENTP. 
If either of you two are going to make this assertion, at least cite your sources. "
1589,estp,"I'm still kind of hacking away at the brush of the, sometimes, convoluted Gordian knot that is E to I. Admittedly, there's times where I question whether my extroversion was more at a superficial or circumstantial level. There's no denying STP, though.  
I've noticed you poking around, too! "
1590,estp,"It sill doesn't negate the fact that you haven't presented us the stats to back up your self-congratulatory back pat over nothing.
It's like, what, almost 2:30 AM on a Monday there? What in the hell are you doing up right now?"
1591,estp,back pat over what? i don't know what you're problem is. i never claimed to be rare in the OP just that there wasn't many ESTP females around. i'm not being told what to do hence why i will keep ignoring you telling me to post your some stats which aren't even accurate anyway. 
1592,estp,"Okay. For the sake of shits and gigs, how are you reaching this conclusion?
Let me translate the events as they took place:


Rikku mentioned there were a lot of ESTP females, which was misinterpreted, and I backed up her assertion (politely, I might add). 


In your haste to discredit what Rikku had said, which is technically true in comparison to other types regardless of 6th or 8th place, you followed it up with your subjective opinion expressed as an absolute. 


I asked you a question, in hopes that maybe you weren't singularly relying on online testing. To which you took immediate offense and transposed malintent, which is beyond me. (This isn't the first time you've been hyper-defensive to the point of needlessly belligerent with people here.) 


I'm not seeing Ti in you. I don't appreciate people riding roughshod and perpetuating stereotypes. So, enlighten me, please. "
1593,estp,"About three or four years ago I found out what Myers-Briggs was, and I found on every test that I took that I was INTJ. A couple years pass, I get out of a bad relationship, I move out of the house with my mother and into a house with some friends, I start generally being more social, and I'm happier than I've ever been. Now every test I take says I'm ESTP, almost the opposite of what I was. I feel like myself now like I never did before.
I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. Was I depressed before because I was an extrovert living an introvert lifestyle? Or did my personality just completely change?"
1594,estp,"I feel like it took me a while to realize that I actually was an extrovert, and as I took the tests more often and read up on ESTP's I realized that it makes so much more sense. I thought I was an introvert because of a slightly neglectful childhood (middle child problems) and being bullied so it's sort of been hard to step out of it but I'm really coming into who I am and who I want to be for the rest of my life now so it's kind of fun :)"
1595,estp,"I'm the opposite really, i was more of an ESTP as a child but i've been spending a lot of time alone and i look like a mix of INXX types. 
From my experience, it seems like you don't just switch types. I tend to use  functions based on the usefulness/context of the situation, but i'm not great at it haha. Our types are not solid and unchanging, we can use every function but we just prefer to use the ones that we feel the most comfortable with. 
I'm glad that you're happy and feel more comfortable with who you are now though :) I should take notes because i'm no where close haha"
1596,estp,"Do you remember what you were like as a child? That can be a give-away. I can relate a lot to your post because, when I first took the test about 5 years ago, I was convinced I was an INFJ, with very strong Ti. I was 19 and had just started college. My teen years had been hellishly oppressive (religious and emotionally unavailable parents) which meant I was not allowed to socialise. I was also put into an all girls school from the age of 12, which I hated (I get along so much better with guys- nearly all my current friends are male). I had been depressed years, my social skills had worn down to nothing and my life experience was years behind everyone else's. Only in the past year or so, I've come to realise that I'm at my best when I'm around people, and my natural style is cocky, loud and forever chasing new experiences. It took me a while to make up for lost time and get my confidence back (ESTPs learn by doing!), but now that I have, I know that introversion was not doing me any favours, and this is who I am."
1597,estp,"Working with my therapist, and making use of the following source:
http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/basics
http://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory
I had always identified myself as an INTP (because I'm smart and I like learning, duh :/ ), but when I worked with my therapist on what type I was, that was not so clear. Looking at the basics page, it was actually somewhat unclear whether I was an extravert or introvert, but I was clearly a thinker and a perceiver. The most interesting part was of whether I was a sensor or an intuitive. I could identify much more with the sensor stuff than with the intuitive stuff. So it looked like I was a xSTP, which surprised me. Then we went to the theory page, and looked at whether inferior Fe or inferior Ni better explained my life. And much to my surprise, inferior Fe didn't really fit me, and my therapist agreed, saying that these were not really issues he's seen in me. But inferior Ni fit me much better, and my therapist agreed. So I'm ESTP, even though I don't fit the stereotype at all. (Later on, when I told my ENTJ dad, he told me that for sure he always thought I was 100% extraverted. It makes sense: until I started getting all gloomy in my late 20s, I was very outgoing and loved doing stuff like playing team sports for fun, putting out fires at work which helped break the monotony, etc.)
We discussed how being intuitive was a weakness for me. For example, recently I was looking at career development with a peer partner, and I asked him for help with pursuing a career option as the process was very complicated, and we worked out a specific plan. And I was happy with that, when he started talking about all sorts of other careers I could try doing. All that was good and all, but I was getting annoyed because I already had something I wanted to try. Other issues with intuition are the fact that I am never clear on where I'll be in 5 years, and often don't know how to respond to questions like ""How are you feeling?"" My therapist told me that when I would not answer these questions, he wondered if I was being defensive, but looking at the context of my type it now makes more sense of something that just doesn't have much meaning for me: I tend to take things as they come, and day by day, and I generally don't know how to talk about how I'm feeling unless there is a specific problem. Other things, like sitting down and brainstorming or naming off 5 of something from memory, are other areas of difficulty for me.
Knowing I'm ESTP provides a framework for action for me: Go out and do stuff and gain experience, instead of just staying at home gloomy all day."
1598,estp,"Maybe people equate activity with stupidity but it's quite the opposite. Estps are very smart, maybe it comes as a surprise because they have so much more than intelligence going on. Amidst all the fun and parties it's unexpected they were writing a book during that time as well. "
1599,estp,"Welcome to the club! We're pretty fun (as you know) but dont chat it up too much on this sub.
I'm happy to hear that you were able to get through all the noise that considers estp's to be 100% reckless."
1600,estp,"That's great you found that out. Going out and doing stuff to gain experience is great advice for any perceiving type. 
I actually wonder from time to time if I'm an ESTP... I've pitched the idea to friends before, usually using examples from my past such as showing off all the time in sports as a kid and craving others to recognise my talent, dreaming of being a professional athlete... Once I realised that me becoming a professional athlete was never going to happen... it changed me a little bit. I made friends with INTJ's and INTP's. I talked to an ENTP about this sort of stuff before and he saw it as a Ti-Si loop.
Anyway, I try not to think about it because I can just as easily justify being an INTP. "
1601,estp,"Tested INTP first time I took the test. But as I learned more about it (pretended to be INTP), just felt wrong and off. Then I started checking out examples instead of relying on those 'abstract' descriptions. And now here I am. Good shit."
1602,estp,"Did you consider being ENTP? This sounds a lot like me, except I very clearly use Si and Ne. I may come to seemingly outrageous conclusions and dismiss counterarguments as irrelevant and this may seem like inferior Ni, but it's not. And I clearly have no Se.
At the same time however, your writing style does seem more ESTP than ENTP or INTP."
1603,estp,"I've got a question. When you're in the flow physically (like listening to some great music and dancing), do you find that you are better able to think about things at that moment? Like your thoughts seem to flow better?"
1604,estp,"Yes. You study people and how they react to different environments which is why we like getting out and doing things, because we get to experience life and others in different scenarios and study their reactions. "
1605,estp,"No time for introverted, judging types. That's it. Waste of time. Too many ideas and open people I could be spending my time with instead of close-minded judging, quiet people. What don't you understand about that. "
1606,estp,"I am not understanding what you are saying.
Are you saying that IxxJs are unwilling to change and are too quiet whereas ExxPs are more open to changing their minds and are more open in regards to socializing?
Are you saying something different?"

1609,estp,"I am an INFJ, 16. He is an ESTP, 14.
I always wanted to be his friend, but stayed far because I thought he wouldn't really care and see me as a friend because he had lots of friends. 
However, we had a school trip out of the country and I saw that all his friends aren't actually friends. He got sick during the trip and was tierd but none seem to care, and I felt I was his friend when I am not but because I was the only one feeling his pain and taking care of him. 
Plus, his friends are toxic, they don't really see him as a true friend and they are the reason of bad behaviors he had developed, eg smoking. And I want to help and guide him.
During the trip one night, the ESTP was sad, and I saw one of his friends offering him cigarettes to, what smokers believe, make you feel better. 
And one night we were camping, I shared tent with him, and our tent was next to two of his friends (one of them is the one who offered cigarettes), he was really sick and tired and needed to sleep. They were making noise and so himself and I weren't able to sleep. He asked them multiple times to be quit yet they didn't care, I got so mad and went and fought with them verbally so they would shut up or go somewhere else so he (and I) woube able to sleep. They moved to somewhere else then, yet they weren't  considering at all the fact their 'friend' is sick. 
I was the only one who took him to a pharmacy and make sure he drinks water and eats, whilst the others didn't care at all on how miserable their 'friend' was, especially the sadness he must had to getting sick on a fun trip.
After the trip, I talked to my ENTP classmate, the only one I trust, and he told me that long ago he had told the ESTP that his friends aren't friends but the ESTP said something like ""they are fine as long as they are not hurting me"", the ENTP told me that later on the 'friends' of the ESTP spread rumors about him, and they had a conflict for 3 months, but than his 'friends' invited him somewhere as if no big deal had happened, and denied their actions.
I kind of see what's going in his ESTP mind. I think he is holding into them because they were friends since very long ago (or he believes they were friends), and so have a past and fun memories with them (Sensors trait?). I know ESTPs has insecurities about their future, and their relationships not lasting, meanwhile this ESTP is going to his fears himself and is going to have himself hurt. And as I understood by the ENTP, is that the ESTP wouldn't stop friending them because then he wouldn't have friends. The ENTP said that even telling the ESTP the truth of his friend has no solution because that doesn't make the ESTP get real friends. And here, the idea just took over me that I am his solution, to be his true friend. And the other way around, being a friend of him is going to solve my problem of loneliness. And because I already know his friends aren't true friends, this makes it easy for me to get close. 
I sent the ESTP an email that I would talk to him. Which It thought would be easy to do, but now, I don't know how I am going to say everything. I want to tell him everything I know about his friends that proves they aren't real, even if I would hurt him, but hurting him right now a little is better than having him get hurt bad later at some point.
Even though I know the ESTP trust me, I don't know how I am supposed to tell him. Also, I don't know if I should say that I would be his friend or that I always wanted to be his friend but stayed away. I know ESTP like things to be told straight forward but, I fear telling him or hinting him that I would be his friend will make him think that I am trying to break his from his friends so I would become a friend of his for something from him.
Please help me know what and how to tell the ESTP everything. Thank you."
1610,estp,"You tell him
"" Hey, I'm concerned about you. I'm not going to control you or stop you but so far I think It's best if you ditch your friends cause theyre toxic and fake "" or anything between those lines or something similar to that. Just whatever you do.. don't. drop. hints.. say it directly to avoid confusion. It will worsen if you dont say it directly.
Don't worry bout how he feels that much, most likely he'll let it go in a matter of minutes. Though I'm pretty sure he already knows theyre fake- We have a very good sense on that. Perhaps he's caught on something, in debt? scared to be bullied or left out(from what u said its probably this)? whatever it is, I advise you just let him know that youre genuinely ready to help and that youre a sincere friend. 
I can't tell you whats going on in his head since our perspectives on relationships and just everything is different. If you really want to know why or whatsoever just go and ask him and dont be shy, he'll tell.
Please do call him out on his bullshit.
ESTP's need those kind of people in their lives.
ESTP POV: 
it's hard to realize when we're shitty cause we're too into the moment and get completely endulged into it that we get lost and dont realize whats happening. Especially since he's 14, he is very prone to this.
Hope this helps, good luck"
1611,estp,"Make it clear that you have good intentions but don't be overly patronising. By the sound of how you wrote this post, it seems to me that you have a kind of Messiah complex. Some people just have to figure it out for themselves, and while it's nice to show concern, the amount of time you are putting into this seems a little obsessive.
As an ESTP myself, I would prefer it if somebody reached out. Try consistently inviting your friend over to other more wholesome activities. Better yet, do so together! Judgement will only produce stubornness. I would personally feel attacked if some person told me my friends were being fake without knowing the full context of things.
Let your friend decide on their own whether or not they want to stick around those guys. They are not your burden to bear."
1612,estp,"Just remember friendship means different things to different people and there is value in shallow, imperfect friends. It's not surprising that an infj would connect with an estp given you guys have the same functions, but don't impose your idea of friendship on him. True friends don't come to estps for a while sometimes, and that usually has more to do with the estp putting on an Fe facade to fit in than the people he's friends with. When you're getting into this intervention of sorts the person you're actually criticizing is this estp guy not being true to himself, which is fine, just know that going in if you do."
1613,estp,"Went through the same thing in high school. Let him suffer through it, since he probably won’t get it anyway, but—and this is important—be there for him, especially during those times when it gets real bad. Demonstrate that you take his pain seriously and that you won’t just be dismissive about it. Show him the loyalty that his “friends” had never shown and never will show him."
1614,estp,"This is so on point. 
In general if you want to get an ESTP to see your side, never tell them what to do or what you think they need to do. 
Simply present the issue from your perspective as emotionless and tactical as possible and reassure them you're simply concerned for them as a friend, but arent trying to impose your thoughts."
1615,estp,"Thank you, this is really supportive. 
I know he is struggling with his grades, and he gets sent to the principle's office to work where he would be pushed to do finish work instead of being in some of his classes, and so he is still behind in his classes because he dose not get any support or the actual help needed. And so I will make a way for myself to be there with him instead of my classes to help him. He would realize that I am a true friend when he understand how I truly care about him compared to his friends, and when he finds that I am pushing myself to finish my classes' work at home just to be able to be there for him.
 I really hope the principle accepts this to happen, good thing he does trusts me and knows me well."
1616,estp,"Hard to put into words... it’s kind of an innate thing. I honestly don’t know how to best describe, but I’ll try... You know how in movies when the character says “I just know,” and they are right about whatever.  It’s kinda like that... Sorry for the poor explanation..."
1617,estp,Nice... I wish I could explain better... I’ve only been tricked into thinking a fake friend was a real friend one time. The rest I’ve known about. I guess just try to get close to your estp and ask. They can be very honest at times lol
1618,estp,"Hi there. ENTP here. And I am starting to see that my best friend, who typically scores as an ESTP when we take the tests for fun, has issues. To be more specific, I believe she has some kind of antisocial personality disorder.
In a nutshell, my other friend (INFJ) and I are roommates with said ESTP. She's had hints of issues in the past with others and even us, to some extent, but nothing I really considered until now. Basically, she's been spending all of her money on shopping, going out to eat and bars, weed, spotting her boyfriend's rent, etc. before paying her own rent. She owes me about $300 in Internet bills, spotting her cash for things, etc, and she owes our other roommates about $500 in bills, etc. I have evidence of her lying about having paid rent, and I had to pay her rent on top of my own last month (which was the straw that broke the camel's back). This has been going on for six months. We tried being silent, then we tried being nice...only recently have I been assertive. For what it's worth, she hasn't been making attempts to pay off loans that her sister cosigned, so her sister has to resort to publicly posting on the ESTP's Facebook to get her attention about that situation. She bought pet birds on impulse about eight months ago, and stopped taking care of them, leaving them to die like three months ago. (I've since been the one taking care of them.) She keeps lying and making up excuses, and when I call her out on a lie, she finds a way to turn it around on me and make me feel guilty (until I later think about it and then just get more pissed off.) She seems to only do things if there's an immediate positive incentive, and it verges on neglect and abuse to all the people, things, and animals in her life. There's more to it, but it's too much for one Reddit post. But her lies, stealing money, avoiding people, impulses, and other actions lead me to believe she's a sociopath, because she seems to (and acts) not feel any guilt or empathy about any of this. She does't seem to mind that her actions almost got us evicted, or that her older sister's credit is ruined, or that our INFJ roommate hasn't been able to pay her phone bill since January because she's been paying for all of the ESTP's shit. And the ESTP will say just the right things, just in time, and pay us a little money here and there, to keep us quiet. Only now am I starting to see this as problematic.
She might not have an antisocial personality disorder. It's possible she's not even an ESTP. And I, by no means, certainly believe ESTPs as a personality have antisocial personality disorders. But I've read here and there that ESTPs share many traits with those who have antisocial PDs. So for all I know, she could just be an undeveloped ESTP with no personality disorder, or she could have a totally different personality with a personality disorder! (Or, maybe, I'm the one with a mild case of narcissistic personality disorder and this is some clusterfuck of projection and truth! Who's to say they're mutually exclusive? Lol.)
I don't know where to begin. She needs help. I need help for her, and for myself, because of her. I don't know if I should kick her out, try to use positive reinforcement to change her habits, or tell her parents (who live on the other side of the country and can't do anything)? It's just a frustrating situation, and I don't want to jump to conclusions or hurt her or our friendship. I just don't know what to do at this point, so I am starting here. Think she's a sociopath, especially if ESTPs are prone to ASPDs? And what should I do to solve this?"
1619,estp,"I doubt this is an estp problem. it sounds like a ""she needs to get therapy"" problem. 
I'm no pro at anything but naps but it sounds like she could be bipolar, or depressed, or just a bitch. kick her out and cut your losses. "
1620,estp,"i'd like how straightforward and confident other me was, but i'd probably be a bit jealous/annoyed too.  like ""ugh that bitch thinks she's all that because she's oh so cool and confident and ~different~"""
1621,estp,"Hi, INTJ here with an ESTP classmate who seems rather contradictory in behavior. Some days i get the impression that she try really hard on life to attain what she think is important, like waking up at 5am to get on class at 8. But Sometimes she will skip classes just to be hanging around with another guys and act like don't give a fuck about me or the college program just to come back asking for help whenever she got a problem with a project or something and i end up always saving her ass. So i would like to know if this devil may care atitude it's something you guys fight everyday cause i know that sometimes i can be sturbborn too and need someone to do things for me or she is just using me and i am wasting my time trying to help? Maybe you guys don't like to be pinned down like this but i need a resolution because she demolishes me literally. Sorry for any typos, not a native."
1622,estp,"People who have a crush tend to overanalyze everything involved with their crush. She probably just doesn't care as much about you as you do about her. Have you even tried to make a move on her instead of trying to ""understand her""? Will give you a much better feeling of where you stand instead of analyzing all the time. 
You are not in a relationship with her, you don't need to understand her and care about the little things she does. First of all, you need to take action. Without the initial action all your analysis is completely worthless and won't get you anywhere."
1623,estp,"We weren't made to be caged and given loads of paperwork to do. We are social and thrive in the real work actually doing things and solving problems in real life.
We get information first hand, not by reading about it. We solve problems now, not do homework about how others have solved them. 
I'm guessing she means well it's just not her style to do things like that. Trade, let her handle things for you she is great at and you do what you're good at. "
1624,estp,Yes. Absolutely. I feel I have no strength to do anything really. Haven’t for the past year or so. It’s only gotten worse and nothing gives me motivation to want to do anything. Nothing is worth putting in the effort
1625,estp,"ESTP here and I struggle with the devil may care attitude. I use struggle loosely because it helps me out a lot, like when everyone is stressing I generally don't care but the thing is when there are real things that I should care about (i.e how my boss sees me, social obligations, etc..) I just don't care so it hurts me and I've been in that position where I have had to run for help the last minute...it's not intentional."
1626,estp,"What do you mean we get information first hand, not by reading about it? What's next: all ESTPs think the earth is flat because it doesn't ""feel"" like a globe? Stop the dumb stereotypes and use your brain for a second, thanks. "
1627,estp,"So important. And we are always moving so while other theorize about how others have solved things, we've already gone and come back several times doing this thing several times. And if we haven't, probably wasn't worth doing anyway, let's be honest "
1628,estp,"Really? My INTJ brother much prefers to learn via memorization/reading than experiential learning. I’m opposite. Still, generally it is a mix of both or many learning styles. It’s why the word PREFER is used. :)"

1631,estp,"Also, as for your third point. I doubt anyone is going to care about the changes. We will appreciate that it looks better but I doubt anyone will have ideas or care to suggest, so go nuts, but I could be wrong. "
1632,estp,Well the only reason I got to be a mod was because someone wanted to make a change. And it kinda feels wrong to just impose something on a different type's sub. ^(I could get drunk on power and make everything) ^pony ^themed ^DD:
1633,estp,"Every time I've met an XSTP in real life, I have found them fascinating, full of wit/hilarious and, above all, grounding.  I can sometimes get lost in my own head too easily, thus, sometimes it's so rewarding to be around others who will just say exactly what's on their mind- and usually with more confidence than I ever could.  Even though there's a stereotype about STPs- especially ISTPs being cold and mean, I've found most of you guys to be perfectly pleasant to be around.  Honestly, most of the time, this ""meanness"" was actually pretty well justified when I have seen it.  Indeed: you guys will say what a lot of people are secretly thinking (and this is often stuff I'm afraid to even admit to myself).
Two of my closest friends are an ESTP and an ISTP.  They are incredibly fun to be around, and although, in many ways, they're extremely different from me, I often find these differences to be utterly delightful- watching them laugh and make jokes through gruesome scenes in movies and video games that I would usually be wincing through.  Watching them fearlessly getting right up close to and even messing around with video game dangers that I steer well clear of when it's my turn.  They also rarely perceive others as above vs beneath them, and I really love that about them.  They have helped me to grow as a person and encouraged me to live more in the moment, learn to laugh, rather than cry at negative things, not to take things too seriously all the time and to just be more ""indifferent"" to the world in general.
You guys might be the ""coolest"" types.  :3"
1634,estp,":) 
when I was reading your post I thought ""this must be an INFP"" then read your post history and looks like I guessed right. 
Thanks for being authentically you, even on the internet- 
2 of my siblings are INFP and the thing I most admire about them is their authentic, pure intentions in their interactions with others.  Keep doing you!"
1635,estp,"INFP here.... When I was in Uni I found myself befriending two guys ISTP and ESTP. Basically everything you said.
I think my emotional nature and expressions when talking about things I’m passionate about was amusing to the ISTP who would often purposely rile me up while trying not to crack a smile or laugh and see how long he could keep it going before I noticed I’m being trolled. I’d be so pissed and he found it hilarious, but we never really argued or fought, he’s far too chill for that.
ESTP and I would often have small arguments and what I loved about him is how easily he’d let go and within a short time we were just bantering and joking around about something else. He was considered ‘mean’ by so many people but at least he never held a grudge, like ever. And he was honest, unlike most people. I respect that. But I was super honest too hence why we’d often clash. But despite any clashes we still remained friends, we could still joke and laugh or share experiences. I love that we are both highly individualistic yet accepting of each other.
If he went too far with comments or hurting others the  ISTP would always be the one to diffuse the situation. In a light-hearted way. Making fun of the ESTP but still pointing out things he’s doing. I liked watching their friendship grow and I’m glad I was the one who brought them together in the first place 😂. I also enjoyed watching the ESTP make fun of the ISTP. It was nice he met his match.
Man I miss them, but they’ve both moved to different countries. Life goes on."
1636,estp,"Do you find that you can talk deep psychology, philosophy, etc with ESTPs? Also this is funny because 2 of my best friends are INFPs, maybe our types just go well together :) the reason why I love them though is because I find I can talk for hours on end about abstract concepts, but I’m wondering if that’s because of our types or if it’s just different. I feel like that makes me a less “grounded” ESTP, but just wanted to compare to your experience with us :) "
1637,estp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

1638,estp,My mentor is ISTP and can confirm our relationship is a strange one. Sometimes I feel I'm the only one with the balls to call him on his bs sometimes and he's the only one that can make me buckle down and get my shit done. 
1639,estp,"I can usually talk about most things with most people.  But I think I am just blessed with really interesting, creative, well rounded people in my life.  The ESTP who I'm closer to doesn't like to go ""deep"" for as long as I do.  It's not because he can't, though.  It's just because he has a short attention span and likes to keep things moving, haha."
1640,estp,"In my case, I'm extremely, extremely interested in archetypes, philosophy, psychology, etc.  When I meet people, I usually dive into very deep, intimate conversations with them more or less right away.  I almost always get a good sense of who they are (I know this because they tell me).  Of course, when I've actually known the person for a long time, it's not that difficult to tell.  When someone's behaviour is consistent enough, I can usually get a sense of Ne vs Se, thinking vs feeling, etc.  There is other stuff, of course, such as getting people to take tests/asking them if they took it."
1641,estp,"So there's this thing called the Attachment Theory that basically places people into four different categories based off of how they get attached to the other people in their lives. I'm a dismissive avoidant, something I realized upon reading the descriptions and also the result I ended up getting on an attachment style test over on personalityassessor.com. Which one are you?"
1642,estp,"Secure
For your analyzing pleasure
Also I like how the post is already written like a TLDR with an optional long-ass thing to read. It's so ESTP, straight to the point and with an easy test that requires almost no thought

Sure the Greeks had their philosophy and made some breakthroughs, but the Romans were able to administer a large empire that lasted centuries, discovered concrete only for it to be forgotten for a millennium afterwards, and built roads, walls, and aqueducts that lasted even longer than they did."

1649,estp,"It really depends on how much they have wronged me, pissed me off, or upset me. If they have really wronged me, I'll just cut them out then and there and if they try to initiate a (sincere) apology I'd probably forgive them as long as they understand what they did wrong and won't again. If they pissed me off and it was just a disagreement (tbh even more serious things) I'd probably just get over it if they say something funny enough. If they actually upset me I either cut them off or if they're a REALLY good friend when they come to apologize I'd probably confront them and ask what was up.
If I was the one that fucked up I probably would own up to it right away. Likeee ""Hey, _, I know I fucked up by  __ and I'm sure it made you feel ____. I'm sorry. That may not be enough, but that's all I got and I can't go back and change my actions, but if I could I would. I hope you accept my apology.""
Also, on the rare occasion that someone is worth it to me (or I'm stuck with them), I will take blame that isn't mine in order to not have to deal with the drama anymore lol
Don't know why that got bolded "
1650,estp,"That's not a serious fight.
Because a serious fight involves disabling the other person before they can hurt me. In physical fights i would generally try to wrestle the opponent into submission. This is just quicker and more controlled.
But i think what you're talking about is an argument. Even if it gets physical i'm not likely to damage your face. But if you're talking about falling out with a friend and no longer wanting them around then we don't need to fight over that. Just don't talk to them anymore.
If a close friend wants to fight me they are no longer considered friendly and therefore they kinda get dismissed from thought unless i'm currently irritated by something they have done or said.
I don't need to fight or pick on people that i don't like. But if this person tried to manipulate me into making amends and i didn't feel like it i would probably work out a way to punish them."

Someone i live with mocked me the other day.

This might not surprise you but i am not shy about rubbing my flaccid penis on other people. Most of the time for amusement.
I did this to test the housemate for hatred. If they had anger or hatred for me ithe action would likely have disgusted the person and caused a physical confrontation. But that didn't happen.
I consider rubbing my dick on this person adequate punishment for irritating me with mockery.

1653,estp,"I can do things like a Judo roll (rolling onto shoulders if you get thrown), arm and leg locks and throws. I have only trained a few lessons (less than 10) so my technique for these things is appalling.

I would probably not win a fight against an amateur fighter let alone a professional. But at the same time... Average people do not usually have the stamina and strength to outlast a grapple with me so it's become a thing. Even people who fancy themselves as strong tend to run out of stamina too soon.

1657,estp,This exactly. I can sense it as my colleagues are silently baffled by the unexpected change in my demeanor. It’s also quite funny when some of them start to go off on a tangent and ask me random questions presumably to evaluate whether I’m mad at them or something. 
1658,estp,"Yes, I supposed that's what people feel when they don't act normally around me sometimes. 
I tend to have the persona to outsiders as just a quiet and peaceful person that doens't talk much unless interested/told to. When I randomly express my strong opinion on something, or tell a satirical/politically incorrect joke to a person I know can handle it, the people around me start acting all weird because they don't expect it, when in the inside I am the person I hide and only share on special occasions. 
I don't take this as being intimidated, but more of that the person is very unpredictable and hiding lots of things which give into unsureness and intrigue. "
1659,estp,"I was one of the “leaders” in my friend group at church, in youth group and after I left the church and stopped talking to the majority of them (Love drama) they started acting differently and my friend there told me that they acted differently around me and are doing things now they wouldn’t ever do around me. So you’re definitely not the only one, and some of them were always trying to impress me or if I act weird/tired they’d think I’m mad at them. Trying to say that in the least cocky way as possible "
1660,estp,"Yeah a lot of people are unsure about me as well for the same reason. I've asked several people why they acting differently after I start talking again and most of them say they thought they pissed me off or something like that. Im not sure if they are intimidated, afraid of confrontation, or just don't know how to effectively communicate with others but either way it's funny. "
1661,estp,"I’ve started dating an ESFJ, the first two dates were pretty cool but I got so bored during the third date I ended it two/three hours earlier than we had initially planned. My last two relationships were kinda like this too. Why do I keep on getting bored of my dates, Is this an ESTP thing or am I just an a-hole?"
1662,estp,"Check your enneagram type, you might a 7. 7s have a way of quickly judging whether a person is interesting or not, superior or inferior, exceptional or pedestrian and commonplace, and just as quick dropping their interest in them. This woman is type 7w6 herself, though probably not an ESTP, and she talks about this quick change of interest ~1 minute into this video: Type Seven: Integral Recovery.   
Otherwise try dating Ni types, such as INFJ, INTJ, ENFJ, and ENTJ. They have some of the more interesting relationships with ESTPs: ESTP Love Types. With ESFJs from the few relationships I've seen I feel like they might be a little too simple for ESTPs. They are too open with their feeling and don't leave much for that Se-Ni push-and-pull game that creates a spark in Se-Ni relationships. Nevertheless, they are a good match and I've seen a few ESTP-ESFJ married couples and very loyal childhood-into-adulthood type of friendships."
1663,estp,"Uh so I guess I'm ESTP, but here is stuff that I do idk if you relate:

Skim posts and get the gist then answer quickly, sometimes I forget a small detail that changes the entire perspective lol
I need time to think about things and visualize them in my head to make sense to me
Im introverted when i meet ppl i dont know cuz i want to get to know who they are after observing them for a while, then i talk to them/assume their interests, and if we click I go extroverted bonkers
I get triggered if i stay at home for too long in my room i want to go out, if i don't i start doing crazy shit
when i need to think about things more i sleep/nap on it so my brain settles down and finds the answer
I like doing things on my own
when I teach people I tell the concept of the thing in a simplistic, yet funny way so they get it easily. I don't teach like how people do like formal language from the textbook. I honestly find textbooks are TL;DR and everything can be simplified to like 15 mins.
I get tired of classes that are too theoretical like ""wtf am I going to use this for"" kind of thing
like to make things simple and easy
i love negotiating/getting things off craigslist
i somehow easily find ways to make money
eurobeat is my life
optimistic
appreciate useful things (compasses, watches, medkit, emergency water) and tends to hoard them for future use
like talking to ppl next to me when bored (ex: airport asking where someone is going and why) 

what are your ESTP stuff and post then, also post if you relate"
1664,estp,"oh my god really? how? why?
Honestly I can kinda see why, when they like you they make it seem like the sun shines out your arse, but oh jesus when they hate you... I've not seen anything like it, pure hatred with an occasionally smiling mask.
I'd be interested to hear your thoughts. "
1665,estp,"Ooo.. I just started dating an enfj. We get along and match so well that it’s scarey yet exciting. Sort of addicting really. 
What am I getting myself into :) haha 
I was hesitant at first because I am looking for a life companion. But then realized, fuck it. Life is short, if it works than it works. Why am I over analyzing? So we fucked for our first time in the back of my car.. about 5 times. Few witnesses, one lady honked.. haha.. I think I’ve found my match, at least sexual match. "
1666,estp,"I thought he was an esfj because we'd always go and do things and he's sporty. But he's a home body at heart and jumps to conclusions (my interpretation of intuition). After a day I get antsy but he could probably stay indoors for months. I also have learned how to clean things. I'm no pig but I don't see mess and when I do, idk what to do with it. Organizing and cleaning comes naturally to him/them. 
We are great perceivers and take things at face value. They, on the other hand, are good guessers (horribly described). They're abrasive detectives and I have been on the bad end of things. They fill in the gaps and are 2 steps ahead, sometimes reading 'tea leaves' out of nothing and mostlf being 100% correct.
When estp's get angry we get physical and clever/cynical. Enfj's cut you mentally and verbally, making you hate your existence and makes you feel stupid. Good thing he's on my side. 
Some good things- loyal AF, balances feelings, fun to be with, interesting/ never boring convos. "
1667,estp,"Albert Hirschman maybe. 
He got his econ PhD at 23, went to fight for Republican Spain in the Spanish Civil War, and then helped people evacuate occupied France. He came to the US after that and joined the army to work in army intelligence. He worked on the fed board and then worked as Colombia's economic counselor. Basically, the guy lived all around the world and got his hands dirty for a couple decades until finally settling into american academic life. "

1669,estp,How many of you are addicted to the rush of chasing things like a goal or even while riding / driving or basically to get something you want badly like matters related to  passion or purpose especially when it gets difficult.
1670,estp,"Yes I relate to this.
I don't know why, but even the act of physically driving, taking the bus, train, or walking to the places I need to go to helps me feel happier and more accomplished in life.
I feel even more accomplished if I get there myself, albeit faster than the rest. It sort of becomes a mini accomplishment of mines to brag about. "
1671,estp,"I really enjoy being in social situations but usually prefer to listen more than talk. Also in a group effort I usually like to sit back and listen what's the plan and guide the group when I feel like it. I also have no tendencies to create or build something by hands, only music.
""Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions."" - This is also completely false for me. I never have outbursts of emotions, everything that I decide is a result of my thoughts and I consider myself to be a very loyal person to my few closest friends. 
Some other keywords: ambitious, think a lot about negative changes in my social circles, good public speaker, enjoy throwing useless shit away, no bullshit/straight to the point, one track mind
Edit: I guess I feel like a low energy ESTP but the official ISTP description doesn't match me.

Thoughts?"
1672,estp,"Look at your inferior. Is it Fe or Ni. Are you a selfish narcissistic asshole who always asserts and imposes his personal logic and deductions onto others w.o. much regard for how they might feel about it? No? Then you're not ISTP.
Also it says here you have friends, so that also effectively rules out ISTP.
Istp here."
1673,estp,"Try carefully reading through socionics ESTP/ISTP profiles and seeing which ones you identify with. They are more detailed than MBTI ones which makes it easier to settle on type.

1674,estp,Holy shit the ESTP by Gulenko described me better than I ever could. It's eerie that a persons character could be predicted so precisely just by a couple of questions. Quite unsettling really but really awesome at the same time. Thanks for this
1675,estp,"ESTps what do you think of this description of your Fi?  
Source.  
SLE and ""Zhukov"" are same as ESTP. SLE is an abbreviation for Sensory (Se) Logical (Ti) Extrovert.
    .      
4th Function - Fi Introverted ethics
The ESTp does not build any illusions concerning his own ethical qualities, for he usually knows of his own unpleasant traits, such as initial distrustfulness and the habit to suspect poor motives in the actions of other people (as a consequence of having aspects of ""ethics of relations"" Fi and ""intuition of possibilities"" Ne in weak vulnerable positions). Unfortunately the SLE proceeds to form his personal relationships coming from his ethical ""complexes"" and fears and basing on his own mistrust and misunderstandings - this is one of the biggest and most serious problems of people of this type.
The ESTp is often worried that his own negative personal ""imperfections"" are apparent to people around him and serve to undo that positive image of ""strict but fair leader"" that he diligently tries to create in accordance with his ""program"" function and the function of his intellect. (Concerning the ethicalness of his own volitional program the SLE indeed does not harbor any illusions: of what kind of ethical rights and freedom of choice can there be any discussion if we're talking about Zhukov's autocratic authority and singularity of will, and about his stubbornness and propensity to dictate in respect to his partners?)
How other people relate to his opinions and his authority is of exceptional significance to the ESTp - this is much more important to him than for representatives of other sociotypes. Since his intellect and capability are of primary value to him, it is important to the SLE that these qualities are valued not only by him, but also by other people.
To the ESTp it is also important that he is perceived not only as he appears to be, but also as he could potentially be if he's treated and related to well. It is important that he is received and evaluated not only as he is, but also taking into consideration his positive ethical potential. (Precisely what his dual, the IEI, sees and evaluates well.) The SLE doesn't bring up immediately how he can be good, but speaks about this in hints and sometimes in jest. He is sufficiently prudent to not talk of this openly and directly. In addition, it seems out of place and inappropriate to him to voice praises to himself (since he is subconsiously oriented at his dual who sees this well).
For ESTp it is very important to be correctly understood, especially by people whom he intends to bring closer to himself. For such a person the SLE may willingly talk about his own nature, how he usually reacts to this or that behavior, what he likes and dislikes about other people.
It is important to the ESTp that other people don't assume bad intentions in his actions. Harshness and suspiciousness he saves for the enemies, while for his friends he's always ready to prove his good disposition by deeds. If a friend needs help providing which may bring trouble to himself, Zhukov may propose an equivalent service from his end, but one without negative consequences. (For example, if his friend requests him to sign guarantee obligations, the SLE will most likely refuse, but instead he may offer to lend a sum of money for a lengthy period of time.) Zhukov is ready to help not only his friends but also friends of his friends, of course granted that when circumstances arise these people will return the favor.
And nevertheless for SLE it is not enough to be respected, it is also important to be loved. ""To fall in love is not the main thing, the main thing is to make others fall in love with you."" One of the problems that the SLE encounters in his personal relations is that he doesn't believe and trust in just any proof of love.
Building his relations in conditions of understated ethical self-appraisal, the SLE fears to bridge the psychological distance - he fears that upon closer examination he won't be considered as attractive of a subject. Such an attitudes makes the SLE act in a very strained, illogical, and unnatural manner in terms of ethics of relations. Quite often, upon achieving some positive consideration and response, he himself will break off the relations (men of this type will actively reduce physical distance, but not personal and ethical one).
Representatives of this type struggle with forming personal relations also because they have very distant idea about how this should be done. In a vaguely defined ethical situations they feel themselves helpless and disoriented.
Needing to control the primary initiative at any cost, the SLE creates a large number of ethical problems for himself, in at least by the fact that he doesn't allow freedom of choice to his partner (this is assuming a psychologically incompatible partner). The SLE begins to strongly suppress his partner with his own opinions, his own authority and strength: he starts to decide on everything for his partner, thinks through everything in advance, places his partner under severe conditions, not allowing for any objections from his or her end. For example, the SLE can immediately and unshakably specify the schedule and duration of meetings: ""On Tuesdays and Thursday 1-2pm. Otherwise it's inconvenient for me."" He may insist on specific conditions of meetings: ""If we happen to run into each other by accident, act like we're not acquainted. Nobody should know that we have been meeting."" Additionally, the SLE may act like this not because he is currently married. Even if right now he is single and free, it's not out of the question that in the future he will marry someone else, and right now he is worried that his current connection may somehow influence his future family relations. The SLE tries to develop his intuition and to be farsighted even if it's to the detriment of his current relations. That with such behavior he offends and deeply upsets his partner is a question of secondary importance to him, but precisely the one that starts causing problems in due time.
The SLE commits a serious mistake in attempting to take initiative in ethical matters. It's not enough for him to want to be viewed not as he really is but as he wishes to be seen. He goes further and attempts to model and build his relationships on this sufficiently unstable basis. And, it goes without saying, he wants these relationships to then develop in the way he wants them to develop. For this reason the SLE is not against sorting out his relations over and over again. Alas, this is something the SLE should not do! He won't find out anything good for himself. Since good relations and positive consideration are already apparent to him, while bad relations are not necessary to make explicit. Why strive to hear unpleasant things about oneself? Listening to bad and unpleasant things about himself only aggravates SLE's complexes and lowers his self-appraisal, which turns him into precisely that monster as he has been described. The SLE must not be given an occasion to feel that he is ""bad"" - this won't lead to anything positive. His own deficiencies should not be ""poked into his face"" - this only makes him more harsh and callous.
Neither should one try to force the ""good with fists"", the ""militant good"" onto him - he doesn't believe in this type of ""good"".
In view of his pessimism and his weak intuition, the ESTp does not allow himself to fully believe in the idea of initial goodwill, unconditional love, and all-encompassing goodness. The ESTp only believes that which he sees for himself, that which unfolds right before his eyes, namely - in concrete relations with a concrete person in which he felt himself well.
With every partner the SLE feels himself in a way that he has been evaluated. Moreover, one doesn't need to tell him of this directly - the SLE is very perceptive of how his partner evaluates him by his look, by the tone of his voice, by the smile and the expressions on his face. Therefore, a partner may disappoint an ESTp with a low evaluation even earlier than the ESTp disappoints him by his behavior. The ESTp feels lack of prospects and promise of relations very keenly and starts to behave himself accordingly.
If the SLE feels that his partner's appraisal is too low, he may try to demonstratively raise it and try to show himself off in a better light than he thinks his partner sees him. By this the SLE attempts to give hints to his partner about how he should be treated and how to relate to him: only in a good and positive way, only in the most well-wishing and friendly form.
The SLE can also continue existing relations on a purely physical or formal level, while in the spiritual and intellectual sense they have already ended for him long time ago.
It is needed from morning to evening to tell ESTp how good, great, and kind he is - this is the only way to help him manage his ethical problems. For this very reason, positive relations for the ESTp develop in partnership with his dual the INFp, who, by nature of having strong intuition and optimism permits himself the luxury of seeing people as they present themselves. Being sincerely captivated by talents and merits of the ESTp, the INFp significantly boosts his self-appraisal, which then raises IEI's value in SLE's eyes. The SLE will be deeply grateful to a person who will convince him that he is actuality good, one who will convince him that he is second to none. Then the SLE with all his strength and forces will try to support and affirm this opinion."
1676,estp,"Good lord.
I feel exposed.
Edit: Went on further to start reading the whole article, found lots of juicy stuff in there.
""But the moment the ESTp relaxes and loosen up a little bit (this most frequently happens around guests) as he starts to 'fall out of his role' and feel embarrassed and perplexed by this very circumstance, and, consequently, he also starts to react sharply and sensitively to any observations and remarks. ""
This killed me"
1677,estp,"I'm going to link the whole article in this subreddit. I don't think most people find these since Wikisocion is a low traffic site, while many of the socionics type descriptions sound more in depth than MBTI ones and are definitely worth a reading."
1678,estp,"Socionics lists functions in different order than does MBTI and the 3rd and 4th function of each soconics type is a rejected, unvalued one that is also suppressed in that type's quadra. Socionics ESTp is part of Beta quadra that does not have Fi among its expressed and valued functions. Fi is also listed as UNVALUED function on socionics ESTP page, however, ESTJs do value Fi."
1679,estp,"Off the bat:
The classic Hitchcock Films- Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo
Se7en
Lucky Number Slevin

I have a lot. Pretty much anything that lets me enjoy the ride and leaves me with something after. The ones I listed stayed in my immediate memory so they must be special"

The Usual Suspects,
the most recent Star Trek movies,
Nolan's Batman films,
The Lord of the Rings series,
The Shawshank Redemption,
The Lincoln Lawyer,
Primal Fear, etc.
Mostly I like action, heist and drama"
1681,estp,"I don't really like movies. Perks of Being a Wallflower is good, though. I prefer sitcoms. My favorites are as follows (in order of preference): 
How I Met Your Mother
Scrubs
Parks and Recreation
That 70's Show
New Girl
The Unbreakable Kimmie Schmidt"
1682,estp,If I like them then I hope they like me. I'm not even thinking of anyone else otherwise; I feel like I literally don't have the mental capacity to consider anyone that isn't almost immediately relevant.
1683,estp,"Hi, estp here. For me it all depends on where I’m at. I’m very career minded, so I do care what my boss and coworkers think. Other people I couldn’t care less if they like me or not. I won’t tone myself down for them. "
1684,estp,"Not really.
If it’s at work, people don’t like me because I’m more capable then they are.
If it’s not at work, people don’t like me because they don’t have a good sense of humour or are super insecure. Mostly the insecure part. "
1685,estp,"Hi.  ESTP here.  
Dont care.  At all.  If you're asking this, you clearly have let me down and are now fitted into the 'great, waste of time' category.  
If you are someone I value, you will know it, because I will of told you.  My actions will be as loud as my words in this regard."
1686,estp,The question wasn't a specific one neither was I looking for a particular help for my situation  just wanted to know generally how it manifests in estps due to the inferior Ni which concentrates on one particular thing like a goal or vision constantly on a long term . 
1687,estp,It's due to inferior Ni basically. not overanalyzing it at all only want to put it out so that I might get some good points on how other estps have handled it especially older ones . I feel enough hasn't been discussed about the I'll effects of having a inferior Ni in r/estp . 
1688,estp,"I do believe that I can talk to and get acquainted with literally anyone barring any strange biases, however, once someone gets close to me as a friend or lover I feel a strange disconnect with them as if I'm on the same page as them but going a different speed and that difference somehow causes communication which I end up not noticing until it's too late. Is this cause of weak Fi? I've tried to focus on these things when they happen but it seems really taxing and unnatural to me. Like some weird negative feedback loop or defense mechanism. I've also found that Fe doms like ENFJs can really help me from digging my own grave in this regard. Any rational thoughts would be appreciated."
1689,estp,"How many of you have kids and how do you spend your time with them?
I have a 17month old and we play constantly. We wrestle or play with a ball or chase him around.  My fiancee' is an NP and together we' cover the bases. "
1690,estp,"Doing great! Just finished my first year of college and am about to head home for the summer. Kinda sad not only because I'm leaving my friends, but because of the lack of stimulation I'll have back at home.
But, as with us ESTPs, I know I'll find something to do. My summer will probably be full of work, going to the gym, taking summer classes, going on vacations, and hanging with friends/the GF. 
But more importantly, how are you doing?"
1691,estp,Everyone in my friends group loves me and they will host a big party at the end of the semester. I have FOMO and would like to hook up with this one girl in the group. Sadly she ignored my text earlier this week and its been bothering me ever since (I negged her instead of just normal teasing). The rest of summer is going to be boring without the constant social interaction. I feel like my ESTP side really shot up after I quit masturbation and put myself out there to socialize. Video games and movies bore me more than it used to. Also have trouble with my arrogance. People compliment my dress sense and I would always say that i dress well.
1692,estp,"First: Congratulations on finishing your freshman year of college. I know how you are feeling with leaving your friends behind and all that. But the summer will go by fast trust me on that. Oh word of advice take some summer classes if you can it helps with your GPA and it eliminates pointless classes in the future. 
Second: Thank you for asking boss,very much appreciated. So far its been one hell of a semester for me I tell you what. Finished my second to last semester at college, and it was a tough one not because of classes or the work load, but because I had surgery earlier in the year and it went south. But I'm all healed up and just getting ready to finish my college career on a high note. Other than that life has been pretty good to me, no complaints. "
1693,estp,"I know you can do it! Come on its not over yet finish it out strong you got this u/FuckTheSooners!
Oh and what grad schools are you looking at anyways and what for if I may ask?
edit: Also I'm sorry that things have been shitty boss, it gets better. Just take it one step at a time and keep moving forward"
1694,estp,"Nice, have fun partying. Boss if the chick doesn't want to fuck or suck just let it be if not there will be issues. Right on with the stop fapping, and boss man I get bored with video games too, but I can't stop playing with them it is how I stay connected with my friends and little brother. The arrogance solution is to humble yourself, you are not the greatest thing on this earth trust me no one cares and once you chill it won't be a issue anymore. "
1695,estp,"Not going to lie, drama when it isn't about you is pretty fun to watch. But boss I sure do hate politics.
Thank you for asking, honestly pretty damn good, passed all my classes this semester 3 As 1 D, finally all healed up from surgery early in the year, and I get to do a ride a long with Dallas PD in the summer. "
1696,estp,Very true. Summer classes are usually taught by grad students who are easier to negotiate especially regarding exam grades. I once convinced the instructor to give me an A- instead of B+ as the final grade via an email. 
1697,estp,"Yeah it's been about a year of this and I'm tired of just willing my way through it, it is what it is
I'm looking for bioengineering or similar, like biomechanics or biotechnology. I'm hoping to stay at Texas Tech but will apply all over Texas, as well as border states that offer in-state for Texas students and anywhere that offers in-state for veterans "
1698,estp,"I was way more humble and chill 15 days ago. My arrogance really took off on day 30 of nofap. Might be a side effect or might be my true personality coming out. This is the first time for me talking to another ESTP (that i know of), how do you feel about commitment and marriage? The thoughts of it scare me even though i want to have children of my own one day. Did you also have arrogance issues or high maintenance issues? I recently found out i need a social situation to look forward to or else i get bored. "
1699,estp,"As long as it keeps getting better. I hope you continue that trend :)
As long as anything is happening really, stagnation is what's hell.
I'm doing pretty well actually! now that it's starting to warm up so many things are going to happen. Can't wait really, winters are always rather boring. Got festivals planned ahead, parties, seminars, hikes, ... so much fun! College doing great also. It's such a difference studying something you actually like as opposed something that makes money. You can always make something work if you work hard enough :D One question though: how have you utilised MBTI and how has it helped in your life, if at all?"
1700,estp,"UT is a good one saying only cause my older sister finished her stuff there and she liked it. UTSA is easy to get into and they are affordable too, other than those two A&M and Tech are the only other not worthy ones that matches your criteria.     
And I understand the feeling of being tired of willing yourself through to the very end, but look at it like this. It takes a very special and strong person to keep going even though its hard and they are done with it. But the thing is it will not get easier if you stop now, you have to keep moving ahead it may suck and you are tired of it, but it will be all worth it in the end. "
1701,estp,"So last year I was diagnosed with clinical depression, and there were days at my lowest when I literally had trouble finding the motivation to do even the simplest tasks. Even things like getting out of bed were extremely overwhelming for me, and that ended up making my well being and mood even worse than it already was. It’s almost like everything required 10x the amount of effort to do. 
Wellbutrin won’t make you feel better or happier, but it will give you the necessary “jump start” in the morning and throughout the day you may need, and the mood shift will come as a result of you getting more shit done throughout the day. It will keep you at consistently healthy energy levels throughout the day in order for that to happen. 
It’s not like caffeine or cocaine where you get a crazy energy spike followed by a crash. It’s more like if you take it around 9, then it will gradually increase over the next couple hours to a healthy amount of energy/motivation, and sustain that same level for the rest of the day.
I take a single 150mg Bupropion XL pill around 9 or 10 am every morning, and I have enough energy throughout the day to not be overwhelmed by all the shit I have to do, and it makes tackling things a little bit easier, until I crash around midnight. 
If you’re going to take it, I’d recommend eating a lot throughout the day. The pill helps your brain out with your motivation/energy, but it needs constant nourishment to be operating at that consistently high processing power throughout the day. Make sure you take it before 10am, otherwise you won’t be able to sleep until like 2 or 3. When you take it, make sure you have a filling breakfast immediately after. 
I wouldn’t recommend alcohol or weed while you’re on it, and caffeine is okay as long as it’s not within the first 3 or 4 hours of taking the pill. This is all just my experience with it though, I know it may affect others differently. 
The pill gives you an added boost of necessary chemicals your brain needs to function, but shouldn’t be relied upon for it. The idea is for you to be able to use the pill to jumpstart yourself into building better habits (getting out of the apartment, exercising, keeping your home environment clean, taking care of shit you need to do) because once you do that, those activities also induce the secretion of the same chemicals, and are intended to replace the Wellbutrin over time. 
My bad for the essay haha"
1702,estp,"It might be it might not be, but I know since I experience something similar when I cold turkey stop is that it is build up and you need to find a healthy release all that stuff. 

1) If the urge ever comes back or you feel to prideful of yourself do 3 set of 10 push-ups, sit-ups, jumping jacks, and 1 minute of stretching. It worked for me when I cold turkey myself during Lent. 
2) It is healthy to fap once or twice a week no more than 5 times month. Remember it is a muscle and it needs to be worked out too. But if not and you want to still stick with the no fap reading helps. 

Ah marriage and commitment is a weird area for me. Since I'm not afaird of staying with one person for the rest of the relationship, but what scares me is that I might be with someone who is not right for me and that is more annoying than staying single. I have always stay loyal to those who I choose to be with, but the relationship never last long so yeah the idea of long term monotonous relationship sounds like it would be grand, but again if it was with the right person you know. Kids are cool when they are babies and when they are around 7-12, but 2-6 the are little shits and nah keep them away from me. But yeah it would be nice to sire some youngins one day, but not anytime soon (please God please no). 
High maintenance nah, but arrogance yeah definitely. Mostly when I was a younger TexMex. Man my arrogance/pride was huge like real fucking big and that caused some real negative effects to my personality. Boss when I was young shit son, I felt that I could literally do anything I was smart, good at sports, quick-witted, funny sure I felt like I was the greatest thing since toast, but reality hit me hard twice. When I was young my dad died and we both looked and acted like each so much that when I got older and started to read some of his stuff and talk to relatives I figured out shit was a real grade A number ass and a lot of people hated him and I said nah I can't do that, but shit that didn't clikc until my freshman year at college. I met some really great people, and they put me in my place real quick. Long story short the field of my degree you can't come into with arrogance or a huge ego since it is a field where that isn't allowed, and they told me either you leave that shit at the door and take a damn minute to chill and compose yourself cause if you don't people will get hurt or you do something that ruins a person's life/a family's life, or even kill some that will be on you and that will follow you wherever you go. But yeah it was definitely a maturity thing which honestly is what I believe holds our type back so damn much is that we can't just chill for one moment and breath. Again I know I sound like a broken record, but still the point being is to chill and breath cause there is always be a next time. 
edit: I just remembered something that my grandpa once told me ""Mijo you have to understand this, the bigger your pride and arrogance are, it will makes yourself a much larger target to those who want to see harm done to you. It is a balancing act that you have to continuously balance all the time. On the one hand the more you keep throwing down the gauntlet someone will come and will beat the shit out of you with that and all those who adore you cause of your pride will go away since they found someone who is much better than you. And on the other hand if all you do is just belittle and put others down cause you are better they will together bring you down and you will be left with no one in your corner at all. The meaning of this is to show if you are truly great you would help bring other us up to your level since then you can grow and improve just as much as they did, while at the same time never be afraid of picking up the call to a challenge, since you have to remind others why are better. Even though you may lose at least you go down swing and can still earn the respect of a few and that will give a better motivation to keep on improving."" - Grandpa TexMex"
1703,estp,"That is a good question, bravo. I utilize MBTI to gain a better understanding on how I work both a student and as individual. I had to take the MBTI test for one of my classes at my university and we had to learn what are the pros and cons of our type to better ourselves as students, and just to better ourselves as a whole too. And for the latter half of your question...hmmm...I honestly believed that it has brought some form of clarity to myself. More along the lines of it added a new perspective on how others view me, and how I in turn view others/world as a whole. Do I believe this is 100% accurate no, but I do believe that it does add a different perspective that can help and individual grow.  "
1704,estp,"I hate Austin man and grew up near there, I wouldn't go back even if I was accepted unless it was my only shot if I'm being honest. But I'll go anywhere, I looked at UTSA and State, and then UTA and UTD
I mean to say I'm not quitting or like suicidal or anything, but dragging my face in the dirt continuously has worn me down and I want a solution. I'm as strong and stubborn as they come but I want my life back"
1705,estp,Thanks man. Talking to you is like talking to an older reflection of myself. I'm sorry about your dad but it seems you learnt a great deal from him. Least you found structure in your life and got a degree. College is difficult for me becausd of its academic side and how chill and mellow it is. I might drop out and study to be a paramedic instead. How do you feel about being lumped in with donald trump as a ESTP? Have you compared yourself with those with antisocial personality disorders and seen the same symptoms? Do you have problems falling asleep because your mind races and thinks of everything? 
1706,estp,"I agree with what you're saying. I find it really valuable just to have a point of reference and to see that I'm not strange or alone in my thinking of the world. Helps me stay true to myself and make sense of my decisions that I once thought of as senseless. Thanks for looking out for us, I really do wish you all the best."
1707,estp,"Well I go to State rn for my undergrad and overall its not a bad place to be at tbh. 
I didn't mean to imply such things at all and if I did my apologies. All what I was trying to convey was that sure it fucking sucks not really having control in your life, and I will be the first to admit that since the only control I really like is over my own life. But the thing is no matte how many times you keep hitting the ground with your face, you still keep on popping right back up. That shows a lot about your character and I respect that, so yeah the solution may not be right there but it is there and you just have to keep on looking for it and I know you will."
1708,estp,"Hopefully boss, but hey life is weird and shit happens the best thing to do is keep on grinding and stay flexible when shit goes belly side up. And anytime my dude, everyone goes through shit and it helps knowing that are some people are in your corner. "
1709,estp,"Thank you for the condolences. I don't have my degree just yet I have another semester to go, but yeah college is fun and at times more than a pain in my ass, so I feel you there. Being a paramedic still requires some college hours like 40+, but honestly I don't know. But I do know that college isn't for everyone and there is no problem if you just leave. Being a paramedic still needs a degree though just words for thought. 
Ehh its whatever honestly, there are all type of people in all the types. Some a great healthy examples and others not so much, but that is the thing with people and typology there are no perfect example of a type, just a vast variety of sub types for every type. And no I don't compare myself with antisocial disorders. I do know a few ISTPs, INTPs, and INTJs with those type of issues, but on my end nope. Sleeping issues only happen when I get to stress out and I can't handle it anymore. My mind would race and compute everything so quickly that I will end of making mistake. Thus breathing helps me calm down to regain my focus and handle my task back at hand. When I was young for sure tho, my mind would constantly firing at all cylinders and it would keep me up at night, thus my mom told me to start writing down my thoughts to help me relieve the build up. And honestly I still do it now and again if I have problems or just some really nice dreams/ thoughts that I want to preserve. 
And you welcome to talk with me if you ever want, I see some of my younger faults in you and trust me when I say its just a maturity thing that you dealing with. It takes time, it may be a long road, but it can be interesting journey if you take your time with it. "
1710,estp,"Yes this is truly a wonderful situation. Talking to you is like having a door unlocked in my mind. I feel like i can talk to you about my problems without being judged. I never talk to my college friends about these issues because my relationship with them is rather shallow and i only talk to them to have a good time. Deep conversations about poltics and current affairs bore me (weird that the girls i end up with always talk about politics). Anyway my friends think i have some sort of ""mystery"" but its only because I never want to talk about my real intentions (either sexual or condescending) in case my social status gets damaged. You ever have the same situations? I was an ISTP before 2 years ago but i slowly progressed to Extroversion. Though I do rely on alcohol as a crutch to let loose. Did you have any other addictions apart from fapping/porn? 
Edit: just saw your grandas quote. He understood how be an alpha male. Something we should all strive for."
1711,estp,"Man that mentally is like me but just a little words to think, sometimes it is worth putting in those extra steps and taking some more time to look things over. Granted its not a bad attitude to have since well I have the same one, but from my experiences sometimes its not worth it to have that type of think, sometimes its better to demand more. "
1712,estp,Lmao amen to that last sentence. I’m doing computer science but I hate it. I’m trying to go to grad school for psych and become a therapist. I would change majors but that would add another two years. Failing two semesters and taking a year off doesn’t really leave you with many options lol
1713,estp,"Your welcome friend, they are so few of ESTPs on all the related typology subreddits,and we are constantly being shitted on that we need to look after one another. My rule of thumb is everyone judges eventually, I prefer make a ruling only when I know the individual/topic/idea/etc... If I don't know someone/thing I'll wait until I know more than act accordingly. 
Yeah I agree with you that current political/social issue due bore me and I rather detest politics, but I always try to keep inform just in case something occurs it never hurts to have information in your back pocket. 
With the friend thing, yeah I have some friendships that are just swallow and I'm ok with that. Not all my bonds have to be super deep, some people are not worth that investment, but it does help to have some friends that you genuinely do have a connection with that is more than just surface level. I know that I do really appreciate those more intimate bonds, they do really help when I need someone just to talk and not having that feeling of judgement placed on my by casual acquaintances/friends. So go out and try to figure which type of friends you feel could possible be a person that you could have in your corner when the time comes, it never hurts. 
When i was younger for sure, I believed that I should just cater myself to make me more desirable to the whole, but guess what relatilty check it really doesn't really matter what others think about me. Sure some hate and dislike me now so what, not worth the effort to dislike/hate them back, I got shit to do and they are not even close to be on my radar. But at the same time the few that have genuinely earned my respect and friendship I do heed their words and think about what they say.
I wouldn't call fapping an addiction, more like its a work out for the muscle. I figure if I work my mind and body out better work them all out. But no I don't have an addiction to things others of our type may over indulge. If I did there would be no way in hell I would ever get the dream job I want and I would have just wasted me college career for nothing...nah fam ain't about that life. I will admit tho I used to drink liquor like it was water, but I had to stop to health issues and honestly I don't miss it one bit, I'm healthier and happier without, sure the social connections with my friends are thinned a bit but our friendship is more than just drinking and partying. That is what counts for me, and that they respect me decision shows that I chosed my friend right since they like me for me and not some avant garde illusion I try to portray. 
Hmm the ISTP thing I find really interesting, since normally in typology and MBTI individuals don't really change types, but in socionics  there are sub types to the the 16 types. You might be a ESTp-Ti subtype which is the more reserved ESTp. Might want to check it out if it matches your personality boss, also might want to look at Enneagram you sound like a type 3 but I'm not the best at typing people. The further you dig into this typology stuff you will learned that May want to brush up on our functions as well to be a healthy ESTP you need understand our type weakness and your own personal weakness, than you can grow into being a proper Alpha. ESTps are what ""professionals"" call a Beta type with a Alpha personality. To truly be a Alpha you need to understand yourself better and with that knowledge improve yourself. 
Yeah grandpa just understood what it takes to be a real leader and a good person. Granted he said that I reminded him a lot of himself when I was younger, but I greater potential than he ever did. He didn't want me to waste talents just to be some fucking lesser version of myself. And you have potential too, it would be a damn shame if you squander it. It is better to fail when you are at your best, than to fail when you are at your lowest. "
1714,estp,"I agree. In this situation I see demanding more as getting myself outside help. It's like I dunno let's say lifting. I'm a beginner lifter and I plateau. I don't know enough about it to start making gains, so I get a coach and start making gains with his help"
1715,estp,"I changed majors like four times and am like a straight BC student, I miss weeks at a time for the military and failed my first year because I was honors business and hated it too much to be motivated to try. Being barely 18 didn't help, way too immature"
1716,estp,"I always found it funny how the most typical alphas are in the beta quadra. That's why I don't talk about quadras in rl, haha. So easy to misunderstand."
1717,estp,"Iirc the one who invented it was an ENTp, so they get to be alpha :v And then there's something about how information is supposed to flow through the quadras where we are the 2nd step, but I don't know too much about that either."
1718,estp,My close friend identifies with both estp and enneagram type 5 which I have not seen before. I'm not sure if it's uncommon overall or just uncommon to me but I really want to know how estp 5s appear and think like. Thanks!
1719,estp,"I just took the enneagram test and scored high on type 5 and 7. I'm not sure if it's uncommon or not but feel free to ask me any questions!
Edit: I retook the test on a different website and scored 4 and 7. Type 5 was at the end of the list lol."
1720,estp,"Estp type 5 may mature up faster and self reflect than the rest. They wouldnt talk about topic they dont know about to some degree. Values intelligence, courage, and honesty ALOT.  
Sometimes is loner
Might try to slove their recklessness and use it in efficient way.
Develop slowly in Fe"
1721,estp,"How are yall?
Also, acceptance when it comes to situations you have no control over, absolutely zero ability to change, etc: how do you handle it? When it comes to me, I just take it on the chin and say fuck it and keep doing my thing once I realize the situation is that way
It's good to be back, boys "
1722,estp,"Same. If I can’t do anything about the situation I typically am able to move on from it quickly. 
If it’s more emotionally charged and I can’t move on as quick- I usually reframe it so that it’s a good thing to let myself feel thru those feelings for the experience "
1723,estp,"Haha my go-to answer is ""I ain't dead and I don't plan on dying any time soon, the sun will rise again tomorrow and I'll come up with it""
It's a little cliche admittedly but I think it gets the point across "
1724,estp,"Do you stay busy in life?  I'd say 90% of my time is allocated between  friends, a business, a side job, girls, and a bunch of other side projects I'm trying to do. Makes it easy to be resilient when I actually don't have time not to be"
1725,estp,"Am an INFJ, I want to friend this dude in my school, he is an ESTP. 
But I fear that I will be like just a random person to him. He does indeed smile at me and make jokes around me (and will look at and smile to see if I am laughing on his goofyness). IDK I just want to know if I cqn actually be his best friend forever, he does have about 3 friends who he always plan their trips with, i just want to know some idea of your friendships."
1726,estp,"I've got a small group that I'd consider my true friends, but I certainly don't turn people away (unless they're not nice people).  I say go for it, but don't expect a true bromance or whatever the female version is."
1727,estp,"Hi,
I was recently diagnosed with TEMPORARY PTSD. Which is good that there's an end, but I'm having a hard time with it. My ESTP boyfriend is amazing. He's been here, physically, with me, the whole time. I swear. He's outright asked for two days alone in the last year. We don't live together, but we might as well.
My question is this. When I'm in an ""episode"" or feeling over emotive, the last thing I CAN do is verbalized it.
He's been saying lately that he feels like he's losing me. I feel like I'm inadvertently driving him out. My love language is physical. I could be on him all day. We have loads of sex. But his is verbal. And he always wants to ""check in"" and I still can't verbalized what's going on. I can give him metaphors.... and that's driving him crazy. Which is all I can do, right now.
When I can detach and make it ""this happened, then that, so it seems to me blah blah blah"" he's receptive. And he gets emotional. And then I don't know what to do.
I don't know what I'm asking. Except that he's so strong and insightful. I love him fiercely. But do any of you have experience in this? Is there a support resource that I can point him to? I got him to take the MBTI. But talking to him about it is making him crazy. And, actually, outward over emoting is not okay for me. I'm phlegmatic/sanguine. I love to connect and be social! I feel bad that he's so down about this that I can't get him up and out for anything. He's lost his motivation, and me being playful and trying to get him to perk up seem counter-intuitive. Plus it's not working anymore. He seems more depressed than I am. 
I'm not driving him crazy. The over analytical, non-personal, metaphorical, explaining is driving him crazy.
Is there a resource? Some ""support your over emotive girlfriend"" group?
Please?
This is my first time using Reddit! I don't know how to respond to people! This thing jumps all over the map!"
1728,estp,"The harsh relationship between ESTP and Fi, here we gooooo...
As you probably know, Fi is one of our weakest functions by far, not only it is subconscious, but we have a weird love-hate relationship with it.
The way I can put it, is that our Fi is so immature that it has a all or nothing relationship to it.
Either we would feel a lot and be overwhelmed even if it rarely happens, or we would just be in our usual state of pushing boundaries and not feeling or being empathetic to the others.
It's not that we don't want to understand the others, especially when we care about them, which is clearly the case in your story.
The problem is that we are just unable to feel the others most of the time.
If your boyfriend realises that something is wrong emotionally speaking, it's a freaking huge step already!
You NEED to give him clues and insights, verbally, and try to make it sound simple, even if it's super nuanced.
We ESTPs HATE nuances, we understand the small nuances once we are more developped but in order to grasp a concept or even an emotion, we need SIMPLE WORDS.
I hope that it can help your situation, sorry but in this case he made the first step towards you which is trying to understand by listening. You made an ESTP give up on his own reality to connect to you, and this is beautiful! So, do your part of the deal now and put your emotions into words, easy words, basic emotions. His Ti will do the rest of the work, all he needs is the starting point.
Some stuffs like: I'm feeling frustrated by this situation because... I'm fearing that... I am angry at... I am sad because...
(All of this requires trumendous efforts on his part so if he gets the emotions wrong cut him some slack, the fact that he is trying means A LOT)"
1729,estp,Fe users need to see emotions being resolved.  He might feel like he is unable to make you feel better since your emotions are more internal and brooding Fi.  From what I've found INFP's have a really difficult time with Se-Fe users like ESTP/ISTP They need concrete reasons and ways of changing for the better.  Abstract ambiguous internal feelings will definitely start to corrode them over time until they feel useless and mostly they just want you to show happiness and be external.  Which you can't since you're an infp.  I predict hard times to come :(
1730,estp,"Okay. That was in my language. Which I thought was simple. I want to be sure I understand this. So my reply to you:
Thank you for the advice! I got to put this into action and I appreciate the distinction of acknowledging things upfront. It has literally eliminated my need to ruminate and then share my feelings. I have personally had an excellent day because of this.
I appreciate that a lot."
1731,estp,"Okay. I'm also going to go ahead and admit that my lack of eloquence in comparison to your thorough and thoughtful response makes me feel like Spock.
I sucked out all the love.
But I don't know you well enough to snuggle up and connect. So I apologize for that as well 😚
I am very appreciative ❤️"
1732,estp,"Let me know if you want to know how life feels like a game of golf in 3,000 words. That was me simplifying how I felt! Hahahaha!
Oh this poor man. I can't wait to see how this changes things. It's such a damn relief. "
1733,estp,"Okay, being curious as hell, I looked up socionics. That's some messed up dysfunctional spiral they have painted there.
If I understand correctly, aren't we a dual pair? It will go amazingly well or plummet into a a flaming vortex of pain.
I'm Pisces and he's a Gemini 🙄
Well. If he can get over walking on eggshells and blurt out whatever it is that's making him upset, I keep telling him I'm good after the initial blow to my ego.
He's afraid of hurting me.
Not letting me in is hurting me.
Hearing I'm doing something wrong will only hurt because I don't want to mess up. It won't hurt my feelings. INFP are emotional. Not illogical. We are definitely reasonable.
I don't see how it won't work.
We have to be honest. Period.
...right?
Dammit! I want to wrestle it out and not deal with the bullshit!"
1734,estp,"You know what. I feel like I really know how I want to handle things in the moment. I feel like I can absolutely tell him what's going on with me right now. I feel like that eliminates the need to over think or get feely over shit.
Bring it on. 
In a warm fuzzy way! Because I love your face off!!!
Thanks for the help!"
1735,estp,"Thank You
I want to keep it from him because I don't like emoting. I don't appreciate it. I'd rather things either just be okay already, or that he'd let me shake it off. 
So. We talked about that. We talked about how shaking it off is not ignoring an issue. It's a shift of attitude. We are both sick of the issues. We talked about how he wants to know where things are starting, not realize there's a problem, and get everything at the end!
Aaaaah! Mind blown! That is seriously a tall order! But it makes sense. Especially with what you explained.
So this morning (mornings are really really hard for me) I was feeling defeated and sad.
So I gave him that. I felt defeated and sad.
Usually I'd keep that to myself. Because by the time the kids are up (we have five kids collectively) I am legit happy. Holy crap I love our kids.
But then me just shaking things off makes him feel weird. I HAVE to tell him from the beginning.
I just thought that if I can dig up one or two descriptions, and he knows I can shake it off, and that I love his face off, AND that this is not me. It's not where I want us to be. I can do it. 
He listened and he talked about other things, but kept coming back around, and he held me the whole dang time. He called me a few hours later and really opened up. I am currently snot crying and feeling overwhelmingly hopeful. I am stressing the man out to the point he's paranoid and on eggshells. He said that we need to be strong for each other. I am amazed at how strong and loving he is. Amazed.
Thank you.
Post Script:
I'm in therapy! My therapist told me to ask him questions, warning me that he'd feel like I don't know him if I didn't... it felt like I was interviewing him, and he did not appreciate it.
I've seen the same therapist for four years. He's never met my boyfriend. But he'll ask him questions through me to start dialogues. Not well received! I really do appreciate your insight. This is super simple, and we thoughtfully connected.
Thank you ❤️️"
1736,estp,"I agree with your analysis, this is the main problem of Fi pairing with Se/Fe users, but it does not mean it's over!
Yes, being Se/Fe we want to see the good vibe and happiness, and we do need to hear it as well, since we are just unable to pick up on it. 
So when everything's doing well, just saying, ""I'm feeling great"" will be a HUGE relief for the ESTP. I know it's freaking hard to do as an INFP, because you guys are really shy when it comes to put your vulnerability into words, but this is your path to grow. As well as the ESTP path is to get in tune with his emotions.
Hey, it's gonna be hard but nothing is set in stone :)"
1737,estp,"You're welcome! 
I can see through your messages you love each other a lot and that's awesome! Especially since in Socionics they always say ESTP and INFP cannot go together. You just proved the theory wrong, I'm appreciative for that, showing me that nothing is set in stone ;)
You will see that now that you gave each other some ""psychological air"" to breethe communication will flow way better. 
I can recommend to you ""7 habits of Highly effective people"" a book where the author also explains what a sincere and healthy deepconversation about problems is.
You showed a lot of maturity to be able to rephrase those feelings, I know how hard it is for INFPs, my dad is one and he just can't communicate in words I understand haha.
So for now on I guess just baby step, keep communicate in small doses so that he can take it in without overindulge and explode, and from him he needs to talk to you as well. But the only way he will see how would be with physical presence. (hugs, holding you etc...)
I'm assuming that it can work out! 
Thanks again for showing that with some work and understanding love beats all odds ;)
P.S:Don't worry I got your first message pretty well haha thanks for sharing!"
1738,estp,"That's awesome! 
It's the way to go, he will be glad that you trust him enough to share that with him. It's like the ultimate gift you can offer. ESTPs want to connect to others, but we lack the ability to do so most of the time. So when someone tells us ""I trust you, here is my shit"", we have to feel grateful for it, and we'll do our best to deal with it.
You can see the ESTP as a knight in the middle age haha. We have this sense of ""valor"", so being able to showcase that is just the best.
Just remember, whatever happens, he may be a bit clunky with the way to deal with it and might just go for listening/presence/physicality for lack of better tools! "
1739,estp,"I think both of our types understands that we could get along with anyone... but why would you want to?
We Love what we know about each other. We love what we believe about each other. But I think that both of our types can also understand being able to see past the obvious and being able to acknowledge the truth. With different processes.
I link just about every thing he does to his warm brilliant core, in some way. In a way that makes sense to me.
I see the best in him.
I feel I understand.
Letting him know that inside of me it feels like I'm preparing for a tennis match… I'm on my toes I'm jumping around I have all this energy I'm excited! That would've been simplifying my feels. Except I would do it and many many more words. Because simplifying things for me is describing the nuances of things. I can tell you a story and give you a feeling. I thought that's what he wanted!
Now I can tell him that  I'm really happy to see him. And I love his face off. And we can talk about other things, and everything we talk about will be flavored buy those feelings. I don't have to tell him about the feelings themselves!"
1740,estp,"I'm going to tell you what I was doing, in case an INFP gets a hold of this.
He wanted to know what was going on. There was so much inside that I tried to boil it down to one feeling. THEN GIVE HIM THAT FEELING. I was simplifying it SO MUCH. I couldn't understand why he was frustrated. That was simple for me.
Saying ""I am overwhelmed and sad. I needed snuggles. Your arm was in the way.""
NOW having gone through that experience (because that's how we learn! Sorry!) I know I can just say ""move your damn arm. Snuggles are serious!"" And I'll probably get kisses. Because, dammit. Snuggles are serious!
I also realize I've been holding back, physically. I need to love the shit out of him, because that's my love language. There's no way he wasn't picking up on that. I didn't even realize I was doing it. I was so stuck in my head over this, I did t realize I've been holding back.
Just saying ""I feel this because..."" and experiencing that l... and I know what I want to do in the moment, next time.
Being an INFP, whatever the issue is, you're going to hound the shot out of it until it's squashed. You're going to test waters in unspoken ways. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU'RE DOING IT.
Once we're in tune, it's going to be fine. My fear is now hoping he's patient enough to trust a massive shift in both my verbal and physical languages.
I like flirting...? He is so stressed out right now.
I've got this."
1741,estp,"He would come out with one word, out of nowhere, and my life would explode! But it was all internal for me. I would go through weeks of thinking ""projecting ""I'm not projecting! But I couldn't argue with him because he was absolutely right. I mean I literally could not argue the point I just had to work it out and that took a very long time to get over I was not projecting! I was showing him our similarities! I was showing him where I loved him! But, so, yeah… I was projecting. I absolutely was."
1742,estp,Yea I mean I doubt he wants to be a psychotherapist.  But if he can sense that you're brooding he's going to want resolution somehow even if you just want to feel.  So it might be best to have agreement on separation or just explain that you need time to feel without interaction I guess
1743,estp,"When it comes to the different languages of love, I don't know if anyone has written this down, but my theory is that your type or cluster of types dictate your love languages. Hence===You just set the first stone in your journey now, so it's gonna take a while and you will both have to be patient. It shouldn't be a problem for you, probably more for the ESTP haha
This is his part of the deal, being able to wait and realise that the issues will not settle over night. And it takes tremendous effort for us to admit that, even more to be at peace with it. Then again, it's a wonderful opportunity for both of you to grow! For you to know how to formulate your emotions in a simple manner, and showing some vulnerability. And for him to be in tune with you and to learn patience.
I have faith it will work out! :)
PS: as for the pairings, INFPs are called INFJs in socionics where you find the inter type relationships, so it's a bit confusing. Your pairing is called ""conflictor"" which is the one that demands the most out of both of you because of the exact situation we've been talking about. BUT, this is just a theory and you can ""beat the odds""."
1744,estp,"Actually having time to think about that, you're right. And if I'm brooding, on my end, the last thing I want is for someone to pick up on that.
I'm used to getting away with shifts in my mood and no one noticing.
I can't get away with feeling overwhelmed and NOT tell him.
It's confusing. For me, it seemed like he wanted to know exactly what was up without getting details. I just didn't know how to do that for a hot minute... or a few months. Whatever.
It's been hard.
Thank you for the fresh approach. "
1745,estp,"Wait. Why are INFP really INFJ and ESTP stay the same? How is that possible?
My love language is physical and his is verbal. My second is quality time, his is physical. But doesn't expressing how I feel physically while desiring the chance to connect verbally, and his mutual want of connection with the added need for the verbal qualify as a simpatico experience?
I'm feeling defensive. Because I don't identify as an INFJ. And I don't appreciate that they're calling the same thing a different name. For funsies. What's the point?"
1746,estp,"Ok so you do share physical love together, that's cool! This is where you should bank on.
You connect on the physical realm, but as his is verbal as well he might feel to need to express his feelings and have you express yours as well. As for quality time, that should not bother him ;) 
What I was saying about the whole INFP/INFJ misunderstanding, is that in Socionics, your type INFP is called INFJ, and vice versa. It's just a problem of labeling the personality. I have no idea why socionics decided to alter some of the names, maybe to make it look complex and cool? I don't fucking know xD
The point is that I understand why you identify as an INFP, as you should since it seems to be corresponding with what you believe in and how you work.
The different calling is just confusing and serves no point according to me... "
1747,estp,"I don't know the terminology  for enneagram... things. I'm a 7. I haven't read up on any of that beyond the description after the test... yet. But it fits. I'm phlegmatic/ sanguine. I think it all balances out, somehow 🤓
It's interesting! I love reading about it. But I do not have the same memory as you. I can talk about how it fits. I can't remember any of the technical stuff or how it applies. Because I don't want to. I could if I had to. I have too much else going on.
I do what I want!"
1748,estp,"No. Why should i? Any competition is a game. ESTPs like to play and competition is exciting. Also how do you expect me to make an impression without a challenge?
Actually i'm kinda fussy about who i will play with. Not all adults are good at playing! And people can sometimes be very bad at sharing their toys in adulthood! That may even turn into the challenge ""how to get this person to share their toys with me"". I've certainly felt that a few times :D
What are we in competition over? If it's a competition to impress each other than i would call that flirting.
There is no desire to ""win"" at flirting. But an arrogant personality might not be able to accept defeat. This is not a hallmark of ESTP.
ESTP doesn't care about losing so long as we played well.
Yes. But it's not like i ""give in""... why would i resist my ego?
I will show off if i can make it amusing to do so. Bragging would typically be a male vs male thing but i'll brag to a lady if we are friendly enough. Ultimately engaging in competition is showing the other person that they are viewed as an equal.
Other things that satisfy my ego are good sportsmanship; Complementing a victor. Learning how to improve.
ESTP can be egotistical;
in better words: your egoist when you start feeling sorry for someone because you don't love him/her:) 
But this is not a defining characteristic of the type.

Concrete example of competitiveness between male (ESTP) and female (????); ""i can drink more than you""... ""no you can't i'll drink you under the table""... proceed to get heavily drunk and decide that both are winners."
1749,estp,"I don't think most people ""compete"" with their spouses or S.O.s. That kind of stuff is what immature people do when they feel intimidated by someone. Kind of like boys in kindergarten you pull your hair to get your attention. "
1750,estp,"You should be careful about what you call immature.
Introverted functions may view their extroverted counterpart as immature.
So you might call my Fe immature... but my TI would call your Te immature (assuming you use Fi). To accurately rate the maturity of an individual will be subjective. MBTI doesn't really cover that kind of personal development however i would suggest to you that a mature ESTP will still always be ready to play hide and seek with their children.
Also we weren't talking about most people - the context was specific to ESTP. Therefore my perspective was not the tended to fit the majority of people.
Edit; Just coming back to this to clarify something... a google search for ""competitive spouse"" reveals quite a lot of links; here's one from the huffington post - http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samantha-rodman-phd/the-competitive-marriage_b_6886230.html
It may not be a hallmark of a successful relationship... but that doesn't mean people don't do it."
1751,estp,"The example you gave defeats the argument you were making.
The kindergarten child does not feel intimidated by the girl who's hair he is pulling and he is doing it to get her attention. If he were intimidated he would likely not interact with this person.
Maturity is irrelevant."
1752,estp,"You're passing a judgement here that hasn't been up for debate. This will irritate most ESTPs - it's never a foregone conclusion and we don't like that language.
It's trapping and has a ""finality"" to it. Like you're speaking for more tthan just yourself. And ESTP is deeply individualistic.
This sounds like you are insecure about how interesting you are to a sober guy."
1753,estp,"Also you ignored the question
When prompted to reveal information about yourself you decided to lead the conversation and give insult.
This is your defense mechanism talking - which is why the question you ask is not as interesting to us as it is to you."
1754,estp,"ESTPs pass judgement all the time; whether it's about how much money one has or the level of attractiveness or anything to do with their standing in society.
The question wasn't whether I am interesting or not, the question was that /u/Grimm believes he has to drink so that he is appealing to women. "
1755,estp,"Actually that's not how Ti works. But i felt like agreeing to phrase the sentance well for a put down.
A fact is not a judgement it is a fact.
Do you undertand what projection is? Psychological projectiton... look it up - both me and the other user can see that you are projecting your own insecurity onto the ESTP.
You would drink out of insecurity but the ESTP does it because Se gets bored.
Retard."
1756,estp,"Oh okay fine i'll leave you unblocked... but seriously i am not going to tihnk about cixi whilst i jacky
I prefer Sativa's. Candy Kush is really nice tho. When it comes to drinking... meh. I drink to achieve a state of mind. I don't drink often but when i do it's likely going to be cheap and cheerful. I'm British and we have a drinking culture.
If you're goig to force me into a suit i'll drink G&T like any reasonable brit. Whisky if you're flirting.
I hardly care about the brand but i'll chat up the bar staff to get a recommendation."
1757,estp,"You don't seem British. Is British a persona you wear on the internet? 
I'm beginning to think you have a crush on me, since this is the second time you have mentioned me and masturbation in the same sentence!"
1758,estp,"Because you provoke. It's fairly clear from the way you present your opinion that you enjoy the intellectual challenge... the ESTP does too.
That seems facetious considering your attitude earlier about drinking.
Would you criticise me in the same light for smoking weed? Do i smoke weed due to an insecurity? I generally don't smoke weed to meet women so perhaps this example can enable you to separate the concepts."
1759,estp,"Se+Ti can be overly focused on fast food. Doesn't mean shit for an individual.
Which is why your judgement was shitty - i attempted to explain this by alluding to the individuality of the ESTP.
But i guess we are talking past each other. Please re-read my initial reply to you about your condescending attitude."
1760,estp,"I'm trying to understand this ESTP I know and I don't think they can ignore their impulses if there's no good reason not to. I can't blame them for doing what they want based off a seemingly short attention span, it's just how they are and if you can't accept it they don't need to open up to you anymore. 
They're still generally pleasant unless you piss them off but they stick to certain values and that's respectable. I'd like to know if I'm wrong because this is based on the complexity of the person I know."
1761,estp,"As a ENTP, i laugh my ass off watching this guy and im always thinking,""This hass to be the perfect example of an PURE  ESTP"".  
If you have no clue who this guy is look at one minute of his videos and it will be quite clear.
What do you guys think?

1762,estp,"INFJ here. I can see the Fe and Ti in him, and...
“I’m more of a planner, but I take things day by day, might as well just do it once”
You most certainly do not have to do something once- Yeah, sounds like my opposite "
1763,estp,"Okay, so, I'm an ESFP and have a really good friend who is ESTP. Basically, something happened and he got pretty angry at me for about a week. We both wanted to talk it out and smooth over the issue  so we could get back to how our friendship was before(very Fe of him, haha). 
However, I'm not sure if this is me just being insecure, it feels like there's something different. Like, we act the exact same when we're hanging out but I can tell something is off, he's a little more distant than before. 
I just want to understand what he's thinking, or how an ESTP would react in this sort of situation? Should I talk to him about this? Or Should I give him more space and time to get over it before things can truly go back to how they were? Or am I just being a hyper-sensitive ESFP? 
Any advice would be massively appreciated, and thanks for enduring that very long post, haha."
1764,estp,"Okay ESTP here, this happens to me way more often than I would like. Anytime anything happens in my friendships or relationships, I find that I tend to push them away from me. I feel hurt and I close myself off. The worst thing to do, for me at least, is to pretend it didn't happen. I usually won't bring it up. But especially if you think it was your fault, I will think you are trying to take an easy way out and nothing will ever get resolved. 
I don't know what happened exactly. But most times, the way to fix it is to be a little overly affectionate or friendly for a day or two and that will show me that you are REALLY trying to fix whatever happened. But that's for me. He/She may be a little different in how they respond to your signs of rebuilding. 
This whole post probably sounds really selfish because this is how I would like all my problems resolved, ideally. And every situation is different."
1765,estp,I'm an estp. In this situation I completely understand how he feels. I too keep people at a distance if there is some kind of problem or issue between us. It's usually temporary if the other person really wants to fix the issues we have between each other. Like the other poster mentioned give him a little time and show you want to make things right between you. 
1766,estp,"When I got overly frustrated in a situation with people, I pull my emotional ripcord. I essentially push away whoever it is, because I don't need/want it in my life at that time. 
Granted, some situations don't allow me to do this. It's easy to detach and relax, then come back to the issue when I'm ready to face it. 
When I try to confront the issue, that doesn't mean I'm over it. I'm simply ready to try talking about it again."
1767,estp,I'm ESTP and I can relate to your friend very much. When I disagree or fight with a friend (or get annoyed by them- females are terrible) I tend to just back away. I an attitude of if I feel unhappy or uncomfortable in a relationship it needs to end. I find I disconnect very easily if I don't have tons of attachment end I'm not an emotional person so this happens quite a bit. 
1768,estp,"I see. Okay, I'll try my best to explain the situation. It all sounds so high school and ridiculous to me now, but at the time, it seemed to have a big impact.
Basically, it's to do with another friend of ours, an ESTJ. 
My ESTJ friend told the ESTP friend that I, essentially, had a massive, romantic thing for the ESTP. That didn't make him mad though, what happened after did.
The ESTP brought it up to me and wanted to ask if it was true, which it wasn't as my ESTP friend is genuinely one of my oldest, closest friends and I would never want to ruin that. 
However, I was drunk and have literally no emotional control when I'm being confronted and I got incredibly mad, and then got mad because I was mad(Which I apologised profusely for) and more or less we had this massive argument. 
My ESTP friend said that the reason he got so angry was that a) he had never seen me react like that b) he was frustrated that he didn't understand c) he was being yelled at.
Thank you for enduring that terrible story, haha.
Like I said, we have talked this over before and I don't know whether to bring it up again to make sure that everything is actually okay."
1769,estp,"If I'm honest, I can't really explain it. 
I became angry mainly at the ESTJ, but perhaps he felt that I was then taking out that frustration on him (which, again, I apologised profusely for). 
Basically, I felt as though I was being backed into a corner. Mainly because I didn't have adequate control over myself, so it probably felt far more confrontational in that moment than it actually was. But, nonetheless, provoked the reaction.
Okay, I'll try chatting to him about it and I'll try my best to make it as casual as I can, nothing too dramatic haha. Thanks so much for the help!"

1772,estp,"I'm an ISFP. I find this super interesting, as I would say that art is a talent of mine, yet I am in the same category (SP) as ESTPs.

Which I find strange because I first thought of the connection when I saw the famous INFP's:http://www.celebritytypes.com/infp.php. Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, J.R.R. Tolkein, Vincent Van Gogh, J.K. Rowling all have the same type; so I figured they were all extremely left brained. Maybe we're different because we have differing interests. Now that I think about it, my only natural talent is growing talent with practice quickly so, I guess this could be premature."
1776,estp,"Moving furnture and belongings?

You want to avoid any negative connotation that may be immplied by sarcastic interpretations or deliberate 'false' reading of the name or phrase.

Just Move It (with a rip off Nike tick)
Cheesy works if it avoids any possible sarcastic intepretation. I made puns about phones toward the end because it speaks more to a consumer lifestyle rather than directly about moving. It conveys comfort and associates a level of service. I also chose to promote a high energy aesthetic with word choice or format."

1789,estp,"Alright guys, a sweet ENFP is here asking for a lil of help (okay, let's keep down the ego. This is serious for me).
I actually have an ESTP classmate. We've been like... 2 years together at the same class. Those years we didn't talk much due to some stuff (well he actually flirted with me and the things didn't go too well, it's a long story haha), but as we were going to enter to the same career at the same college, we did team work for exams and studied together and we actually have a good .. friendship? Well, for me it's not really a friendship as we don't talk about deep stuff, but we have fun together so well.
Okay, that was to describe a bit my relationship with him. Now I'll explain the situation.
At first, he was happy about college, motivated u know, but as the days kept passing.. that motivation started to dissapear (there have been already two parties and he refused to go wtf?!?!?). Apart from that, he is starting to get angry easily.. and he is becoming more serious...
I'm quite worry about him, as I'm seeing he is going into a Ni grip and.. I don't know what to do, i mean, I wanna help him! But i don't know how to do it.. 
He isn't socializing much with people, it's like if his expectation weren't becoming real? I dunno..
I dunno how to act in these situations with him ;--; so I was wondering if you guys could help me out?"
1790,estp,"IDK looks like to me this ESTP is having some frustration that he doesn't want to tell you.
I said this to someone with a similar problem, but if an ESTP really wants your  help they will tell you. From what your post looks like, is that you haven't told him how much you care about him so he doesn't know about it. He is deep in thought about this problem he has, that he doesn't want to talk to people because it bothers him and he's trying to find ways in his head to get rid of it (the problem).
​
I guess one way to make him open up is to say
""Hey I noticed that you are losing motivation, not going to parties anymore, acting all serious... is something wrong?""
if he shrugs it off, then it's a personal/deep problem he's been struggling with for some time. In that case I'd say
""Even though I haven't said it directly, I really care about you and want to help you. I was with you when [insert good time with ESTP] and think you are [insert positive characteristic]. If you want to talk to me about your problems, I'm here.""
Either this ESTP will
a) Break down and vent all his frustrations to you in some private area
b) Walk away... then come back to you after some time and tell you everything if he trusts you.
ESTPs in Ni grip will always want to be secluded until they figure out the solution internally. But they also know that they can benefit by bouncing off (to people they trust) about their frustrations and how to solve them. It is therapeutic to an ESTP like me, to talk to someone and realize that someone is there that cares for me and that I'm not alone in case things go out of hand. They need to feel ready about it first, so it takes some time."
1791,estp,"I thought you were going to complain about him not studying. Some people are just introverts and the party scene just really isn't their element. You never want to pressure people into doing anything because you feel like you're doing them a favor, but they may also feel they're doing you a favor if they go out of their way to go and if things go south you guys may end up resenting eachother. If you guys can coexist knowing that you have different interests that might be the best route. Keep inviting them of coarse, so that he doesn't feel excluded, but don't be pushy."
1792,estp,"I think I understand what your friend is going through. Since you only use your secondary function in times of stress (Ti), this adjustment might be extremely stressful for him, especially because he's used to the dynamic life before college that he had a lot of control over, his motivation might be turned into more media consumption/things that stimulate his mind while he processes this new change(using his Ti). 
He might be more apt to spending time by himself because of this. It appears perfectly healthy for me. I have a tendency to be a bit shy as an extrovert so when I move somewhere new it can be a huge adjustment for me because it takes time to build the big friend groups I want to be around. "
1793,estp,"Okay I'll be answering from point to point.
Nope, I haven't told him how much I care. First of all cuz we are getting closer this year. Even if we have known each other for two years.. this year is when we finally are getting along somehow (I mean, the other day I looked quite upset - I'm a very expresive person - and asked me what happened and that if I needed help, he was there to listen - I told him about my problem and he helped and gave me advises. After that he tried to cheer me up. This surprised me as it was the first time we talked about something .. serious? As other times I've been sad he just avoided asking me or if i told him something, even if it was a little, he was like: u have to deal with it.
Due to what I've just told you.. Till yesterday - it happened then - I didn't know he felt the same? I mean, that we were really friends? (We even talked about love and asked me who i liked and gave me advises HAHAHA)
What I noticed is that the problem he has it in college. So next time I see him upset.. I may ask him and try to cheer him up as he did with me!
Somehow I feel like if he feels confortable with me, so now I think he would be able to tell me, maybe, so I can help him? I dunno ;;--;; i dont like seeing him sad.
And, thank you for your comment really !💕"
1794,estp,"I didn't try yet. First of all.. cuz till yesterday, I didn't know he relied on me or that we were really friends. I mean, I've always wanted to become his friend! (I really like his actitude and seems a good person) but we've always been close and distant at the same time.
But yesterday, when I was upset, he worried about me and asked me what happened, tried to cheer me up (i found out he liked my energetic actitude haha) and he was like: I don't wanna see you on monday like this! 
So that's why I didn't ask, as I thought he would avoid me or something - I felt quite frustrated - but next time I see him this way I will ask him!"
1795,estp,"No no. I mean.. he isn't an introvert person, and actually.. he goes to more parties than me 😂 (I started going this year). That's why I was worry, as he changed his actitude...
I dont pressure him either, I just ask him and invite him, and if he wants to go its okay, if not, well, maybe other time?
But he changed his actitude also in college.. acting more introvert, but that is, he is not that way!
I dunno if you get my point."

Skateboarding, long boarding, travelling to hot countries with friends and experiencing the food, the sites, the nightlife, meeting attractive women, music, singing, music festivals, movies, video games, Reddit and some self help books by people like Mark Manson and Coach Corey Wayne."

"
1804,estp,"So I have taken the Meyers Briggs personality test and many others over the years. I have always come back consistently as an ESTP. 
However I hear a lot about how ESTP are not good at communicating their feelings or interpersonal relationships. 
However I truly think these are two areas I actually excel in as well with the many areas of ESTP. 
I know you shouldn’t take the test too much but I have gotten ESFP as well. I just think my S and F are really close. 
Or am I just a healthy aware ESTP? 
Idk lol"
1805,estp,"INTJ here.   It’s possible that you tend to teeter from T to F in certain circumstances or in different aspects of your life.   I have the tendency to teeter from my T to an F as well, and in those times, it appears to contradict with traits of the original result.   Can’t say for sure without knowing you better, but it’s likely that you are just a bit of an outlier- in the sense that you are more intimately in touch with your emotions.   It’s a good thing.    As long as it isn’t creating any inner or outer conflict in your life, I’d say you’re just healthy and aware."
1806,estp,"Introverted functions can be real hard to spot!
​
I'm still either ISFJ or INFJ. Leaning towards ISFJ seeing how I interact with SXP types over NXP types. 
​
Do you not communicate feelings due to an emotional reason or logical reason? Or is it half and half for both? It is possible you could just be a very emotionally intelligent thinker!
​
I put a brick on top of Si, because sometimes I get accused of being stuck in the past and unable to move forward. This is not the case. When that happens I feel anxious and my Fe sort of shuts down as well. This has led people to think I have Fi as well. But it feels more like an anxious Ti, I know I'm going to have some sort of outburst if I'm running on anxious Ti for too long, so I start to isolate because I do not want to burden others with these outbursts."
1807,estp,"I would totally agree with you! I think I teeter pretty well but the ESTP Just resounds with me besides the whole not being in touch with my feelings. Very interesting to say the least. I appreciate the outlier comment haha.

1810,estp,"I'll try to keep this short, ask for more info if needed.
How do I clearly state my requirement for alone time, w/o offending.  I have an Se dom acquaintance that is asking me constantly to do things.  I try to (in my mind) clearly indicate that I can not do these highly stimulating extroverted activities all the time.  That I need time to recover...and by time, more than an hour or 24 hours, even more than 48 hours.  That once a week is my goal, and anything beyond that is 'luck' if it fits into my schedule/time line/energy alottment. 
I've denied many encounters, but every day/other day I'm asked again.  Its become tedious and negatively effecting energy and mood trying to manage this situation.
I don't mean this rudely, but it feels clingy or needy.  Where as I'm completely fine and often prefer to do things on my own...its nice when every now and then I can hang with someone else along the way, but I don't need it every day or even every week.  Side note: They have asked or claimed to be curious to why I have been unable to meet up. Asking for an excuse...as if I need to justify my time/energy.  I think excuses are pointless, and if someones busy, they are busy. I have work/business obligations, and made these apparent. I have goals that rely on these obligations..
The more I try to state my position, the less it seems to make a difference at all. Which has me thinking its intentional at this point and they are seeking a reaction...but I'm too patient...up until I'm not...and then I disconnect.  I'm trying to avoid that.
Apologies, still got pretty wordy.  Any tips/suggestions welcome."
1811,estp,"I'd say this person either likes you romantically or thinks you're a useful end to a means. Do you have a particular skill or relationship with somebody they might be trying to get on the in with? Do you have money or other entertaining things that come along with you?
Otherwise they could just be trying to be inclusive and might not really care if you decline. Sometimes I know people are happy to chill themselves and even though I'm neutral on their participation in my life's fun, I'll invite them regardless so the times when they do want to join as you say, they are still welcomed. 
It's also possible they think you're upset with something they've done and are trying to get you back in their good gripes."
1812,estp,"be blunt and tell them you need time to yourself. be honest. this isnt an offensive statement so dont make it into one. or just also tell them you dont want to do what theyre trying to get you to do. 
also keep in mind every relationship is a cooperative thing, and I've had enough experience with intj to know you guys like to micro manage and plan everything, and it doesn't take a genius to know estp are some of the most spontaneous people you'll ever meet. your friend isn't trying to personally attack and you and ruin all your schedules and personal plans and obligations, they're just trying to hang out with you because this is how ESTP go about things. They're trying to include you. maybe you should stop thinking of it as some kind of unreasonable expectation they have on you, and try understanding it from a perspective other than your own. Ones expectations and implications of ANY given situation will not be known to everyone UNTIL THEY ARE VOICED, and you should never expect others to read your mind. This person is not inside your head, no everyone knows you're planning your day from the moment you wake up or that you have an energy expenditure limit. Talk to your friends. Communicate. Be Honest. Meet them halfway, don't expect them to know everything already. "
1813,estp,"This person probably is needy and possibly is trying to get a reaction out of you. Honestly if you've already communicated your boundaries to them then they're ignoring you on purpose which is lame. Make a stronger boundary. ""I will only do one thing a week with you. I'm just going to ignore any other requests"" and then if they get even worse, then start shutting the relationship down because they clearly don't respect you."
1814,estp,"I am considering a MTB demo and offered they join if I could get two diff bikes to test ride.  We met/know each other due to MTB.  So maybe this would be the entertaining thing.

I project plans and don't get 'too excited' about things too often, unless deep into Se flow-which is rare/if ever in a default or resting state. They did comment about being excited about it.

1815,estp,"Need some perspective here. 24 year old male working in the technology sector. Making good money. Enjoying the bachelor life hanging out with friends and doing whatever I want with whoever I want. I am enjoying it. I didn't plan on settling down until 26-28 because I want to put in a ton of time at work so that I am established as possible when it is time to settle down.
A girl comes out of left field a couple weeks ago. 20 year old girl who is a dental assistant. I know this sounds dumb, but do you guys ever get cold feet when you think about settling down, even if it's just dating? Does it ever go away when you get older or should I just take up this opportunity to dive in the deep end?"
1816,estp,"I've been in 2 different serious relationships over the last 5 years. I've never really had an interest in settling down, but have been able to rationalize getting into relationships using one bit of rationale (both to myself and my girlfriend(s))
""what is a couple of years over a lifetime?""
it allows them to feel more comfortable with your long term plans, and is also a great way at preventing an engagement ring or some other dumb shit. Also, it's a general principle that i believe in. If the love/intimacy is there, and you are both confident in it, why would you need to rush things. "
1817,estp,"That's what is love to hear other estps opinions. I haven't met any other girl like this and have been purposely holding out for awhile, but maybe this is the right one. I feel like estps are way more picky than others because we know we can literally settle down at any moment"
1818,estp,"I personally disagree with that.  The reason I don't settle down is because I subconsciously fear the day that we separate, which is why I usually tend to dip as soon as things get intimate with a girl, as a way to save myself from the pain.
I know it's not healthy, and I do want that to change, but I can do that later down the road; it's not a priority of mine yet."

1821,estp,"Ello 
So is it just me or is it that there is some disconnect when I talk to NTs? It's like they are in a different world and I can feel they are perceiving us through a different lense which I don't understand.
Like for example, trying to break the ice with NTs, I try to randomly think of big ideas like (What would happen if scientists use the DNA of a mammoth and put it in a female elephant will it work??) and they get all flabbergastic about this and start talking. 
I personally find the idea interesting, but it's not something I would enjoy talking about consistently. Where as, NTs, can talk about it forever / go on long tangents, which pisses me off internally after a certain time.
​
The only NTs which I can realistically tolerate for lengthy periods of conversations are ENTJs. Perhaps because I can pitch them some great ideas which have a connection to reality, and they give me great suggestions on how to work it and if it will be successful, and sometimes they become interested and want to work with me. I enjoy conversations that I can end up applying afterwards, which seems to mesh well with ENTJs.
​
I struggle talking to types such as INTJ/INTP and ENTPs. With ENTPs, I have to think about some LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic idea or show them a politically incorrect meme to get them talking and then end up debating with which give me a headache because I don't caaaareee. INTJs seem like an enigma to me and they either come off as rude and standoffish (ignore any attempts to make conversation), or become critical/give favor about what I talk about and then not talk anything even though it was like 1 sentence long. INTPs are just far out there and start going down the rabbit hole of what I just talked about towards different ideas which is a headache and I have to stop them from talking too much.
​
TL;DR-
So how do you talk with NTs? How do you not get a headache with them? 
It's like every time I talk with an NT, I ALWAYS have to give them something interesting. I can't do some small talk like normal people do because some get completely turned off by that and I want to be friends with them. Thanks guys."
1822,estp,"INTJ here...I think the easiest way to talk to an INTJ is to minimise your expectations of a response, and prepare yourself for some intense silences. It doesn't mean we don't like you, but yes we're judging you. Don't take it personally, and it's more a cool detached kind of judging to see if we'll invest time in you. We do that with everything! If I'm going to invest time in (read: have a conversation with) you, I think I respond most to authenticity, genuineness, and intelligence."
1823,estp,"If someone is that far out there in terms of me connecting with them, I just...don’t bother. 
My best friend is ENTP and I know a few NTJ’s. Got no problem connecting as they usually have awesome senses of humor. 
Maybe you’re overthinking things. "
1824,estp,"As an INTJ I couldn’t make any friends with any type other than INTPs ISFPs INTJs ENTPs INFPs never met an ENTJ or INFJ, didn’t like ENFP/ENFJs, and one ESFJ friend that I don’t think he is an ESFJ...
I don’t talk much with anyone other than INTPs i love them they are great.
To be fair idk if i met all S’ types but most of my friends (before knowing about MBTI) turned out to be NT’s. 
(I don’t choose friends based on MBTI thats stupid, i just find a person that i like and start talking to him/ her.)"
1825,estp,"INTJ here. I have a good(?) friend who is ESTP and we get along great...in certain circumstances. My issue with her - apart from seeing her increasingly as very opportunistic (that in itself is troublesome b/c we appreciate genuine, loyal friends) - is that I find her equal parts exhausting and boring. Exhausting b/c she never stops doing: “LET’S GET BREAKFAST”, then “LET’S GO TO THE POOL”, then “LET’S GO SHOPPING”, then “LET’S HAVE A BBQ” and all in the same day sort of thing. Now, that could all be fine, but as you’re doing all of these things, she cannot have a meaningful convo about anything - has literally said “Why do we have to talk about these things, LET’S TALK ABOUT BOYS”. So, you’re exhausted from socializing, but bored to death with absolutely no mental stimulation. We (or at least, I) like to talk about ideas or what’s going on in our life/world and how it relates to other people/things. Make a connection with what they’re talking about and don’t try too hard - have fun with the conversation/them - as another ESTP said, we often do have a great sense of humor. But, we can also sniff out a disingenuous person from a mile away. "
1826,estp,"Small talk doesn't address any of my wants or values. Small talk is a means to an end, making enough trust, cohesion, or familiarity to get something done, not a goal in and of itself. Pulling myself out of my thoughts to communicate with others is effort, and effort requires a payout. 
Why would I want to participate in a conversation you don't care about? Do you think I care?! Conversation is effort, if neither of us care why would I put in effort? This is what I believe you are getting from INTJs.
I would (and do) just talk broadly about things you are passionate about, if you both care enough about similar things maybe a good conversation will be had, if not then you will not have a good conversation."
1827,estp,"INTP here. Chances are the INTP you're talking to feels the same way about the idea, but is continuing on the train of thought because you seemed interested in it & they know firsthand what it's like to be interested in something wacky but not have anyone to talk to about it. The rabbit trails are inherent to the type, but communicating them to you is the INTP's attempt to reciprocate in the conversation. (Plus it's rare for an INTP to come across someone willing to have those kinds of conversations, so they're going to grab that bull by the horns and not let go if they can help it.)
​
I totally get how a person can feel like this, but
...do you really?
​
I mean, I'm sorry--that probably came off as harsh. It's just that after reading that, my understanding is that it seems less like you want to develop meaningful friendships with these specific people, and more like you want to be the sort of person who's friendly with all sorts of people.
And that's fine, but it means that regardless of the topics you bring up, you're still ultimately engaging in small talk.
I think that's probably the biggest contributing factor in the disconnect you're feeling. You're engaging these types in a ""small talk"" manner, but with all the trappings of ""not-small-talk."" So in a way it's like you fooled them into thinking this wasn't going to just be chitchat. But it ends up backfiring on you, because they took your engagement at face value and wore you out.
So to circle back to your original question/topic, how do you talk to NTs? Deeply, or not at all (generally speaking)."
1828,estp,"INTJ - usually not much talk, just hang with them and do stuff 
INTP - ask them to copy their homework, or sometimes exam 
ENTJ - give them aesthetics advice and receive financial advices in return 
ENTP - exchange sarcastic/dark jokes and laugh our heads off "
1829,estp,"If I understand some of the cognitive functions correctly (I'm very new to MBTI and very old to you), here is the problem, as I am seeing it.
You think in a linear fashion. 
The Intuitives and we are a minority,  think laterally.
Combine that with a Ni's inherent Breadth of Curiosity and your own innate Trait Curiosity ( I do not know if you have breadth of curiosity and mean no insult)
however, this makes communication difficult for both of us, when we want to communicate."
1830,estp,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/intj] A post on r/estp on how to talk to NTs I found pretty interesting

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
1831,estp,"As an INTJ, this would piss me off. It feels like you are more interested in me as a collector's item for your group of friends than an actual person. I wouldn't want to just be the awkward token friend. "
1832,estp,"Best descriptions I've ever read 👍  
In general acting like their own type or the complete letter-opposite (ENTP-"
1833,estp,"That's totally true.. I already got some friends NT's and sometimes they put attention to whatever i say. 
When i going to meeting them i read a lot of thing just to have something that sound interesting to them cuz they already know what i going to talk about and they going to be bored so faster. "
1834,estp,"Two of my best friends are intp (my room mate)  and entp.
I have any problem to communicate with them.
I'm maybe less in their World, but they are very interesting and very funny.
I'm never bored with them.
Btw, yes they dont like smalltalks when they are useless.
But i dont especially talk about that too"
1835,estp,"Well, I could totally see this happening but usually, INTPs who are socially somewhat adjusted could definitely see that you're not interested in their abstract theories and they would know that most people wouldn't be interested in such things so they won't really talk about it if you didn't bring up that topic.
I have xSTP friends that I am close with and I know that they are not interested in my abstract theories. When I am with them I talk about ideas that are more applicable to real life and generally my experiences and we communicate through Ti so it's fairly easier to relate.
It's not like I hate conversations about real life stuff that is concrete but I do prefer abstract convos about ideas and theories. AND I also do realize that I can't do that with most of the population so I adjusted myself to it. Therefore, it is good on your part to talk about abstract stuff with INTPs from time to time but you don't really have to force yourself to do so all the time just for the sake of opening up a conversation. :)"
1836,estp,"Yeah I have an INTJ cousin and it’s scary when we eat alone at the dinner table and there are long periods of awkward silence and I feel obliged to talk about something.
“Soooo how’s your day?”
“.......”
“Decent.”
“.......”
“Alright guess I’ll leave ya alone there”
sips water nervously and pulls out phone and laughs at memes posted on discord, while looking at cousin sometimes to see what he doing
Like I legit get stuck here. He is either 
a) thinking about something deeply and i don’t wanna bother him
b) just being himself and not saying anything then he’ll just go to his room and play computer games lmao
c) ????
d) planning to kill me"
1837,estp,"You're usually naturally (psychologically) inclined to like people who are the same type as you (or close) and people who use the same functions as you so it'd make sense that the chosen surroundings (so not family members) of an NT are, for the most part, NT or, at least, Intuitives. "
1838,estp,"You are the light in this thread (love the INTJs). I'm ENFP and one of my good friends is ESTP. I find that the reason we get along great is because we are both always down to have a good time and go off and do whatever (go on trips, go out drinking, go to events, play sports... basically just have a good time). If you remove the 'external stimuli' of the activities and it's just us two in a room, the talk can be absolutely dreadful. As you said, most can't have a meaningful conversation about anything. I've tried a plethora of topics, most of which have been met with a wall of silence or a weird look. Zero feedback. I'm usually left thinking to myself 'well fuck me for trying to talk about something that's interesting and that actually matters'...
Btw to OP: 'LOL RANDOM XD unrealistic ideas' are usually neither random nor unrealistic to most N types. (I'm not talking about 'why are unicorns not real' I'm talking real life geopolitical events, advancements in science, space exploration, history ...) But as you said, you don't really care at all about any of that.
Totally respect that some people don't really give a f about topics that are interesting to NT or NF types. Some people are just more inclined to do rather than think and reflect. That's what makes all the different personalities interesting. I've dealt with pretty much every type and I do find I struggle a lot more with S types, but it also doesn't mean that you can't have a meaningful relationship with someone that's very different from you :)"
1839,estp,"This is exactly it in my opinion. As an INTJ I am often pulled into conversations I’d rather not be having, as such I’m pretty keen on picking up when others are in a similar position. I can tell you don’t care and I despise idle small talk. It would seem in everyone’s best interest to let the conversation die. "
1840,estp,"INTJ (married to an INTP) here—your assessment is spot on. 
OP, why are you starting conversations about these topics and then getting mad that people are talking to you about them?
Gonna second /u/travisseitler’s question about your motivations in these conversations too. If you don’t want to have deep weird conversations, don’t. We know when people don’t like talking to us and are bored. And it makes us not want to talk to them again. Plus it’d be really confusing if you’d begun the topic and then were bored.. I would think there was something wrong with me and how I was explaining things. 
If you want to be casually acquainted and on good terms, figure out some topics that are middle of the road: ie you’re comfortable talking about them and can ‘caaaaare’ for the whole chat, but are also more interesting than small talk for your conversation partner. "
1841,estp,"I’m not sure about developing meaningful friendships. More about trying to get to know them, be comfortable bros, and open up. Not sure if ESTP thing, but I feel comfy in an area where I’ve known (even superficially) the people around me so I can get a better feel of the surroundings and temperament of people. 
But sometimes it’s just me and a group of NTs that I feel excluded from because they think differently in terms of conversation. (I’m a C.S. major if that brings some background). They all enjoy talking about deep theory and abstract stuff and random things thrown in all around... so I kind of feel alone because they all “click” and I don’t (guess where the nerd insult comes from). It seems nice they all hang out together and share the same classes and stuff. Idk.
If any meme would relate right now it would probably be that one with Steve Buscemi dressed up as a sk8ter kid and saying “How do you do fellow kids”. Search that one up, lmao
Thanks Jordan Peterson"
1842,estp,"Wow thanks!
I just read an article to understand “wot is linear thinking vs lateral” and that actually describes the discrepancy I have with NTs. I was going to write an edit about “mental masturbation” which is what I found common with conversations observed from other NTs where they throw out some idea or subject to talk about and all the other NTs start tearing it up and presenting it in different pieces. It seemed like fun so I tried to join in... but yeah sort of hard for me because I get tired trying to fit that sort of thinking
On the other hand with SEnsorS we just talk about life and say how you doing and “what’s up”. I mean, occasionally we might talk about deep things like politics and philosophy but in the end we have a limit to how much we can keep talking about. It’s more of QA style. Once we both agree on some part of the conversation it kind of stops from there and we might just go and hang out some place to pass time."
1843,estp,"Your sensor explanation makes sense. I saw something about sensors and how they immediately will fix something that is broken. 
How many Se's does it take to change a lightbulb...
I love all of the little things that I keep finding out about everyone. And poo! to the Barnum Effect, right?
If you really want to communicate with an introvert, try writing it down first. I find that when I have to extrovert in a conversation, I get all wrapped in observing the person speaking and forget to listen."
1844,estp,"That happens to me as well. 
It's like the you that's in charge of your executive functions takes a step back from the screen to get a better view. 
Edit: I'm an INTJ btw. "
1845,estp,"Well to be honest it could be that we're not thinking about you at all! Like... At all. Just assume they like you until they tell you otherwise because usually that's the truth. If they didn't, you probably wouldn't even be having the opportunity to be feeling awkward because they would have left already haha"
1846,estp,"A lot of my closest friends through my life have been INTJ's.
Honestly love them. Them to me? not always spectacular.
I find a lot of conflict comes from the fact we have a lot of interests in common, getting along well in weird situations, but it all breaks down when it comes to lifestyle. My lifestyle is incredibly holistic, while INTJ's tend to have a very structured existence. However my ability to just do things without thinking can rub them the wrong way sometimes.
That being said, in casual hangouts or in group activities they're a lot of fun once they open up to you.  
DM me we can voice chat and you can get a sense if you like."
1847,estp,"I'm an INFJ and my husband is an ESTP. We've been married over eleven years. We're not at all on the same page concerning our sex life and I want that to change. Frequency being the biggest issue. The only times he tries to take initiative is really late a night at bed time. We both work full time and have two kids. I do everything in the house: cooking, laundry, dishes, cleaning, ect. At the end of the day I'm so exhausted it rarely happens. He's consistently hurt when I say, ""I'm so tired. Why didn't you say something earlier."" He takes it as rejection and that I don't want him. I've suggested better times. Like when the kids are napping on the weekend or after they've gone to bed during the week. But he says those times aren't spontaneous enough and not when he's in the mood. He says it's got to be on my terms or not at all, which is ironic because I feel like he's doing the same thing. So when I offer (which I'll admit is not as often as it should be) he usually takes it, but apparently it doesn't count because it wasn't his suggestion. He doesn't want to get counseling and doesn't feel like talking about it. I can understand where he's coming from, feeling rejected when you just want to love your spouse sucks. But I feel like if this was such an important issue to him he'd be more willing to try at different times rather than an hour after I've already gone to bed. He definitely has a higher sex drive than I do too, which only compounds our issues. I've also told him that aside from completely exhaustion, it's frustrating when I say I'm going to get ready to bed and he stays up another hour or longer watching TV or playing a game, then once he comes to bed remembers he has a wife he finds attractive, who's more than likely asleep by this point. If I'm conscious enough, I feel like a complete afterthought at that point. And it's not that I don't want him. I love my husband and when we can have sex it's great. I just don't understand when I tell him you have a 90% chance of hearing yes around this time of day as opposed to a 2% late at night, why he wouldn't be a little more willing. But at this point he's given up trying because he's felt rejected for eleven years. Any advice on encouraging him to meet me in the middle? "
1848,estp,"I don't know the answer, but I can think of some things you could try.


Be enthusiastically opposite a few times sprinkled into the days you deny so it can maybe give some more legitimacy to your off days. Ie. ""Hahaha oh babe I'm sleepy right now but remember Monday last week? Mmmm hmmm let's do that again this weekend [time or whenever you actually want] ok love you good night.""


You should have no problem with him getting off on his own, so maybe you could ""recommend"" a way for him to do that. For example, earlier in the day you could show him a photo you think might turn him on, and say, ""oh I really find this pic hot, I wanted to show it to you"" or say something more natural for your relationship. But then later you can be in bed and say, ""Mmmm yeah and don't forget about that hot pic from earlier, sorry I'm tired but go crazy for me love you zzzz..."" Basically I'm suggesting you justify his masturebation by actively endorsing it, thereby deferring the issue until next time. This can continue forever if you get increasingly creative with your material.


Frame it as a problem for him to solve for you. Maybe the next time you're going away for a weekend without him you could make it seem like you're worried about yourself getting off while you're away. Reformulate this into a time you must to get off because you'll have no other time and going without for so long will drive you crazy.


Counselling is a good idea in any relationship, healthy or otherwise... but it kind of seems like maybe you want to go so you have a platform to air your grievances, and he can probably already imagine what those are because you've expressed them several times. So yes, counselling good, but this situation maybe he's just not going to be receptive for whatever reason.
Ok good luck. You should also know, when I read somebody replying with such a lengthy post in this subreddit I am usually surprised because we'll start something and just cancel it when it seems like a lot of work for no return."
1849,estp,"Honestly, as an ESTP, I get horny everytime I'm in bed with my girl, even if we're just laying next to each other quietly, a boner shall rise. I love crazy passionate sex, and I think that things just tend to snowball when you play with ESTPs. Kind of like going to a nightclub, if you don't drink and just stand there like a strawman, it's going to suck, just go home, but if you're going to get some vodka down your throat and party all night, it's going to be crazyyyyyyyyy. Get it? Snowball effect. Just start out by doing something romantic but freneticly passionate, unexpectedly. Just start making out with him like if you were frenzy in love with him and go down on him and give him a good time, and do it like you love it. Go frenzyyyy on him, we love excitement. Don't plan sex, that's just boring, just do it, surprise him. For me sex is a way to show my love, the way I love the most, I don't fuck with a bored face on, I fuck with all the passion that I have. So, just go crazy, drink a Red Bull before bed and just do it! Sorry if this was a bit too graphic but just keeping it real lmao."
1850,estp,"hey there. I think the issue for him is that he doesn't think that it's ""fun"" or ""sponteanous"" enough if you tell him that ""it's better to have sex in the afternoon during the weekend when the kids are asleep"". 
I don't think it's an hour/schedule issue, but more a way on how you present it. 
It's totally understandable that you have a lot on your plates and you're exhausted (by the way, you should talk honestly to him about it and should get him to help. ESTPs are doers after all, you just need to show them the directions and they will get at it). 
So maybe try a different approach. When the kids are asleep on the weekend, take the lead and be flirty, don't hesitate to tease him, be extra tactile. It's more a question of making the moment fun and sponteanous rather than ""let's have sex at this time instead"" matter"
1851,estp,"May I suggest that for ESTP, spontaneity is basically an overload of stability? The more stable/routine everything in life of an ESTP, the more the person craves spontaneity?
Also, the spontaneous behaviour isn't ever that random. I bet not all people are aware of the underlying cause of their desired that just appear out of nowhere. (IRL not out of nowhere, there was a precedence of multiple events that lead to a final event X.) Have you tried to use a little bit of your Ni to see all the events and predict your husband's desires?
I am no expert in advising about these things though, so take my questions are genuine curiosity :)"
1852,estp,"Hmmm maybe you could inspire him by initiating? Say, go to bed and let him go watch TV, and then get up and go tease him sexually, get him aroused. Maybe if you do this, once or more, you'll get the idea into his mind that his attractive wife is right there available, and he will prefer coming to you than doing those other things."
1853,estp,"Essentially the image is a no bullshit, self-confident leader.  He takes leadership roles because they give him access to resources which allow him to expand his control.  He has a great sense of power balances and timing which gives him the ability to act quickly in the moment to secure these resources.  He's highly independent and strong-willed.
Imagine a warlord, essentially.  Do you watch Game of Thrones? Khal Drogo is what I imagine when I think of an SLE."
1854,estp,"Yeah
My main purpose is just to have fun, do things I want to do, feel balanced with myself, and share my experiences with others. I realize that once you pay off the house and car, the rest of life is really up to you. You can get married if you want, make a business, travel, work out, or all of this with a balanced work schedule up to retirement. 
What gets me up in the morning is that there are so many things to do that I'm possibly missing out on. I don't want to die knowing I missed out skiing or experiencing Jamaica or some shit. It's not only physically going places but mentally. I like to see how I can solve the world's problems and try to help humanity as a whole. I want to leave a legacy somehow, but if I don't, that's okay. As long as I'm satisfied with my life and no one forced me to do anything, I don't care if I die.
I'd say it's soothing and stimulating at the same time. Actually, I get soothed as I get stimulated because I'm finally doing something I enjoy and I'm not missing out. Like I'm actually doing something I want to do and that makes me happy.
Edit: I just wanna get this out there but I know some people make their whole lives serving a God or trying to get to heaven. I used to be like that and I’m not saying that’s bad I’m just saying that the mindset it forced me in secluded me from a lot of experiences until I had to think outside the box and explore. I’ve seen religious people discriminate innocent people’s life choices, fight each other, and so forth. Bro, stop doing this please. Don’t shove your personal life choice to other people and threaten them with eternal hellfire. If God was really fair he wouldn’t do such a thing even for people with their own conscious choose to reject him. Also atheists are guilty of this too. Life is not about materialistic stuff, it’s about being happy and striving for something to be honest that’s all I’m gonna say here peace"
1855,estp,"Yo......you're 18.  I know us ESTP's seem to juggle 20 plates at once on life.  On one hand we're like wtf am I going to do with my life.  On the other we're like no worries I'll figure it out.  All the while not wanting to miss out on opportunities.  My advice as a 43 year old ESTP.  Don't sweat it.  Really there are few things in your life you can control.  Those few are you and your character and motivations.  All the rest are small details.  At 18 you may be saying wtf are you talking about?????
What I'm saying is that in life very few things are going to keep you down long.  No matter what you go through.  A break up.  A loss of a job.  Hard times financially.  You won't be down for long before you're back up on your feet.  So my advice is to ride the waves and not stress out about everything.  Why?  Because like the stock market as long as you are progressing it's always going to be going up.  
All the best my friend.  You WILL figure this out."
1856,estp,"Hey ESTPs. I'm in high tech media and do interviews with top leaders in this field. I know tech is one thing that many ESTPs find interesting. So my question is..
what are the areas or topics you're interested in or want to know more about.
And what are the questions in this field you want to get answered?(For example, it may be trend, finance, startup, funding strategy, stock pick, social impact, leadership etc in high tech. Any question is welcome!)
Sincerely hope to hear about your thoughts on this. :):) Appreciate it!"
1857,estp,"I think I am much more interested in what the tech would allow you to do rather than details of how the tech works. I am a sucker for stories where someone trying to predict what happens when for example AI has replaced human x-ray readers. We already live in a physical world where most of the things we buy have been produced completely by robots and no human interaction. What happens when we get our investment advice, personalized medical advice, policy guidance, banking services, etc. all based on AI decisions with no human involved?"
1858,estp,"Hi mate. 
I'm mostly interested in crypto projects. Could give your take on where the blockchain space is at in general. Also who have you interviewed from crypto, what projects are you interested in etc. 
Many thanks for taking the time."
1859,estp,"Hey there! Thanks for the suggestions! Will definitely include those angles. :) Blockchain is getting a lot laid back now lol  But the really good ones are starting to grab attentions. I actually had a focus on blockchain last year. The topics are around IEO, STO and the real adoption at this point. Are you building up a crypto project or a tech enthusiast?"
1860,estp,"I'm a tech enthusiast and follow crypto closely. I'm not starting a blockchain project per se, but looking to start a company that utilizes existing projects. 
How'd you find yourself in that career? Interviewing leaders of the tech is a dream job, I'm heaps jealous. Could you link to one of your interviews?"
1861,estp,"I am an ESTP and I've noticed that the girls who are attracted to me are often depressed and have high anxiety. I've dated girls with anorexia, depression, and bi polar disorder. I have lots of friends who are not depressed but I feel like depressed people are drawn to me and open up to me way faster than I am comfortable with. I just met a depressed INFJ and she told me about her depression and anxiety within 10 minutes of our first conversation. Sorry if this blurb didn't flow very well... ESTP. "
1862,estp,"im an ESFJ girl and i had depression while i was really into this hot fuckboy ESTP, and it's because y'all thrive on female attention and subconsciously manipulate us/charm us and make us feel special so we want to be around u all the time. you guys are super masculine, popular and funny. you're secretly very protective which makes us feel secure (some of us for the first time in our lives) but aloof enough to make us chase after you, which you hate so you just pull away even more and leave us emotionally devastated. ESTP guys do not make for healthy relationships esp for a dependent girl."
1863,estp,"There's a girl that's like... obsessed with me cuz she has anxiety and im like her only friend, don't know why she picked me though. Always talks about her anxiety/depression and some of its real but 90% of it is literally her making stuff up for attention "
1864,estp,"just got out of a relationship with a BPD and INFJ girl.  I thought my positivity would be helpful for her, until shed loose it on me for giving suggestions of help.  I think its because we are very happy people and upbeat.  I want everyone around me to be as awesome as I am.  Life is fun."
1865,estp,Its not just dudes coping it. I get anxious depressed and mummy issue type boyfies. I reckon its partly because of the compassionate yet steally charm. What the lass above said about making others feel good yet still having an air of unattainability is the thing that gets those who are a bit more needy or unsure. 
1866,estp,"It's soul sucking.. Constantly talking with depressed people long term can really rub off on you. I had people like that in my life last year, distanced myself from them and it did everyone the world of good, even them"
1867,estp,"I gave up on an entrepreneurial project I was working on because I was losing optimism/passion, and it was a huge defeat to my foundation. 
Currently, I have no ambition or motivation, and it's an unpleasant feeling because I don't feel my natural energy/drive. I know losing motivation is a common ESTP problem, do you guys have any creative ways to turn yourself around? 
Books?
Movies?
Activities?
Volunteering?
Sleeping Around?"
1868,estp,"I just come up with new interests to keep me distracted until I get back in the groove. However, this isn't really a good solution because my current ""hobby"" is stealing from people I don't like. So, just find something new to do, but try not to be too destructive."
1869,estp,"I rely on others to keep me going.
When o have failed, I just changed interests. I tried to set up a website building business. It started quite well, but after a few years I had run out of customers. So I switched to Religious Studies teaching."
1870,estp,"Drop as much as you reasonably can from your life, use the extra time to reflect on what you wanted to get out of the project, what you actually ended up getting (both good and bad), and why you lost motivation. Take small steps toward new goals (for example, if you want a car, go get your license, or if you want to start another business, go to a conference or seminar). Use your knowledge of what you enjoyed about your venture to recalibrate and set a new goal. The rest is easy; grab opportunities, break out of your comfort zone, and keep doing you."
1871,estp,"as I've seen before, I try and pick up a new hobby, or go out with a bunch of new people, or get into something that really catches my eye. Typically anything new, action-oriented, and I can use my thinking with"
1872,estp,"Thanks. Sitting in bed. Gearing up to end a chapter. I'm dropping my resignation papers today. Moving to a new firm with better benefits, more money, client facing, and tons of travel. Heaven. 
Time to kick this pig! "
1873,estp,"Here's some very Se- and Fe-flavored music for y'all. The world as a whole is kind of confusing and depressing right now. I think it's important for us betas (xSTP & xNFJ) to form enclaves where we celebrate the positive things and keep up morale.
Feel free to share anything else that puts you in a good mood in the comments! :)"
1874,estp,"I went to Eric Prydz concert just a month ago and had amazing time Se-Fe-ing with friends. This is exactly what I needed this morning to remind me of the good times, thank you <3
Do you have any other Se- and Fe-flavoured music though? I'm curious as to how you select those :)"
1875,estp,"Good question!!  Heh. I got fucking slaughtered in r/istp because they didn't understand that this word has a different meaning in typology than it does in common vernacular. ^^;
The 16 types are divided into four quadras depending on the functions they value.
If you don't know much about the cognitive functions, now is a good time to review that.

Alphas value Ne-Si and Fe-Ti.  These are xNTPs and xSFJs.
Betas value Se-Ni and Fe-Ti.  These are xSTPs and xNFJs.
Gammas value Se-Ni and Te-Fi.  These are xSFPs and xNTJs.
Deltas value Ne-Si and Te-Fi.  These are xNFPs and xSTJs.

There are certain commonalities between all members of a particular quadra.
Here are some aspects that all Betas (ESTP, ISTP, ENFJ, INFJ) tend to display, courtesy of Wikisocion.  These aspects may be more or less prominent depending on type and individual personality, but are generally true:

They prefer situations where the power structure and hierarchy are clearly defined according to consistent rules and where ambiguities are minimized.
They're more confident when analysing the real situations, people, and objects, rather than hypothetical, what-if scenarios.
When judging a new acquaintance, they mainly notice traits that they have previously observed in other people belonging to the same (perceived) group as the new person.
They try to look for general rules explaining people, politics, mechanisms, and trends - rules that, once defined, can be applied generally.  They prefer these general rules, rather than approaching things on a case-by-case way.
They're energized by competitive situations where analytical tactics are emphasized.
They tend to enjoy group activities where the whole group participates in generating a common emotional atmosphere, as in laughing at jokes, etc.
They tend to feel energized in the presence of people who share their beliefs and express them with obvious enthusiasm and emotion.
They tend to give more value to feelings that are demonstrated with clear emotional expression.  They often increase the level of their own emotional expression in order to get a reaction from other people.
They tend to describe their closely-held personal views with poetic or dramatic language.
They're often deeply concerned about social issues and the direction the world is heading. They believe that apathy is a significant cause of societal problems, and work to fight against it.
They don't usually enjoy discussions of personal experiences when the focus is on a someone's own inner feelings, especially when described in a subdued way.
They tend to be skeptical of conversations about a person's potential to develop their abilities and character, and they don't like it when other people discuss them in this way.
They tend to look down on nuts-and-bolts, detailed work when striving for success.  Instead, they prefer to focus on vision and leadership.
They don't usually enjoy relaxed personal activities as much as competitive group activities.

There are a LOT of other commonalities and important distinctions, but I've taken up enough of your time, I believe.  Please let me know if you have any other questions; I'm happy to share what I know!"
1876,estp,"Oh you're so welcome!  I'm really happy to hear that. :)
(Just to clarify if anyone's reading this and doesn't know - ""Beta"" in socionics refers to people who value Se-Ni and Fe-Ti.  That means ESTP, ISTP, ENFJ, and INFJ.  It doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the concept of alpha or beta males!!!)
So, more music?  Sure, let's see...


Dagny - ""Backbeat"" is one of the most Beta pop songs you're gonna find that still feels modern.  Right now Gammas and Alphas are dominating pop music, so it's hard for Betas to gain a foothold on the charts.  Dagny is an ENFJ.  What you're looking for in Beta music is that it's quite optimistic (or moody), unabashedly emotionally expressive but without a great deal of complexity - we prefer a song to express one clear feeling, even if it's a fairly unique feeling.  In addition, it's almost inherently catchy.


Betas (and Deltas) were dominant in pop music during the late 80s, 90s, and early 00s.  A lot of that emo/angsty stuff in the early 00s was quite Beta - think Three Days Grace - ""Animal I Have Become"" (haven't officially typed the lead singer but he gives me ESTP vibes) or Evanescence - ""Bring Me to Life"" (Amy Lee is ENFJ).  Or beautiful Marilyn Manson (INFJ) with his ""This is the New Shit"".

Poor Miley Cyrus (ESTP) can't get a foothold in present-day pop culture, but her newer music like ""BB Talk"" and ""Dooo It"" are some great, fresh Beta songs & videos.
For some excellent catchy, heavier stuff, check out Nightwish - ""Ever Dream"" (this lead singer is ENFJ, main composer is INFJ) and The Pretty Reckless - ""Just Tonight"" (she's ISTP).  If you can tolerate Christian music, The Letter Black - ""Believe"" is a banger too.  Haven't officially typed her yet, but she's definitely a Beta.  But yeah, metal and (to a lesser extent) grunge are quite Beta genres all on their own.  I don't listen to much metal but I suspect you'd find a lot of Betas there, especially xSTPs.
Now.  IFFFFF you want some more upbeat shit, you're gonna have to go back a little farther.  '90s or so.  I believe the lead singer of Smashmouth - ""All Star"" is ESTP - usually I don't type just from music videos but I am almost positive.  Fountains of Wayne - ""Stacy's Mom"" is also definitely Fe, likely Se-Fe.  Just from the brief glimpses in the video, the lead singer seems STP, but of course I'd need to see more to tell.  Robyn - ""Call Your Girlfriend"" is kind of bittersweet upbeat too (she's ESTP).
Emmy Rossum - ""Slow Me Down"" (she's ESTP) is a nice example of Beta done softer haha.
I don't know about the producer Cash Cash, but the singer Sofia Reyes (ESTP) makes the song ""How to Love"" feel really Fe
Oh and of course, how can we forget Taylor Swift (ESTP)?  She likes to play at ESFJ and ESFP aesthetics a lot but she's coming out of her shell more and more lately.  Check out ""Bad Blood"" for almost embarrassing levels of Se, or ""Out of the Woods"" for something a bit more muted.
xSTPs are overrepresented in 90s and 00s rap, and in more alt rap today.  Se in particular tends toward the shocking and controversial as well.  Some great examples are Iggy Azalea - ""Mo Bounce"" (she's ISTP), Eminem - ""Lose Yourself"" (he's ISTP), or my favorites, Die Antwoord - ""Fatty Boom Boom"".  Ninja (the dude) is ESTP, I haven't officially typed Yolandi yet but I lean ISFP for her.  The band itself is quite Beta though.  They're playing characters, which does make it harder.

Full list of Beta musicians that I've typed (bands are of course harder but they tend to follow the frontman/lead singer in terms of music):
Amy Winehouse, Charlotte Martin, Dagny, Die Antwoord, Dixie Chicks, Eminem, Emmy Rossum, Evanescence, Frank Zappa, Goo Goo Dolls, Leonard Cohen, Machine Gun Kelly, Madonna, Marilyn Manson, Miles Davis, Miley Cyrus, Nightwish, The Pretty Reckless, Rachel Platten, Rage Against the Machine, Robin Thicke, Robyn, Snoop Dogg, Sofia Reyes, Sufjan Stevens, Taylor Swift, U2
(Also, Normani Kordei from Fifth Harmony is ENFJ, but the band seems more Gamma/ESFP to me.)
Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty more, but like I said for reasons above, they're fairly ""recessive"" right now in pop music.  But they should come back around starting in about 10 years or so if my theory holds true!
This got soooooooooo long, I'm sorry. O_O  I hope you found something enjoyable in there anyway!"

1878,estp,"I wish I could give gold! :D I am actually working on a very mild theory about functions and genres of music, so it comes as no surprise how hip hop artists you mentioned are xSTP as I had it related to Ti and Se already.
How do you go around typing songs? Or you determine the artists' type? What about artists and the songs written for them? For instance, there was a debate about Katy Perry's ""Dark Horse"" being ENFJ yet she herself is a completely different type. Thoughts?"
1879,estp,"To add up...
The entire reputation of the band is pretty asshole-ish, so I'd say you're probably right.
I do, and also found a lot of ""betas"" in the genre, especially you can see that at the concerts. I've been a huge metal fan for years, feels good to confirm ;D Have you thought about Slipknot? I have a few thoughts about them, interested to hear yours.
Ah what a musical journey, thanks again!"
1880,estp,"For songs the most I can usually say is that it shows off a particular function or two.  They're usually not developed enough to be a ""type"" per se.  But knowing the artist and the genre helps a lot.  For example there are several ENFP artists on the charts these days that make what I would call ""faux-ESFJ"" songs I guess, but that's mostly just because they're trying to imitate Ed Sheeran lol.
""Dark Horse"" as ENFJ-inspired makes sense.  Like everything Katy Perry touches, though, it feels fake and shallow to me (which is not to say I don't like any of her stuff - I do - but it just never seems quite genuine).  ""Roar"" is ripping of Sara Bareilles and could thus be called ESTJ-inspired; ""Rise"" also sees her trying to act like an ESTJ - it's common for types to try to imitate their beneficiary.  But yeah, she's most natural when she's just being ESFP haha.  ""This Is How We Do"" and ""Last Friday Night"" feel chill and unpretentious.  Omg and don't get me started on ""Chained to the Rhythm"", halp."
1881,estp,"You're so welcome!
Slipknot's hard!  Haha I tried to watch some videos but tbh it's late and they're too scary for me!! D:!!
Definitely Se-Ni though.  Let me watch an interview with the band and see if I can tell you...
Oh wtf their interviews are in scary masks too!  Lol!  It's really hard to type without seeing faces.
Best guess is that Jim is ISTP.
Mick is an introvert.
Chris is ??
Corey Taylor!  I found a video without his mask!  He's ESTP. 
So yeah I'd go for Beta as a band haha.  If you can find other unmasked interviews for the other members I can give them a shot.  It's just too hard when I can't see their faces!"
1882,estp,"Lol. Yeah. I think the system kinda sucks. First of all, there should definitely be more than 16 combinations of functions. Second, it's almost impossible to type yourself when we actually all have all the 8 functions in ourselves. Which are we using and when? It's all so metaphysical, and in that world, anything is possible, and it's all amalgamated together. Like trying to find a drop of water in the ocean. 🤷‍♂️"
1883,estp,"yeah, i agree with how anything is possible. but sort of don’t at the same time. since anything is possible & tbh we’ve only uncovered the tip of explanations for everything/anything, this theory would be valid in that sense right? paradox 😂😂 if u get what i mean. i don’t fully believe anything, but i don’t fully deny anything either. learnt that the hard way 🙂"
1884,estp,"no, i was replying to ur ""and in that world, anything is possible"" part. u & i, we also have limited info. we don't know anything, so they're just trying to uncover the hidden patterns within the limited info they have. whatever they're doing, it's a shot in the dark, even if there is a perceived pattern. guess & check, u know? so we may never get to know if our theories or answers are the actual truths. 
we will not know if this jungian psychology is leading us to the truth, so why deny it completely first? there hasn't been much to prove it, but there isn't much to disprove it either. 
in a sense, everything is an incomplete theory. why believe in science? or religion? it's the same thing. a chance at uncovering the real truth, even if the chances are very small. 
btw sorry if i sound hostile here or assuming u don't alr know this, i just want to explain myself clearly. i separated the sentences cause it was damn hard to look at "

1888,estp,"Just wondering if ESTP type people get crazy obsessed with video games? I know you're all about adventure and shit, but do people always prefer going out and scaling mountains and jumping off cliffs and stuff, or do you like fantasy adventures like being Link in the Legend of Zelda or being some crazy villain Rogue ganker in World of Warcraft?
I'd like a little more insight into ESTPs! Do you spend a lot of time on the internet, or do you prefer to be out in the real world doing whatever it is that you wanna do?
Thank you!!"
1889,estp,"Used to be quite into them. Never obsessed. Don't remember the last time I played a video game. 3+ years ago.
I prefer going and doing something. On my death bed I won't look and think ""oh remember that night I got a 25 person kill streak?""
On my death bed I'm going to look back on my life and think ""remember that night we went for a walk for no reason at all and we ended up on a boat to Ireland?"
1890,estp,"I prefer to be out and about travelling, but as a student I get stuck at home on the computer a lot. I used to play WoW for a bit but got kind of tired of how long it was :P I do like quest based games but now I just stick to shorter ones with good stories. Also my SO is really into gaming so I'll play Xbox things with him once in a while "
1891,estp,"I absolutely love vidya. I have gotten very addicted to some games (like the 800 hours I spent on Skyrim). I am however very prone on quitting MMOs because they required too much devotion from me. One-match type of games with friends are the best: COD:Zombies, Dota2, Little Big Planet, Civilization, Racing. But I do also like Adventure actiongames like Skyrim, Crysis, Infamous, GTA and Assassins Creed (i played all of which up until Unity)."
1892,estp,"I play like 4-5 times in a month. Mostly because I just don't have time for this, there are work and other fun things to do. But if I play, I take whole day off and play like 12 hours straight. I prefer shorter games not endless MMOs. 
Though I play AAA games like GTA, Portal, Farcry etc, I love to find new kind of puzzle games which tend to be flash/html5 games. I really want to play teamwork games like MOBA, but they have too long learning curve.
My favorite game is still AoE2, although I don't play it often.
I spend most of my free time outside in summer, but I need internet too."
1893,estp,"i have been playing dota / dota 2 on and off for about 10+ years now. all the other games just dont have that allure that dota does.
each match is different. games are always different. so many permutations. manages to catch my interest"
1894,estp,"Thanks once again for your insight!!
May I ask, have you ever suffered from depression? Sometimes I don't know whether I'm just a depressed ESTP going insane. I don't know.
But thank you once again for your reply."
1895,estp,"This is interesting. I've always thought myself as an INFJ, but when I got on anti-depressants, they turned me into a hyper-positive ESTP. I used to live my life in WoW because I was depressed. Sometimes I wonder if I'm just a depressed ESTP. Hmmmm."
1896,estp,"INFJ. Just extremely wish-washy and impossible to talk to. Trust me, I've tried. I usually can find a way to befriend anyone but there's something infuriating about INFJs that I haven't been able to figure out yet."
1897,estp,"On a very very surface level maybe infj, because we tend to have two opposite behaviours. Once we get deeper though and learn to know the person better, I'd say Infp would be the most infuriating... 
Infj, on the other hand, once you get passed the seemingly passive and ""disconnected""  nature, you may realise that you have a lot more in common with them... 
Hardest types to get along with on a deeper level: infp, estp, enfp
Easiest type to dig with: infj, isfj, intj"
1898,estp,"This is really exactly how we do it, because we've had a pretty flawless relationship thus far. She kinda keeps me grounded, so to speak. A little more well-rounded, because I definitely do like to have my crazy and stupid fun. Likewise, I drag her into the fire. Among other things, it just works. That being said, you must be very aware of it and communicate very, very well. ESTPs aren't great at working in relationships so to speak, so if I (we?) am not told of something she doesn't like pretty much instantly, chances are I'll never notice or anything and it'll become a problem. And the INFJ type can be very needy in a relationship, so that comes up relatively often. It isn't a problem, but it's a constant awareness thing"
1899,estp,"Sounds accurate based on what she tells me and how I read her
ESTP definitely need to be engaged or they'll leave. 
I'd say it has a lot to do with our sporadic nature and tendency to be on the ball when it comes to social interaction of any sort. You kind of have to plan ahead when talking to us, because we're going to be ready with a response every time and it's gonna be straightforward more than likely. 
That being said, your boyfriends sound like they don't recognize how your personality works and they don't try to work with its opposite nature, which is a problem. Make them aware of that and encourage cooperation and communication as much as possible. If they're unwilling or think it's too much, they're probably not the one for you"
1900,estp,"Hello all, INTP lady here, married to an ESTP guy. Was just wondering if you all could give me some insight into how best to motivate my fellow in regards to housework. I've worked out a few different ways to ask before but I never end up following through because I don't want to feel like I'm nagging. It's in both of our natures to not really notice clutter, or to let the house go without a good cleaning for long periods of time. But I'm trying to change that (2 kids and a dog will do that to you) and, being stuck in my own head a lot, I find myself resenting him when I feel that I'm bearing more of the load but I never know how to express it to him. Thanks y'all, any and all help is appreciated."
1901,estp,"""here is a list of things we need to do. I have already started on a few things but if you can help me with task 3 and 5, maybe we can go (play some lazer tag or have sex or some other example of a fun activity) tonight."
1902,estp,"Why not be straight up with him? Have you had communication issues in the past? 
In my personal experience, if someone asks me to do something; I'll always do it but on my own time. I hate it when someone asks for me to do something ""right now"""
1903,estp,"Looks like you have a lot of replies already, but I'll still tell you how I feel.
I love it when people are straight forward with me, when people, women especially start beating around the bush, I get tired of it very quickly and demand what is truly on your mind.
Don't beat around the bush.
I also hate when people give the silent treatment, or if they act like I'm supposed to know whats wrong."
1904,estp,"I find it easier to do things I don't like doing (like cooking) when we are doing it together. Maybe if your schedules work out you can do chores together and maybe ask him to think of one or two he doesn't mind doing that need to be done once a week at some point. Definitely communication is key though, let him know that you don't want to feel like your nagging but it is a shared responsibility that he needs to be a part of. "
1905,estp,"Look, no one likes to do housework, so the good news is you are on the same page.
Why not make a schedule of ""who is in charge of housework this week"" and stick it on the fridge? 
The responsibility is clearly divided so everyone will know who to blame when the house becomes a mess over a week."
1906,estp,"I personally feel it tends to activate our Ni and detach us temporarily from our Se, sometimes it can aid in relieving us from any stress we are under but it can also put us under a sense of paranoia since we are detached from Se and put into Ni.  "
1907,estp,Im the only one out of all my friends who actually gets quite hyper when I smoke . I become (even more) talkative and want to go on adventures lol. I tend to smoke while I’m out bc if I smoke before bed I can’t sleep. Even indicas . 
1908,estp,"I’m one to just eat a shitload and then just melt into the sofa enjoying some old school dubstep. I can get to a state that’s as close to lucid dreaming as I can manage. 
Oh I have riden the mountain bike up whistler while blasted. A line while baked off my ass is one of the best things I’ve ever done. "
1909,estp,"Interoverted intution is estps inferior function and when you smoke weed , your dominant function Se gets blocked and your Ni is used. Ni predicts and is also future focused and also interested in possibilities so when you get high your underdeveloped Ni is one dimensional  and negatively oriented to present you about things that might go wrong in the future and create paranoia. "
1910,estp,"The weirdest places - but enjoying every minute of it. I work in a library, a laundromat, and pet sit. Look for the ones with the odd jobs. We're usually pretty confident. Can be bitchy without trying to be. So, you happen upon us more than you seek us out. We are nowhere normal or particular. 
edit: female ESTP here"
1911,estp,"Yo where the girl ESTPs at? 
I’ve actually never met one, and just wanted to know if any are on here! 
If you are, just wondering. Do guys find your personality attractive? I feel like my ESTP type draws a lot of men to me because we’re generally adventurous and fun and pretty blunt and low drama, but I’m not sure if anyone else has noticed this in regards to gender. 
Also this post is not to sound conceited! We definitely have weaknesses as a type too. Just wanted to know if any other girl ESTPs read this and want to discuss the life experience of being a rare type, in regards to dating but also just other things as well since I feel like our type doesn’t lead us to follow our traditional gender role. "
1912,estp,"Met an estp girl a couple months ago. Instantly it's like we knew each other. Exactly like me but in a female form I swear. It's not that I found her looks attractive, although they were incredible, it was her personality I was drawn to.."
1913,estp,"I'm an ESTP female. I definitely get the sense that men can be into me regarding the ""bro"" side of my personality, but I am typically the one to decide if the relationship will be romantic or not, and I make that decision clear and stick to it. I can be very charming and bluntly flirtatious, but if I am not romantically interested, I will act extremely casual and uninviting to romantic advances.
I have an unreal number of platonic male friends. I love to hang out with ""frat bro"" types because they're fun as hell and are always down for anything, but don't find them necessarily challenging to me intellectually, or make me reconsider my perspective on...anything. So as a result I've dated social but nerdy engineers, consistently. I guess I just find them really interesting? I can't say. I love hanging with girls too, but we don't always care about the same things, and even if I enjoy partying with them a lot, they don't  seem fulfilled with my disinterest in basic girl stuff lol, so we drift easily.
​
In regards to dating history, I dated two super respectable ESTJs long-term pretty successfully, had one VERY fast-paced/fast-ending relationship with an ESFJ, and got really caught up on a brilliant and wildly fascinating ENTP (to this day still kind of am...the challenge, I guess). We had very similar values but our communication styles caused massive problems and we fought all the time, which is super not normal for me. Dude seriously made me crazy, beware of ENTPs lol.
​
In general, and this may DEFINITELY be flawed, I feel like I could get anyone I wanted if I really set my mind to it. Could be part of just being a woman. When a bf and I break up, I always find someone new pretty easily. But yeah, the ""unique"" ones are the only ones I ever actually seem to be interested in...but they aren't as fun or easy going?...it's an eternal struggle. In true ESTP fashion I have no fkn clue what I want "
1914,estp,"I'm here!  I'd say people do tend to find my personality attractive, sadly they usually don't find my appearance quite so attractive . . . But I've always had a wide friend group, both men and women, and my male friends often describe me as being ""like one of the guys."""
1915,estp,"I’m an 24f ESTP time and time again. I would say that a lot of men find me attractive and charming and it’s flattering to a certain point. The point is when you’re not interested in dating or hooking up and the men take that as a challenge. I’m generally a kind person so when these advances come my way, it takes some emotional energy to let that person know that I’m not available and I probably won’t be for a while. 
My relationship experiences have mostly been longer term, and I try to really get to know the person that I’m dating. I feel your dating history OP, that’s about the same as me. I find really intelligent people attractive and I like people who come off as very unique."
1916,estp,"I'm a female ESTP! Yeah, guys are often drawn to me because I'm so ""blunt and down to hangout."" But being down to hangout gets me in trouble cause sometimes guys like to assume you're down for... anything... when I'm really actually not smh. A lot of people say I'm really easy to talk to and they feel comfortable around me. I'm usually drawn to unique guys as well. When basically any guy can be drawn to you, only the unique ones are interesting lol. "
1917,estp,"I’m 20f ESTP-A! 
Most guys seem to really enjoy how confident I am. Eg: I lead the date (pick the restaurant, decide what to order, drop hints about what I want etc). 
I’m very outgoing and talkative, and all of my tinder dates compliment how they feel like I’m really easy to get along with. 
My boyfriend is great, he handles me taking on too much, or working late, or being the host of the party and not seeing him very often, really well. I think we’re a good match because there’s literally no gender roles in our relationship. He does the dishes, I build the flat pack furniture, (and if I need a work out, he’ll let me squat him haha). 
We made a loose verbal agreement that he’d stay at home and look after the kids (if we have them in the future), while I run my own business. 
Something that I’d love to ask the other female ESTPs is; 
Do you find it hard to find/make friends that you admire?
I know I’m very young, which can make it hard for me to find people that have that same ‘need to succeed’ complex I think a lot of ESTP have. Most of my friends always complement me and admire how hard I work, but I can never find young people who I can look up to! "
1918,estp,"Yes absolutely they find my personality attractive.
I’m actually an ESTPf (20) and I have a lot of guy friends because of it. I don’t actively look for guy friends, I’m actually just friendly with everyone. But it’s just that the people I’m with tend to be guys because we share the same hobbies and attitude (computers, video games, business, drifting cars, hiking, etc). 
Of my relationships, the types that tend to fall for me tend to ironically be IxTJs. But they comment that I’m very honest, chill, and not afraid to defend myself, intellectually stimulating to them, and a savage meme master. It’s just communication issues where it ends up not working out because we have different standards for each other and I’m still in college so I have to push them away sometimes :/
Anyways hopefully this helps anyone
Still looking for an ENTPm though LOL "
1919,estp,"Hi I am one as well.
Men are either wildly attracted to me or afraid. I've had good relationships with ENFP and a weirdly strange attraction with INTJ. I met an ESTP guy once and I think we could have been perfect together, as friends at the very least. I miss him but he lives halfway around the world. "
1920,estp,"here yo! I have a female best friend who’s ESTP and she rocks.  
Male ESTPs are usually annoying dicks and love themselves way too much. I can’t trust them because I know how they think. They’re fun tho until they’re annoying "
1921,estp,"ESTP woman here. Hell yes, men still find my personality attractive (I’m 55). I hate drama, but love excitement. I’m happily in an open relationship with my INFP partner.
Like others posting here, I have lots of male friends (am totally “one of the guys”), have a hella time relating to other women, am attracted to nerdy computer engineers."
1922,estp,"THIS IS SO RELATABLE! I should’ve probably guessed that I would be able to relate to a lot of the girl ESTP answers because we are the same personality type, but what everyone has said has been so much more similar to me than I really imagined. 
I have a lot of boy friends too, own frat at my school actually tried to see if I could join their fear lol. I love hanging with them because they’re chill and not dramatic (I can’t do drama at all), but like you said very few actually intellectually stimulated me. So I dated a math geek software analyst for awhile. I’m always drawn to engineer/computer nerd types, the social ones though. If there’s one thing that is most important for me to be attracted to someone, it’s intelligence. 
I need to be better about letting my guy friends know when I don’t want to hook up/anything more than friends. Good for you for making that clear and being quick to be cold to those advances. I find myself always wanting to people please in the situation and I’m a charming person (as I bet you are) which makes me come off as pretty flirty as well, and I just am kind of flirty. It’s ruined some great friendships though because a lot of guys feel led on, so I need to be more like you there! 
With girls I can party and have fun, or have like movie/wine nights, but what always prevents the bonds from getting too deep is that they just aren’t down for many of the adventures or risks. And I can’t do drama, like I said, and overly emotional conversations just kinda lose my interest. Also I’ve found it really hard to comfort girls, I feel really out of my element there probably because of the T part of ESTP and not the F. 
The guy that I’ve connected with more than anyone ever was an ENTP. Met him on a week long vacation. We had our first conversation and we talked until 6am, we just kept going on about philosophy and theories and stories, it was so natural. I found his mind fascinating. We talked every day and night and never ran out of stimulating topics, but then once the week was over we had to part ways. I wonder how dating would’ve been given the differences in our personalities. Crazy that we were both fascinated with ENTPs. I wonder how consistent that trend is. 
I feel the same way about being able to get anyone you set your mind to getting, I hate how self centered that sounds! But based on trying to get guys in the past it rings true, and I’m normally the one to end a relationship. Like you, I only go for the interesting guys. I agree that most of them aren’t as fun/easygoing. Trying to find a fun/risky and unique and intelligent person led to me dating a few drug dealers/ex criminals and going for the “bad boy” type in high school, and damn was that a bad decision! Now I stay away from them but try to go for “good guys” ugh but good guys just aren’t fun. Recently dated an ENFP who was great in a lot of ways, but never took initiative in our relationship and was just a little too normal for me. 
I just feel like it’s so hard to find someone to match my energy. 
And, just like you, I have no idea what I want either. I also feel like since we can get most guys, it makes it so much easier to let go of relationships and move on to try to find something better. Sometimes I just feel like I’ll never be satisfied, but then the logical side of me kicks in and figures there’s gotta be a lot of people out of the billions that I could be happy with. 
Do you feel like you can find someone and be happy and stay married to them forever? 
I feel like even if I found an amazing person I would still get “bored” eventually or wonder what else is out there. "
1923,estp,Honestly as girls I feel like we are always doomed to a bad type lmao. Of my 6 exes 5 of them had mental disorders that made them horrible partners but they were super smart and I found them fascinating and that’s why I dated them - so it’s not just you choosing the bad guys! I was just wondering with people in general if they seem to comment on whether or not you seem more adventurous than other girls or whatnot 
1924,estp,"Exactly, it is always hard to get them to truly back off. 
I also have found that men “fall” really fast. They say they’ve never felt this way with someone, and most of them are like really willing to prove it by getting way too serious. These are the normal people too that I’ve had things with, not just the oddballs lol. 
I started just saying I’m into women to get them to back off, but sadly I’ve realized even that doesn’t work. Most men think their dick really has the power to change a lesbian into a straight person, as sad as it is! The male ego does some funny things. "
1925,estp,"SAME!!!! Okay I resonate with this so much. Especially the part about “down for...anything.” Like yeah I’m down to cliff jump with you or visit you if you live in a dif country or state for a trip or go on any random or crazy adventure but just because of that it does not mean I want to fuck you in all of those places too! 
I do think it’s true about the unique ones too. My last boyfriend was the first “normal” one, because I was trying to break the trend, and ultimately we broke up because I wasn’t stimulated enough. It’s a hard balance :/ "
1926,estp,"This is so eye opening, because I relate to a lot of this as well! 
Tinder dates are the same for me. I don’t think I’ve ever had one go “bad” from their point of view (even if I might have not loved it). I generally take charge too, and I’ve ended 2 relationships because it eventually got frustrating and I felt like I was putting in more effort than them in terms of planning all the dates and everything. Maybe that isn’t so much their fault in retrospect? 
I need a relationship without gender roles!!! I actually am bi and just started dating women too because I find that generally I might be more compatible to them? 
Yes, I do. I have guy friends that I do activities with, and very few girl friends that I go to for emotional support, but I’d say I only have 3 friends I admire. After 21 years. It’s hard to find a mix of stimulating, challenging, intelligent, adventurous, and risky that isn’t a convict or like psychopath or “bad” person. IMO. 
I also think with our success attitude, it makes it harder to relate to people our age. The people I click with the most are normally 3-5 years older than me, sometimes more. And they’re always surprised to hear my real age because they say I’m very mature. I think that’s due to my high level of contemplation! "
1927,estp,"In my last long ass comment to wittyfulfillment I told my story of the ENTP I met, he was really dope and we could talk for hours. Never have clicked with someone like that before. But also wittyfulfillment warned against them, so many our types clash sometimes in a relationship. The one thing I noticed with him is I feel like if we dated we would be very up in space and not really grounded because we talked about far out shit, but also I’ve never felt something like that with someone 
UGH I WANT GIRL ESTPS FRIENDS SO BAD! All my friends are guys too, because of shared hobbies and the “chill” factor, but all of you girl ESTPs sound so cool. I feel like a girl ESTP friend group would just be so badass, lol all the guys would be droolin 
When you say you’re in college so you have to push them away, what do you mean by that? 
Asking because I feel I do that too, for me the reason being that I’m not really set up in my life yet (I’m 21 and just graduating) and I feel like I can’t settle down at all yet. "
1928,estp,"In response to your marriage idea, I'd say I'm way more sold on the idea of a family than a husband, and this makes no sense. I say all the time I'll probably never get married but I don't even know if I mean that or not. I'd love having kids and being married to a best friend, but yeah it would REALLY take the right person. And idk what I'm really looking for still so we'll see what the world throws at me lol."
1929,estp,"E - Extrovert
S - Sensing (Observant people)
T - Thinking (Logical thinkers rather than feelings based)
P vs J - no clue
I don’t really try and figure people out but I tend to prefer people with the top two"
1930,estp,"Exactly, it is a hard balance! Hahaha all my friends think my bfs are weird and they know a lot of times like I have the opportunity to go for someone normal and decently attractive but yet I go for the unattractive potential criminal genius guy instead, or the super smart but depressed chain smoker. Lol it’s bad, but someday I’m hoping I’ll come across an interesting yet somewhat “safe” guy! We’ll see😂"
1931,estp,"I am an INFJ looking for some inspiration from ESTPs. As you may know INFJ's inferior function is Se. In my case it not developped at all. I often feel too flighty and untied to the present reality, I would really benefit from being more assertive, persuading. 
So my questions is, ESTPs show me how your Se is working. Some life examples? "
1932,estp,"YEEEE Buddy. 
Se is literally JUST DO IT. The thing is, since it's dominant often I don't think about it. It manifests in us having a thought and reacting. It's a very 'sensor' type thing too, we have an idea so why would we need more?
For me, I often find that I bypass my auxiliary (Ti) for it. This has personally caused me problems because of the Se-Fe loop-- It has made me a bitch to be around, but it's something I'm working through.
Act first, think later. I imagine you view it as fairly careless and it can be and especially when you have not developed it to act appropriately. 
I find myself fairly reactionary. Press the button to see how it works. Do stuff to understand. When interacting with N-types I've found that I NEED specific examples to understand a concept fully. 
As for becoming different, I could only recommend being around an ESTP that you like(and likes you). I love most of the INFJs I've met but I find them getting easily frustrated with me combined with simply not understanding my thought process. There seems to be minimal respect for the way I think which hurts. This is pertaining to the couple friendshipss I've had with INFJs(which I've burned with the Se-Fe loop). Overall, I am super super super attracted to due to a LARGE amount of intrigue for the type generally. The large differences appear to make it easy to have friction though.
I don't know, I just kind of typed different thoughts on this. I would love for another ESTP to post so I can compare the type vs just what is shitty about me haha.
Also, if you have any specific questions(mostly to arrange my thoughts and actually give you something useful) I can easily answer those.."
1933,estp,"I see an apple in front of me. At the same time a man is pointing his gun at my head. I'm hungry. So I ask the man to kindly bring the apple to me so I can eat it.
I drop an apple on the ground. I quickly look around. I see nobody. I pick it up, wipe it off and eat it as if nothing has happened.
I finish my apple. I see a trash can. So I (have to) throw it. "
1934,estp,"Wow, this really helps, you have no idea! Actually accroding to socionics INFJ and ESTP are duals so that means even though thought processes are different they can really benefit from communication. 
My inferior Se is just soking up everything related to it, even in the form of a text post :)
Yes, I do have questions. How do I become more assertive at work? I often find myself being critiqued by colleagues for the same stuff that I wouldn't critique them for. So for instance if they make a mistake I'll just fix it my self, rather than starting an argument. But they prefer to discuss it thoroughly, and it turns out that I am the one to blame :( What would you do?"
1935,estp,"Question for you too then, I don't know if you're a guy or girl but what do you think INFJs typically find attractive? Is there any way to persuade an INFJ to rethink who you are? 
Truthfully, I don't know how much acting out of the inferior function helps in any case. Depending on how old you are/how developed tertiary is etc. 
In that case, I would really try to not take it personally I find that due to the skipping to Fe I can really turn around and tear apart people with Ti. At this point in my life its really about taking that criticism with Ti to understand it.
I am a very confrontational person, and I probably would confront. If I'm 100% in the wrong, I would try to express my hurt if I believed they would validate it. If not, I would mentally tell them to fuck off. 
I don't know how much I believe the cognitive function theory dominates, but by it I would suggest trying to find a solution that uses your strengths. I've learned it the hard way-- that getting stuck in a situation with being forced to use your inferior function results in bad things. For me, I become very much like an animal in a corner. 
Being more assertive for the sake of assertion will be hard, but if you could explain that you're hurt by the way they brought it up they might hear you better. Also from Ti that would help a lot too. I have NO idea how Ni works.. This is the largest source of confusion for me. 
Perhaps you could find a colleague that will relate to you on a more similar level. Is this issue with a specific person or couple of people? Because people are dicks, and lots of the time they aren't even trying to-- they are just careless :(."
1936,estp,"I'll answer your first question,
What I like is someone with whom I can discuss - well more listen and learn than really speak myself - for hours. However the subject have to be at least somewhat interesting for me, this is pretty much anything that you are passioned into which is not gossip or idle chat and small talk.
Our type is really attracted for people that are able to give them lectures on unexpected topics.
If you want someone to rethink his opinion of you, you'll need to provide strong evidence that he  was wrong and surprise him enough to make him reconsider his opinions."
1937,estp,"I am a girl, what are you?
Thanks for advice. I guess it is the problem with one of the colleagues in particular but also it is in general my problem. I often try to avoid confrontation even at the expense of my interests. That is realy annoying, and I am trying to work it out. 
Using one's strength is a very good tip. I already do that. For instance I often try to maintain great relations with the boss, understand them, sort of connect with them on a human level, not only as co-workers, show off a little. This has saved me in the past))
As for your question, about what INFJ's find attractive, I would say a lot of things you told about ESTPs I find quite attractive. Like living in the moment, and doing before thinking. INFJs also value intelligence. And since many INFJs are artsy and creative, they value someone who is knowledgable in this area or at least has an interest in it or has some philosophical thoughts and can ruminate on some deep meaning of life questions... :) 
As for persuading INFJ to rethink who you are... I don't really know. We can be very stuck with our opinions about people sometimes. Especially ones who we don't care about. (I often find myself putting labels on people: ""bitch"", ""indecisive loser"", ""great mind"", ""drinks to much"", may be because I want to save time and not think about them. Because when I have time and energy for that I can get very deep and think too much about people, reasons for their actions, their characters...) But when I care about people or am curious about them, I am very open-minded. If you want to persuade some INFJ in your life to rethink who you are, just show it to him/her. For instance if you hung out one on one before, try to interact with him/her when you are among people. Or talk about the topic that you never talked about. Provide new information! Make them curious.
You can ask me questions about Ni by the way. I would also love to verbalize for myself how that works in me.  "
1938,estp,"you should focus on your NI-Fe not you se, se is more of a filter for your Ni-Fe not really it own stand alone function like the first two. now if you were a estp, asking the same question i would say work on your Se. an example of what i mean; I'm an entp Ne-Ti-Fe-Si. my Ne helps me to generate Ideas, or causes me to be fascinated with things (what looks like ""enpt ADHD"" but is really taking in data), my TI helps me analyze this data; is it true, then why, why not, and does it pass my internal concept of logic. these first 2 functions are like the (Ne) research and  (Ti)manufacturing part of my brain, then we go to Fe for advertising, this is why entps are so damn charismatic but its not creating or changing the idea, just how i present it. is it funny? or serious, can i use this to make someone feel good? or inspire someone to improve intellectually? finally we have ""marketing"" (how is this product unique and thus valuable) Si, Si is a traditionalist function, call an entp what you like, but no one has ever accused us of being traditional. so at first this sounds like our weakest function, so weak it's not even present in our personality. unless you know how a entp uses tradition, we store it, save it almost like compiling a database of things ""as we know them"" (subjective traditions- how the thing should be or idea is or has been historically to me). our Ne does not work without or Si, in that if we didn't know how things should be, we wouldn't know when thing are new or different, this is the reason people say we are innovators or problem solvers. my point is that the only way to strengthen my Si is to use my Ne. it works the same way for you. the reason people think INfj's are ""clairvoyant""  is because your Ni is a more precise intuition than my Ne, but when turned on a person, your mind is reading subconscious body language and facial movements (ones that are lost to me as a Si user)  your Ni would not work without these automatic observations, if you didn't have Se you wouldnt have this data base of what each muscle twitch of the eyes means, when someone is lying to you. your Ni needs to compare off of your Se, it figure out what is happening in the present. this happens so fast you may not even know that all of that occured, (i didnt with my Ni-Si) so you must use your Ni to bring in more information about ""people"" movement, actions, motives  etc. and your Se will grow accordingly. 
also this is just your Ni-Fe at work, you are not a lazy thinker, you are just unique in this way from every other ""type"" that is your intuition labeling them as thinker, bitch, etc. other people may make quick judgements about people but not as accurately or as usefully as Infj's and definitely not as fast. though since your perception of people is usually spot on, changing initial impression of someone, (from my experiences with infj's) is mostly a futile endeavor. it would like doing a science experiment, not getting the results you expected, and then deciding to go back and change the experimental design to get the results you wanted. these new results may look right on paper, but they will never feel right to you and these feelings will show in your interactions."
1939,estp,"Hey guys, I am an xNFJ friend of one of you, amazing ESTPs. I clearly see what my friend is going through right now. In short, it has to do with some job and friendship related struggles. I know that the best way to help an ESTP with those struggles is to leave him alone with finding a solution to problems. Also ""talking emotions"" isn't really the best way I can help an ESTP to feel better. I don't want to be a friend-psychologist as I usually am with the other types. The only way I can help is to be a ""cheerleader"" friend. 
Any ideas? What would be the best way to help a friends self-esteem? What boosts your self-esteem?"
1940,estp,"It will come by itself. I think deep down most Estps just seek to be accepted. Being a cheerleader is cool, but just listening to that person and saying ""I accept you"" is one of the best gestures you could ever achieve. 
Fi polar can mean ""I don't deserve love"" 
Unless he's too stubborn and will push you away. :) Good luck!!!"
1941,estp,"Just invite him/her out to do something, talk to them about mundane stuff, and don't respond positively to negative responses. Just kind of ignore them and move onto new topics instead of trying to cheerlead the negative thought away. You won't be able to anyways. Talking emotions isn't a horrible idea. Just don't beat around the bush if you're going to do it. And maybe explain why it makes you feel bad when they're down, instead of simply asking why they feel down. Chances are, if their self esteem is low, it's because they have doubts about what others think about them, not doubts about themselves. So trying to get to the bottom of their emotions is a lot less useful than showing them yours."
1942,estp,I had this in mind. So would you say I should give it a try? Telling what my emotions are and make it sound like a self-esteem kick start?
1943,estp,"Yeah, just be careful about trying to make it sound like anything. If it's upsetting you that they're down, then tell them that. Don't sugarcoat it or they'll probably sense something's off. If they sense you're faking an emotion, then they will too and you'll have wasted your time."
1944,estp,"He is an F1 driver known for his team radio phrase ""Leave me alone I know what I'm doing"". The more you know :)"
1945,estp,"Well, thanks! Introspection helps a lot. It gives some time and room to understand who I am and what the fuck I'm doing. The most difficult part is not to be too harsh on myself. (quite Estp thingy, or Beta in general I'd say) 
Question though: genuine help out of friendship or is there something else? 
Translation: Classic INFJS help, being nice and understanding because humans are interesting creatures, or deeper layer of infj,  the one that truly cares about the other?
(I'm not judging nor accusing, it's for my personal data lol) "
1946,estp,"Tell me about it. I bet it's how we are Fe-ing throughout the life.
Not at all, I am happy to introspect as to why I posted this question too! So thanks for asking haha
The answer is long because I haven't delved into this yet myself. Yes, humans are interesting creatures, I genuinely love people and care about everyone on a very very intimate level. However, right now I am at the point in my life when taking care of myself is my first priority. As an xNFJ, I learned that sometimes giving people space IS the best way I can help. xSTP types usually are autonomous in solving their issues.
So to answer you, ESTP I am referring to really does have a special place in my life :) I used to (and still do) have deep feelings for my ESTP friend, but candid confessions are not what both of us need or want. My intuition tells me he is afraid of rejection and afraid of feeling loved, but having an avoidant relationship style does not help him in building a stronger bond with people around him. He looks confident, of course, which is why people do not consider he may have any problems with building strong lasting friendships. It's a loop for him that only he can break. I see genuine beauty in him and his personality. He deserves a lot more than he struggles with at this time in his life. But again, I can only help by 1) not intervening too much and 2) cheerleading from a distance. "
1947,estp,"3) whatever happens, showing you accept him.
That was beautiful and it felt genuine.  Waow! You're bringing hope back in me. I've been hurt deeply by an Infj recently,  and now we both pretend we're ok but deep down we hate each other. It's fakeness at its best and I have a really hard time handling our interactions. She fake smiles,we don't speak, but she keeps saying ""It's ok"". Makes me wanna vomit.
Same circle of friends so we do bump onto each other on a regular basis...
Thank you so much,  for showing me there are genuine people out there.
Yeah, I think you're on the right track. Growth for INFJs is embracing their little Estps inside.  Maybe do too much, make some mistakes and learn. Rinse and repeat, until you know the right balance between being an ear for others and trusting yourself. 
Maybe be a bit careful, I know 2 INFJs now who are stuck on their crush and nothing seems to move forward.
You seem to be delightful human being, keep it that way :)"
1948,estp,"This sounds like a torture tbh. Both of you clearly understand the shitshow but have to keep the status quo for the harmony of the shared social circle. Fucking hell. Of course, time apart would have helped to process the past experience for you and even her :/ Well, brace yourself there.
You do know INFJs haha gladly I have strong Fe and Se. Keyword: emotional binges and self-love/self-acceptance. Also, how the hell do you know so many INFJs :D hahah
And thank you for the kind words. Really something I needed to hear today :)"
1949,estp,"I found this especially true to my multitude of friends I had in highschool. After college, they become a completely different person and I no longer become friends with them. It's only the friends that really share the same characteristics, that I am still friends with."
1950,estp,"Change is normal it’s for the b-est. you don’t love the same things we loved in preschool, same favorite foods , same favorite activities. we all change it’s just the friends that stayed the same that we leave behind , the friends that don’t develop with us, can’t hangout because they’re in the same shitty jobs. Those are the ones we leave behind."
1951,estp,Wow! It’s exactly the same with me. I hate it when people change. I don’t believe in that shit. Just act normal and be yourself. I understand that you become more confident or more social or something. But i have seen friends from me turn into complete hippies in literally one day. 
1952,estp,"Yeah some friends change for the better, and some for the worse. But some change in a way that they no longer want to hang out with you, because you aren't their ""type"" anymore. It really bothers me, as if they forget everything we used to do together."
1953,estp,"The only real requirement I have is that you can have a Skype/Hangouts-call (with cam!), so I can get a feel for you.
I don't really need much beyond that, I think any and all questions not covered here I can just bring up in that call. Any questions you have for me you can feel free to ask.
I will try to chip in what I can when it comes to anything beyond the travel-costs, but I honestly can't promise anything. I don't have a lot of money to work with in the first place. 
I at least have myself, and hopefully that will be enough.
So, ""Who am I to demand that you pay?"" 
Really, this is entirely up to you. If you don't want to do it then you don't have to, simple as that. I just thought I'd put this out there for anyone who thinks this would be a cool thing to do.
I don't really know what else to add, if you guys have any questions then feel free to ask and I'll try to reply as best I can. I don't see this having to be something complicated or big, so I'm trying to keep it short.
Now then, ""Who am I?""
My name is Sara, I'm 22 and I currently live in Sweden. I guess mentioning that I'm an INFJ would be relevant too.   
I've traveled a few times in my life, and looking back on it I realized that those times were among the best of my life.
I really enjoy making music, drawing, writing, and taking pictures, and I try to do one thing or another as often as I can (even though I'm not actually particularly good at any of those things yet, still working on it).
If there's anything in life I love, it's experiences. I love walking out late at night to a lake and sitting down to look at the stars. I love walking around town and exploring, going down an alley I've never seen before, and finding a restaurant I've never eaten at before. I love sitting down next to a homeless man in a park just to play chess with them and listen to them tell me their story.
I also love cuddling into a sofa with a ton of blankets and pillows, finding a new movie to watch and then discussing the movie both while watching it and afterwards as well. I also love finding a new recipe, getting all the ingredients and trying to make something delicious while making the kitchen a mess. I also love walking around a festival, going to a stage where a band I've never heard before is playing, and getting myself lost in the energy of the crowd.
And I love the little things, like stopping to pet every dog I walk by, or trying to make a cashier's day a little bit nicer by smiling at them. Or picking up some trash off the street and putting into a bin, or holding open doors for anyone who needs it. Or sitting down at 5am with a complete stranger, and giving them some heartfelt advice about life after they've drunkenly told me their story.
I think most of all, I love writing, as you can probably tell by this long tangent. I love sharing all of the things I see and experience, because I know that all of these things make me really happy and all I really want is to make other people just as happy too.
That's why I so desperately want to travel, because I want to see everything that life has to offer, so that I'll have more things to share.
I don't really know what else to say about me to be honest. Those are things I feel is the most important to me. There's a lot more to me, but I'm sure we'll get to that all in due time.

This is a crazy idea, I understand that, but I just hope that there's someone out there who's just as crazy as me.
Comment or PM me, and tell me a little about yourself.
This is a genuine offer to anyone who's willing to take it.
Thanks for reading."
1954,estp,"Ok, I just deleted my rant regarding my estp brother. He's constantly  asking me for money.
Your free ride request is very dangerous imo.  That being said, what are your hopes? I wish you safe journey, be careful.  "
1955,estp,"Hi, I was wondering what you like or dislike about INFJs. Have you had significant problems with them? Do you trust or distrust them? Overall, what is your impression? 
Are they like a threat or too personal too fast? If you got to know one more personally, what did you find? Did you get angry with them or did you find a real friend? 
I just don't know what the reality is for the ESTP-INFJ combination. It probably depends on the individuals, but I keep reading that it is supposed to be either the greatest or the absolute worst, and I don't know what to believe, so I came here to ask you guys about it. 
They say that one's greatest strengths are the other's greatest weaknesses. Assuming that that is true, would you consider the INFJ's strengths as a major benefit to you? What do you offer the INFJ in return?
I've met two ESTPs, but I kept them at a distance and never got to know them and now I kind of regret it because it might have been interesting. I was too afraid I guess. But I am curious. Thanks. "
1956,estp,"My childhood friend is an INFJ. We get along beautifully for the most part, but maybe that's just a byproduct of having known each other for so long. 
There are certain parts of her personality that annoy me - for instance, she doesn't know when to give up on toxic people. It's funny though; she on the other hand accuses me of giving up too quickly. In my defense, I am more utilitarian with my efforts and know when to cut my losses. I don't try to ""fix"" people. If someone isn't contributing to my life in a positive way, and is also a pain in the ass to deal with - then why should I keep them around? 
Which brings me to my next point about trying to change others; I've noticed that she has a tendency to do that. I know I myself am far from perfect, and what is best for me may not necessarily or objectively be good for someone else. 
However, my weaknesses are her strengths. She can read people on a much deeper level than I can; it's hard for me to describe. She's also much more careful and meticulous than I am, lol. I'm all about jumping right in to get the task over with, but for her, everything must be done with painstaking perfection. Hope this helps!  "
1957,estp,"INFJ's are good people, my grandmother is an a INFJ. They can be idealistic in my opinion and usually are not fit for public office (ex: 39th US President Jimmy Carter, he was very naive and easily manipulated) due to the fact that they are too kind and try to ""change"" people or change systems that really have no way of changing. But what I do like them is that they bring kindness and that they are genuinely good and (mostly) incorruptible people who stand by their morals no matter the circumstances. 
I see INFJ's strentghs very useful, kind and nicely organized. God bless you all and please keep bringing kindness in this cruel world."
1958,estp,"It honestly depends. I am an INFJ and was bullied heavily by mostly ESTPs in school. However, that was also because I was an ethnic minority so it made me an ""easier"" target. My brother is an ESTP and we get along really well."
1959,estp,"Before I discovered the MBTI, I actually felt dumber than him because he notices EVERYTHING and he is liked by everyone, which kind of made me extremely jealous. However, after leaning about the difference between sensing and intuitive intelligence, I started appreciating my own intelligence while kind of underestimating his. We don't really argue much (because of our Fe). He's rarely home, and I'm home 24/7 lol. He didn't understand my introversion and he still doesn't. He also has zero interest in the MBTI. Pretty sure we both find each other to be utterly boring.
TL;DR we are both extremely different yet we never had any major arguments because of our Fe. Even if we have fights, we are both quick to forgive and forget. "
1960,estp,"Update: I actually had to end our friendship recently. Long story short, she went through a breakup and it changed her personality drastically. She became extremely critical of me, pointing out trivial things that she didn't like about me (such as my sense of style, my food preferences, mannerisms, etc). I couldn't tolerate this new controlling version of her, plus she started playing devil's advocate whenever I told her about my problems. She hasn't contacted me since I stopped talking to her, so she doesn't see anything wrong with how she had been treating me. I would hope that not all INFJ's have Princess Syndrome. "
1961,estp,I've just lost a great friend too of 10 years. I'm a estp. She's a infj. She had a breakdown & she changed and started to accuse me of all manner of stuff. After the 8th time of forgiving her & her shifting her rage to something else I had to boundary her & cut my losses. Really sad times - hoping one day she'll  feel better about herself but she's not mine to fix. 
1962,estp,"Wow, our stories are nearly identical.. I think we made the right decision by cutting off these toxic people. it's a shame because we've known them for so long. maybe the differences in our personalities became so pronounced over time that we can no longer reconcile our conflicts. Like you said, not our job to fix them. "
1963,estp,"I find it to be boring, I've done the pump and dump kind of dates and after a while it got dull for me.
I prefer long term relationships and I usually do dates around noon so we have plenty of time to drink and talk"
1964,estp,"Go do stuff, join a class, play a sport, anything that's an activity in a group. Meet people, make friends, see if you're interested in anyone you meet, ask them out. Keep asking them out if it's going well."
1965,estp,"I generally don't worry about my height, I mean there's nothing I can do about it. I think you're on to something with the profile/photos tho. I mean I'm smiling in most of my photos and I'm as confident as I can be but I'm not a supermodel, nor do I have a professional photographer taking photos of me. I hear people say: ""be yourself"" and ""be confident"" but really I can't do both. I'm pretty fucked up in the head and depressed from a number of factors outside of relationships"
1966,estp,"I always find ""be yourself"" is terrible advice. Be the person your ideal partner would want. There is nothing fake about that. Self improvement is important. My ideal partner doesnt want a fat lazy slob who sits around all day on reddit. I go to the gym, I read, I get things done, I try to be interesting.
I dont think there is a stigma with online dating. Meet up with a female friend and go, I am failing hard with my online dating, can you help me out? Should I get better photos, better clothes, is my profile shit? What I am missing. Partner with someone."
1967,estp,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?
Thank you!"
1968,estp,"These articles will give you a general outline of how romantic behavior varies by type (they flip j/p for introverts, so their INFp is MBTI INFJ, while extraverts stay same): Erotic Attitudes & Romantic and Sexual Behavior of Quadras and Subtypes."
1969,estp,"PoLR is a socionics abbreviation for ""point of least resistance"" also called the vulnerable or painful functions. This function is considered to be a kind of blindspot in a person's psyche, something a person blatantly ignores, but that is visible to people who have that function as a strong one. For both ENTP and ESFP that function is Fi which creates certain relational problems for both types: Fi PoLR for ENTP and Fi PoLR for ESTP."
1970,estp,"I took the test recently and found that my results fell exactly in line with the qualities of ESTP. (No surprise, as I am an ESTP, but I know that some people's results didn't fall quite as exactly in line with their type.)
My strengths:
1. Woo
2. Activator
3. Maximizer
4. Communication
5. Positivity
Have any of you taken this test as well and gotten similar/different results?"

1972,estp,"ESTPs are known as these badass, cool guys with great people skills. Now maybe it's not true for all ESTPs, but most of you for sure is better than me when it comes to dealing with people.
INTP here, I just can't seem to find my niche. I always feel like I don't fit in. Given that I don't really like conversing with people very much, but I don't look like someone who doesn't give a fuck. I just look like a loner.
Well the thing is, I do give a fuck. When I am already with someone, I just act awkwardly, I tend to ""overcompensate"" on some things like being too friendly and accepting. I feel like when I don't I am doing something wrong somehow. I sometimes can't say no and when I feel like ""oops, I don't want to do this"" I can't help but just suck it up. How do you get around these types of situations?"
1973,estp,"If you don’t like conversing with people but want connections...you’re gonna have a bad time. 
XSTP here. I don’t care for small talk but I recognize it’s necessary as a means to an end. 
Sometimes that small talk leads to better and further connections. 
I do give a fuck about most things. Just not about people that aren’t worth giving a fuck over. How do I differentiate? 
Can they help me? Can I learn from them? Do I need them? Do I enjoy them as people? Then they serve a purpose and that in turn helps me. So win/win. 
If they don’t then no need to be impolite but no need to care enough to exert effort. "
1974,estp,"It's unreasonable and unrealistic to care about everyone and everything
When making a new connection, initially it's motivated by that person providing my life with something I like and want more of, or need. It grows from that, but it starts that way. I try to reciprocate as well. When that ends, it's over
If someone has demonstrated they're unwilling to help themselves, I feel for them but don't do anything to help them because they've proven to me it's a waste of time. I'll try up until that point
Confidence is a huge part of any and all of this 
Does that help?"
1975,estp,"I think it could be due to our Se and our strong hold over reality and what is , so it helps us take the right decision and make right moves when with people and to access them well and not care even if it means to hurt or not obey any rule or be overly friendly and docile whomever  it might be. 
With intp with your weak Se I think you guys are either too submissive or too agressive without a true balance and moderation for what is needed for when . 
Se blindness:
The individual tends to overreact to aggressive or confrontational behavior, taking it as a personal threat when it may only be a knee-jerk reaction or the result of a bad mood.
He tends to avoid intruding on others' space or engaging in behavior that may be perceived as coercive, and tries hard to handle his needs by being disciplined and well-prepared himself - rather than relying on others to do things for him. If these strategies fail, his efforts at dealing with the resulting conflict make him look actively pushy in a way that appears awkward and unnatural to others. This opens him up to painful criticism and feelings of weakness and helplessness.
He is able to moralize and instruct others about what they should do and why, but he is not prepared for others' active resistance or refusal to do as he says. In his mind, this would require him to put aside reason and good feelings and simply make the other person do what is necessary. This is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for him to do."""
1976,estp,"I used to act like a straight-up INTP, and I understand what you meant in terms of being aware of how odd I feel. At some point, I realized how much people danced for social normalcy and how funny it was. I just started acting like myself afterward, disregarding rules I didn’t feel like following and being the brash and “cool” ESTP. I reasoned that I wasn’t the weird one so long as everyone else did stuff out of their comfort zone just to fit in."
1977,estp,"The thing is, if I will just be myself I don't really care about connections. I tend to be passive, but when I start to talk with someone this passiveness goes away and I become a different person. I become even worse when this person and I start to hang out more often. I know a lot of people that I don't really want to be with (realizing that I don't enjoy their company that much) but now I don't know how to say no when they ask me to join without being a dick. What happens mostly is just me going on a different life path and doing the purging. They will be like WTF?? but in reality I have already planned to cut them waaay before, I just don't know how. And yeah I admit that is very asshole-ish. 
I'll keep this in mind. Thanks for the response!"

obviously the 'analytical' groups would have the most members due to their nature for finding and seeking new ways to categorise people i guess. Putting people in labels is effective even though there are definite amount of anomalies. Therefore they would try to find answers to their new hypothesis by joining communities which also love to do the same. blahblah intution
NFs are the more friendly bunch especially INFP. They probably were like 'yay new friends'. they are excited finding people like them.  THis is all seems like a very N thing.  same thing about introversion, if you are introverted you are way more liekly to be on an MBTI subreddit,
SJs and SPs are the least likely people to actively search for an MBTI subreddit or MBTI related thing in my personal experience anyway. Therefore all the numbers add up init"

He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) 
You don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is:

Any comments, ideas, critics are welcome!"
1988,estp,"I took both the test for MBTI and for zodiac, but I still feel like I'm missing the point..
I was accurately typed as both an INFJ and a Capricorn, but outside of just telling you it was accurate, I don't know how that's really helpful."
1989,estp,"As an ESTP and a girl 👏 
Keep talking to her and express how youre interested in the things shes interested with in a none assertive way- genuinely enjoying the things she likes. Just enjoy the moment with her, she'll open up to you."
1990,estp,"She sounds like an immature ESTP in my opinion who relies too much on Se. But anyways, if you're into that, definitely stimulate her Se. For example, if you take her on a date, make sure it's something more active and stimulates the senses like hiking, a concert, a picnic with a nice view, etc. Something more than just sitting down to eat at a boujee restaurant and small-talk for a few hours. That can get boring really quick as an ESTP female myself lol
But overall, just be yourself, and if she doesn't like that at the end of the day then its not worth your time. Good luck :)"
1991,estp,"Give her the inability to sit down...if you get my drift....
remove all the chairs and surfaces in your house. 😐
ESTP whispers into ENTPs ear
Wait? What? What did you think I meant by “give her the inability to sit down”?
ESTP whispers into ENTPs ear again 
Oh, your one wee dirty bastard!
ENTP gives a BIG unsettling smile with big Rape, sociopathic eyes 
ESTP smirks
A Clockwork Orange 2 occurs...
(ESTP gets arrested whilst the ENTP puts the entire blame on the ESTP and after attending court and being considered“Not guilty” the ENTP writes about the entire situation)"
1992,estp,"Speaking for myself, be ready to be called out on liking things because I like them. I appreciate it, and I'll say that, but don't go into it expecting me to believe you just magically started having all the same interests as me without me poking a bit of fun at it."
1993,estp,"Hello fellow ESTPs and any others who might have a comment to make. What are your thoughts on our type and what personality disorders might be common? Antisocial, Sociopathy, and Narcissistic come to mind. I have many traits of all these. I am obviously self diagnosing when I consider these things in relation to me, but curious to hear what you guys have to say about yourselves or other ESTPs around you. Any other personality disorders/quirks, too!
Also, I've never met another ESTP (that I am aware of) IRL. If you guys have, what traits did they have? I can't wait to meet another ESTP some day. 
edit: Just found this link in the top section of r/mbti: https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/54bt57/results_are_in_the_most_sociopathic_mbti_type_is/"
1994,estp,"Hey!  I think ADD/ADHD are commonly associated with ESTP.  I know I've dealt with that growing up.  As I got older, and realized my type, I wondered if they were in fact interchangeable.  Did/do I actually have ADD or was I just more interested in the world around me instead of following some curriculum enforced upon me that I saw no practical use in?
I'm curious why you say antisocial? The extroverted part I think would indicate you'd prefer being social since that's your natural way to energize."
1995,estp,"I'm like 95% sure that my ESTP step-sister (who I love dearly) has undiagnosed bi polar disorder. I think it definitely stands out in her mbti. Because she has undiagnosed bi polar disorder, she is a very unhealthy ESTP. She is socially inappropriate, very impulsive, and brutally honest. During manic episodes, these traits are 10x more apparent.
Also, whether you like him or not, Donald Trump is a textbook ESTP as well as a textbook Narcissist."
1996,estp,"Estps clearly have sociopathic tendencies. We hang out with people but since acceptance is super hard for us, tertiary Fe, we may find ourselves in the situation where we feel that we are completely alone between multiple people. It's super hard for us to feel accepted. Hence the comment on antisocial,makes total sense. 
Hypomania is also another trap we might fall into, we are ignoring Si, and we just don't know how to stop, it might feel that we will fall into oblivion.
All of those traits can be worked upon obviously, nothing is set in stone, they are our tendencies and that's it.
The enneagram plays a part in this as well. 
The 8 might be the most enclined to be sociopathic,  and the 7 to have ADD..."
1997,estp,"Antisocial personality disorder is actually defined as people who"" tend to lie, break laws, act impulsively, and lack regard for their own safety or the safety of others. "" Haha. :) And I have ADHD too"
1998,estp,"ENFP here, lurking around mbti subreddits. It is actually ENFPs that are generally known as the ADHD myers briggs. However, because of the impulsive ""leap before you look"" mindset of ESTP, it is possible that many of them are misdiagnosed with ADHD as children. It also would make sense if many of them really did have it!"
1999,estp,"My bad! This is definitely relatable then! I would argue on the compulsive lyer though. Estps are very good at disguising the truth, but the truth is also super important to us. That's what brings us trouble most of the time, the fact that we won't lie and tell someone what we truly see. And we are often right,  when we only give observations with no Ti judgement. 
Most people don't like when we do that xD"
2000,estp,"Hi my mom usually comes out as INFJ on tests but she fits the profile more of a depressed ESTP (possibly ESTJ) than a healthy INFJ. 
She's been in the dumps for so long that I think she's gotten used to it. Anyway, she doesn't show any desire to get better. I'm tired of it. Is there anything I can do help her? I've tried being nice, being firm, ignoring her, being a shoulder to cry on, etc but nothing has any results. 
Edit: She's been like this for over a decade. She might have tried therapy but gave it up for whatever reason. I think it'd still be a good idea. So what can I do to push her in that direction? Like I said, it's become her new ""normal"" so she doesn't have any desire to change it. I'm an INTP."
2001,estp,"It’s a gamble, honestly. It usually gives me energy for the time I’m working out when I’m tired. I recently stayed up for 31 hours straight and decided to go for a workout to get my energy up, but it completely drained me, and walking home was difficult because it felt like my soul was leaving my body."
2002,estp,"Sort of.  If I don't work out, I've got energy to burn at the end of the day and have a less satisfying sleep.  And yes, I can't just sit and watch tv.  I have to be doing something unless it's a rare show or movie holding me rapt.  Otherwise, I'm drawing, painting, playing my bass, messing around on here, looking for memes on insta, lol.  Sometimes I'll even do laundry.
Point being, I can't just sit still unless that's the point of an activity, like yoga, meditation, and prayer, and certainly not idle.  It drives my infj husband a little crazy sometimes."
2003,estp,"I have never gotten a ticket but have been pulled over like seven or eight times. Never really get in trouble at school or work even when I definitely did something wrong. 
Relatable?
Edit: what about bullshitting your way through things? I'm also very good at that, is it an ESTP trait?"
2004,estp,I can make up the most believable lies. More of a social manipulator than to do it for my own benefit/compulsive liar. The lack of consequence is probably from the fast thinking and being charasmatic? We can make people empathise with us I suppose? Someone with better knowledge could probably analyse.
2005,estp,"In retrospect, yeah, maybe. I haven't thought about it much before since it was all automatic, but it could be attributed to luck or charisma.
I'm thinking mostly of grade school and the fact that, in present day, my 'good personality' gets me out of a lot of hot water. I have trouble believing it at times, but I'm apparently likable (as I've been told, anyway) enough to be able to squeak my way out of a lot of things, or just 'lucky' enough to be able to squeeze by.
That's going by others' reports, though, because I just kind of act and do and other people report it to me later on, because I don't put too much stock into my charisma since I'm too busy focusing on other things.
I also wing it a lot based on context, and things tend to go in my direction (and if they don't, that's fine!).
I'd say that being called a ""bullshitter"" is not at all inaccurate lmao"
2006,estp,"I rarely find myself in those situations. If I do, I will either take the loss and be honest about the fact that I've made a mistake, or I will try to be real sly and get myself out of a bad situation by acting real innocent. If I can, I'll try to be real subtle about it too.
It usually works, and if it doesn't, I can at least turn a real shitty situation into a much-less shitty situation."
2007,estp,"Absolutely. I can have anxiety at times and overthink things before they happen, but when the moment strikes and it's ""do or die"" I nearly always say the right thing and wing it perfectly. This is the case with teachers growing up, parents, cops, etc."
2008,estp,"Hello there! 
Well.. I was wondering how ESTPs usually do when they.. get jealous. I have a friend estp and we are actually like.. flirting. But a few days ago something happened and after that he started acting weird.. i mean, lilke more distant. I think he got jealous but I would like to know first how do they act and also.. what can i do..."
2009,estp,"Interesting question.
To answer to you, in my case, when i feel jealous i hate that ! For the good reason that i feel dependant.
So like others i get some distance, even if it's my friend (i speak of loving jealousy).
I would like to have an other solution, but for the moment, i don't have an other one"
2010,estp,"Don't feel bad, even if you actually like him. If he acts up it's actually a red flag. When you're young I guess it's normal, but you both should know that if you're not exclusive you're free to date and do as you please. Plus that seems a little overboard. If he's you're friend he's not supposed to make you feel bad when things do go as he likes, seems a little manipulative. I'm kinda assuming that this is what's happening especially since the scenario is painted that way. Maybe just on an off-chance something happened between now and then that made him act differently that had nothing to do with the scenario?  If you really think that it's jealousy , and it frequently happens and you just want him as a friend, maybe you need to make sure the boundaries are set and respected, in a calm way, and if they can't be then he can never truly be a friend because he has other intentions. Otherwise if you are interested it'd be fair to say that he is too. Also don't feel bad about it if you don't reciprocate the feeling's he has, being friend zoned happens a lot especially when someone isn't as socially adept, we all have to learn somehow and some of us the hard way. "
2011,estp,"Being honest, I like him. I liked him for.. 2 years now.
Our story is quite weird tho.
Anyway, yea he was like.. jealous or something, he was acting weird for 4 days (2 days during weekend, in whatsapp). On monday I decided to ask him if something was wrong as I was worry, but he acted.. like: everything is ok bla bla bla (and that day he was acting as well weird af).
Now he is back to normal (since tuesday), we are talking as always and he is ''caring'' in his way xD
We are gonna hang out tomorrow :3"
2012,estp,"Trump is an ESFP, no Ti in him. 
ESTPs have a very strong Ti. They are one of the two types with the heaviest use of pre-fontal cortex of their brains, regions that are responsible for logical reasoning and complex cognition. Dario Nardi shows this through brain imaging via EEG. ESTPs are extremely logical. 
Trump is a tactical navigator of his audience's feelings and energy. He has no consistency, zero logic. He is a salesman, manipulates people to win. ESTPs don't manipulate, they are usually blunt and truthful. ESFPs are known to lie casually like it isn't a big deal. They are confident in their lies, exactly like Trump is. "
2013,estp,"Trump's Feeling functions are weak to the point of being appalling. He commits so many social faux pas that it's painful to watch for any type that has strong Fi or Fe. If you want to see an ESFP leader, look at Justin Trudeau and how careful he is with his words and actions and how blunt and truthful Trump is in comparison. Saying the man is 'tactical' is a gross misunderstanding of his personality. He is highly strategic. It was Trump's carefully constructed strategy that allowed him to win the election when all the odds and most media outlets were against him, and everybody thought him winning was a joke. Pure Ti on his part - a well thought out and masterfully orchestrated plan to overcome his opponents and come out as a winner in the end. As for ESFPs rising to the top as social opportunists that is Justin Trudeau."
2014,estp,naw my point was creative Ti has the potential to be excellent at providing explanations because the explanations entail creating little Ti packages that you can impart to people in order to help them better understand things.  Different people tend to have all sorts of various confusions and questions which help the ESTP develop their own structural understanding and then they can fashion explanations by addressing the specific questions in light of their overall holistic Ti structure 
2015,estp,"Depends how old they are / if they developed Ni. People with Ti are generally simultaneously the best and worst at explaining things.
ESTPs are good at handling details and can build explanations without effort. Ti is the function they use to help people. They use Ti all day long and much more than most types. It's effortless for them to use this function.
What they do works for the issue at hand. They don't really ever need to understand how every gear exactly turns in a system/tool in order to use it. Most of the time, Ti users create problems because they don't see how others can't figure things out and go with the flow when the instruction manual isn't clear. Ti users tend to be neglectful/misleading when giving instructions to others. They are also problematic when it comes to editing/improving existing systems since they don't care to learn what things are being broken when they fix one situation. Ti computer programmers do this all the time. They are better than Te when it comes to creating solutions that are brand new and don't interact with anything else. Much faster from start to finish of the project and the solution just works. For now. For that exact situation and bundle of current requirements.
Healthy ESTPs are a wonderful exception to all those above drawbacks. If they develop Ni, ESTPs can be exceptionally competent at explaining things."
2016,estp,"Justin is a Fe-dom. ESFJ most probably. 
Trump is Se-dom. ESFP definitely. 
Trump has no Ti, kinda like u. Only someone with no Ti can say he has Ti. He's been unable to construct a single line of logic in his many statements, never ever did. His entire career is like this, confidently spitting out whatever bullshit comes to his feeble mind. You failing to see something so obvious, means you are not equipped with Ti either, so your judgement on a person's Ti should be taken lightly. Don't ever use the phrase ""pure Ti"" because you clearly don't know what it actually is. Also, it's good to go out and meet some real life ESTPs to get a feel as to who these people are and how they look, think, and behave. You know what typology does? It's a Ti construct; it categorizes clusters of people who think/feel and look/behave like each other into the same categories. Knowing a couple of ESTPs would've helped you avoid making such an obvious mistake. 
Highly strategic? If you mean his Ni, you are right. Yet that's distinct from a thinking function. Even in his Ni, he is tactical, contradicting himself all the time, reacting to his immediate situation. To say that Trump won the election without the help of the party, the media coverage, geomandering, Russia, and the electoral system, but because he was such a system thinker or long-term strategist, is naive at best. Talk to a couple of INTJs, they're known for these strategic traits, and they're all dissatisfied or disappointed with Trump's impulsiveness, tactical tendencies, and lack of long-term planning and vision. "
2017,estp,"Ni creates a strategic map can help with how you plan to come to ppl and how to get what you want out of people but Se is what's gonna make all of that fly. Much of the ESTP's communication is improvised and based on experiences which only Se and Ne can provide. Both are important but I believe your explanation put too much bias on Ni and ignored Se and Fe (for connecting with others and picking up on their feelings atm).
Also, on computer programming, both Te and Ti are good for dealing with bugs and issues in different ways. Ti is better at finding different ways of doing thing while Te just gets it done and solves an issues Ti will mull over or Ti caused the issue trying to find another way. Ti isn't confident in information unless it knows EVERYTHING about it and will outperform Te always but requires months to years of skill building where Te can pin point an issue down and get it done."
2018,estp,"Eh you sound like some kind of worked up INFP who got all butthurt that Trump, your ""conflictor"" type in socionics, has won in the election and would rather blame Russia for it LOL! Your only arguments are ad homimems with no sense or reasons that are easy to dismiss for their brainless content. I'd say try again but logical reasoning is clearly not your strength and we wouldn't want you to stain that inferior Te of yours gasping for arguments.   
ESTP Ti in creative/auxiliary position is not focal and linear - it's diffuse and flexible, it's never consistent since it's designed to handle a variety of different kinds of situations, hence why ESTPs are part of flexible-manuvering EP temperament that is not about keeping consistent arguments. This rubs the linear Ti/Fi doms such as yourself the wrong way as you view this inconsistency as ""lies"" and ""bullshit"" rather than truly understanding it for what it is - a natural adaptation and strength of EP types. I'd dismantle your arguments further but at this point it's clear that you need to learn more about functions before you even start to debate anyone's type and wasting other people's time. Else you're just going to make a fool out of yourself, as well you have already proceeded to do in this discussion."
2019,estp,Your typing is based on the assumption that Trump is complete moron who only happen to have enough charisma and luck to randomly become president. It's actually the whole point of this chat and typology became very secondary for its duration...
2020,estp,"You're pretty much all right. Whenever I talk about Ni, I try my best not to be bias. If I was bias then it might come from Ni users facing a lot of accidental abuse. Se users tend to think what they perceive is enough to make decisions on. If that person also uses Te, they will completely shut down the Ni user. Not because they're correct. But at the surface level it seems like they might be. The Ni user has to choose between spending time arguing (really, teaching a reference level the other person hasn't been exposed to) or just let themselves be shut down. Because Ni users have so much trouble socializing (studying the art of body language is the only way to begin a long road of treatment), they can't afford to look any worse. And people, unfortunately, don't like it when you argue with them, or, worse, teach them something they didn't give their consent to learn. Ni users hate workplaces where they aren't in charge. Not because they want to be in charge. They just don't want to be shut down all the time and made useless by the words of the blind. I'll need more time to mull over how Ti works. I think there's more to it and I don't think we know introverted functions as well as we do extroverted functions. And Ti users can't seem to explain it right. I wanna know how exactly their minds go about things when they make decisions."
2021,estp,"Ti- ""is"" consistency, objective logic. In all Ti- users, it works the same. INTP, ESTP, ISTJ, ESFJ, they all use it to some extent, and to that extent they are consistent. To judge Ti- use, you should have it. You don't have it, so... 
Ti+ is fragmented logic, subjective. ISTP, INTJ, ENTP and ENFJ use it to argue with objective logic, either to attack the assumptions, use fallacies, or start with non-agreed upon (or false) assumptions and prove a (false) point. You seem to belong with this group. 
Fi- users aren't necessarily consistent, as they don't use Ti. They value authenticity and personal feelings, which could go against logic or consistency. Yet these types value Ti- and are receptive to its convictions. ISFP, INFJ, ENFP and ENTJ don't use Ti-, but if presented with a solid argument, they are usually open to its truth.
Fi+ users are the ultimate inconsistent individuals. Only what feels good to them matters, and in a very subjective way. They don't consider Fi nor Ti in others. INFP, ESFP, ISFJ and ESTJ are Fi+ users, and it shows in them being clueless when presented with Ti, and their resistance to it. Trump belongs with this group.
Now, what's with your false INFJ tag? Uncomfortable with your own type? Muddy the waters? Make a false impression on your audience? 
Why not go out and meet some ESTPs before coming here and typing bullshit? I know it's not important to you to be right or not make a fool out of yourself, that's clearly not your mission. But why make it so obvious who you really are? That shouldn't be part of the your mission. You like to be in the shadows, and for that you need to be not making such rookie mistakes dear ENTP. "
2022,estp,"ESTPs can't be morons. They use their pre-fontal cortex so heavily that they are second in logic only to INTP. These brain areas are responsible for complex reasoning, analysis, and logical categorization. No other type uses their pre-fontal cortex so often, they rely on other brain regions. An extroverted Se-valueing person needs to develop these brain regions to become an ESTP, if not, he becomes some sort of a Se character with no Ti. There are two other extroverts that he could become, ESTJ or ESFP. Tillerson for example, is an ESTJ, Trump, he is an ESFP. "
2023,estp,"Not having something doesn't need proof, having it does. You think he has Ti in his top four? Show us many many instances where he has been consistent instead of contradictory, objective (universal) instead of personal, and logical instead of emotional in his judgement. Good luck! 
The guy is known for his subjective and emotional judgements and being inconsistent! ""I'm this and that, many people like me, nobody likes you, sad!"" 
I can show many instances of his Fi. You can't show many instances of his Ti. We all can show many instances of his Se. Therefore he is an ESFP. "
2024,estp,"I doubt you actually follow the political scene. You make it sound like Trump randomly nukes a town every months out of anger.
As far as I can tell, he's been following his original ""plans"". He'll still building the wall; he's been blaming China for a lot of shit and he's still on their asses as soon as they mess up; He's anti waste and it's easy to tell that creating scenarios where the USA actually makes money is his top priority; he has very little values, all he does is follow his own understanding of what a good deal is and that's pretty much it. I am not going to spend 4 hours on this comment linking you articles of clues of what I believe makes for a good proof of consistency but what I can tell you is that he plans on selling weapons to Ukraine despite being supposedely budy with Putin. If that's not a proof of insectoid Ti mind without any presence of Fi. He's not going to fight for Syrians or Ukrainians, he's just going to indirectly put his finger in Russia's asshole by making a profit while making no committement whatsoever to anyone. Blabla there are tons of existing exemples where you can easily tell that Trump has a very simple way of making business and it has nothing to do with emotions(???) or values... 
Also, Ti is subjective like all introverted functions.
If there are contradiction in the small things he says here and there, then it just means he's become a politician. What hasn't changed is his approach to business and he's using his position to do so. SLE's lie all the time, it's a well known fact, they don't have much Ni to show so you'd see more weak Ne instead. For exemple pointing at Hilary's email to deviate the accusations he had to ""face"", clearly shows the signs of a very weak contextual understanding. 
The signs of Fi you think you see probably have more to do with the domineering need Se doms feel. There are no definitions of Fi in MBTI nor socionics that would support your claim. He completely lacks the Fi charisma that make ExFPs so good with people. His charisma is basically a Warhammer 40K meme aka the ""God Emporer"". He's ruthless and that's why people voted for him."
2025,estp,"He contradicts himself halfway through a sentence man! And he's done this many times. He is following the agenda he needs to follow (sticks to the ""plan""), but whenever he is live, he starts to mess things up with his weak memory about his previous positions. He just plays the moment. That's Se. When judging a thing, he uses emotional words. He never judges himself (which Ti does, and Fi doesn't.) He uses his own weight to give weight to his arguments (again, Fi). So, his Fi is just very hard to miss. And his Ti is nowhere to he found. Trump constantly asking us to trust him: Fi or Ni. 
Ok, let's see what else you got here: hmmm... Blah blah... Ok. 
From what I see, and also reading your ""opinions"" about him, I drive that he is either an ESTJ, an ESFP, an INTJ or an ESTP. Other types are just so far from his core that it's impossible to put him in any other category. 
ESTP is a very intelligent type, so is INTJ. They're both Ti users (model G function stack). These two types don't have much Fi either. They both ""justify"" their positions, using their Ti or Te. Trump never justifies anything, ""I'm telling you"", ""trust me"", ""everyone says so"", ""it's sad"", this is just not how Ti operates. 
So, we're left with ESTJ and ESFP. If his memory was better, he was efficient, and he was less confident, I'd put him with ESTJs. He lacks good memory, is more of an improviser and a performer, and he is childishly confident. That's his lack of Si, strong Se, and inferior Ni. So, he is an ESFP. "
2026,estp,"I decided I'd make my own post here. Fellow ESTPs, are there any particular ESTP stereotypes that you break? Here are my own:
Active: I'm really not. Like, I live in the moment and primarily absorb information via my senses but I am not all that active. I'm kinda lazy unless something catches my interest.
Not interested in theories: I definitely get bored with abstract theories but I sometimes enjoy talking and thinking about them. I am good at understanding theories to an extent, I just get bored easily.
So, what ESTP stereotypes have ypu broken?"
2027,estp,"I think I mostly fit the bill. Though, I think it is common for ESTPs to often be mistyped as introverts, as previously mentioned. ""He who runs fastest runs alone"" is a thought I've heard thrown around in the MBTI community about our type. "
2028,estp,"He is super flirty, sporty and confident but that may be because he's really good looking. He tries to tease me every now and then but really cares for me, brought me food and water and offered it several times more.
It's really hard to say if he's an intro or extrovert. One time I played a little ""mind"" game. I got away from the crowd and went to an empty spot, not too far away but I was alone. He always came when he saw me and we would start talking about all kind of things. We did get really well along, even started to get into philosophical topics. Idk if this matter but he was surprised when he found out I was single. Perhaps he is quite impressed with me, I spontaneously agreed on hosting an event, showed him my artistic skills and I even beatboxed when the opportunity arrived. He also seemed to like my humor.
​
But
He has a girlfriend.
I did not know this from the start, actually only on the last day I decided to meet him. I think I might have been reading into it too much.
Now I just want to know what his personality Type is so I can find reasons why it would not have worked out for us anyways. I'm not sure how helpful the context above is going to be for typing him. One of my friends also said that he doesn't seem like the type of person to fall in love easily. Also, he has a Technician part time job while finishing his media marketing studies in uni. If that helps at all??  
I'm an ENFP btw"
2029,estp,"ESFJ probably.
ESTPs are cool and free-spirited, not necessarily flirty and social. On the other hand, both STPs are bad romantic/friendship matches for an ENFP. ENFP's matches are ESFJ, ENTJ, INFJ, ISTJ.
ESFJ males are masculine but kind and social, sporty but not aggressive, and they are way more caring than ESTPs. If you are an ENFP, and if you are really into him, with the details you provided, he most probably is an ESFJ. "
2030,estp,"I often hear about INxJ/ENFP or xSxx/ESTP pairings, but frankly, stories with ESTP/ENFP are rare.
In the ENFP community, most are attracted to fellow intuitives especially INTJ to the point that it's become a comical stereotype that I simply cannot relate to and don't care for.
My closest ENFP friends and I have realized that most of the men in our lives that we're often attracted to and attract are xSTPs.
How would you guys rate ENFPs compared to other types that you're attracted to? And if you're repulsed by us, feel free to share and why as well. :)
​
*Edit: Lol at the downvotes. I can already guess who got butthurt and it's probably neither ENFPs nor ESTPs. "
2031,estp,"to be completely honest I can find myself attracted to anyone personality wise who isn't a J, and even then I can make a lot of exceptions. As long as you're not going to make me your therapist and you're okay with spontaneous, last minute adventures (even to the corner store) and are okay with not planning everything I'll probably at least consider ya. I'm an ESTP bi dude so I think I fill your preferred criteria pretty well, hahah."
2032,estp,"I would rate ENFPs middle of the pack to upper level relationship status depending on various factors like shared values, intelligence etc. I seem to attract ENFPs like a moth to a flame or some metaphor especially in socioeducational settings like College as well as parties etc. If you're either one you'd ideally want to show genuine interest early and often if you want to pursue a real relationship and generally talk a lot about how you guys feel about a lot of stuff which the ENFPs love but really drain the ESTP. ESTP like being in control and many times the ENFP likes to wrestle that control away and ESTPs don't really like to manipulate so we let yall do your thing but eventually we need it back. Many times there are increasing levels of selfishness in this regard from either sides so that should be noted and addressed before it can cause real damage to trust levels that can then only be repaired after a period of time (can be years). ESTPs love being analytical not unlike intps not that we don't make logical mistakes but many times those mistakes are due to external factors. Also love playfully stroking our egos hehe. Enfps are straight airheads most of the time so we really have to make sure that balloon stays full of air for the benefit of both parties. Also it's a big plus if you guys can connect on some deeper spiritual or philanthropic level. ESTPs are generally really popular everywhere and care somewhat about their social status so just try not to embarrass them, that can cause them to become resentful or pissed off. We are also constantly trying to improve/elevate thanks to aux ti so you may soon realize that you can become woefully unprepared to handle the awesomeness that we can/will become. Just sayin"
2033,estp,"In Socionics, these two types share an ego relation (described here: http://www.socionics.com/rel/ego.htm) . The functions between them are reversed and inverse - which ultimately makes teamwork hard. And if you're aiming for a serious long-term partnership, teamwork is what you need. This kind of relation is like the equivalent of asking about an INFJ and ISTJ being good partners and why you rarely hear of it. The values are just... different.
Anecdotally, speaking as a dual-partner to ESTPs, their willpower and ""alpha""-ness is very strong (extroverted sensing) and wants admiration (tertiary Fe). I haven't really met any ENFPs that respect that Se in the way I see an ESTP needing it. But, again, I'm no ESTP I'm just experienced with 'em"
2034,estp,"My last two boyfriends have been ENFP and I've never had a better time to be honest. We just get each other on so many levels. Finally found the ones that not just get me or tolerate me but accept me and we can just live. Learning how to love them and let them be free, was never used to someone equally free as me. Will report as my latest relationship develops. "
2035,estp,Well it’s just casual so far she’s leaving for a six month internship in about a month. I can see where we might clash for example she’s not near the risktaker/thrillseeker I am but in general we communicate pretty well. I’m not really an expert on all the functions and what not so if you want an in depth breakdown from that sort of perspective I’m the wrong guy but I’d be happy to answer any question you have if I can
2036,estp,"To be honest, I definitely see ESTPs with J types a lot and the stories are more often than not successful. 
As for your second part criteria, ENFPs THRIVE off of spontaneous and last minute adventures like ESxPs thanks to dominate Ne.
And never expect an ENFP to plan. You're more likely to suffer planning with a J type."
2037,estp,"Slow down there, hot shot. 
Based on all that you wrote just now, I'm definitely getting ExTJ vibes from you more than ESTP. 
""ESTP like being in control and many times the ENFP likes to wrestle that control away and ESTPs don't really like to manipulate so we let yall do your thing but eventually we need it back.""
Going to be a bit of a devil's advocate here, but the ESTPs that I know don't need or want to be in control unless they feel like they need to step in when a situation goes awry.
As for manipulation, excuse me sir, but many ESTPs definitely love to manipulate and know they're good at it. This is not necessarily bad though because I know some ESTP's manipulation tend to be for a better purpose or for women (lol.) "
2038,estp,"They are close to the worst relation, I know a INFP ESTP couple, now that is toxic. Dont know how people get into these relations. I also know a ISTJ and ENFP couple, now that is warm and fuzzy and they play fight, so damn cute. "
2039,estp,"Yes! It took us a lot of effort to get where we are now. 
We used to get into so many (small) arguments because we just did not get each other. But we worked on our communication and we solve misunderstandings pretty quickly now. 
Learning about MBTI did help us a lot. It was an extra tool to help us understand each other.
As long as you love each other equally and put in a SHIT TON of effort, these kind of pairings can go together really well. :D"
2040,estp,"Yeah, hahah.
I've dated an ENFP once and she was chill and liked going on those sort of adventures so I'll give you the answer of I like em! Like I said, I can't handle being somebody's therapist (it drains the shit out of me), so it goes for any type really that as long as out dates arent gonna be complaining sessions I can at least consider someone"
2041,estp,"hihi!! the ESTPs i’ve met (including myself) secretly like to be in control of the situation behind the scenes BUT don’t like to show it. because of Ne demon, they can be pretty paranoid. the only reason they seem carefree & going with the flow, not minding if things go wiry is cause they know they’ll be able to handle it in some way (showing that they like control).
hope this was useful"
2042,estp,"Haha well ESTPs have the same interaction style as ESTJs and ENTJs so I should expect you to get the same vibes from us lol. See how you neatly organized your paragraphs? Yea we don't care about that (aux ti). Many ISTPs can look like ESTPs on the outside but will not take control of a situation until they need to step in like you said.  Also if you want to see real masters of manipulation look at ENFJs or INFJs they are on another level compared to us, it almost looks like them cheating when we compare it to our use of Fe. We love to manipulate stuff that has to do with US. The more time you spend with us the more you realize how curated our entire lives are. But often times ENFPs will modify the art gallery without informing/asking us. That's the wrestling of control that I'm talking about. Most of the time the change will be appreciated and welcomed with open arms. Especially if the change makes logical sense we won't mind at all. But if it doesn't make logical sense to us or if it lowers our social standing or is embarrassing somehow you can really anger an ESTP who might be stressed and we might say something that can mess with your Fi. We don't like to be angry but some stuff that ENFPs do can make us angry. Realize that your Ne Fi will conflict with our Se Ti since our Fe Ni isn't often used by us often not until forced to do so. You will get butthurt and we will not care until we are forced to use our Fe to calm shit down."
2043,estp,"Haha yep I'm an INFJ with an ESTP partner :)
I wrote my reply in the middle of the night so I used unclear generalized shorthand which has led to some misunderstanding. I wasn't talking about unhealthy ESTPs. ExTPs have tertiary Fe as their ""achilles heel"", if you will: they want to be loved and admired for who/how they are. In the context of the ESTP, they use their power (Se) all day long and can get respect from others for that, but ultimately they want to be admired and loved for it. This is easier with INxJ types who instinctually value Se because they're not very good at it and want to be. Specifically for an ENFP, Se is their role function: the 8th and last and they really don't care about it all that much. This is where partnership conflict can easily arise."
2044,estp,"Good question (mainly because she told me she’s an ENFP) she might very well be. My sister is an ESFP and she’s very much the typical ESFP stereotype. This girl isn’t like that at all, much more down to earth and seems to love deep thoughtful conversation. I know she loves adventure and travel and being spontaneous. She’s more of an artsy/hippie type adventurer. There’s other things too like she seems much more willing to go against the grain whereas my sister can’t handle any sort of conflict or doing anything that might rub people the wrong way. "
2045,estp,"look, what I mean is that you shouldn't fixate on personality types because there's going to be an X that is an exemption to the rule.
Enjoy your life and hang around who ever makes you feel the best version of yourself.
If you are looking for a one nightstand then just fuck the most attractive person to you"
2046,estp,"Absolutely! Finally someone else who thinks so!
I always found that when both are incredibly healthy, ESTP and ENFP make great partners in crime. :D
Also may or may not be related but if my assumptions serve me right, how's the sex? ;)"
2047,estp,"Okay. I see what you're saying. 
But organizing paragraphs was not a good example to defend your points. The ESTPs around me are incredibly neat and the same can be said with their paragraphs.
This is just your writing style. Although funnily enough, the ESFPs that I know write just like you.
And no, I wasn't saying you're trying to manipulate. I'm just making an observation about what I assume, but I never claimed to be correct."
2048,estp,"I came on this forum to ask ESTP mens' input. Not an INFJ whose partner is ESTP to talk about why their own relationship work and why an ESTP/ENFP's relationship would not. 
Do you know how obnoxious and unwelcome this could come off to people lol?
And yes, everyone knows the ESTP/INFJ relationship would be easier and more compatible. You two share the exact same functions. It's kind of a known fact around the community that ESTPs get along with FJ types. 
It's nothing new to me therefore, I don't really care. 
That's why I came on here asking about ESTP and ENFP. It's also a general known fact that ESTPs and ENFPs are like fire and gasoline. You telling whatever about your own experiences with ESTP/ENFP is nothing new either.
I want to know more stories successful or not from the ESTPs' sides and not just from the ENFPs' sides."
2049,estp,"Yes, they do make great partners in crime! I am definitely more mentally stable though, but my partner is working on himself and we’re going really strong.
Sex is amazing! We’re both open to new experiences so we’re always ready to try out new things.
A big difference is that sex for me is (mostly) purely physical and my goal is to climax, but sex for him is about the sex itself and the moment that he is sharing with me. He is more likely to initiate a 1 or 2 hour sex session, when I’m satisfied with 30 minutes. But it sometimes does feel good to satisfy his needs. 
He’s also really a giver when it comes to sex. I’m more like 50/50 when it comes to giving and receiving.
We do have sex 80% of the time when we’re together, so we’re pretty active!"
2050,estp,"Look like I said above, i probably wouldn't be able to say this to you in real life if given the chance but who really cares if we show it off to a random person on reddit. Again you can either try and understand the points I try and make or you can continue to pawn it off as me trying to manipulate you/show off our intelligence. Either way we will not care."
2051,estp,"xd fair enough, my workout partner is an ESFP and a clear way to tell them apart is they tend to shy away from these kind of analyses unless they can read about them from some book or hear it from some respected member in the learning community etc"
2052,estp,"I don't see anything wrong with you asking either. 
I understand that it would be boring because you already have an opinion set on the matter.
But I'm drunk so I like to just spit shit and random words.
Hope you get the info that you are looking for because I'm not going to be of much help"
2053,estp,"That's what I like to hear!
Aha, he sounds very much like me then. I love slow and sensual sex that lasts hours. I like the teasing and intimate aspect of it.
But there are times when I'm in the mood for a good ol rough and being taken!
I'm not surprised you guys are active. It's the ESTP x ENFP coupling! ;)"
2054,estp,"Oh look! Another INFJ who likes ESTP who can't handle my thread spotted. I seriously don't ever asking you guys anything in my original post.
Yep, I'm ENFP. Ne/Fi to the core. Don't make me some other type just because I don't adhere to your skewed up, stereotypical perceptions of ENFPs. 
Hang out with ESTPs? I WORK with them. :)
And no. I have enough ISTJs in life, thanks."
2055,estp,"I mean this whole reply chain. Going after people just because you don't want their opinion is not an attitude I'm gonna tolerate here. To use your own words, do you know how obnoxious and unwelcome this could come off to people?"
2056,estp,"ESTP subtypes:
ESTP-Se - Seems clever, impulsive, seemingly concealing within him a latent threat. Far from being easygoing and appeasable. In reality, he can be sharp, sufficiently aggressive, and persistent. Can hold a grudge and be sufficiently resourceful to make the life of his ill-wishers become intolerable. Has a contrasting and unpredictable character. With those whom he loves can be kind, tender, even sentimental. Possesses a sense of humor, that easily molds into sarcasm and caustic irony. Talkative, charming, witty, critical and sharp. - Full description
ESTP-Ti - Leaves an impression of calm strength and self-assurance. Rational and consistent in his affairs. Hardworking and enduring. Usually he is cold-blooded, restrained, collected and unfazed, but in moments of irritation does not conceal his anger, which shows in his look and in sudden categorical gestures. When he is calm, he is polite and courteous, tough keeps his conversation partners at a distance. His humor is blunt and can be somewhat crude. Sometimes he has a fast moving, distrustful look that looks from under his eyebrows. - Full description"
2057,estp,"I've seen some people who like to include the Fe and Ni subtypes. I'm definitely an Ni subtype. Otherwise, idk. Probably Se subtype.
I'm a pretty nice dude and I don't hold grudges. I've realized I can get angry pretty quickly. Apparently I'm pretty naturally aggressive and confrontational but theres never any actual ill will or poor temperament. It just happens."
2058,estp,"Both. ESTP-Se when things are going well. ESTP-Ti when I’m focused on a goal and have something I’m working towards. Thought & discipline are needed so I go Ti mode to help me focus and stay committed. It makes me come off as that description I suppose. But I much prefer to be Se, however I have a strong Ti and that grip sometimes does make me intellectual & seemingly a bit reserved and observant. It depends on my mood & current focus either intellectually or in general."
2059,estp,"I've seen Se-ESTPs get caught up in Ti for long periods of time and due to this mistype themselves as ISTPs. Some Se-subs have this habit of getting downtime and isolating themselves ""to do something thinking"" which can last up to several weeks, depending on what problems they are mulling over. This excessive time spent thinking tricks them into believing that they are ISTPs. This happens  because Se-ESTPs have strong Se/Fe but weak Ti/Ni, so their thinking and attempts to put their experiences into context take them a long time and require more effort out of them, since Ti and Ni their are weakened functions. They confuse this lengthy thinking for dominant Ti. Ti-ESTPs have more of a stable persistent drive. Their issues are usually in their relationships with others."
2060,estp,"The Fe subtype is actually the same thing as the Se subtype, and Ni is same as Ti. Se-ESTPs have strong Se/Fe but weakened Ti/Ni. For Ti-ESTPs the reverse is true, they have an energy accent on their Ti/Ni but weakened Se and Fe. Functions aren't isolated units that float around on their own - they are actually connected to each other through the jungian dichotomies of E/I, T/F, and N/S - and if you shuffle them around you discover that you cannot accentuate Ni without accentuating Ti, of Fe without Se and vice versa, which means there can be only 2 subtypes."
2061,estp,"Hi, I am an estp with an enormous penis, I was just wondering what type of jobs you guys have that you enjoy and feel like you can be yourself at? More looking for suggestions for things I would enjoy being an estp than really wanting to know about your jobs."
2062,estp,"I am currently procrastinating myself through a masters program at my university. I manage a local laundromat (I love this). I also pet/house sit very frequently. I have 5 steady clients at this time. I kinda sorta work/have been ""adopted"" by this couple. They are more like my true parents than those who raised me. We just match. I wrk with them a lot. Running errands, etc. so kinda a personal assistant. 
Also, my threshold of boredom for a job is about 2 years and I'm ready to move on. "
2063,estp,"In answer to your question:
My job itself is boring. My place of employment isn't. The culture, the people, all make the boring part worth it. 
Plus, I'm loved for my personality type and what I can offer. Part of that is being an ESTP. "
2064,estp,"No, but I wish I had the patience and discipline to micromanage people. It always feels like I'm working with stupid people that are incompetent, so I can get condescending with others. I'm working on balancing between being nice but also motivating enough so people get shit done. "
2065,estp,"Same thing as gravitre on a project, but in a perfect world, everyone would just do what I say since I tend to be good at doing stuff alone, meaning if I have to succeed as team leader, I’d rather have the team be an extension of my own abilities rather than a complex and clunky system of personalities. Teams are able to do a slightly higher max workload than I am, but I feel like it’s not a worthy trade when it goes way slower with other people weighing it down by being below the average competency line of the team. I try to be nice and calm as possible, but I try to put myself in a position where I do most of the work overall, filling in the rest of everyone’s shit to do when I’m done."
2066,estp,"As an estp I feel sometimes it's hard to find a mate that actually loves me. Often times my boyfriends see me as a cool friend, someone they love to hang out with, etc but they don't like me as a partner.
I've found a lot of the times the guys I date prefer to be with someone I would consider boring, inferior to me in many ways. My question is, what personalities actually love us? 
Edit: Met an estp in real life and we were flirting nonstop, it felt great being with someone like me. He made it clear he'd ask me out in a heartbeat if he didn't already have a girl. From now on I'll be on the lookout for guys just like me or other super confident types :P "
2067,estp,"Thank you for asking this! I'm an estp guy and I don't have trouble talking to girls, but I am horrible at building relationships. I feel like nobody really loves me. But I get needy as fuck. 
I have no solution, but I wanted to add to this also. "
2068,estp,"People like me at first because I'm charming, witty, and sexy. But then I either A) Get bored and move on  or B) They see who I really am and are over it. I don't know who would love me. xNTJs tend to like me but I find them too intense. My bff/person I really actually love loves me and she is an ISFJ. "
2069,estp,"I'm ENFJ and I love ESTPs! But I believe it always takes some time, even months, before the actual chemistry starts to go on. I guess it happens because of your self-confidence - you don't see the need to open up right away to ignite the ""chemistry"". Based on my observations, you seem to be very very confident without needing to ""trap"" people with your vulnerabilities and inner issues for the sake of feeling intimacy with a partner.
Another thing is being blunt. If someone actually likes you and wants to take you out on a date may potentially be afraid of your insensitive response. My ESTP friends struggles with saying things that may be offensive or triggering to others, even though his/her intention was otherwise to make a joke or rationally point out the truth. That may scare some people off unless they are other ESTPs or mature enough to get that joke :p"
2070,estp,Hey! So I just commented on this earlier but I just found out what the personality types of two people who love me to death. One of my best friends and this one girl who used to be my manager but really really cares about me a lot. They're both ENFJ 
2071,estp,"INFJs. They are duals. Also INFJs have Fi in the id, which is very powerful, and has to deal with deep, personal love. They'll be most likely to truly see the ESTP for who they are and genuinely appreciate their qualities."
2072,estp,"Maybe. I think it's hard because at one point they see me as their best friend and not so much a mate/sexual being. They like flirting and trying to get the attention of other girls.
I never let them flirt with me, I hit on them and got straight to the point. So I guess I don't let guys court me and maybe they like doing that. Maybe they like shy, feminine girls and don't like me being so blunt :/ "
2073,estp,"It's common to be attracted to your dual or semi-dual but have difficulty maintaining a relationship before your inferior function has developed, so you often see people before the age of 25 or so and especially in their teens have these kind of star-crossed trysts.  Additionally, the fact that duals and semi-duals make the best relationships does not mean, of course,  that we'll like every single person of that type.  Lifestyles, maturity, values, etc. can all lead to particular individuals being unpleasant.  (Of course, I would be neglectful if I didn't mention that mistyping is also always a possibility.)"
2074,estp,"I installed Bumble and have noticed some guys do state they're estp, I creep their instagrams if they have a tag. Idk how it would work, they seem so similar to me. I'll report back if I ever go on a date with one. "
2075,estp,"Looking for some self-help, meaningful reads that have helped you all either A) understand yourself better or B) understand more characteristics/ attributes of our type, or C) good texts that apply to this sub. Thanks."
2076,estp,"Depends what you are looking for. 
Spiritual / philosophy stuff? 
Hustle books on success and building a better life?
Understanding others' emotions?
Learning about a skill or a methodology? 
Basically it depends on which function you feel needs to be ""pumped""  right now... "
2077,estp,"I guess how to get organized in life in order to take on more responsible. So to answer your questions hustle, success, or anything that is in between which could also be considered a method or skill? Sorry such a vague response. Not really good at how to word this...."
2078,estp,"For Se bump,  or willpower pump. I would recommend ""ego is the enemy"" by Ryan holiday. Huge dose of willpower in that one. 
The subtle art of not giving a fuck by Mark monson is also pretty good.
""Stealing like an artist"" I don't remember the title, something along those lines, really successful book.
""The power of Habits""; really efficient.
I've heard that ""fuck your emotions"" was quite good as well.
Tony Robins is a big one with his bestseller ""awaken the giant within""
That's pretty much it... If you feel stuck I'd recommend Tony Robbins or mark Monson first"
2079,estp,"hi, my estp is depress feels like he cant do anything. we are currently in a long distance relationship. he doesnt want to talk and is having a rough time with life. he has a hard time accepting help and right now everything I do feels like pressure. I want to help but dont know how to. How do you guys deal with depression? what can I do to help?"
2080,estp,"Its not too uncommon for estp's to get depressed, sometimes out of no where. For me, if i'm super busy without ample 'me' time, I feel completely drained from others and all I wanna do is be a negitive nancy.
The saddness shouldn't last too long, as we are good at pushing feelings aside.When expressing emotions, I make them physical. If they also do this you are going to read between the lines (or even better, bluntly ask why he is upset/disappointed/angry). For example, if I'm anxious, I'll probably say something like, I dont feel well or I have a headache. Its true, but doesnt really get to the source of the low mood.
Maybe you can take a trip up to see your SO, and do something active/outdoorsy to lift his spirit."
2081,estp,"Money ^ 
Likewise /u/kerssen, just let em go. He'll either do it on his own, which we prefer, or go to you for help when he decides he needs it. 
I was actually feeling this way like yesterday and the day before, I eventually got hammered and hung out with my friends then had a solid workout after a day of moping and felt brand new"
2082,estp,"What he means is he takes the mental state and assigns it a physical problem/feeling instead. I do that too, like literally it was two days ago I was mopey and depressed and I just told everyone I didn't feel well and had a headache exactly how he described"
2083,estp,"Its more that estp's have a severly underdeveloped emotion expression  and are experts at using the 5 senses to analyze info.  In order for an average estp to express feelings of sadness, they will usually associate it with something tangible (headaches, nausea) so they can 'solve' the problem instead of realizing, 'hey, I've been stressed about the exam- no wonder my heart is racing'. Then there are other times when I try to speak how I'm feeling and my chest/throat tightens. Its like my body is fighting to keep the emotions in because the release of the emotions are intense (like everything estps do). Try to stay more calm than the estp if it escalates because they are good at picking up nonverbal cues and will amplify the negativity and say hurtful things. 
One warning: estp's are real good at giving short-uninformational responses without elaboration if they feel intruded on. This is when to give them room to think and digest the conversation. Also, since we are tactile, a videochat is much more satisfying than a call or text.
This link helped me discern what I was feeling. As elementary as this seems, until I was able to name emotions, i was able to express feelings better.
http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html"
2084,estp,"Share opinions, please. I find that most of my xSTP friends help me to ""let things go"" if I am stuck in my own emotions. It's nice since I would otherwise dive deep into the rabbit hole of overthinking ""why do I feel this way blah blah"". (I'm I/ENFJ)
Hence, I wondered how are you dealing with your own feels?"
2085,estp,"90% of the time I tend not to linger on why I feel some way. Usually I observe that I feel some way and then move on (whilst remembering what caused that emotion). 
Occasionally if I'm in a down mood (tired, sad about something), I will linger there for a little bit. Sometimes it even inspires me to call/text people I normally don't think of and say something more touching/personal than I normally would."
2086,estp,"Yes, we are great at ""shoving the emotions down"". :)     (this is not acceptance, but escape)
Experiencing a feeling 100% is a path of growth for Estps,  even ad hoc asking why we felt that way.
You are 100% right in your statement,  but that's not a great thing to do either."
2087,estp,"Interesting. Do you avoid what caused the emotion then? And is there a specific aversion for asking yourself ""why""?"
2088,estp,"How would you recommend approaching an ESTP friend who sees to be ""shovelling"" too much recently that it affects him and people around him? Without being intrusive and coming across as a know-it-all NFJ that I am lol"
2089,estp,"I think if I see a trend that causes an emotion and that emotion is negative, yes Id avoid the situation in the future (or just power through it to desensitize to it). 
I wouldn't say there's specific aversion to asking myself ""why"". It's just what happens naturally. I'm not afraid of introspection, it's just that normally I just track the trends of situations and find patterns."
2090,estp,"Well, the truth is that for most types, even more so ESTPs, they won't do anything you tell them to do haha
Just putting the idea out there, without saying ""you should do that"". If you are indeed a NFJ, you know exactly what I'm talking about when bringing awareness to an issue without mentioning it :p
Be evasive, talk about how he might feel or react when so and so happens. I think that ESTPs just love to be heard. (hence the cool relationship with INFJ usually) If you can just hear his thought process when he feels bad and be NON judgemental, he might open up. If he does, no judgement again and hint him towards experiencing the emotions. He will figure out by himself then how to ""fix"" that."
2091,estp,"I tend to solve 95% of my problems by having a friend that I just talk or text raw thoughts to. I'll get them all out, then hear or read them back and think ""Wow that guy is a little bitch."" Then the way not to be a bitch appears easier since it's all outside of me.
Edit: The best way I can describe how I work out my thoughts is I need some of your brain space to set up a little room and you will be the walls. Then you need to toss me in that room and let me talk and shout all of my thoughts out. Most of which you don't need to intervene with but if you ever hear something serious (self mutilation, self loathing, or negative thoughts towards others) I need you to come in and give me a reality check then let me go back to working it out."
2092,estp,"Hahah exactly! Totally agree with the first two paragraphs. 
This is what gets me stuck with ESTPs. Being a little too inaccurate with the whole ""help ESTP in obvious need"" and I evoke that negative emotion the person has shoved down. Hence, I'll be shoved down too. Thanks for advice btw!"
2093,estp,"Why should you feel the emotion? Hmm because it can be a beautiful emotion that gives the world another, beautiful dimension. It leads to understanding yourself, and thus, people around you. You are less judgmental, more empathetic, emotionally acute and aware. Feeling the emotion is different from actions on it or displaying it."
2094,estp,"I can understand myself and the cause of the emotion without feeling that way, though
As for others, I'm not sure if this is me or other ESTPs are like this, but I really don't want to understand the people around me unless I have to or take an interest in doing it myself. I don't care about them or what they have going on, it makes no difference to me. The only people's emotions that aren't my own that I concern myself with are those close to me such as close friends, family, a significant other. I'm not very sympathetic/empathetic and really have no desire to be"
2095,estp,"It's one of the better type matches for ESTP, basically anything with Fe or Ni is a decent match. Avoid Fi lol. Called ""mirage relationship"" in socionics: ESTP type matches."

​
ESTP Strengths
ESTPs are loved by almost everyone they meet. They have their own brand of humor, and others are drawn to their charisma. They love to be the center of attention. They always try to be straight-forward with others — a trait that others often appreciate — and rarely sugar-coat things.
ESTPs are great problem-solvers. They are very resourceful and are able to adapt easily when necessary. They are able to think critically and logically when making decisions, rarely letting their emotions cloud their judgment. When confronted with a problem, ESTPs try to use the information available to make the best decision, hoping for the best. They place a great deal of trust their own judgement, which is based solely off of unbiased logic and reasoning. They have little tolerance for intuitive judgments. Rather, they prefer to evaluate the information available to them and make a decision quickly.
ESTPs have initiative, and others often describe them as “doers”. They are very competitive, and are always pushing themselves to be the best. This helps them become very successful in life, particularly in their careers. 
​
ESTP Weaknesses
Because ESTPs are very detail-oriented, and may have a difficult time thinking about big concepts or theories. They would much rather focus on realistic possibilities that are practical, rather than big ideas with limited practical importance. At times, it may be hard for ESTPs to see the “big picture”, or see too far into the future, and they may get caught up in details of the present moment instead.
ESTPs are not afraid to take risks. In some cases, this can be a positive trait. However, these risk-taking tendencies often make ESTPs prone to making poorly thought-out decisions. They may make irresponsible financial choices—gambling or making impulsive purchases. At times like these, ESTPs often forget about their responsibilities and how their actions may affect others. Aside from this, ESTPs’ impulsiveness may make them prone to difficulties in other areas of their lives. They are constantly seeking new and exciting things, making it hard for an ESTP to focus in school. It is critical that ESTPs continually practice keeping their impulses in check. If ESTPs are able to keep their impulsiveness in check, however, their enthusiasm and charisma will help them become very successful in life.
​
ESTP Parenthood
ESTPs are fun-loving and playful parents. They enjoy engaging in whatever activities their children are interested in, and are not afraid of making a fool of themselves in the process! Their spontaneous nature helps them keep their kids having fun and learning. They have no problem planning hands-on activities that help their children learn and grow. They are very understanding when their children make mistakes, and because of this, their children rarely feel the need to hide their mistakes from their ESTP parent. This helps build the foundation for open and honest communication, forming a great parent-child relationship.
ESTP parents are able to give their children the freedom they need to become their own individual selves and follow their hearts. ESTP parents do not force their children to participate in any particular activities. Instead, they allow their children to explore whatever it is that interests them.
Because they rely so heavily on logic and reason, ESTP parents sometimes have difficulty parenting “F” (feeling) types. They may have trouble comforting children who they view as overly-sensitive.
​
ESTP Romantic Relationships
ESTPs are looking for a fun-loving and exciting partner. They want to make the most of every day with their romantic partner, and are always looking for new and fun date ideas and things to experience with their romantic partners. ESTPs also take their lives one day at a time. Because of this, they may have trouble committing to a long-term relationship. They may try to put off making long-term plans or settling down the their romantic partner.
ESTPs truly believe that actions speak louder than words. They are constantly striving to make sure their romantic partners are satisfied, and enjoy giving gifts and planning fun experiences with their romantic partner. However, they may have trouble giving their partner words of affirmation. In the eyes of an ESTP, love is obvious — they don’t see the need to constantly say “I love you” to their partner.
​
ESTP Friendships
ESTPs’ observational skills make them excellent friends. They are always able to assess others’ feelings, goals, and perspectives. ESTPs have the uncanny ability to detect when others are not being genuine, allowing them to build friendships with people who truly are genuine and caring.
ESTPs may come off as flashy or over-the-top to others who are more introverted. However, once others get to know ESTPs, they are very empathetic and caring.
​
ESTP Work Habits
ESTPs are action-oriented in the workplace. They are great at making decisions quickly and under pressure. This, coupled with the fact that they aren’t afraid of taking risks, can help them propel their career forward quickly. This tendency can also be detrimental to their career, however. ESTPs must be aware of this tendency and try to reign in this tendency at times.
ESTPs also can become friends with their coworkers easily. They go out of their way to talk to others, and are great at networking. They can talk easily with their superiors, subordinates, clients, and coworkers — they truly are social butterflies.
​
ESTP Career Paths
ESTPs thrive in a fast-paced environment that allows them to use their creativity and insightfulness. Similarly, they usually are not well-suited for jobs that have a lot of routine and repetition. ESTPs are usually well-suited for jobs as sales representatives, entrepreneurs, athletes, marketing representatives, paramedics, police officers, or computer technicians.

2097,estp,"For me, I value realism and mental fortitude.  Just be for real.  Say what you mean.  And handle your business.  Without dramatics.  Pull up your bootstraps and do what needs to be done.
I cannot stand histrionics, melodrama, weakness and an inability to cope."
2098,estp,"I (26F) have recently started online dating this past year and I must say it’s been...interesting. I haven’t been in a serious relationship by choice due to work, school, spending time with my friends, and doing some self discovery. I’m at the point in my life now where Im open to the possibility of a relationship. 
If I’m talking to someone that’s sparked my interest, I am sooo into them-thinking about them through out the day, wondering if they’re thinking of me, have butterflies when they text me something cute, etc and then the moment I find something that I don’t like about them (example: repeated attempts to bend my already established boundaries) or that something may seem “off” (possessive or controlling characteristics surface) I first asses myself and see if it’s something I may be doing, that’s causing these negative feelings/thoughts toward someone. When I realize that it’s not me (which isn’t always the case.. I can be a bit blunt or matter of fact and that gets me in trouble sometimes), I am perfectly fine with just not seeing/talking  to them again. It’s like a switch that goes off-it’s really weird I can’t explain it. It could take me a couple dates in to realize this about said person of interest. When explaining my dating life with my best friend who is an ESFP, she doesn’t understand how I can “cut someone off” lol. It’s hard for her to process or even fathom letting someone go so quickly after having a lot of feelings for them. She can tolerate a fair amount of b/s and I just don’t have the patience for it. 
On another note-I can lose interest fairly quickly in someone also. It’s the same thing, I could be totally into them or be invested in their life and then I kinda get bored and just let things fizzle out. Eh yikes right? Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have any advice? "
2099,estp,"This happens to me a lot. However, I'm not nearly as eloquent as you. I'll be brief. 
I always put open communication on the table immediately. It ensures that my partner knows I'm earnest. Then, I make sure to reenforce the traits I like with sincere compliments. If my partner and I split after getting close... It's cold turkey. They will usually understand because I've told them I only do things with honesty and openness. Continuing to talk would feel cheap. They usually know that too. "
2100,estp,"There's always going to be some form of bs, unless the red flags a huge red flags if you're cutting people out of your life for petty things, and are absolutely ok with it there may be a different underlying probelm. likeing someone to the point where you obsess over them might be the problem to begin with because you start painting them a certain way when you haven't given yourself a chance to get to know them, so you mislead yourself on who the person really is and become weirded out or dissapointed when the persons veers from what you initially thought. Also I've learned sometimes some of our biggest flaws don't go away you just have to awknowledge them and try out other strategies. The people you're talking to might get the initial feelings that you're putting out, maybe they don't know how to deal with it either. Also I've been in situations where my ex at first really wanted attention and would get upset if she didn't get a certain amount of it and once I thought I got how much attention she liked, she'd flip it and ask me why I'm clingy. Which I'm not, but seeing that she somewhat groomed me into giving her a certain amount of attention It became natural until it wasn't. If certain problems are repetitive I'd definitely take the time to reflect if you may have aided in certain behaviors. It's really hard to give advice online because I don't really know you so all I can give you is a bunch of different situations that you might want to consider, that being said I hope I brought a different perspective to your situation."
2101,estp,"Yeah I experience it quite often. I find me and my other xSTP friends have issues with relationships. It's different with guys I'm sure but a lot of girls don't like when I basically tell them they are crossing my boundaries, don't respect my boundaries, and a lot of them don't wanna communicate their issues with me and beat around the bush when I ask what's up or communicate my issues with the potential relationship. I get pretty blunt at times with them too which don't help when you're dating a more sensitive person but ignoring it will only cause issues in the future when you do start being blunt so it's best to be blunt from the start Imo otherwise you'll get the ""you've changed I can't do this anymore"" thing. Then again I also tend to date crazy girls so that may have something to do with it. Also when you cut them off do you just ghost them or do you straight up tell them you don't think it's gonna work? "
2102,estp,"I agree, I have definitely done a lot of self reflection over the years and not perfect by any means. I have some things im still working on. Im not really obsessing over them, I just grow really fond of them. Like I could see some future potential (unless that’s obsessing, and if that’s case I’m screwed! Lol) and it’s not like that with every person either. I have definitely learned a lot of the past year from online dating. I can never get a good read on somebody by skimming their profile or even in the couple messages we send. I’m not into texting or messaging a whole bunch, and would rather just meet in person. I’m a terrible texter tbh. Thanks for sharing, sounds like that situation became complicated. Did that in some way affect your next relationship or did you work on that before you were ready for the next one? If it’s easier, you can pm me too-whatever works. "
2103,estp,"You should not ghost, generally....but definitely not if you and the other party have been intimate. That’s sort of a fair baseline, IMO. 
Think about it this way: If you’re that blunt, you shouldn’t have a problem telling it like it is one last time. "
2104,estp,"Yeah I completely get it. It honestly depends on the situation. If we had a genuine connection and were talking for a while and it was me who lost interest, Im usually up front-even if it’s hella uncomfortable. If it’s someone who just straight up ignores my boundaries or likes to play games, I really see no point in waisting my breath. "
2105,estp,"I include everything within reason. I usually adjust as I get closer to someone. 
When my partner shares something that is personal, I will bring up the importance of communication. Again, I will fist tell them I appreciate their openness in the form of a compliment or other form of recognition. Then, I explain why. It will also come up relatively easily when a conversation turns to sex.
My dad always told me that any criticism should be accompanied by at least two compliments. I thinks it's an easy thing to do if you are interested in, or care about, someone. If it's not that easy... it's pretty obvious that it's not going to work on my end. "
2106,estp,"I mean  in that relationship it wasn't a lasting problem at that point. We were getting out of the honeymoon phase of the relationship, not sure if you've made it to that point or if you get red flags before then, but I was trying to relate to something that might steer you away, but in the end the person could have just misread the situation and can control themselves. It might have been done there if she was judgmental and wasn't forgiving. I just respected my time more even if she complained about it. I stopped changing who I was to please her and just was true to myself. Sometimes she'd get upset, but long run she respected me a lot more for it. It was a good lesson to learn. Can't learn if we're not making mistakes. "
2107,estp,"I couldn't agree more. After dating someone for half a year only to not get along when we finally met, I always push for a date as soon as possible. There are always things that get misinterpreted when texting and even talking over discord/ts will only show whether personalities match, not lifestyles."
2108,estp,"Oh yeah obvious games there's no point cause they are just try to disguise their games better or just drop you themselves. But with boundaries I straight up tell them they are ignoring my boundaries, and if it continues happening then I just drop them. Better to be single than constantly be disrespected anyways. "
2109,estp,"What do you chill to? What do you get amped to? What puts some swagger in your step?
Ofc that's a lot of music to answer with, and I probably couldn't do it without some thought but fuck it, since it's my OP I'll give it a shot
Vibe and chill: anything that sounds good. I'm pretty guilty of jamming to mainstream music that admittedly isn't great, but it sounds catchy and appealing to zone out to with it in the background. Mainly rap and pop. I'm in my 20s, so the songs we used to grow up listening to also fit, I'm never embarrassed to throw it back a little bit to the classic 2000s songs we all used to love
Pump up and swagger: Songs that are fast paced or have intensity to them. I also like a good chorus or hook for sure. Rap and trap/EDM for sure. Money and the Power by Kid Ink for instance is one of my favorite songs to just get into the zone to. My university's football hype song is Higher Ground by TNGHT, when it bumps in the stadium I get ridiculously lifted although that atmosphere is already extremely electric anyway, it just adds to it
So what about you guys?"
2110,estp,"To keep myself from over complicating it, I'm going to answer with all Led Zeppelin(Since they're my fall back band anyway.):
Chill: ""Going To California"" ""Over The Hills""
Pump Up: ""Heartbreaker/Living Loving Woman"" ""The Ocean"" ""When The Levee Breaks"" any of their meaner sounding tracks."
2111,estp,"Chill - Recondite, Tipper, CFCF, Nicolas Jaar
Amped - Gabriel & Dresden, Infected Mushroom, Black Flag, Social Distortion
Always down for Pink Floyd, CCR, Zepp, Black Sabbath at any time 
Can't do rap or country... total vibe killers."
2112,estp,"So dom tert loops are different than being in the grip.
ESTP's and ENFJ's would have a Se-Fe loop. Entailing impulsiveness in the face of others. Actions and choices made simply to evoke a visible emotional response.
Loops happen to extroverts when they check their extroverted functions with there other extroverted functions without ever introducing their inner self. So the solution to this would be to check yourself with your Ti-Ni.
Is this action necessary? Would I want someone to do this to me? Does it help me accomplish my ultimate goal? The answers to these questions require some degree of introspection which, if evoked, might lead to more thought out decision making.
I honestly can't speak to the legitimacy of this framework. It makes sense, but I haven't found a reputable source on this."
2113,estp,"HAHA ^ This. I take pride in being situationally aware and adaptable. One thing I can add, I suppose, is that I can make accurate insights but instead of coming off as ""empathetic,"" or ""understanding,"" it puts people off. They pull their guard up. I've definitely learned that you can't go around telling people about themselves. "
2114,estp,"Yes, I'm currently working on this. I'm also bad at interrupting people the moment I think I understand the issue at hand, usually to offer a solution before the conclusion of whatever's being said."
2115,estp,"I haven't tried many new things recently, but about a half a year ago I gave learning manual transmission a go and got it pretty much down in 10-15 minutes of trying. I'd say we're pretty hands-on people so just give us some time to learn about something ourselves and we'll try to master it."
2116,estp,"ESTPs are great, you guys have this presence that demands attention, its stunning.
You guys are able to hear me out, letting my take my time to formulate my ideas, and aren't shy to tell me when Im wrong, and Im ready to do the same!
You guys are brave and are quick at making friends and getting shit done.
When you guys get emotional Im ready to lend an ear, which I like doing. Its funny how you guys can be a stone wall to some people and then be so soft on the inside. And when I get emotional you guys help me clear my head. 
You guys share life with others, and that sharing makes it better for everyone, my fav part about you guys.
I feel like I can relax around you guys and recharge, when ya'll are not dragging me into some awesome adventure. 
You guys are beautiful, strong and amazing people. 
So go out there and get it! <3  
Love from an INFJ  "
2117,estp,"Aww thanks 
I have an INFJ friend and I would say the same thing back. I would definitely say he is the missing puzzle piece to me. Although we are vastly different from each other, we somehow mesh together in what we view of the world and others, and have similar senses of humor that we don’t need to be so PC about.
Something about him is immensely calming. Yeah, he does help me get emotionally grounded and he is very dependable and trustworthy. I don’t have many friends like that to be honest. INFJs are like golden apples you guys are awesome"
2118,estp,"(Background: we're both in college and neither of us have ever been in a relationship) 
I'am an ENFP (sometimes esfp) guy and I'm having nonstop thoughts about my ESTP friend (female).
When I first met her through a friend I thought she was fairly attractive and carried herself in a fun way, which was cool because I'm all about fun and what not; anyways, every time we hung out drunk we would end up hooking up with each other in club/party/kick back type situations, however one time was different from the rest.
It happened when she hosted a little party for our friend that was studying abroad. While we were hooking up in her bedroom she was saying, ""I'am normally not like this"" as well as ""I normally don't have guys like this in my room"". The day after I realized that I was fairly attracted to her so I asked her if she wanted to hang out some other time and well she basically responded by saying, ""I don't hang out with guys in public"" ""it's not me, it's not what I do"" in which me being the little ENFP that I'am responded saying ""whaaaa what why not""?. She repeated her self but I replied back with a couple jokes on the topic that made her laugh because I wanted to lighten up her mood, and well, from that day on......we became FRIENDS!
As weeks and months passed by out friendship grew stronger. She started coming to me to talk about problems and we would spend a lot of time hanging out together alone, and even in public haha, however, as more and more time started to pass by hooking up between her and I started to disappear and in return we kinda became best friends in a way. 
The thing is, I haven't made a move on her in a while just because I've been enjoying her compony and getting to know her as a person. (I think ESTP's are the coolest personality types because if they truly care for you they'll show you a part of them that NO ONE or a select few will ever see) But it has kind of dragged on too long in my mind. 
Like I personally want to make a move again but I'am just so scared of destroying our friendship since we haven't hooked up in awhile; I don't want to come off on the wrong foot. Also, if I haven't shown it, I have feelings her...and having some feelings in return would be cool too, so how can I tell that she has feelings for me? and what do I do to win her and fix up my mess that I made?
Thanks so much you guys! 
Btw, something I forgot to put in the post was that there was a gap where we stopped talking because the only form of communication was through my friend at the time or just us talking over text. Anyways because me and the ESTP would only text, the ESTP would frequently ask my friend when she'll bring me over or when she'll be able to hang out and see me again."
2119,estp,"Yeah okay, i have something to say about this dynamic.
The ESTP withdrew from intimacy because they do not want to feel heartache. It was great when there were no consequences... but you can only hook up so many times before someone starts to have feelings. Essentially, this is the relationship cock-blocker. You can't fight against that either or you'll push the ESTP further away. 
The ESTP has a very accurate sense of your emotional availability and in all honesty you guys will probably not hook up again until you drop the expectation back down to zero. That's kinda the reason why you got friend-zoned here. You represent a threat to the ESTPs individuality and freedom.
It has nothing to do with how you match-up or being a good enough fit.
You must understand that you are trying to exert control over the ESTP. You'll never admit it because you are ENFP and i know that you (frequently) don't acknowledge your own agenda. Such is the nature of Ne-Fi.
My advice to you is to take the hint; Withdraw a little yourself. If you can't do that the ESTP won't trust you to get closer. It's basically the one thing you need to realise. Don't cage an ESTP. We'll reject you completely if you represent more limitation than freedom. And you can't offer us freedom like a carrot of a stick to put us in a cage because we're too perceptive for that trick.
Also it has absolutely nothing to do with ""there's something wrong with you"". It's not about that at all. You have different agendas and it needs to be acknowledged. The ESTP has an agenda for fun. You have an agenda for a relationship. You probably find it hard to believe that anyone could not be looking for a relationship and yet still be intimate... well... i can assure you that the ESTP is not secretly thinking about a long term relationship.
They are not playing hard to get.
This is pretty much why my last relationship crumbled. Except is was reversed in gender. Anyway, the ENFP girl i was dating couldn't help herself but emotionally tie me down and that makes me anxious... eventually she took it very personally when something wasn't reciprocated and got all hurt and told me to go fuck myself.
Do you see the anxiety that your ESTP friend expressed the last time you guys were hooking up? ""This isn't me..."" etc... The only time a ESTP feels like they have lost control is through anxiety.
That's because you got too close.
If you really want to have a relationship with this person you need to be able to let her go. Does that sound like the hardest thing ever? Well let me tell you... that is because your agendas don't line up."
2120,estp,"Yeaaah... Forget about her, she's just not into you. She might enjoy your company but you will never win her heart. Chances are she already has someone in mind / she is seeing someone but hasn't told anyone yet."
2121,estp,"Thank's for the detailed reply (it's pretty funny that we're in reverse rolls).
Anyways, I have some questions: 
What did you mean by ""drop the expectation back down to zero"". As in don't get tied up with wanting feelings out of our relationship...kinda like ""just play it cool""? 
Also, when you tell me to ""withdraw a little yourself"" do you mean to stop talking to her? Like just space our friendship out and try not show emotion that can lead into something like a relationship? 
And, when you tell me to let her go do you mean stop talking to her as a friend as well?....it does sound a little hard
""You must understand that you are trying to exert control over the ESTP. You'll never admit it because you are ENFP and i know that you (frequently) don't acknowledge your own agenda. Such is the nature of Ne-Fi"". Is so true haha thanks for making it apparent to me! 
Btw, something I forgot to put in the post was that there was a gap where we stopped talking because the only form of communication was through my friend at the time. Anyways because me and the ESTP would text, the ESTP would frequently ask my friend when she'll bring me over or when she'll be able to hang out with me again."
2122,estp,"Hey no worries... but i have bad news for you... You are currently in the friend zone. If you want to leave the friend zone then that will require you to get away from that person. Like actually leave them. Alone. Completely.
Why?
Because the game needs to be reset. There is no point in saving your progress. Game Over. And this is the mistake i see lots of guys make... when you got rejected you tried to carry on... you made her laugh instead of just leaving. It doesn't matter how nice you were the ESTP will see this as dishonest. Actually leaving at that moment is manipulative too (but ESTPs have some respect for manipulation).
Let me pull out a couple of quotes from my post...
I'm talking about emotional availability. Make yourself unavailable and (if she is interested) she'll let you know. This works well because it means you don't waste any time with inaction... and it's still the best thing to get the girl.
In plain text. Your desire to form a relationship is cock blocking you.
I shouldn't have been ambiguous. You need to get over the crush. That's really inconvenient right? Not really... It would actually help you if you can date other girls. There's nothing more painful than seeing someone with a crush stay in the friend zone. It's unhealthy for you.
You don't have to stop talking. But you can't be interested in forming or progressing a relationship with her. I should know because i did this in my last relationship and the girl walked away saying i was cold hearted.
Well it's a nice thing to think about. But kinda irrelevant if this happened some time ago. Plus you didn't give any real detail here about the situation (why no direct contact, etc)... either way it's irrelevant if you've been rejected since this happened.
It seems contextually different to the rest of the atmosphere in your writing. So i've assumed this extra bit is irrelevant because of how much has changed since then."
2123,estp,"Once again thanks for the content! 
You're so right about making myself unavailable. Every time I hang out with one of her friends, she'll text me the next day or a couple days later with plans to hang out. Not that it is the case but it could be. Haha one time at this rave her best friend and I (friend of mine as well) disappeared (we we're dancing, making out, and doing our own thing else where). My phone was dead but when I charged it I noticed that she was sending me so many text's asking where I was at in such an aggressive matter haha.
I feel you though and understand what you mean by ditching this ""relationship mindset"" It makes perfect sense and I'm pretty happy that I'm able to see what you mean so I can put it into practice. Thanks for being the homie dude. 
and I forgot to say this earlier but I'm sorry about your situation, it seems like the girl went head over heels with her emotions. 
Now one final question, just out of curiosity, what attracted you to your enfp friend before things went down hill? "
2124,estp,"Im and estp and my ex is an estj. Recently she calls me  just to see how I am doing and stuff. Then she begins to act really affectionate towards me and tells me how she's sorry for everything she has done to me. Long story short, I think she wants to get back together with me because shes calling me ""babe"" and sending ""I miss you"" texts whenever I dont respond. We broke up over 3 years ago and she said she hasnt been in a relationship in over a year, and to top it all off she keep sasking if I'm seeing anyone, and I'm trying to change the sbject on that ;). I really do like her but I feel like I cant trust her, at all. She was ""the big one"" if you know what I mean and it makes me feel like she wants to make me her rebound after her last breakup. Can she be trusted? Is she just using me? Answers please!"
2125,estp,"These type of questions I feel shouldn't be based upon the personality types. Even though the personality type can have an effect or explain her behaviour, you as a person will know her better than what her description might follow. 
From a female's perspective she definitely wants to get back together, however if you feel like you can't trust her then don't go for it. If her breakup was over a year ago, you probably aren't a rebound exactly but may seem like an easy solution for her loneliness. "
2126,estp,"There are two issues here to concern yourself with.


Nostalgia is a powerful emotion and that could be what she is feeling. Probably the point she is missing is that she is wistfully looking at a version of you that is 3 years out of date.


Trust is an incredibly difficult thing to regain.  I'm in a similar circumstance.  Even though a section of me knows we clicked on every level, I don't trust her any longer.  And there isn't anything I can envision that she can do to get that trust back. 

"
2127,estp,"Actually by reading your post I feel like you already know the answer man. 
It's very hard to understand who an ESTP & ESTJ can get together as ESTJ are all about law, order and security, which we find boring as for us: ""there are no rules"". 
BUT if you really loved her and that she was ""the big one"", I would definitely suggest to think really hard about some simple questions:
- Why did you guys break up in the first place? 
- Who broke it up ? 
- Are you happy now? 
- Do you think you would be happy-ier if you were to get back together? 
- Has she changed or have you changed? 
Keep in mind that knowing that ESTJ value order and security before anything else, maybe she's confuse after her break up and she's trying to rely on something that felt ""familiar"" to her which is you/your relationship.
Anyway, I hope you find peace and whatever you decide, you do it for you and for your happiness, life is short, let's live it to the fullest and not waste too much time on dwelling on the past ;)"
2128,estp,"This pairing gets a lot of flack on the internet for possibly being the worst. NFPs are often paired with other intuitives and ESTPs are often paired with IxxJs.
This, however, is not necessarily how it is in real life (although the pairing of ESTP x ISFJ are certainly real.)
I only know of three confirmed ENFPs; one is my friend and married an xSTP. Another is an ESTP guy friend and his wife is an ENFP.
One MBTI youtuber even pointed out that ENFPs actually statistically marry STPs the most irl.
​
I also noticed on here and personality cafe, there are many ESTPs who have INFPs wives/partners which really surprised me.
Unless of course, everyone has been mistyped. Said STPs are actually STJs or the NFPs are actually SFJs.
What are your thoughts on this, ESTPs?"
2129,estp,"I'm an ESTP woman married to an ISTP man and we get along famously.  We also offset each other REALLY well.
I have 4 children and my youngest is an ENFP and also happens to be the child I ""connect"" w/ the best.
I do typically clash really hard w/ ISTJ's  as they usually tend to drive me up the wall."
2130,estp,"My work wife is an INFP and it's amazing. I get her out of her shell and she helps me think, 'should I really get into that?!', but most of the time we just have a good time (as much as possible since it's still work)."
2131,estp,"There definitely is something that attracts these two types to one another initially but i have read countless stories about it later turning into unhealthy relationships. 
Communication is one major issue and STPs may be a bit too insensitive for NFPs, sounds like the kind of relationship that is doomed in the long run, after the passion dies.
Personal opinion: ESTPs get bored too easily either with people or their circumstances. Another issue for NFPs. "
2132,estp,"I also clash with ISTJs. Dominant Si is a huge pain.
I'm glad you brought up connection because some of my strongest connections were with ESTPs even if sometimes, we get on each other's nerves.
What are your other children's types?"
2133,estp,"Oh yeah. Dated an ENFP for a year and a half. When the explicit communication wasn't bad  (it was 60% of the time towards the end), it felt like I was walking on eggshells - probably for her as well. Does it seem like she's annoyed I'm not giving her the praise she wants to her random comments she's making? Cue passive aggressiveness and resentment.  To be fair, I did it quite a bit as well. Overall was just a mess and unlike the natural ""understanding of the other"" like with ISFJs and INFPs to an extent. To make matters worse, it was a long distance relationship for most of it since she was off playing soccer in random countries.
A lot of this transcends type but that's my experience, and I've dated / been in a relationship with quite a bit of people.
edit: the sex was good tho"
2134,estp,"I had an ESTP ex and i am INFP, can confirm, communication used to be a major pain in the ass. Felt like walking on egg shells for me in the beginning and later for him (when i was close to leaving) but then again we were both mentally unhealthy at different times so that could have been another issue. "
2135,estp,I don't know about the older 3 as I haven't gotten them to actually sit down and take the test for me yet but I can say with certainty that the oldest is an extrovert like the youngest and myself while the two middle kids are introverts like their father.
2136,estp,Yep. You can't take the Si sense-impressions (judgments) seriously without spiraling into their subjectivity. Its hilarious how intuitives think Si is sooooo grounded while they're actually really airy in a kind of boring way. 
2137,estp,"It’s surviving well actually! We work at it. Our arguments are for sure more frustrating than any other I’ve experienced, he tries to figure out what I “mean” and it seems to take the place of his listening to what I’m actually saying. I, on the other hand, take him too literally and can miss the point he’s trying to make. But we understand this about each other and learn techniques- like texting is better for us than in person. "
2138,estp,"I'm always going to need structure in my life and I think an ISFJ would provide not only that, but would compliment my ""let's go do this"" personality. If life was only adventures and opportunities, I'd absolutely date another ENFP, but there's unfortunately more nuance to it. The first girl I dated on/off for 6 years in high school / college is an ISFJ, and other than our immaturity, we were actually a great fit.
That said, we'll see what happens. "
2139,estp,With a weak Fe growing up emotionally dint know what people were trying to do  and seemed insignificant and avoided it but a lot of people seemed to have tried to emotionally fuck with me  while growing up only realising it now after developing Fe to some extent. 
2140,estp,I slammed some weights at the gym last week while i having a bad day. An old lady complained about the noise and her personal trainer told me off in a condescending way. Was thinking about smashing the back of his knee with a heavy plate but didnt do it because I was in the wrong.
2141,estp,"Nah I just like going to the gym to release dopamine. I rarely get angry compared to when I was a teenager. I try to hold back anger as much as possible, even if i do lose my temper, I would be calm in under 30 seconds"
2142,estp,"This a problem for me. I need A LOT of social interaction. 
If I'm home alone for more than 2 nights in a week I start feeling lonely and depressed. I make sure to spend a lot of time with my friends or boyfriend (but we just broke up this morning). 
Usually when I'm single I line up dates for almost every night. For the first time in a while I feel like I want to just take some time to reflect and focus on self improvement and my hobbies/art."
2143,estp,"I’m extremely independent and also very satisfied with the way I am, so I refuse to change even slightly to satisfy anyone else. I live for myself and myself only. Because of that, I end up losing a lot of friendships and romantic relationships. It’s a pretty lonely way to live, and it can be rough, but at the end of the day I’d rather be myself and be alone than fake my personality and change for others, because the reality is that I’m the only person who is 100% guaranteed to be in my life. I don’t think you can ever fully rely on anyone to stick around and be there for you, so what sense does it make to change who you are to please others? I think as long as you are pleased with who you are and can look in the mirror at the end of the day and be satisfied, that’s all that really matters. You will always have yourself, so be somebody that you can love. "
2144,estp,"I had this irrational fear of being alone and failing in life , these two used to be my nightmare and I would do anything to avoid it but I had repressed it so much that I had to embrace it at one point in my life and first become comfortable with the idea of  being a failure and being alone. Now I’m comfortable with both,  it’s weird but it isn’t that bad it’s actually very  balanced than  what I was before ,introspection and self awareness are good tools to have for someone like us whose life can be quite fast to even notice what’s happening within us. But too much alone time is detrimental too  as I can dig myself in some deep rabbit hole.  
It was thrilling to face both these fears and embrace them  actually loved going towards something that was threatening  me and to finally make peace with it. "
2145,estp,"I love being alone. 
My true personality comes out when I have money and am at a party where I can be as loud as I can (my place).
If I could I would live alone the rest of my life but I've come to realize that I need to interact with people in order to maintain my mental health at a optimal level.
Only women that I'm in a relationship with I can tolerate the most.
I realize that I'm lonely when I start to dream that I'm either hanging out with friends or with a love interest. Usually legal and illegal drugs fix that for a moment"
2146,estp,"If I'm being forced to stay inside, alone, for more than 2 days I start getting anxious.
How I get through it is by going outside (walking, jogging). It is possible for me to replace social interaction with online, but I start getting more frustrated because I prefer meeting people in real life and interacting with them face-to-face and going places.
​
In the off-chance I can't go outside for more than 2 days, I go on the internet and try to be productive with a project or something to keep me occupied. I usually blast loud/exciting music (eurobeat, rock) to help my mind wander and let me relax. Sometimes I even read self-improvement novels, or start reading about philosophy or other questions I have in my mind on what to do. Eventually at some point I'll figure out a solution to my loneliness, and that is usually finding a way to get outside (if in the case I'm ever restricted to, which is terrible)."
2147,estp,"Meditation. Yoga. Prayer. Etc. Realize that we desperately need these because of our inferior Ni. Otherwise we will be stressed, jittery, anxious, and not our true honest natural selves. Also sooner is better than later."
2148,estp,"yes!!! this is exactly me. getting through that phase, or rather, facing that right now, i’m very comfortable in the more emotional/deep realm. i love to dive deeper in & explore my mind. now, i enjoy the calm rather than chasing after the thrills. 
if u want to know, i’m 17 this year. i’ve forced myself to face that area so much that i think i’ve developed my Ni inferior quite a bit."
2149,estp,"it becomes easier if you actually have a bad time doing it which I'd say it's something rare in ESTPs 
Just like good ol' Jimmy said: ""Solitude is dangerous. It’s very addictive. It becomes a habit after you realize how calm and peaceful it is. It’s like you don’t want to deal with people anymore because they drain your energy.""
Being alone is a hell of a drug but don't do it too much or you will sink down deep in the rabbit hole.
Don't get me wrong, I can easily make friends but I just choose not to because of the implications that come with it (hanging out, birthdays, etc.). It's fun but I'm too much of a cunt to care for most people"
2150,estp,"To anyone with even an inkling of what to do in a Sensor/Intuitive relationship:

background
I'm an ENTP dating an ESTP, and it's been awesome.  We have lots of fun and I think we get another in a Ti/Fe way that makes everything feel very secure, trustworthy, and reliable.  On the surface everything is perfectly healthy and sustainable.  I've probed (subtly), and he seems to be enjoying himself.
However, I've been struggling to emotionally connect, and it's been frustrating me to the point that I find myself talking myself out of a relationship altogether.  He's super supportive and nothing but kind, but conversation never goes beyond a certain point.
He isn't the only ESTP I struggle to connect with either.  My sister is so ESTP it hurts.  She's been my closest family member, now and while growing up.  And yet, I can't reach this emotional connection with her either.  I ask introspective questions and get back genetic responses.

question
How the heck do you get an ESTP into an emotional or introspective conversation?  Is this something strictly for the world of Intuitive weirdos, or am I simply missing the correct cipher to crack this code?"
2151,estp,"What kind of emotional connection are you looking for? Maybe He and She already feel connected to you
What kind of introspective questions are you making and what type of response do you want back?
sorry I fried my brain this weekend so I'm a bit denser than usual"
2152,estp,Ehhhh I think it is possible w a more mature ESTP . I have a good ENTP friend and we have pretty though provoking convos where I’ve shared sensitive info and he has talked about his random theories/ideas. I definitely wouldn’t have been capable of this in my early 20s though. I’m 29 now. I think the ESTP has to be comfortable with you to share and be able to have those convos. I still don’t think my level of deepness will ever be enough for say... INTJ relationshipwise.
2153,estp,"Im In the exact same kind of relationship. (ENTP with ESTP) it comes with its difficulties yeah. I think we view that connection different than they do, and im sure if you asked your bf and sister they would say they feel emotional connected to you."
2154,estp,"A thought: ask us what we think, not what we feel. Find ways to fashion the kind of life and death questions you want to ask around questions that are intellectual rather than emotional; and build the emotional side in afterwards, as evidence towards the point you are making."
2155,estp,"Lol!  You're super coherent for a fried brain, not dense at all ;)
I'm not exactly an emotional expert myself...  I know that it's an emotional connection I find with Ni-doms.
I think there's an outer ENTP layer that's playful and fun, but on the inside there's all the seriousness and pain.  I want to feel capable of being serious, exposing that side of myself, and sharing ideas or thoughts that aren't immediately relevant to action or fun.
For example, I want to be able to talk about a childhood memory or fear of death without boring the other person, and preferably have them participate somehow?  It doesn't have to be philosophical depth 24/7, but it'd be nice to be capable of having those conversations and relating on that level.
With the ESTPs I know those conversations feel stunted, and I end up ""squashing"" my Ne, hiding it away in a corner.  In some ways it feels like I'll never get to know them if I can't gather some insight into their inner world."
2156,estp,"What do you think changed with maturity?  I guess in Jungian terms, you'd be developing Ni later in life?
Interesting that you compare to INTJ...  What about them or their conversations is ""deeper""?
Kinda disheartening, because in my experience conversations with INTJs, INFJs, and ENTPs always seem about the same level or depth."
2157,estp,"What's an example of a good indicator of emotional connection for an ESTP?
I dated an ESTP for almost two years, and even though he was big on Acts of Service, he'd be kind to nearly everyone.  He'd go out of his way to help strangers, like an old woman with a lot of groceries, so I can't really connect caring behavior to myself on a personal level.  This socially-respectable friendliness is confusing, lol.
Guess you guys are just too damn charming! :P"
2158,estp,"I guess I still struggle to get him to get into more “deep” conversations, but I try to get my need fulfilled from other people. (As in friendly conversations no cheating lol)
I find that where we really connect is through a shared passion/hobby. For us that is fitness/health. We can rant to each other about that for hours and not get bored, talk about goals, and encourage eachother.  That, and then I’ve also noticed he definitely use body language as a way to “contact” versus I use words. This became sorta messy sorry. Hope it makes any sense"
2159,estp,"I get what you mean now. Sort of.
While it may be influenced by the mbti type; maybe it's your choice of words or maybe it's the culture in which you were all raised. 
For example if someone told me about their childhood memories then I would be like ""ok that's cool"", what am I supposed to say? I'd listen and if something similar happened to me then I'll add to it but usually I can't relate.
If it's something philosophical then I'm in. But wording is really important. Most of the time when people try to be philosophical it just comes out as /r/im14andthisisdeep. I'm guilty of this.
I suggest you try to have those kinds of conversations with people you already know they will engage. It's kind of disappointing but such is life.
ESTPs connect emotionally in a different way. Now that I think of it, I've never had like a really thought provoking conversation with any of my past girlfriends, sure some interesting and semi deep stuff but nothing THAT deep.
Maybe in top of us being that way; it has something to do with gender dynamics.
I don't know where I'm getting with this, I had to take a dump mid comment lol. Hope it helps at least a tiny bit"
2160,estp,"Infj married to an estp 🙋🏻‍♀️ESTPs are genuine and like to keep things lighthearted. They can definitely go very in depth but they need it to be natural to get into it and engage. If you make it a big deal that you wanna get deep and artificially try to get there, you won’t get to a deep level of intimacy, but you might run into some contempt from them.
Also something I do is I ask him what I want to tell him. So if I want to express a childhood memory, I’ll ask him what his first memory is or something before I express my own. Then it just naturally becomes a 2 way conversation."
2161,estp,"I guess I went through some personal crap and instead of getting shitfaced and partying like I usually do, I sat around and though about it. I still party a lot though lol. I just got better at being okay with being alone and going through my thoughts. 
I say INTJ because although I’m usually attracted to that personality type, I feel we ultimately run on different wavelengths. My INTJ ex from a few yrs ago that said I wasn’t really capable of a deep convo. But I have another INTJ friend rn that seems to like to confide in me. They’re more out there though than ENTPs imo."
2162,estp,"I feel ya, fuglebarn...  I also find myself filling that need by chatting with other people, but that entire situation concerns me.  I'm almost certain that a mental/emotional connection is my primary need, above fun and the rest.  So if I'm filling that need by having ""deep"" conversations with some other guy (since I only know one N-dom female), how long before I feel closer to someone who isn't my boyfriend?
Separating my physical and mental worlds like that, between two different people, feels icky to me."
2163,estp,"Lmao!  Are you an ESTP or an ENTP?  Cuz idk why, but every ESTP I run into ends up calling from the bathroom at some point or another.  Is this type or gender? 😂
It's not so much that I'm looking for some deep insight into my personal life or problems (which can sometimes even be annoying with Ni-doms), it's more that someone else listening, asking questions, and being genuinely interested in your answers feels really good.  Not only does it feel like you're truly being ""seen"" by the person, but it feels like who you are is important to them.
Anyone can know my biography or see my body, but only someone especially close to me can ""see"" me.
Lol, yes.  I've been on dates with INFPs where I wanted to bang my head against the bar until they stopped talking about Aristotle.  If I had to point to a reason for such extreme boredom, it would be complete lack of awareness of their audience.
I don't want that.  Exploring ideas, imo, is more about sharing a mental experience than regurgitating philosophy.  So, it's dynamic, something you do together.
What wording would make it more engaging?  If it's miscommunication that's encouraging, because a translation error seems more conquerable than a complete incompatibility.
How do ESTPs connect emotionally then?  Sexually/physically?
Is a relationship without ""deep stuff"" fulfilling for you?
I've been wondering this as well, since ESTP seem to be far more of the ""guys guy"" than the Intuitive guys I know.  However, I've been known to strike up deep conversations with a random strangers, including more conventionally ""masculine” guys like football players.  I find it hard to believe that every single one of them was Intuitive."
2164,estp,"I've definitely noticed how ESTPs seem to constantly distract themselves (usually with friends, parties and convos in every free moment).  Is this not an avoidant behavior/reaction to personal shit?  If I were to act that way, it'd be because I was trying to avoid confronting something.
I bet that's Fi at work.  ENFPs and INTJs do seem less conventional than ENTPs and INFJs."
2165,estp,"I understand that, i guess I’m “lucky” in the sense that just about all of my friends are n-types so I can “spread” it out across all of them if that even makes sense. 
I don’t think you can ever find a person where all you’re needs will be satisfied. I think society tends to put up this idea that the “one” should be able to satisfy all our social needs, but I’m not sure I agree with that.
I do understand your problem though since it’s something I have experienced myself too. I guess for some reason it doesn’t really bother me as much anymore since
1. I do once in while seem to get him a bit “out” there”. I told him before talking about stuff means more to me,and make me feel connected, so he makes an effort, and try to share personal things and feelings with me etc. You could try do the same
2. He fulfills me in a lot of other ways, so I tend to put my focus on that."
2166,estp,"Check my flair, baby 😎
That to me sounds like a compatibility problem with your bf in that regard. idk with siblings as I'm an only child.
Maybe a maturity problem as other people suggest. I've been often referred as a great listener.
So much can be communicated through a comment so I can't be of much help without reading you in person.
Exactly what I meant lmao
That sounds like fun. I really miss doing that with some of my friends. This was what I meant with the environment in which you were raised or the culture itself. 
What helps me create an engaging conversation with either introverts, reserved or just stuck up people is asking what they think. 
Ex: I bring up a non controversial topic but make just enough chatter so they don't disconnect and then ask them what do they think. If I feel like they don't want to chat then I try to bring an old topic that I know it worked for them.
Usually that's what works. Like a dog or a cat, some of them want to play right away, some of them will hiss/growl at you, others will only want to be petted.
Again, I'd have to listen to your conversation to figure out what could help.
I'd say physically from process of elimination, but I don't really know much about mbti 
Totally, I like having conversations with my girlfriends but nothing too deep as they usually tend to mix feelings with facts.
I talk with my male friends about that stuff. 
Some things you just can't try to discuss with your couple imo. 
We should chat sometime"
2167,estp,"Oh it’s definitely to avoid personal stuff. But I think eventually it all catches up to an ESTP and they come crashing down and disappear. Or at least that’s what happened to me. We’re thinkers so after all the partying, were left with our own thoughts at the end of the day. 
But to go back to your original question, you can’t really force someone to be deep. If it’s not there then it’s not there and you know you can’t really wait around for that. You know when it’s missing. Some people just lack depth and some people just haven’t gotten there yet. It would be a red flag to me if a guy couldn’t emotionally connect after a few months."
2168,estp,"I agree it doesn't make sense for one person to be your everything.  However, I think we can still find the closest fit for what aspects of a relationship are most important to us, and settle to varying degrees in the rest.  If my primary need is fulfilled, I think it's much easier to dismiss whatever else is missing because it's relatively inconsequential in comparison."
2169,estp,"I'm pretty adept at making friends. The problem is keeping them. I think people get the wrong impression off the bat. I'm enthused to have a new friend so we end up talking and texting and hanging out a decent amount. For like, a few days, or a week. And after that I'm just done. I want time alone. So the friend thinks I'm being shady and trying to ghost them and then that's the end of that friendship. Or things at least become real awkward and distant. The more the friend tries to get me to talk the more abrupt I am with them making things worse. I can't help it, I get pissed off when people don't respect my space.
I'm not an introvert, I've been typed by myself and others multiple times as ESTP. Function wise that is what I am. I just can become antisocial after being saturated with any given person."
2170,estp,"I don't have a whole lot to contribute here, other than to say I can fully identify with this. I really enjoy getting to know new people, but after awhile I need a break from them. I find that after I ""disappear"" for awhile, I'm much more personable towards a given friend again; and the more clingy someone is, the more I tend to stay away from them. Personally, I think it just boils down to the fact that I don't like depending on others and I don't like others depending on me. I also need newness and boldness of experience, which tends to come in diminishing return if I spend time with the same people over and over."
2171,estp,"Just talk to them when you want to! I’ve done this awesome thing where I’ve brought all my friends from different social circles together. Now they’re friends with each other, so I don’t have to talk to them as much, and they won’t bother me as much unless it’s to go out 😃"
2172,estp,"Absolutely. To me, it's almost as if a slow-growing friendship is more sustainable in a way? It's odd because of course, as enthusiastic people we're always excited to push the friendship forward, but some of my best friendships and relationships have grown from the other person controlling the pace and me just sticking it out."
2173,estp,"Because most people don't have any exciting or new and cool things going on they leave because well, we do. 
Unless they can afford to stay on your level of action they go. What else is there to talk about with people that pretty much have no life?"
2174,estp,"Yeah I honestly despise texting. I do it on occasion when something happens but people use it as a form of conversing, daily. I equate texting with a longer form of paging. I seem like an introvert because I really do not need more than once or twice a week contact with anyone."
2175,estp,"Cant tell if you're being sarcastic, but my whole life i felt I was so different than everyone. As a result, it actually does make me feel good when I find out some trait of mine isnt thaaaat uncommon."
2176,estp,"I am the type of person who typically hates anime, but with how many people had recommended Attack on Titan to me I had to at least watch a few episodes.  The main character is an ESTP like me.  He can be rash and foolhardy sometimes, but more importantly he is the most badass and awesome character on the show.  I wasn't sure at first if the character fit, but the more I watched, it was like watching myself.  By the end of the first season I was flabbergasted with how alike we are.  That's all."
2177,estp,"A lot of shounen main characters are ESTPs. Might want to look more into anime. Whatever you think 'anime' is, you are wrong. Even if you are an anime fan, you are still wrong :P. It's simply a medium. It's like saying ""I am the type of person who typically hates movies"". It's a broad statement that's probably not entirely true.
I'd also recommend Full Metal Alchemist. It's a gateway drug anime, and I think you ESTPs would like it."
2178,estp,"Forgive me, I have a high tendency to exaggerate.  It's not that I typically hate anime.  I have tried Full Metal Alchemist (both versions) and it just didn't do it for me.  I LOVED Death Note and am a huge fan of Attack on Titan.  I will always try a series before knocking it.  I meant no disrespect to the genre.  Still, I am not partial to the emoticons and some of the overdrama that accompanies even some of the best anime.  I realize that it is just a medium and entirely dependent on the writers/animators, but they do tend to try and fit a style.  "
2179,estp,"Alright :P. Just keep in mind that there are anime that are way different than a lot of the stuff you'll run across. Go check out Time of Eve if you haven't. It's pretty different and doesn't have a lot of things that are common in anime. Not sure if you'd like it (maybe), but I just wanted to show that not all anime are the over-the-top crazy/cartoon-styled shows."
2180,estp,"Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.

2181,estp,"INTPs are really self assured in my opinion and ready to learn. Which I totally respect. I think they're really intelligent in their own respect if they're passionate about something but they're not big on give or take, it's usually just take. Loveable assholes."
2182,estp,"an INTP to an ESTP is someone broken and that needs to be fixed, he's quite smart but impractical, either he thinks of irrelevant shit or he thinks of practical matters but never make them come true.
He's hard headed in a bad way, i.e he don't shape himself to fit reality.
I'm INTP with an ESTP friend"
2183,estp,"Maybe you do know intps . could be the social chameleon thing. Usually when I'm around estps ... Im quiet and I wait to go home.. Or arguing about some dumb joke (bantering really) ,but that's only if I stick around, .. Or if I'm in a good mood I'd be highly competitive "
2184,estp,"i don't know your type, but if you're ESTP then no, the inter-type relation between INTP (TiNE) and ESTP (SeTi) is asymmetrical.
reverse supervision would be the INTP's point of view"
2185,estp,"Sorta like ENTPs (introverted extroverts)
I tend to have a persona in real life that I show as quiet, chill, somewhat intellectual, and submissive. But if you knew me at home, I’m a fucking politically incorrect savage that likes going out and having fun.
I don’t show my real self unless I’m comfortable around the people I’m with, so I get mistyped a lot. 
Anyone relate to the persona thing?"
2186,estp,"I guess everybody has a face that they put on when different situations arise. 
Like if somebody was threatening you with a knife, would you start shivering/express your emotions or try to remain calm?
Putting on faces is a normal and logical thing to do... Maybe to an extent it can be bad though"
2187,estp,"I'm an ESTP like big time. For some reason my dumbass thought a long time ago that I should be a finance major because it would help me learn to be more frugal and less spontaneous. I'm a junior at this point and I just landed my first internship.
And it's fucking awful. These people sit in offices all day and do paperwork and small talk about the dumbest shit. The only person who looks like they're having fun is the branch manager because he gets to leave and go to meetings and stuff. I literally sit in a room from 9-5 copying and pasting stuff from databases and making copies all day. I'm about to fucking explode. 
Seeing as most business majors are pretty interchangeable (to an extent) and I'm pretty open to changing mine, what would you suggest? This finance stuff is soooooooo boring. 
Also, how do I survive the next 12 weeks lol"
2188,estp,"Why are you in finance?
If it's to make money - you won't make it as easily as you will here.
And if you're bored - don't let an internship in a rinky dink office determine your stance on the industry.
Lots of different types of jobs, lots of different types of finance companies, lots of different types of culture.
And you have so much free time during your industry, fill it up. Boredom is a state of mind that can be resolved by something as simple as contemplating what boredom is. Ideally you should spend it researching or studying for a license/certification you can use to stick out and help you land a job. 
Work smart not hard please"
2189,estp,"As a kid I just wanted to destroy.  I didn't want to hurt anybody, but I wanted to destroy for a good reason.  Like when you see a rule that is just absolutely nonsensical and restricting people, you want to light it on fire.  I had all this rage, but being put into a monotonous static institution of absorbing information, I couldn't do anything with it so I ended up being very destructive.  Just hurting people, being a bully.  I eventually repressed this, because I felt like a garbage human being, and I became very timid (although still very angry in random periods).  Now, I'm older, and its all coming back.  I shoved it under the carpet, but its not gone.  The other night I was blackout intoxicated on various substances, and absolutely went into an outburst, screaming and threatening my friend, and then I started crying.  It doesn't make me a bad person, it was just misdirected.  It has to be channelled into something helpful, something action oriented, and then it can become more beneficial.  I still don't know how to overcome the self hate that resulted from this misdirected rage though.
Has anybody else gone through this rage?  Whether you repressed it or not?  What helped you?"
2190,estp,"Ohhhhh, yeah. I deal with this big time. I was a goody two shoes kid so I never really learned that I could be loved even when I was a prick kid - and with the issues I had, I had a lot of anger that I never let out. Now it's resurfaced via all my sadness being replaced with anger. Instead of crying, I get so angry I shake and punch walls. I'd kill myself before I ever hurt someone else though. I'd feel horrible.
I can't give you any advice, but you're not alone in it man."
2191,estp,"Shit eh, I guess we'll figure it out eventually.  I'd hate to senselessly harm anybody now, yet that is essentially what I did as a kid.  Which is why I feel evil, and repressed essentially everything about myself.
If you dont mind me asking, what are you doing in life right now?"
2192,estp,"God I feel that man. Hit the nail on the head. I think the trick is just emboding the phrase 'fuck it'. unless you're harming other human beings, fuck it. Be loud, go out and have fun. Make friends and date around. Repressing stuff just makes it gurgle up inside of you and its not fun. Letting it out in any way is gonna help. Although I'd love to get to the point where I don't have to, punching pillows is better than punching other human beings you know?
Also, I'm in high school and studying automotive engineering so I can get into a good college. I'm also in a band on the side.
Just out of curiosity, why do you ask?"
2193,estp,"Yeah I'm starting to feel that ""fuck it"" attitude, as long as I don't cause senseless destruction.  Also I think I may take up some form of fighting to keep me busy, have an outlet for my energy, and have a good skill.
Idk, just wondered what kinda stuff other ESTP's do.  "
2194,estp,"I'm in University for psychology.  So I find psych very interesting, understanding the mind, how we can mould it and maximize its capacities, fix problems with it, and apply it to my life.  But I worry that I may get restless from a lack of action in it.  "
2195,estp,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
2196,estp,"One question was repeated.
And You should have more than 4 possible answers to your questions. 2/3 becomes very easy to pick. I read on reddit that 7 is the optimal number.  
I followed the curve, exept that the people of reddit is a unsosial bunch."
2197,estp,"I was partially basing it on a trick in some political surveys to have no middle option to force people to pick a side. Yeah sorry about the repeat question after about 10 questions, google forms gets weird glitchy and laggy."
2198,estp,"ISFP is the ""supervisor"" type of ESTP, while ESTP is the ""supervisee"" of ISFP. Supervisors will drain you out of energy, so they are best in small doses, couple hours of hanging out here and there 1-2 times a week. If you spend more than half a day with them they'll zap you out of energy and to recharge you'll have to distance from them. Nevertheless ESTPs keep chasing after ISFPs because supervisees are usually attracted to their supervisors and put them on a pedestal as a kind of superior person, for which reason many ESTP men end up dating and even marrying ISFP women. The way cognitive functions work between ISFPs and ESTPs, the ISFP cannot hear the arguments of ESTP so much of what ESTP says flies past them, while the ESTP hears and reacts to every little thing the ISFP says or does. Hence why these are called ""asymmetric"" relations - the ISFP has much stronger effect on ESTP while the ESTP is powerless before them.   
This is the entire description of supervision relations and relationship layout for ESTPs with other types.   
P.S. ISFPs have a completely different effect on ISTPs. ISTP supervisor type is the ENTP which is very different from ISFP. This is actually one way to check one's type: if ISFPs are truly one's supervisor type then that's evidence for being a bona fide ESTP, if not - then definitely some other type mistyping as ESTP. 
P. S. S. more about ESTP's Fi PoLR which is dominant function of ISFP added below"
2199,estp,"Think about your own Fi to maintain your boundaries.  Check this comment to see how Fi doms think, and apply it to yourself.
Study how TJs shut all that down instead of indulging in it.  Speak Te to sidestep or stonewall whatever they're pushing on you.  ie lawyer instead of logic.  You don't owe them anything you didn't formally agree to.
I can't really get more specific than that without knowing your situation."
2200,estp,"Use your Fe! Be patient and remember that whatever tone and vibe you give off, they will mirror it. 
Remind them that you are a different person, with different opinions. You respect theirs, so they should respect yours. You're also allowed to say things Like, ""I am feeling overwhelmed. I need time to think on my own"" ie a nice way to get out of a situation with them.
Sometimes I think an ISFP needs to feel butthurt so they are forced to think about and process the situation. It depends if you were actually right or not (and being right doesn't excuse arsehole behaviour btw)."
2201,estp,"Wait... I think I finally understand what your getting at. I'm going to describe a situation and you tell me if it sounds like what your trying to describe. So you and an ISFP are trying to walk to a new fishing spot. As you are walking down a dirt road you come across a fork in the road. To the left you see a nice sunny meadow. To the right the path goes through dark dense woods. You look at the map and see that the right path is quickest. You are about to head down it when you notice your companion is headed down the left path. You confront him about this. He says he has a bad feeling about the right path. This immediately seems stupid to you. You know the right path is quickest and you've been in the woods plenty of times and are unfazed by dark woodland. The other guy is unbudging though. So what do you Do? ......fuck him, just go down the right path. You will get there first, and catch more fish. When he sees your success, he'll question his own decision and change to fit your narrative. As logical thinkers, feelers are our play things. Learn to manipulate them. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink...but you can make him thirsty."
2202,estp,"Lol went into a depression when I was attacked with their Fi. Dint even know what it was then. 
Tried my best to develop Fi due to it and recovered from my depression but couldn't function fully untill I came out of it and integerate fi  fully to  become myself again . It's been a roller coaster ride . Same goes with being attacked by Ni / Ne from a intp and intj was left clueless trying to compete and imitate their intellect intutives ."
2203,estp,"I don't get it. Ok, let me rephrase that. I don't get how someone can spend the time to interpret something so off-base into it. Guess that's why I always get into fights with SFi folk."
2204,estp,"PoLR is an abbreviation for ""point of least resistance"". It's a socionics terms that refers to the function that is most vulnerable and sensitive for any given type. For ESTP's this function is Fi, which is the dominant function of ISFP and INFP and auxiliary for ESFP and ENFP, for which reason ESTP's relationships with these types tend to be complicated to say the least, and sometimes full of misunderstandings and hurts. In supervision relations, which ESTPs have with ISFPs, the supervisor has the dominant function that corresponds to this PoLR ""point of least resistance"" function of supervisee, which is how the supervisor is always in a dominant position in this relationship.    
ESTP Fi PolR & Fi PoLR - misunderstood"
2205,estp,"Fi is Feeling (introvert) as opposed to Te which is Thinking (extrovert).
No clue what PoLr means though. I would assume something along the lines of ""point of least resistancd,"" but I have no clue what that means and I didn't really get anything from a quick Google search."
2206,estp,"Hey, Batosai_, just a quick heads-up:
untill is actually spelled until. You can remember it by one l at the end.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
2207,estp,"Like... not porn. Real people. Wanting to look at other people and not wanting that to be limited or curbed at all... if it bothers the other person, shouldn't that be mitigated?
And if you KNEW they were having a hard time with it, would you go to lengths to hide it or download an app to make them more discretely accessible?
It seems counter intuitive. I don't get the logic.
I wouldn't consider myself insecure or jealous (INFP) but I'm starting g to wonder if I need to be more firm. Because it's escalating instead of getting better. "
2208,estp,"I'm trying to be open minded about it. I'm not trying to control him or tell him what to do. I just have a limit.
Sometimes it feels like he's doing things deliberately. It doesn't even make sense to get caught at this shit!
Aside from that, why would anyone even need to look at other people. I genuinely do not understand. "
2209,estp,"Ok, so as a person who used to do this here's my opinion.
It's natural, and I feel like you at least understand that. There's some understanding that it's ok to do on some level between the both of you.
That being said, it sounds like you're beyond the point of minor or subtle glances. If you've mentioned it to him, it's now moved into a little bit of douchey territory. I think being more vocal about it will help your cause. I know from experience that if no one says that something I'm doing is wrong (even if I know it's not right), I'll push my boundaries until someone says something. You need to do that.
A fair warning though - and this is again speaking from introspection. I used to (and sometimes till do) get upset and will push back on being called out on some behaviors (depending on how I'm doing mentally). If I'm in a healthy state I'll admit pretty quickly, that yeah, you're right; that was a little over the line. 
However, if I'm not in the best mental state I will act aggressively. I just want to set you up for the worst possible case scenario. It may get ugly, but nothing's worse than saying nothing and being a doormat. "
2210,estp,"Every time I've been mad enough to punish him, he's liked it.... but I'm an INFP. GENUINELY, I just want to know the truth and move forward. No matter what they is or what that means.
I'm tired. I don't know how much more I have to genuinely give. Which sucks. "
2211,estp,"I don't think they're trying to be mean, it just feels good in the moment.  I think it's hard to respect someone who completely forgets they're surrounded by humans and this isn't some kind of zoo, but hey."
2212,estp,"I'm an INTP. I have a friend who's textbook ESTP (tested and confirmed) who I've become quite close with recently. We get along great and she's an awesome friend with whom I have a lot of fun. That being said, she seems to want to hang out with me literally every day and it's way overbearing. Even if I had the time to hang with her daily, I don't think I'd want to. Being an introvert, I need my alone time and appreciate being able to relax and sort through the day's thoughts Ti-Si style. 
I don't want to make her think that I don't want to hang out with her or be around her. I don't think post-poning her requests would work, since she asks almost daily. How do I deal with this? What do   I say to let her know that I can't hang with her every single day, while still making it clear that I do what to be around her in a general sense? She doesn't really know MBTI well, so I'm hesitant to use the ""I'm an introvert and you're an extravert"" explanation, because I think it would be a waste of time that would be largely lost on her. She took the test at my request (suspected she was ESTP and wanted to be sure) and that was the extent of her exploration."
2213,estp,"tell her you need alone time to recharge and then plan a specific time to hang on a day like 3 days later. it tells her that you for sure wanna hang but you can't till a few days later. so you give a concrete date that hanging out will happen so it doesn't look like you are just brushing her off, but it also gives by default like 3 days where you probably wont wanna hang. And if she texts or calls on those days, you can say you can't but that you cant wait for sat. But if you do wanna hang, you can hang.
Its flexible while still establishing what you need and want. 
And you dont have to tell her all about personalities... just say ""ya know how you love to do shit and it energizes you?... well being alone to read and contemplate shit be a mad scientist by myself makes me happy and energized... but can we hang on tuesday, maybe go sky diving or drinking or something?""
Just say what you mean... no need to delve into the science unless we ask... just give us the facts/tools to do what is required. ""Naw man, i need sime alone time to chill. oh but hey you wanna go do x on yday? Cool, see ya then.""
Boom."
2214,estp,"Lmao, I was spending every day with my two new friends last year, one tells me, dude, we need like 1 day to be by ourselves. I was like oh, okay. I have no problem being with people all the time, I was a bit taken aback at first lol"
2215,estp,"My normal thoughts:
What am I doing right now?
When will I finish?
What should I do next?
How? Why? Is this important?
Do I even want to do this?
Example:
While watching a doc on primates;
Monkeys are cool maybe I should become a primatologist with my Gi Bill. Yeah gotta finish my military contract first. I really should clean my room, and pack my car. Should I go get food right now? It's 11pm, I could get food, pack my car, and go to sleep and hit the road in the morning. Or I could leave now and get food on the way. Do I really want to drive 14 hours RIGHT NOW? Well I probably won't sleep much anyway and the sooner I leave the sooner I get there. What the fuck am I doing? I'm just wasting time deciding what to do. I should check social media while I decide. R/airforce has no new posts since the last time I checked. R/MBTI nothing new either. Long shot but let's check r/estp. Oh look a new post. This could be interesting, starts typing this comment damn this just triggered me and reminded me I still haven't made a decision what to do. I'll probably hit send and then go pack my car and get food then decide if I want to drive or sleep first. "
2216,estp,"When I’m engaged in something or with someone, usually nothing much. But when I’m alone I find myself thinking back on past events, planning my schedules, thinking of solutions to problems I am facing and so on. I like to think I am living in my own bubble when I’m not around people. "
2217,estp,"Currently reading Ernest Hemingway quotes as he’s an ESTP. & I’m thinking about how true his quote is “When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.” When I’m speaking with someone they have my full attention & I notice when I speak to others and sometimes even when responding to that person they can get distracted at times. It’s so true & honestly quite unfortunate because people don’t know what they’re missing out on. People & stories can be so interesting & they miss out on me because once I notice they’re not paying attention they lose me as a conversational partner. "
2218,estp,"I can’t speak for other ESTPs. But I’m usually thinking of new ways to make more money and/or something fun to do in the present moment. 
I don’t think very far into the future and usually preoccupied with things that are going on here and now. "
2219,estp,"I'm always thinking on how I should be utilizing my time well and use my time to socialize with others, although I'm a lazy college student so I also enjoy sleeping and procrastinating and then thinking about how I wasted my time and how I could have been at the bar drinking with friends. Time is always on my mind."
2220,estp,"Bluntly speaking
My mind 24/7 is completely blank
No ""voices"", no ""inner thoughts""
I do what I do subconsciously
What happens right now, happens right now and I dont even think of it and i just do it
Ehhh.. Does that make sense?"
2221,estp,"I have a love-hate relationship with my Ni, it either gives me what I need or a shitty ass grip 😂
Se has its downsides too, sometimes I would like to actually stop and think rather than regret it afterwards.. Not that the regret stays for long tho, I forget about it afterwards but anyway the point it to other people those scenarios or incidents stick to their brains. Not really handy when it comes to maintaining a good reputation of being lowkey. Guess we'll always be known as hyperactive sons of a bitch haha"

Results Post Here

Hey there, ESTPs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if we can confirm any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs, INTJs, INTPs, and ENTPs, mostly. I've asked a few other types as well and now I'm coming to you :) I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate. Just state your type (it's ok if you're not an ESTP) and your % scores for each Big 5 category, and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share. Thanks in advance!

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
2223,estp,"they just so cool.they have the potential to be psychopaths,highest percentage in prisions,all kind of mean badasses.i know i know.estps arent ALL like that.but still they so cool.when they want something they go straight for it.fearless.they also charsmatic and master manipulators,having that ni fe in there...........so how do you guys do it?"
2224,estp,"We don’t really think about it, it just flows naturally!
Also, are you sure you aren’t making the ESTP personality type seem cooler than it actually is? 
I mean, we’re also all just normally functioning people in our daily lives :)."
2225,estp,"Personally when I'm at my best, I just don't think.. Everything flows and all information around me regarding the environment, situation, etc. is analyzed in a split second and usually the best action immediately follows. It's as if I read the ""vibe"" everything gives off on me and then logically figure out why I'm getting that vibe and then act in best accordance to it. I'm not sure if every ESTP feels or acts the same way, but my over-confident self thinks that I'm one of those rare G ass ESTPs with high enough IQ to let it all come together. I'm 20, can seemingly, consistently, make better decisions than both of my parents and siblings and of them and others I know relatively well, can read off what they're thinking before they speak"
2226,estp,"Man i m studying machine learning and thinking to build a career in it and have a computer degree. As an ESTP, i im into mid life crisis and finding it very difficult to choose a forward career path. And even in my head pops some noise as ""something leadership"" always from time to time. ESTP has pursuasion word written all over it and even my dad is sales manager. It also embaffeles me to huge extent that although i watched many netflix shows like GOT, Fargo etc but why do i from time to time just watch sherlock again and again and again and even never get bored. Even
I just want some advice from other fellow ESTP's man how they are approaching life paths and keeping options open.
I just dont know what to do!( and it really goes into my veins and head these thoughts of wasting time)
Also how is maths for ESTP, i mean deep maths because ML and AI is all maths and how we are into field of research.
I also find studying about entrepreneurship fascinating but if at time we dont have ideas popping how to be one.
I also think ESTP are psychopaths or sociopaths.
Grateful for any tips about choosing careers!"
2227,estp,Are you able to focus enough on research and deep learning/math to enjoy that career? The most important thing you can do is just choose something. Don’t get stuck analyzing all your options. Choose something. Change if you need to. Leadership will come naturally in any role. 
2228,estp,"I went to uni to become a teacher, did not pay attention, failed a class. Said fuck it apprentiship here I Come. 
Got a Job shift maneger Job after apprentiship, 60 people daytime 30 people evening at the sausage factory, Loved it big Numbers and pressure.
Got tired of it after a few years changed to departement manager at a chicken factory. Loved it! For 1 Year, then I had to mive my line to the other side of the country.
Said fuck it, am now studying to become a high school teacher at restaurant and foodmanufactoring (Norwegian system), and got a Job at my local high school. After I finish I guess I will do it for a few years, maybe take some math to be able to do more later.
I have a 5 Year plan, goals that can be messured ""start an education"" ""care for my marriage"" and a few projects. And points on how to do it ""I would like to study, teaching or economics/leadership""... It can be broken, but it gives me a focus without beeing locked down.
Everytime I start something I have a frame for how long the minimum time I have invested in it. New Job, I finish school in 2 years, then I can quit if I want to, or stay. But I know everything but my wife and children have a date I can say ""FUCK IT, IM OUT"" and start Looking around.
The beauty of this is that I always have my feelers out for something better/cooler and still not Looking like a quiter at my CV. So put on your big boy pants, stop whining and aim for all grades to be A. Become better push yourself, compete against the best you! That is how you stay focused, that is how you win in your own game. Become better, life is a game to crush! "
2229,estp,Yes I am able to focus and understand concepts in a go but the major problem and root cause is if you can't breathe and think about it every second. and things you are interested in should naturally come into your head. when i stop studying those concepts i learned tend to dont come naturally to my mind and i have to intentionally and forcefully remember them which feels like something is not right. True passion is you are thinking about what you are learning 24/7 and you have the ability to do it for 2 days straight without sleep or even more. This happened to me when i was hardcore warcraft(dota 2 gamer) and i was breathing every second of it in those days and it was my true passion. Putting almost 3500 hours in it i was sure this is my career. But then losing competetions I quit and realized it needed more practice for atleast 3+ years for pro level play. Although good at academics till high school looking for a career path. I live by principles of Elon Musk atleast 90 hr work week but i am at moment 65 hrs. Now primary focus is reclaim in any way those 3500 hours with beast mode self improvement.
2230,estp,"Good for you man you finded something you love. And all the best with yoir career. Even i think i just stop this machine learning thing and go forcrossroads between leadership, detective or sales. And some times go for dj although never tried music. Life is very hard for ESTP to make decisions."
2231,estp,"Almost No one finds true passion. 
90hr work week is something you do when you get something you love. Not to find love for the work.
Computer games at a high, but not pro level is easy work so it is nothing you can compare that with. But as a gamer you know how to grind, school is grinding, work is grinding, relationships are grinding, life is grinding. Not for fun, for the grind! Then you have to find shit to keep you from sinking during the grind, that is where you find love for anything.
So stop Looking for passion and start doing the borring stuff, when school is done you can do something else."
2232,estp,"Yes. There is 2 Main ways, from the year you turn 16. 

Vocational subjects. 1 Year is general, 2 Year is more specialised. (electricians/autimation (fuck I just woke up and cant spell for shit, and on phone) have 3 years). You can do anything from mecanical, building, restaurant and food manufaction, health and carring. 

At my school they have 3 days in the kitchen every week 1 long day of Norwegian. Math, gym, english, sience and 1 short day with teory about hygiene, nutrition and everything elce you need to know. 

Preparing for studies. 3 years more and more Teoretical. There is a Main Way where you can spescialise in what you like (sience, language or political ). Or you can do it with an intrest (it have to be a line for it) you have, sports, art and decoration or media and communication (there is more, but I dont remember).

There is a total of 17 choices for for the first year.
Edit. From the line I teach you can do 12 apprentiships, second Year in school have 2 grups 
restaurant: restaurant chef, instetution chef, waiter
Food production: butcher, Meat cutter, sausagemaker, Meat deli, fish production, fish deli, baker, pastry chef and industrial food production (where I Come from)
And sorry about english, the phone does not help me! "
2233,estp,"That's so much different from the US. We don't really have any formal vocational paths until university. Even in university you don't have to choose a vocation. A lot of people get degrees that are broad subjects like communication, economics, business, etc. 
​
It's a lot more independent here. For example, you would have to know what classes are required to be admitted into a university program that you need for a vocation that you want to pursue. To be an engineer, you need to do an undergraduate degree in engineering. To be admitted to an undergraduate engineering school you need to do a lot of intense math and physics in high school. Most public schools in the US won't really tell you that. Students just need to know or actively seek career counseling. Which can be very difficult in rural places.
​
It's probably worth noting that in the US you arguably don't even need to finish high school to go into some fields. Using restaurant work as an example, you would probably be best served by dropping out of high school and getting a high school diploma equivalence while working in a restaurant, and then going to a culinary school once you finish the diploma. Most people wouldn't do this though, because high school is a very social time in the US, so it is a lot easier to say dropping out to focus on your career is a good idea than it is to actually drop out. 
​
There are many other vocational paths that open up after different levels of education. If you want to be a dentist then you have to complete an undergraduate degree and pass a standard test for dental students. After that you can apply for graduate dental schools, which then take 8 years.
​
So, the point is it's very complicated to become something in the US. I'm jealous of your education system."
2234,estp,"That sound bad for vocational subjects. Having a purly academic system pushes people away from good jobs, short education and fair pay.
I think your system reduses the value of trades. More dropouts that ""have"" to start doing the jobs, and you get unmotivated people."
2235,estp,"ENTJs also have tertiary Se, and some theories (socionics particularly) promote the idea that the tertiary function drives each type’s “hidden agenda”. In the ENTJ their HA is “to be wealthy”, and they utilize Se to manipulate social and professional situations to their advantage.
ESxPs do this naturally and with no ulterior motive, except to entertain others. If one wants to learn how to win over the majority (and ENTJs often do have that desire) then he should emulate ESTPs. Which ENTJs often do. Look at Joe Rogan and Dwayne Johnson."
2236,estp,"Hi,
I have a friend who I can't type properly, he's either ESTP or ENTJ. Both types often correlate with 8 so they sometimes lookalike to me. My friend is an 8 so he has a fiery temperament but it's just hard to tell which type he could be. Can you tell me how I can make the difference between you and ENTJs?"
2237,estp,"I'm an ESTP and my sister is an ENTJ. Let's take playing a sport for example: 
If the two of us were playing volleyball, my sister's focus would be to win the game, no matter what. She doesn't care as much if she has fun doing it, she just plays for the outcome, for the victory, if you will. I play because it's fun. I enjoy spiking the ball and getting a service ace. I would prefer to win, but that isn't my overall goal. ESTPs like to show off, and ENTJs want to conquer. "
2238,estp,"Whenever I took an online mbti test, I'd always get either INFJ or INFP. And during these times, I was going through a lot of hard times, depression, feeling lost, you name it. I read somewhere online that ESTPs can become unhealthy INFJs or revert to their shadow functions as an unhealthy version of an INFJ? Has anyone else had similar experience? And what were some ways you got out of that shadow function?"
2239,estp,"I was an estp my entire life untill I got into my early 20s which is when I met an intp who I considered as my mentor and my intj bestfriend along with my isfp gf meeting these introverted people tempted me to develop my introverted  side since it was so bad compared to theirs,  also during this period I was under extreme stress due to my parents marriage breaking off and getting seperated and at the same time I  also got into the habit of smoking weed everyday  whish isolated me further from the external world and my friends . The stress in my life that I was trying to avoid along with the habit of smoking weed led to me snapping my mind on one fine day where my inferior Ni got the best of me and I was taken over by it fully. For us estps the inferior Ni presents itself in the form our subconscious INFJ personality and the subconscious mind is not something we have conscious control over so it was by default negatively wired and was extremely dark to navigate this inner landscape(Ni) for me and it led to full blown depression where the Ni had complete control over me and every action and thought which  also led to anxiety , psychosis and paranoia that was totally not experienced by me earlier in my life due to our SE  taking the bull by its horn always  . It was completely crippling to an extent where I started believing that I am an INFJ and my life is going to  horrible always , but I had the fighting spirit  to fight irrespective of how bad my situation was or how deep I was in the Ni rabbit hole . I finally had to develop my Ni and Fe to come out of  the rabbit hole along with other fucntions like fi and ne , it was extremely painful but coming out of it seems it  was  totally worth it and I  seem like a totally different person now compared to who I was when I went it. It also helped me to understand introverts instead of finding them weird but I still think they are a pain in the ass sometimes with their subjective world and close mindedness especially (IXXJs)  One thing that I learnt from this is the fighting spirit we estps have and the ability to kick and fight our way out of any horrible situation we are put in ."
2240,estp,"Ah i see, that’s similar to me as well.
I know I’m an ESTP because I process the world directly first through my Se. When I look back on my life, it’s the primary way I made most of my decisions. And after reading into the descriptions on function stacks, I relate more the ESTP function stack. I don’t go by the general mbti type descriptions because those can be a little too general and misleading."
2241,estp,"Hey, Batosai_, just a quick heads-up:
concious is actually spelled conscious. You can remember it by -sc- in the middle.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
2242,estp,"MBTI has too much intuitive bias. INFJ groups are full of types like ESFP, ESFJ, ISTJ, ISFP who believe themselves to be Ni doms. If introverted intuition wasn't advertised as such a magical function they'd at least give other types a look."
2243,estp,"Haha hey you’re really observant. My friend suggested I retake the test again when I asked him how he picked his career, and I got ENTP. I learned to take MBTI tests with a grain of salt though as it is similar to astrology in the psych world and the concept of self fulfilling prophecy where you become what you believe and picture yourself to be. I have tested honestly from INFP to ESTP to INTP to ENTP 🙃 and each time my life circumstances and priorities were a little bit different. I like to think of personality as a scale and depending on the time of day or what is happening, I might be more introverted or extroverted, more observant or intuitive, etc. 
For my current job since it is therapy with autistic kids, sometimes I have to pretend to be more talkative than how I normally am or pretend that I am confident and comfortable with being assertive to show kids how they should be. But in reality what I noticed is I prefer to be more quiet, away from people, and left alone with my hobbies hahah and I used to be quite passive aggressive too but it is something I am working on. 
So yeah that could be part of why I fluctuate since what I get paid to do is different than how I prefer to be normally. It is kind like how society conditions us to think a certain way to fit in but how we are internally may be different. "
2244,estp,"According to some sketchy sources it can help with with social anxiety (long term) and maybe even autism. I don't think my social issues would be enough to qualify as autism or come from the same place as autism, but certainly MDMA as a therapy treatment would be something I would support being researched and have recommended to lots of friends. For me though, I think my social anxiety made me recluse myself, and being an extrovert this lead to depression. So MDMA helped me get out of that hell. On the upside, having experienced that stuff I now know a lot more about how to help people suffering than I would have had I always been healthy."
2245,estp,Yes but in my case  I was in a full blown depression due to my inferior Ni taking over me fully due to stress and not devloping and taking care of Ni and ignoring it too much. It was almost like you can't go further untill you organise the massive amount of information se had gathered all your  life. Now that I've arranged it and even though it was boring and very painful it feels good to be back. 
2246,estp,"Yoooo I totally get it. I had the same experience where I had social anxiety, mainly from unfortunate factors from my upbringing. And that led to me thinking I was an introvert, but in reality I was just an extremely depressed ESTP haha. And it didn’t also help that people assumed I was shy and quiet because of my anti-social demeanor. But now that I’m healthy, I’m back to my outgoing and boisterous self lol
And yeah, I’m glad too that I went through that so I can help other extroverts who think they’re introverts too.
Concerning the MDMA, I wouldn’t say for myself that it helped me get out of social anxiety. I think it made me more aware that I do have social anxiety. Cuz while I was on it, I became hyper sensitive to everything and got really intense anxiety and paranoia. It basically heightened everything I was currently dealing with as a person if that makes sense. But overall, after the come down I realized I needed to start being more self-reflective and take better care of myself and use healthier ways to put myself out there."
2247,estp,"Hey, Batosai_, just a quick heads-up:
untill is actually spelled until. You can remember it by one l at the end.
Have a nice day!

2248,estp,"Fellow ESTPs - thought I'd share my own experiences with other types after having lived with, worked with, and dated lots of different types and see how your own experiences are alike/different from mine. Standard MBTI PSA: I really do believe (almost) any type is compatible from a relationship standpoint depending on emotional maturity, shared interests, and most importantly – understanding of your own shortcomings and needs of your partner, etc. Serious tl;dr warning as well. 
Anddd we're off like a prom dress! 
ESTJ - Brother, current and past roommates, a couple coworkers


Pros: Fun dudes. Always enjoy activities with them and joking around about a bunch of shit. Find myself agreeing with them on a lot of stuff.  Great sense of humor.  Little brother is my best friend.  Work with them is fine and fun when they aren’t taking things too seriously, even if they tend to obsess over random processes that don’t add value for anyone outside of their adrenaline rush for needlessly organizing stuff in Excel (really goes for anything they do in life I’ve found). 


Cons: Every ESTJ I've met NEEDS to be in control of every situation they're in, overly-OCD about dumb stuff, e.g., borrowing something from them is the most formal process ever - if it isn't returned in pristine condition, they get irrationally angry. You haven’t cleaned the dishes on your “turn?” Oof –not good, and better not do it again or they’ll be problems, generally not open to debate about anything, repress feelings and will unleash on you.  Never, ever, do anything to hurt their pride, unless they bring it up themselves first.

Relationship potential: Literally last I would date. 

ISTJ - Dad, current boss, coworkers, girlfriend’s mom


Pros: Really love their quiet sense of duty, dependability, and will cover for shortcomings of others generally without feeling the need to express it. Often overly organized like ESTJs, but in more of a “this is my stuff, don’t mess with it and all will be well.” Most times I find myself appreciating their recall of…everything they’ve experienced in their lives.  Makes for some good stories, conversations.  Enjoy their sarcasm most of the time.  Great bosses, as long as you don’t mind to be held to the same expectations they hold of themselves and don’t care about work-life balance.


Cons: ISTJs love the past – in fact, once they experience something even once, that becomes the most important data point to them. Most of their responses in casual conversation is “I remember…” and they really pride themselves on their ability to remember useless shit.  In my dad’s case, I pointed this out to the rest of my family, and we often laugh when his contributions to the conversation have included stuff like: how he lost his 5th grade regional spelling bee championship (his mom pronounced the world swaddle as “swattle,” which clearly through him off), exact dates for stuff like when the AC went out in 1987, etc.  However, find myself clashing with them on certain topics, but in the end not really a huge deal. 

Relationship potential: Probably not, but not completely out of the question

ESFJ – Sister, lots of girls I know


Pros: Genuinely are interested in the well-being of everyone they love.  In fact, in my sister’s case, hurts them if someone is struggling and will do what they can to check-up on you and try to make you feel good.  Easy to talk to them about anything, and from my personal experience it seems like they really appreciate Ti – something I’d say us ESTPs value quite a bit.  Their sense of duty to their family’s happiness is unparalleled.  


Cons: Even though I enjoy random gossip, they take it to a new level I find kind of pointless (did you see x cousin is moving in with her boyfriend?). Seems like they’re always trying to “prove themselves” to everyone, ESTPs in particular.  Don’t find them bringing too many different viewpoints to the table during conversation, and will incessantly defend others if only to “keep the peace” at the expense of what is really true. VERY materialistic and status focused, always pretend to listen to what you’re saying with interest, but don’t seem to really care.


Relationship potential: Was seeing an ESFJ girl for a few months. Not serious at all, but found myself bored very quickly.


ENFJ – A couple girls I know


Pros: Fun people. Seem to really care about your well-being, and often confident in their own unique way.  Great conversation, strong morals, could talk to them about pretty much anything.  They don’t necessarily bring many thought-provoking views to the conversation, but will definitely add-on to whatever is being talked about.   When alcohol is involved, there won’t be a second of silence. 


Cons: Also materialistic and status focused. Can be way too chatty and gossipy. Seem like a little bit of control freaks.


Relationship potential: Had a spring break fling with a good friend back in college and was a ton of fun. While I've found ENFJs and I always enjoy each other’s presence and doing fun stuff together, not sure it’d go beyond that.


ESTP – Me, 2 best guy friends from middle school, female cousin


Pros: We are actually the most fun people.  We will talk to you about anything, USUALLY not take things too seriously, and add a spark to whatever is currently happening.  The first person you will text – or more likely receive a text from – saying “let’s go do x” and if it sounds fun, the ESTP will always do it.  Witty, confident, and surprisingly loyal to those they care for. Lax about a lot of stuff, will often lend a hand and do appreciate helping people out. Actually wants others to feel good much of the time.  


Cons: Often immature when it comes to relationships, work, and other important things in life and instead focus on short-term instant gratification.  Many ESTPs appear outwardly confident, but inside are self-conscious, which often manifests itself in the worst way particularly in relationships.  Cocky, and critical of…everything.  Knows how to piss you off, and will.  Their cunningness is a gift to them and often a curse to anyone else.  Will get out of most sticky situations due to a great combination of quickly assessing surroundings, and thinking how to logically manipulate others to believe what they are saying.  Overly hedonistic.


Relationship potential: Ha. Would be fun for a lot of it, but good luck establishing even a semblance of day to day organization and predictability. 


ESFP: Mom, dated one briefly couple years ago girlfriend’s dad, old-coworker/friend and a few others


Pros: Are also fun people.  Always see my mom giving the most genuine grin ever during simple things like playing board games with the family.  Refreshingly positive most of the time.  Want things to be fun for everyone and will try to bring out the best in people in the moment.  Casual conversations are extremely enjoyable.   


Cons: So here’s what I find annoying with immature ESFPs (my mom, in some aspects):  Their “wanting everyone to be happy” mantra sometimes can be deceiving because it’s often used to…make themselves feel good about themselves for being such “caring people.”  Not to say they aren’t, but they will be the most empathetic and supporting people, until they they’re triggered by something you said and all of a sudden that caringness is completely gone until you apologize or they realize they were being overly sensitive (former far more likely). I think many types do this, but their swings are the worst of any of them.  We joke that my mom often tries to engage us in “Forced Family Fun,” because there’s no reason we shouldn’t be having fun at ALL times, right? 


Relationship potential: Long term? No chance. Short term? Yes, and stock up on plenty of booze and condoms before the first date 


ISFP: Adult female I’ve had many serious conversations with, male cousin, uncle 


Pros: Moralistic, caring, aversion to mundane matters – seem to share the disdain for unneeded organization like ESTPs.  Great listeners, emotionally mature, appreciate many of the simple things in life. Can be surprisingly logical for a feeler some of the time.


Cons: Suffers a bit from the “care and support you until I don’t” syndrome like ESFPs. Very sensitive people. From my standpoint, can be a bit…boring, notwithstanding the shared extraverted sensing stuff we can talk about.


Relationship potential: I really can’t see this one working – maybe the lowest chance of any feeler.


ISTP: The only ISTP I have even somewhat of a relationship with is my uncle and ex-girlfriend’s dad. I do watch interviews for a bunch of athletes who clearly are ISTPs.


Pros: Carefree, the “I don’t give a shit” attitude is refreshing, and something they have above all types – something all types could learn from when faced with stressors that really don’t matter.  Don’t feel the need to people please, and seem to be good at being themselves in all situations.  Confident in a way us ESTPs aren’t.


Cons: Overly apathetic. Seem to be critical and selfish, and maybe the least likely type to attend to their partner’s needs 


Relationship potential: Female celebrity ISTPs are hot as hell (looking at you Anna Kendrick). Still, can’t see this one working beyond a short-term fling.


ENTJ: Really close friend, girl I had a 2 week fling with


Pros: My favorite thinking type. They seem to offer an interesting perspective on stuff and are always open for debate, enjoy being challenged, seem to rarely get defensive – instead opting to explain why you’re wrong. For the first time in my life, saw it was like to be with a female much more confident than me and didn’t put up with any BS – was actually a great learning experience form me. Also enjoy fun activities, loyal, have your back.  Makes me laugh when my ENTJ calls people out, even if it’s me.


Cons: Tendency to completely disregard emotions when in debates or discussions – and this is coming from someone who often values logic above most everything else.  Often critical to a fault.
Relationship potential: Would be interesting, but leaning towards know.  Think it’d take a mature and emotionally confident & mature ESTP to make this one work, as well as an understanding ENTJ.


Relationship potential: Much like in the case of ESTP-ESFJ relationships, I think ESTPs would be trying to ""prove themselves"" too much to ENTJs, while the ENTJ would get bored pretty quickly.


ISFJ: 6 year on/off relationship with one, another very close friend, brother’s girlfriend, couple female friends


Pros: Warm, loving people.  Appreciate the little things in life.  Really loved how much my ex-cared about her family despite them being fairly dysfunctional and not giving anything back in return.  My close guy friend has my back no matter what and often gives way more than he should.  Great listeners and will help you out any way they can. Amazing memory, and, unlike ISTJs, often focused on nostalgic, happy times. Very forgiving people if you are genuinely sorry about something.


Cons: I feel that they are perpetually stressed individuals, even healthy ones.  They can be stubborn, moody, and hold grudges if you don’t directly address them and apologize if necessary. Can be boring.


Relationship potential: Yes, think it’s a good pairing.
INTJ: Senior coworker, close friend


Pros: Interesting people.  Logical, dependable, self-sufficient.  Their dry sense of humor and hilarious metaphors always make me laugh.  Offer an interesting perspective on some things. Dependable, and I’d imagine even more so in a relationship. 


Cons: Hold themselves to a higher standard than perhaps any type.  Doesn’t seem to take constructive criticism well. Oftentimes find some of their views and passions in life “cute and funny” rather than interesting and thought-provoking.  


Relationship potential: Maybe. I think the ESTP could get bored, and the INTJ would feel fairly marginalized. 
ENTP: old co-worker, current pseudo-supervisor, girl I went on a few dates with etc. etc.  This will be an interesting one, as I’ve sat, literally, over 5,000 hours next to an ENTP over my last 2 jobs.


Pros: Funny, shrewd, extremely skilled in finding possibilities in everything – especially useful in business.  Good conversationalists and offer interesting insight.


Cons: Suffer from the same “outwardly confident, inwardly subconscious” problem facing ESTPs.  Talk…a lot – often about some stuff you really don’t care about that they find super interesting.  Contradict themselves every other sentence. Talk around stuff instead of addressing it.  Can be extremely sleazy, emotionally immature, and in my opinion the least trustworthy of all types.  Talks a lot of shit and plays devil’s advocate for literally no other reason because it’s stimulating to them, notwithstanding the fact they know they're completely wrong.  Had a fun time with the girl though.


Relationship potential: This would be disastrous.
INTP: Brother in law, cousin, lots of people I’ve come across on the internet.


Pros: Insightful, head always full of ideas, courteous.  Like ESTPs, love using that Ti for talking about theories at a high level without needing to discuss the exact details.  Unlike many other types, they don’t feel the need to be needed.  Open to challenge and exploring the meaning behind something. Really enjoy talking with INTPs and always find my relationship with them satisfying.


Cons: Scatterbrained, disorganized, gets obsessed with a random idea, only to find the amount of attention to detail is a bit more than they expected.  Probably does not give nearly as much in relationships as their significant other.


Relationship potential: Why not?
INFP: A friend and a few others I’ve come across over the years


Pros: Warm, caring people. Love how tune they are with their emotions inwardly, yet appreciate purely logical discussions.


Cons: Idealistic to a fault. Can become cold and defensive when challenged.  Need to be appreciated. Really can’t find anything else bad to say about them.


Relationship potential: Good match IMO – have found that each type really appreciates and truly understands the other. Would be interested in meeting some more INFPs


INFJ: Ex-girlfriend (only ~6 month relationship), female cousin


Pros: There’s just something about INFJs.  I’m not sure exactly what it is, but you all know exactly what I’m talking about. I dated the INFJ girl during a tough part in my life, and she had the tendency to see exactly what I needed before I could figure it out myself.  Super caring, creative beyond belief, a sweet, innocent soul.  Found the type is surprisingly intellectual for an NF who allegedly sits at home reading books about unicorns all day. Almost everything about INFJs make me smile.


Cons: Also idealistic to a fault.  Stuck in their own head, bottles up feelings before unleashing them upon you 10x worse than you’d imagine. Very, very, stubborn with certain views – especially ones about themselves.  The INFJ door slam is real and non-negotiable.  Except when they turn to their shadow functions and drunk text you, but I digress.


Relationship potential: I really like the ESTP-INFJ dynamic – the ESTP helps get the INFJ out of their head and back into the real world, while the INFJ can help an ESTP grow emotionally.


ENFP: Current girlfriend, good guy friend, girl I had a short fling with I kept in contact with for awhile:


Pros: I find ENFPs fascinating. On one hand, you see a gregarious, larger than life person cracking jokes and bringing everyone out of their shells, and on the other side – pure mystery (best I could do, INFJ readers).  The more you get to know them, the more you discover not only the lust for life & sense of adventure but this sort of warmth that, unlike with other types, isn’t communicated verbally and does not need to be.  The way they speak to you, look at you, and physically show their love makes you feel like the most loved person in the world. Biased because I’m dating an ENFP? Nahhh


Cons: They constantly need to be brought down to Earth, as the might actually be living in the future. Half joking, but their focus on the future makes them miss actually what’s happening right now. Can be bitter towards people -
especially if someone is wronging either them or someone else they care about.  Tendency to get offended easily, also knows how to hit you where it hurts. Can be a little bit shady to do everything in their power to not be “judged” by some action they do, which can affect trust in relationships. Can be immature on a lot of things.


Relationship potential: Would love to say “hell yeah!” but I can absolutely acknowledge many of the potential communication barriers with the ESTP-ENFP pairing - many which I've experienced.

"
2249,estp,"Istp here. Just stopping by to read the good things about me and jerk one off real quick. Ahh that was nice. Ok thanks bye. 
Also the length and depth of these impressions make me highly doubt you are estp."
2250,estp,"What's up my man? Glad you enjoyed it, and celebrated appropriately.  I'd like to say I'm not ""typical for my type,"" but everyone says that and it's usually bullshit. That said, I'm definitely an ESTP and not typical for my type."
2251,estp,"""All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.""
It's a T.E Lawrence quote but I heard it in Uncharted. "
2252,estp,"Unless I’m tired, I can not think without pacing around and walking everywhere. When I sit still and try to think of a solution to a problem, it feels like the mental version of having cataracts and I need to walk, dance, twitch my legs, etc. every few minutes to get it cleared up. I get some comments that I pace too much or that I look nervous when I’m standing still. It takes so damn long to write Reddit posts that are this long since I can’t exactly walk around and type too efficiently (I’m twitching my legs just to keep typing). Is that just an ESTP thing or is that a me thing?"
2253,estp,"I cannot confirm that what you're describing is a trait of ESTP, but I can say for a fact that I HAVE to be moving to have my best thoughts, or even a solid conversation on the phone.
Even if it's driving around instead of walking, I still need changing scenery to be at my best mentally."
2254,estp,"I can identify with this sentiment.  
My wife is an INFJ and last week our cat's health took a sudden decline. Random onset blindness that afternoon, seizures about 5 hours later then she stopped breathing that night.  
I bring that up because I was the one who had to find a vet, take her there, set up an appointment for the following day and then find an overnight vet to take her to so we could try and stop the seizures.  
My wife was incredibly emotional about it throughout the entire time, whereas in spite of the fact that she was MY cat, (as in, we were super bonded and she was just affectionate to my wife,) I was super calm and collected in dealing with it, asking the hard questions about best and worst case scenarios and what to do in the meantime.  
Mind you, this was VERY hard to deal with, but the fact that it was a crisis situation allowed me to be level headed while my wife was (understandably) incredibly emotional about it and therefore unable to come up with a plan.  
Once everything was over, I was a total wreck and my wife was able to be very comforting to me, but in retrospect, I believe that my ESTP personality type equipped me to deal with the issue at hand and then her INFJ personality helped me deal with it afterwards."
2255,estp,"Totally relate to this , also the part where becoming a wreck after everything is over. Unfortunately I don't have a Infj in my life so left with using my own Fe and Ni to deal with it even if I suck at it. "
2256,estp,"About a year ago, I had a relationship with an ESTP in one of my classes, and it went great, for me at least. He broke up with me after two months because he had too much going on in his life, and I made my peace with that fairly quickly (though I'll admit at the time I thought he had just gotten tired of me). Recently he and I have reconnected, and I don't understand him as well as I used to. I think he likes me, but I'm not sure. I was the one that reached out to him originally through text, but he was the one who continued to make effort to start conversations after that. Even though he starts the conversations, though, he doesn't really contribute much to them after the initial ""Hey"". I usually have to be the one to keep them moving, otherwise there are lulls. That happened a little bit when we were dating, but for the most part we used to be able to talk for hours, contributing equally to the conversation. Now, I feel like I have to make more effort just to keep it from fizzling out. So, what are the signs when an ESTP DOESN'T like someone, or isn't interested in them? What could be going through his mind? I admire him a lot for a variety of reasons, and I'd like to be able to find a way to talk to him without feeling strained. I'd appreciate it if you guys could help me gain some insight into what he's thinking. Thanks!"
2257,estp,"Hmmm. There's not so much information here. Is the ESTP still very busy? Was that a good reason before and now the chemistry isn't kicking up the way you'd like?
When you said reconnected does that mean just talking? Try being very straightforward! Perhaps tease the guy - we like to chase things if we think we can't have them.
Sry that the advice is vague."
2258,estp,"I'm fond of you, guys. You look dangerous from far away, hardly approachable, but I was always curious about you. Being in your circle of friends, gives a sense of security. 
Love you being ""down to earth"", honest, straightforward, playful and living in the moment. But the most, that you are risk takers.
What do you think about INFPs?"
2259,estp,"IDK if it's just me, but do you guys relate? 
It seems like I'm on the edge whether I want to make more friends or not. At some point, I would love to have more friends because I enjoy having more company and knowing more people. But at the same time, I don't want to have more friends because I'd have too much attachments to keep track of.
Like I get a bunch of messages from friends I have sometimes, but I can't type / message back all the time and I don't want to appear rude that I don't want to talk to them and stuff. I don't know, I mean I know I can just leave them and say I'm busy but to me that just feels cold, even colder if I just leave them in the dust, so I feel obligated to message them back and the cycle continues you know. Sometimes I just appear friendly to people that they naturally just want to talk to me and be friends/hang out but sometimes I just want to be alone. IDK
​
Do you guys relate and how do you figure it out? Thanks guys
​
​"
2260,estp,"I can completely relate. There’s a certain charm to meeting someone, talk for a long time and after that no more obligations. I want to make lots of friends but it’s hard to... stay in touch.
My tip is to not be the initiator in “Want my cell?” Or anything. Just enjoy yourself. And when they do basically say: “I’m not much of a texter” or something. Lay the groundrules for new friends, you know. “Coffee/drink, I am yours... but I know I am no star in texting”"
2261,estp,"i can somewhat relate. i can appear friendly, i can also just put on my resting bitch face (& it’ll be easier). but i don’t feel socially accepted when i put on my RBF :/ & i keep wanting to get more friends. when i get more friends, i have fun in the beginning but i get sick of them soon after & reply only after 4-5 days. kind of ruined my rep.
i suggest telling them directly that u have that habit of not wanting to text back all the time or sometimes want to be alone. that should fix the problem. communication is key. set things right at the start so that there won’t be any miscommunication. 
if u choose to avoid the problem (like i did previously), it will make them feel even worse about u (i’m sure ur Fe child won’t like that). it’s better to out right state it & risk looking like an idiot than hurt their feelings while also over complicating things"
2262,estp,"My Dad is a ESTP and he would make tons of friends.  But of course in his day, there was no texting(and not much phoning).  So he would be glad to see and talk to these friends when he would randomly meet them in public.  No problem in that day and age.
Must be a way for the ESTP to function in modern society.  "
2263,estp,"About the feeling of being obligated to text back, I do completely relate and receiving their texts do sting for those who I don’t really want to. 
About figuring out whether to make more friends or not, nowadays I try (however selfish it may seem) to stick to the rule of whether I can see the potential of somehow gaining/benefiting by being their acquaintance. Although I often end up just making friends with them regardless, and the shitty loop goes on and on. "
2264,estp,Yes! I really have this but i don’t see this as a problem. I just don’t build a deep connection with new people anymore because i already have a bunch of good friends and i don’t have time for more. It’s sounds really practical but it’s the truth. Sometimes a make new friends if the are really special and i really enjoy their company. But also there a some really good friends that i lost. I also categorize them. A lot of just normal friends which i see a lot in school/soccer but not really good friends. It could be good friends if i hangout out with them but i don’t do this because of my time for my other friends.
2265,estp,"If I weren't sure whether or not to get new friends, then I probably wouldn't. It's hard for me to make real new friends if I'm confused or stressed about my social/emotional state. If you really can make new friends with that confusion, then great, the more the merrier, but it would be hard for me to connect if I felt like I was neglecting other friends."
2266,estp,"Interesting, I suppose that's an option as well. I'm actually more comfortable meeting people upfront than texting all the time, because it's hard to read the message behind what they write (whether they are feeling anxious, just want my attention, etc)"
2267,estp,"Haha I'll keep this in mind. I'm actually the initiator by asking ""Hey what's your cell"" and then we go texting so I get to know more about him/her when I'm busy. IDK, I just feel bad when I'm busy hanging out with another friend and then I'd have to text ""sorry man I'm busy hanging out with X"" as if I don't want to hang out with them, but I do except it's like I'm separating my affections into different parts for each individual kind of thing. I guess I gotta be honest and say I'm just a busy person lol :p"
2268,estp,"Lmao, totally relate to the last paragraph. I tend to make a ton of acquaintances, and it's usually a good thing (IMO) because of personal experience I had with one (figuring out that they were connected to doing X, which I never heard of, eventually getting a job at where they were connected to, became closer friends). To me, every friend/acquaintance is a surprise because you never really know what they are involved in and what they can show you. IDK, but yeah totally relate to the sting of texting back for those I don't really want to."
2269,estp,"Yeah I've done ""the more the merrier"" attitude for a while. IMO most of the ones I don't talk to anymore are completely fine with it, but deep inside I don't feel like they are. I kind of expect them to be honest with me about me not talking to them as much, but I guess since they aren't telling me they are concerned then I don't need to do anything about it  ¯( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)/¯ thanks though"
2270,estp,"ok, so I have 4 esfp friends in mind as I write this. 2 guys, 2 girls. I can only have deep conversations with one. the others get bored or only participate if it's a circlejerk about their own opinions. we have a lot of fun though... it's no lie that esfps are the life of the party, and as a fellow Se-dom I love having others around who will keep up with me when everyone else is slowing down. they're always up for another dare or adventure and it's awesome, but when things get serious... they can try to have deeper convos but even if they manage, it's more pseudo deep than actually deep. erg that doesn't fit with all though... like a couple of the friends are perfectly good at and capable of having deeper conversations, they just don't because it doesn't interest them as much as joking around and being silly does. "
2271,estp,"that's awesome! yeah, take what I said with a grain of salt bc obviously people are all individuals and just because my esfp friends aren't the most intellectual doesn't mean every esfp out there is vapid and shallow. "
2272,estp,"Realize this thread is 
The F is foremost, but we can learn the T (through the education system).  Younger Esfp's tend to be less developed on the T side, and if they let themselves continue that way, they'll grow up to be underdeveloped on the T and you get your friends (not sure how old they are so they might be relatively young still).
On the flip side, since Estp's already got the T part down, but there's no formal way to teach the F, so that's harder for you guys to learn.
All that said, if done from a perspective of humor rather than derision, we're happy for you to laugh at the ridiculousness of us tearing up at the movie/song/commercial/magazine ad.
My ESTP friends and I get along very well and have a wide range of conversations from smack talking, relationship talk, career, aspirations, etc."
2273,estp,"It's probably more of my age than anything (I'm 21, F) but I can't make up my mind on anything. I start a project and stop in an hour because I get bored. I've changed my major more times than I can count and I can't seem to find a career I'm interested in. I've probably changed my mind on what I want to do every week. How can I take the next step in my life if I can't figure out what I want to do? I'm pretty stuck right now and it seems like the only thing that makes me happy is going out and partying which has become slightly dangerous recently. I want to take a step back but I become very depressed when I'm not in a social setting. I've also realized this past month how sensitive I am toward everything. I had to stop watching a silly cartoon because I felt too bad for a character in it which is pretty silly. Any other ESTP feeling the same way? I'm not sure if I've clearly stated about how I'm feeling.. pretty bad at explaining my thoughts (which I think most ESTP's can relate to lol)"
2274,estp,"Here's what i learned. The whole world needs to be treated like a competition.
Everybody knows that the reason why people chose a subject is so that they can specialize. It make you more valuable in any given field if you are the best at doing what you do, obviously. But ESTP doesn't like long term comitments - feels like a cage, right?
The advice i was given is to treat that comitment like a challenge. Be better than other people at getting the thing done. And then it is yours. Work hard and then play hard.
This is how ESTP can excel despite wanting absolute freedom. You better understand the path to that freedom."
2275,estp,"Hey girl, 23 F still in college and I can totally relate. Luckily, I found a major I liked right away (international affairs) but I am constantly failing classes because I get bored. I hate the pointless routine! And bored means depressed, so I look for ways to get happy too. Try not to over do it on the party scene, I've been there. Try to make plans with new people too, college is like a playground for us because there are so many new people to talk to. Sometimes it helps avoid the depression. Also at some point just realize all majors have opportunities to be both boring and interesting, nothing is always going to be 100% great so just pick one you like and commit! Chances are it wont be what you end up doing for a living anyway."
2276,estp,"Haha I can totally relate. 
Actually I answered another thread about what would you like to improve"" and getting bored too easily was it
https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/4lip7u/what_would_you_like_to_improve_if_you_could/
Actually I was super bored at school and didn't do great at academics, not because I'm not smart, on the contrary, ESTPs are known to be sharp, but just because I was so bored all the time. 
Concepts, theories and else bore us like hell. I would rather go out and try to apply what the teacher is saying than sitting in class and listening. Because the lecturing approach of formal education is so unappealing, I would suggest to try and focus on major/subject that you can practice with a lot of hands on. Learning things that you can apply in the reality of your present moment. 
As for the partying and the going out, it's normal, you feel alive when you're outside and with people. That's how ""you recharge"" emotionally speaking, even if physically speaking it might be a bit borderline if you abuse it. What I learned over the years, is that I'm know satisfy with just hanging out with a small group of friends that I really care about, I don't need to go to huge parties every day of the week no to recharge. I can just chill with beers and talk and mess around with my friends and it makes me happy and emotionally satisfy. Of course, we do go out all together and go crazy from time to time (I'm often the initiator of that btw). 
My advice, would definitely to find a balance between going out (movies, watching a concert, sports, restaurants, bars) with your friends and not spending ""too much"" time alone because that's when you start thinking and having all these sensitivity coming up. "
2277,estp,"Yeah, I want to be able to choose whatever I want after schooling.. even if it's opposite of my major, haha. 
That's a great point. I didn't think about it like that before. I'll start taking things more as a competition to motivate myself to do things."
2278,estp,"I've been in a lot of different fields in retail and I used to be a server. Currently I'm a nanny for twins which lets me go anywhere I want to go and keeps me active :) I'm thinking about picking up a second job though so I can make friends my age lol. Yeah I agree, I hate that everyone keeps telling me I need to make up my mind right now! Why should I spend all of my money and time in something I know I'm going to change my mind about in a year? Psychology is the one thing I've always been interested in. My psychobiology class is really interesting to me right now though so I might pursue something in that field (I'm about to get my AA in psych). Thanks for commenting! I'm glad other people are going through the same thing. "
2279,estp,"Well I'm an engineer, I focus on actual real science. And in my opinion everything involved with psychology is pseudoscience no matter what.
I don't know what the specific dogma in psychology is but I'm sure that some day people said the same thing about Jung like you're saying about this guy. 
I don't know if his theories are right or wrong, all I know is that what he says an ESTP is supposed to be, looks a hell of a lot like me."
2280,estp,"Tbh, what makes small talk is understanding what people want. Why do you think the first thing most people say to someone is ""Hi, how are you?"" It's because people want to talk about themselves. The best first question to ask anyone is... ""What do you do for fun?!"" Just keep the questions going off of that and you are pretty much set. 
It's a conscious activity. We all want to be  playing 2v2 ping-pong for a pitcher of beer but you gotta chat those losers up before they are willing to play for beer like that. "
2281,estp,"Just because you're shy doesn't make you not ESTP. I used to be bad at social things too.. Just work on talking to people little by little. If you're not hitting the gym I can personally attest that that was the biggest improvement for my social life - not sure why but it worked.
You'll get there bro"
2282,estp,"I have dermatillomania, so my main go-to is skin picking, I do it on my fingers. From my understanding, it comes from a lack of like an actual better mental way to cope with stress (since I'm not an addict of any kind) but I'm no psychologist. If I'm being overwhelmed then I can get frustrated, but otherwise that's about it from the top of my head. Maybe other answers will remind me of other stuff"
2283,estp,"before developing NI - keep  going toward stimulating things like extraversion drugs / women  and ignore the cause of stress
after developing NI- isolate and gather myself and all the information SE Took in and acknowledge the stress to create and organise the information using NI"
2284,estp,Either stand completely still and stare at the ground or pace/walk myself. Thinking and weighing up my options. Generally I don't get stressed for long as i find a solution or just give up or procrastinate. If I'm facing the problem directly I just get impatient or angry (if I'm at work I rush things and throw stuff around if they are in my way)
2285,estp,"Sure, sounds good. Are you willing to do it though? Seems that none of us is ready to invest at all into this subreddit lol.
(I certainly wouldn't take the responsibility xD) 
General topic ideas:
How to befriend an Estp: be honest and fun
How to date an Estp: be honest and fun
How to have an Estp on your side: be honest and fun
How to have an Estp do his work properly: be honest and fun
How to have deep conversations with an Estp: be honest and fun
Wait! My spider senses are tickling (Ti)... Do we have a pattern here??? Oo"
2286,estp,"As a female ESTP I think its complete crap. I don't care if its 'truth', those 'tactics' dont allow for functional  relationships. ESTP's are naturally flirtatious, so if its helped your relationship...holy fuck you are/were a lost soul."
2287,estp,"Mostly bullshit. While I'm sure /r9k/-types can probably get laid using Red Pill ideology, I doubt it's with anyone but the lowest common denominator (looking for money) or girls who are in a dark place emotionally (where abusive behavior is actually appealing), and I doubt it can at all foster a healthy relationship.
And generally, not treating a person as a person, but more of a vehicle for self-gratification isn't a good idea, and speaks volumes about the emotional immaturity of one's self."
2288,estp,This standup highlights the kind of conversation and philosophy they’d like to create for men (its goofy af).. but from what I can see - it’s kind of a circle jerk and anti-feminism
2289,estp,"One of the best things to read as a man. For the love of god read the sidebar first. If you dive head first into the hot posts you will be completely out of your depth. 
It’s the kind of stuff your dad should’ve taught you but probably didn’t. 
Not done an awful lot of good to my sex life but I’m a bit...different in that regard. 
Improved the interactions I have with women immeasurably. If you’re into social manipulation, which as an ESTP I’m pretty sure you are, then some stuff in there is complete gold. As with anything there is a lot of rubbish thrown around but it’s a bit of a work in progress so that’s to be expected. 
Don’t be so autistic as to follow it like a bible. Use what you think is useful and dismiss what you want. Most of it is completely correct though. "
2290,estp,"I think a lot of the comments made so far are from people that don't know much about it. Yes, extremists exist, which is why you get this air of ""TRP is for assholes and they treat women like garbage!"" However, if you actually read the sidebar and dig into the core value of what is taught, there can be a lot of benefits... for everyone.
It teaches to focus on oneself. Make yourself the priority. Don't focus on garnering outside approval, or being popular. Focus on what YOU want in life, and go for it. You do need to ignore a lot of the comments, and focus on ""Endorsed"" posts and sidebar content. The core tenants don't speak about treating women poorly - - unless you consider not standing up for yourself by setting healthy boundaries and sticking to them as such. 
As an ESTP, I find a lot of help in TRP from these concepts, but I do take a lot of what's said with a grain of salt. 
Just my opinion."
2291,estp,Eh trp isn’t just about pickup stuff though. Being flirtatious won’t help you get a job. Okay that’s a lie but you get the point.  It’s more about the unwritten rules of male/female interaction and how to navigate those murky waters as best as possible. What you do with that knowledge is up to the user. 
2292,estp,"Basically argues men should mistreat and belittle women to have women pay attention to them because they can't get a woman. These types refuse to see/change their looks, lack charisma, money, skills, manners and the like. 
Cringe fest through and through. 
If they'd just workout, get a job, manners a lot of their problems would be solved. But of course then they couldn't blame women for their problems. "
2293,estp,"So ""taking the red pill"" is a concept from the matrix movie, it means accepting the truth 100% no matter how depressing or offensive it is. Truth 
r/TheRedPill is a subreddit mostly about men's relationship with women. They post their ideas about how women act regarding romantic and sexual relations with men, many redditors find a majority of what they say to be untrue and sexist."
2294,estp,"I'm just getting into this whole MBTI thing, but as far as I know, I am primarily ESTP. Test wise, I am always given the result of ESTP but with a 1-3% range between S/N and P/J. Depending on my environment/setting, I can display functions of other types. Not entirely sure how that works but could be a ""hybrid?"" lmao. 
Absolutely has had a positive impact. I've found myself to be a natural (as ESTP's should be considering their present state) but TRP has been able to help me reinforce my mindset and develop ""innovative"" tactics I would have otherwise not been exposed to. Also with ideas and concepts from TRP, I can compare my previous interactions to the ""ideal"" way they should have turned out. From then, I further improve future interactions with women, friends, and acquaintances. "
2295,estp,"In a nutshell, it says that if a woman has the choice to date ""up/date ""Chad"", she will even if that means cheating. Therefore, your main focus should be to work on yourself and become Chad. And then the women will come. Working on yourself includes: developing a fun personality, hitting the gym, eating healthy, successful career, etc. You catch my drift."
2296,estp,"What are your guys 'criteria' for a friend?
What are the things/characteristics that you think are the most important to have in a friend? 
What do you expect from a friend?
Another question: Do/will you ESTPs have lieing and manipulative type of people in your circle of friends? The ones that break the rules? Do you actually perceive them as a real friend?"
2297,estp,"Ok, for 'best friend' those are people i have long history with. You don't become a 'best friend' through personal effort or coolness.
i'm the ESTP who adopts introverts and drags them to things they really don't want to be doing... street festivals, axe throwing, bars...
You need to bring some utility to the relationship. Maybe that's killer music recommendations, or you're a great shopping partner, maybe you're great with my kids and willing to babysit once in a while, maybe you're an expert in something I find interesting, maybe you can diagnose that weird noise my car is making. If you need a lot of help and attention from me, but don't bring anything yourself, I'm going to get tired of that real fast. 
I've got some real sketchy friends I adore. But they treat people decently they just might use drugs or scam their car insurance company. "
2298,estp,"a friend for me is someone who I can really just hang out with and do anything with that I trust.
To me an important characteristic is that if I get into a fight they jump in the fight with me. I'd do the same for them and to me it says a lot about loyalty. My best friends are family to me I see them as brothers.. And my girl bestfriends as my baby's.. 
I hate lying manipulative people and avoid them like the plague. I have no problem with people I know doing it to others just not to me. I'm kind of partial like that. IDGAF how my friends are so long as they're good to me, I accept them.
People who break the rules with me are awesome. I trust them more.. Cause I know I'd be down to help them do something illegal if it was really important. Like this mfker wronged my homie and we're about to set the score straight. That's what I mean."
2299,estp,"That's such a broad question 
My friends are people who don't suck. If you're a boner and are completely uninteresting, are dissimilar in more ways than not, etc, yeah it's not gonna work. Loyalty and honesty above all else, followed by being fun in a close third.
No, and ffs we're not just super liars and manipulators 24/7. Breaking the rules is fun if they're the rules you want to break and when you want to break them, otherwise it's annoying. Yes?"
2300,estp,"No, not at all. We generally keep people in our lives because they serve some use or purpose to us. So if that use or purpose is like to fulfill needs that friends generally do, yes. Otherwise, no, it's just a mutualistic relationship with friendship on the side until the use goes away "
2301,estp,"Hi guys PnssyDestroyer here.
I'm literally dead inside from my office job (I'm a medical assistant) and it's extremely detail oriented / repetitive and pain staking. I can feel my brain cells melting from the stupidity of my job (literally any kid can do my job ngl). I get paid minimum wage to scan and input records and it's my third day and I already want to kms.
​
Do you guys have any recommendations on easy jobs to apply to and get in? I'm still in community college so I don't have much in terms of degree. Any ways to make money or something? 
​
Thanks guys"
2302,estp,"There's jobs and there's careers. Getting into the gig economy is something you can do for extra cash, but try to find something that has career potential. You'll thank yourself later. 
It's good that you don't have a degree yet! Nothing is set in stone. If you still like the medical field, decent pay, and don't want to be in school for ages, something like sonography/ultrasound tech, radiology (more risky) or phlebotomy may be options for you to explore.
Find something you enjoy and pays well. I technically tell people what to eat all day and love it. I chose nutrition as my major because the careers are diverse and there's always something new/contradictory/problems to solve. There's a bit of science, math, and psych/sociology which kept school interesting.  I could have been researcher or a blogger. I could work at a hospital (very routine), do cooking classes/be a personal shopper, become a professor, start my own business or create nutrition handouts/trainings."
2303,estp,"My niece is a radiology technician. She sets her own hours (up to a point) and she loves it.
The hospital is pleasant, the cafeteria is good and the people are young and fun.
r/https://www.asrt.org/main/careers/careers-in-radiologic-technology/explore-careers
She was in school for two years and if she finishes her bachelor's, the hospital system may offset her school costs.
Good luck with your career search. It's fun to think about what I might have chosen at your age and with all of your options."
2304,estp,"Hi, I was wondering if you found INFJs as significantly helpful to you in an everyday kind of way. We are supposed to be really good at reading people (I'm an INFJ), and I don't know if that is of very practical use to an ESTP in a friendship, business partnership, or relationship. 
I can analyze poetry. I really don't think that matters at all to an ESTP, while it might be their weakness--Not to say that there are no great poets of our time here on the ESTP thread. 
It seems that some ESTPs are attracted to INFJs. I don't know if that is a thing, or if that is something I have only seen a few times. Maybe the girls were just cute and their type didn't matter actually. 
So in you opinion, do you consider the INFJ' ability to read people significantly valuable at work, at home, or as friends? 
Thanks!!!!!!!!!"
2305,estp,"This is so true. I'm (INFJ) very naive and have difficulty trusting my gut about people, but my husband (ESTP) is almost scary in some of the things he comes up with from reading others. Because he's almost always right! It's just me he has trouble reading, lol."
2306,estp,"Whenever I try to affect others' emotional values (ie anything that doesn't concern logic...flirting, socializing, asking for favors, etc.), the moment they show discontent, I usually get insecure about it. This is ofc due to inferior Fe, which feels like being a kite in a hurricane. Im not used to functioning in the realms of values so i cant navigate it. My stoicism helps me hide it, but it's all just a front.
You guys are supposedly more balanced w Ti/Fe. Any practical advice?"
2307,estp,"You're overthinking it. You're not the center of their world, you don't really matter that much to most people. You can't do more than your best, so as long as you do your best there's nothing to be insecure about."
2308,estp,"IDK, you mean if they don't listen to you after you do it? I just shrug and then go to someone else or do something else.
If they are discontent/uncomfortable about what you just did I'd ask why. Atleast the reasoning itself helps me not think it was my fault. Maybe they were having a bad day or they are just a jerk. If they don't want to say anything then that's their problem and I'll just hang with someone else to forget about it."
2309,estp,"Like if they dont LIKE what I'm putting forward, I'll take that as a reflection of eg I'm not cool, or I have bad tastes, or I lack social skills. Its true more often than not, and ik that, cuz again, I'm a Ti asshole, and im ok w that. But I know its not true ALL the time, sometimes it's the other person thats got problems, and not being able to differentiate is the stem of my insecurity."
2310,estp,"I don't know i think you answered your own question there. For the insecurity part, just apply that thinking to everyone who acts negatively towards you (the negative thoughts that COULD have been applied to you are not true all the time) to reduce the anxiety. But asking them straightforwardly that they seemed bothered and why will help you stop guessing their intentions."
2311,estp,"Some mental processes could look like this,
​
""I think I like you""
Not
""My heart says I like you""
​
Don't go strait to emotion, does that person make a good point/show they care about you? Show the SAME back (or maybe just slightly more)
​
One of the biggest mistakes you can make is bottling up emotion (Good or bad) and releasing it all at once. I used to be an ISTJ so I know the pain lol 
​
Example of what not, and to do
Backstory: Your coworker annoys you, you have been putting up with it for about a month without telling them and they make a snarky comment towards you and it hurts your feelings, what do you do?
​

Ignore it (bottle more up)
Say a specific hurtful thing about them to let them know you don't like them and to f off. (requires thinking and social awareness for the specific situation)
Explode saying all the things they did wrong to you and making yourself look like an emotional fool in the process

It may seem obvious but in the moment because you ignore the thinking part of the brain and go strait to the feeling part... something you never want to do if your a thinking type because fe is probably underdeveloped
​
same thing with positive situations, think through what your going to say, never the other way round
​"
2312,estp,"If you mean how do you do it without having people trying to shun you for it, you can't. There will always be people who just dislike you, for the silliest of reasons, but you just have to know yourself and know that your intentions are good. It's ok to feel good about yourself and the things you've worked hard to accomplish. The way I justify my confidence without being egotistical is by trying to be selfless and helping out others that are on the same trade as I am.  "
2313,estp,"I'm sure there have been times when you told people what they wanted to hear, even though you yourself don't agree with it. For instance, you'll pretend to like someone's political position, so the person will trust you and benefit you in some way. you don't have your own preferences because you need to adapt, so that you can get what you want in the end "
2314,estp,"Ok so basically what I’m trying to say is that many of my opinions are never set and stone. For instance, someone would say they’re not a morning person. My opinion on how I am a morning person or not can radically change. It’s never set and stone. It can change based on whether or not the situation calls for it. "
2315,estp,If it's only stuff like that it's cool I also wake up at 6am without problems but only because it would be harder for myself if in my head Id go like 'maaaan this is such a drag. I'd rather stay in bed and sleep some more' since I'm going anyway. If 
2316,estp,Eh I’m not sure either man. I don’t know. I’ve been in homeschool for the past 2 years now and seclude myself from others due to social anxiety among other things. Think I just need someone to talk to or something. Ugh I dunno 
2317,estp,"I'm a public health dietitian. My main persuasion to this profession is: I'm good with science, I care about less fortunate/at risk people, and eating/cooking are fun. I like the job stability and decent pay too."
2318,estp,"I'm currently still in college and I'll probably get my Bachelor's in Business Admin with a concentration in HR. 
By the time I graduate, I'll have been in 3 different universities and 3 different majors. I went from math to Spanish to business. My academic career is a long story, but I realized I'm very well suited for business.
Currently, I work as an intern at a real estate office, but my boss has 3 other companies that I do random work for too. I also have a screen printing subcontracting job on the side."
2319,estp,"My mom is an ESTP entrepreneur. We're wedding DJs and MC and sound equipment rental. In my childhood my mom has MC'd soooo many parties hahaha. Her charisma and organizational skills really shone, it's great fun to watch her. 
She's also a housecleaner, very thorough and clean. "
2320,estp,"I'm a female ESTP entrepreneur and I also do marketing consultant work on the side for extra money. Work on a bunch of different projects in a wide range of areas with a bunch of diff teams. Love the chaos, flexibility, freedom"
2321,estp,I absolutely love it. I get to be on my feet all day instead of in a chair. I have ample creative opportunities and it is very much something I could leave at work and go home and work on other stuff if I wanted. It also allows me to be the boss yet still have some boundaries to work in. 
2322,estp,You don't have to. To be honest I'm mainly interested in you reacting to these 2 points:
2323,estp,"What's your anchor? A teddy bear? 
Do you cry everytime Rose let go of Jack?
I can't imagine an ESTP, doing these things. It's rare that I'm suprised by anything I read on typology, somehow this does."
2324,estp,"Football
It takes a lot to get me to cry, and still quite a bit to get me to care about things unrelated to myself and my life.
We don't have much as far as emotions go. What reactions I have about anything are small at best "
2325,estp,"Maybe start threads about things that you enjoy?  I'm pretty sure threads don't have to be psychology-oriented.  Maybe you'll attract more ESTPs here.
I dunno – it's a place to start / something to try.  I honestly couldn't attest to its effectiveness though."
