0,isfj,"I don't know if it's just me, but I've had plenty of realizations throughout my life that have changed my way of living, or my perspective.  For example, I recently cut some friends out of my life after they began insulting me in a group chat (I also posted about this situation on this subreddit here.)  With four people sitting there and telling me that I was fake, annoying, and needed to change my fashion and myself to hang out with them, I really believed all of them.  I thought that they were correct, and everything was my fault.  I blamed myself immediately.  I wanted to die.  I felt like I'd never find people who liked me.  Most of all, I felt alone.  I didn't want to bother my parents with my pain, my friend group had revealed to me that they'd bee talking about me and hated me, and they had told me to not tell my other friends what happened because they ""already get enough hate.""  I called the National Suicide Hotline because I urgently needed to hear another voice on the phone... to know that I wasn't losing my mind.  As stupid as this may sound, I told the man on the other line what happened, and how I felt.  I admitted to him that I worry frequently about what others think of me, and that I feel a strong need to take care of others to assure that they never feel the way I do.  The man on the other line said something to me that really changed my mind: ""Caring about other people is a great quality to have.  But you're a person, and it's not bad to put yourself first.  The girls who started texting you aren't the only people in the world.""
And that really did change my way of seeing things.  I've been working on developing a stronger sense of self.  I've realized that I am stronger than I thought myself to be.  I am more capable than I had thought.  I feel like I'm developing a sense of confidence.  I've realized that everyone I meet isn't a good person.  I've reflected, and recognized that I've been walked over many times.  I'm not going to be mean to people.  But I'm going to stop letting other people decide who I am for me, and putting me down.  I'm no longer a pushover.  I'm a person, and I have people in my life who like me.  I'm going toward those people instead of toward those who don't have my best interests at heart.  
So, fellow ISFJ's: what's a lesson you've learned, or a realization you've come to, that has changed your way of living?"
1,isfj,"A kinda of joint lesson relating to worrying/overthinking things

Sometimes you just gotta not give a fuck and do it.
Even if the thing youre worried about/overthinking does happen/is true/becomes true, so what? Just let it happen and deal with it, the worlds most likely not gonna end.

Of course Ill still get stressed like any other person can over certain things
But that joint lesson helped me to be more relaxed, be more like myself (instead of staying too quiet and hiding back my personality too much out of security), and accomplishing things I didnt think I would"
2,isfj,"I hate that ISFJ must learn confidence in late age when you actually need that in young age. My life would be much better with that.
I dunno I still consider myself immature cuz people call me that. I only enjoyed that I actually had opportunity to work in sales so I developed my ESFP side of mind. I have nothing much to share. Winning friends and influence others is great book."
3,isfj,"The biggest lesson in my life came when I was having marital problems.  All of my childhood issues being raised by alcoholic parents came out in my marriage and it was suffering – controlling behavior, resentment, and not letting go of issues.  My sister sat me down and basically said “In order for your marriage to work, you will have to confront and deal with all of this childhood crap and how it affects your personality and relationships going forward.  You can deal with this now while you are still married and try to save it, or you can get divorced and have the same problems in your next relationship.”
She mailed me a book called “Codependency No More”.  I (43M) cried on the kitchen floor while reading it because I never have read my life story already written.  I went through a tremendous amount of counseling and worked with various support groups.  This was the beginning of the new me, the one that I love and understand. 
The lessons I learned over 10 years going through this process are as follows:
1) It’s okay to put myself first.  It really is.
2) I don’t have to control people to get what I want.  I can ask for help.  And they do not have to respond.  And that’s okay.  Find a different path or outlet.
3) I no longer live a life of what is right or wrong.  I live a life of what is healthy or not.  That is my approach.
I don’t know whether growing up trying to save my alcoholic parents turned me into an ISFJ, or if I was already an ISFJ and that is the role I chose.  My personality and my circumstances are so intertwined, I honestly don’t know what came first.  But I do now know, having such a deep understanding of myself, that I now have a choice of who I want to be.  I now know why I acted a certain way and thought a certain way.  With this knowledge, I can no longer blame anyone or any circumstance for my behavior, feelings, or actions.  This is the true lesson I have learned."
4,isfj,"Hi, as an ISFJ and former-pushover (for fear of offending/upsetting etc. etc. as we know all too well...) All I can add is that you have done amazingly well to cut out the hate, negativity and downright nastiness. It’s hard to walk away from people like that, and I’ve actually managed it in the last year or so as well. 
I think I’ve said on here before that I was told ‘Kindness is not Weakness’ and that was a game-changer in not seeing myself as a doormat for just trying to understand and care and help (to no avail!) A year later and I am not missing anything about the toxic relationship at all. It’s brilliant. Really done me the world of good, I hope it does the same for you x "
5,isfj,"Lesson learned: a person putting other people down is the one with the problem. I learned this when having a friend who constantly gave me small negative remarks. Once I realized that she did it because she was unhappy with HERSELF, it totally didn't bother me anymore. Then I started feeling sorry for her instead. "
6,isfj,"I don't think anyone will suggest an universal ISFJ gift... Each person has specific interests and hobbies. But as you say in your comment, gifting an experience may be a good idea, it should remain as a good memory and it would be unexpected for him. If he is adventurous, maybe some kind of activity like and adventure park (those places with bridges and ziplines in the trees), I would have loved that! "
7,isfj,"I'm a so called entp myself... Was curious what other isfj people would have liked as a kid, something he isn't even aware exists.. Plus, children spend too much time online, need something in the real world, or an experience (they get too much plastic sh*t as presents as it is) "
8,isfj,"So you'd rather to take something plastic but there than something virtual but his ?
I feel you place the bar too high by striving for something out of his representations. Just respect the spirit of gifting, and you'll be fine.
The best you can hope from your creativity is hitting two birds with one stone, not finding the Holy Grail."
9,isfj,"The only ENTP I've ever been close to is my older brother.
I really adore him, but our personalities clash a lot. 
It was much worse when we were young. We fought like cats and dogs, and we couldn't even stand to be in the same room with each other without arguing.
Now that we're both getting older, we've mellowed out and it's much easier to hang out with each other. We do still argue if we're around each other for prolonged periods of time, but mostly there's just a lot of good-natured ribbing and sarcastic insults.
There are a lot of traits I admire in him. He's always seemed so confident and outgoing, and I've picked up a lot of social cues/behaviors from him, growing up.
I envy him for his independence.
He's extremely funny, and nobody has ever been able to make me laugh as hard as he can. When I'm hanging out with him, he frequently makes me laugh so hard I cry.
He's a very genuine, loving, trusting person. A lot of people do take advantage of that. He has a desire to help people, and he trusts people really quickly after meeting them, so of course there are always needy, toxic people who see that in him and manipulate him through that. They play the wounded victim, and he tends to jump in and try to rescue them, without considering what this person is like, or what they're taking from him.
He's very generous. My brother was always offering to take me places or buy me food and stuff when we were younger. 
He's always been extremely protective of my sister and me, and I've always felt safer when he's around. He'd never let anybody hurt either of us, and there have definitely been a lot of situations where somebody was bullying one of us, and we didn't have the courage to stand up to them, so my brother did it for us.
He cares a lot about his hygiene and appearance. Which really sucked when I had to share a bathroom with him. Now that he's moved out, though, it's not a problem. I'm never ashamed to be seen in public with him, so that's a bonus.
He's a little bit of a chameleon-type, and he definitely tries very hard to fit in, which often involves repressing his own personality, interests and desires.
For example, if he gets a new girlfriend, he tends to adapt his interests to match hers, and he'll listen to the same music, watch the same movies and shows, dress more like she does, etc; even if he was never into those things before.
He struggles with depression and anxiety, although I think that's more likely due to our upbringing than his personality type, as we were raised in a pretty dysfunctional home environment.
My brother has definitely been good for thickening my skin over the years. I learned how to let a lot of things slide, and I like to think I'm less offended by arguments or criticism after living with him for so long.
When we argue, we butted heads really bad, and we were both too stubborn to give up, so he helped me learn to stand my ground with people. 
I love him a ton, and I look up to him a lot.
That being said, I would never want to be in an intimate relationship with an ENTP, personally.
I read about a lot of ISFJs ending up with them, and I could never do it. The constant conflict would be exhausting.
Plus, I have a hard time being around extroverts for too long, and they drain me.
INTPs, on the other hand, I've been with and really loved. They're similar enough to ENTPs while still being introverted and needing their own time/space.
TL;DR:
ENTPs are lovely people. Confident, funny, kind, witty, extremely intelligent, boisterous, the life of the party. But they also love to argue with people, and I'm too stubborn to be able to handle that in large doses."
10,isfj,"My fella of 6 years is an ENTP. Our friends say we complement and balance each other. 
We have some major issues, which frequently arise, but we work on them more often than we used to. Generally, the issues stem from an imbalance of consideration for the other's needs. 
Most of the time, we get along well.
Occasionally, though, I wonder if this relationship will destroy me."
11,isfj,"My director pulled me into his office the other day and asked if I would take on the role of manager for the small team I'm in. I still haven't decided if I should accept. I have some concerns:

I am a female in my mid-20s, and would be managing two guys in their early 30s. This intimidates the heck out of me, and surprisingly more so because I consider them friends. Could I be taken seriously as a leader?
I feel that I may experience ""impostor syndrome""-- despite working there for several years, I often feel I don't deserve the praise and confidence my higher ups have expressed toward me
Obviously as an ISFJ there are things that work against me in a leader role-- I'm not really assertive, I don't like ruffling feathers, I prefer to avoid the spotlight, I have trouble looking at the ""big picture"", I often take on too much work, etc. You know.

I know there are things about ISFJs that can help us be good leaders, but it seems that there are a lot of hurdles. Anyone have advice or experience in regards to leadership as an ISFJ?"
12,isfj,I’m 25 and have to be in charge of people in their 40s and 50s with tons more experience than me. I will use the fake it till I make it routine if I feel uncomfortable but it’s not a great long term approach. Try and get an assertive type friend who you can use as your voice or to be the “bad guy” if need be and so long as they are supportive of being in that role. That has really helped me focus on actually managing rather than fretting over what everyone will think of my decision. I wish you the best of luck!
13,isfj,"Some thoughts:
Going from an individual contributor (IC) to manager is a career change. I didn’t really realize that when i moved from a team member to the manager of my team.  There will be new/different challenges as a manager and i spent more time dealing with interpersonal issues that i didnt have to deal with before. It was a growing opportunity for me as I’m not the best at handling interpersonal issues. 
When i became a manager, I was significantly younger than some of my team - a few around my age, but most were older than I (10, 20, 30 years older). I didn’t experience any issues with the age difference from the team.  But, it was hard for me to get use to telling the team to do something instead of asking them to do something. I had to work on how to say no and being less accommodating when it would adversely impact the team or our deliverables.
I definitely experienced the “impostor syndrome” (and still do from time to time). But i’ve learned to take the praise/confidence my manager gives me to counter my internal struggle with “impostor syndrome”.  
I tend to be quiet, avoid the spotlight, avoid conflict and those traits make some aspects of management harder. But i learned a lot and have grown because i had to do things outside of my comfort zone.
Only you can decide if the role is right for you. But if you dont try, you wont know if it’s right or not for you.  
It also takes some time to get comfortable with any new job and there is a learning curve to get up to speed. It took me over a year to feel comfortable when i started. 
If you take the manager role, make sure that your company backfills your old position. When i started, that didnt happen and i ended trying to do my old role (because it was familiar/comfortable and i knew i could do it well) and my new job. I ended up working a lot in my first year and had to learn to let go of some of the work and delegate to the team.  "
14,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and was promoted last year to manager. I was a bit scared but luckily the team are really nice. I've booked myself on to some internal management training to help strengthen my skills and fill in any gaps.
The thing I find the hardest are those awkward convo's where you know people are going to react badly, but I've found that by staying calm and factual I can usually pull through on them. I also hate presenting but can force myself to do it when I need to, and it gets easier every time.
I've kind of just faked it til I've got more comfortable with doing things and if I'm ever really unsure about something I'll check in with our head of dept just to run through. Not very often and in a ""x has happened, I was gonna do this to sort it. Is that ok?""
You will ace it!"
15,isfj,"Hey, I'm a bit late to the party. I'm currently a assistent manager at a local store. The only thing that has been a downside is the fact that, if people don't do it the right way/not the way I want them to do, I'll do it myself. Same thing as when they take too long to understand/I have to repeat myself a lot. I just get frustrated. I don't know if that is a ISFJ thing, but it's a thing to be thinking about of you have the same trait. Good luck! 
Also, I'm also a female in mid 20's, and I have to manage people ranging from 20 y/o to 40 y/O's. :)"
16,isfj,"Thanks! I haven’t actually accepted or said no to the offer yet— I’m still trying to decide if this is the right choice for me. My manager says I would be crazy to say no, but at the same time, I would also be crazy to say yes if it isn’t right for me. Agh, I don’t know! Thanks for the insight."
17,isfj,"Really good points, thank you! 
Yeah, everything you mentioned really resonates. A lot of the reasons that drive me to want to decline the position are kinda the reasons I should maybe accept the offer. That is, I can learn and grow a lot as a person and professionally if I take on this challenge and face some of my anxieties. And yeah, you're right-- I won't know unless I try.
I would still be working alongside my team members and mainly would be taking a more active role in helping us prioritize, track and analyze our performance, approve time off requests-- stuff like that. I probably would have fewer projects on my plate, but still would do a lot of the same types of work. We also already have a project manager, and he helps distribute the workload and prioritize, so it isn't all on me to organize everything. And then I probably would have to have some tough conversations from time to time, I would think. If I take this, I imagine I would need to be a hardass sometimes. Can I be a hardass to people that I consider friends? I dunno. Probably, if I give myself a good pep talk.
The initial awkwardness of it hopefully would be the worst part. The idea of my director calling us together to announce, ""We're doing some restructuring, and I'm excited to say that Goldarrr will be leading the writers"" makes me want to run for shelter. And gauging the impressions my coworkers have of everything-- it's just odd. 
Anyways, a lot to think about!"
18,isfj,"Thanks for sharing! I did accept the position, and am in the early phases of the transition. Yeah. what you said makes sense, and I think would be more of an issue for me if I were training a new hire. 
I think I'm most afraid of being perceived in a negative way, and that I might struggle with some of the more numbers/productivity-related stuff. Basically I want to maintain the camaraderie, but still do a good job of motivating us to improve processes. We'll see-- I hope I do okay!"
19,isfj,"I'm a habilitation provider for the state of Arizona. I work with my brother who has autism. We do daily goals for practical, everyday things. I think it definitely reflects my personality type, working at home and with my own family."
20,isfj,"Interesting, I've been thinking a lot about this lately. I'm a database architect and, while it's hard to complain about the pay, I really don't feel like it fits my personality. If I had my druthers I'd be writing, but the idea of being a nurturer is appealing in many ways as well. I'm not sure what this really translates into, however."
21,isfj,"I'm a phone interpreter... I've been feeling recently that my hard work could be better put to use elsewhere, but as it is, I do my best and feel pleased when I'm able to help the customer and the client communicate. "
22,isfj,"I'm in my last year of college, but I plan on going into safety in the oil and gas field. I would say that definitely fits my ISFJ personality type since I feel that anything involving ""safe"" and ""caring"" correlates here."
23,isfj,"I do online marketing for an environmental nonprofit. I wasn't sure about this job at first because marketing is definitely outside my comfort zone, but when you're trying to save the planet everything feels much more honest and emotional, and your ""customers"" are generally happy to hear from you. So I ended up loving it, and I feel like a superhero every time one of my projects brings in a bunch of money. :)"
24,isfj,"With school starting soon, it starts to put a weight on my shoulders to make sure everything is up and running for everyone in time, but solving each little problem is a step forward and every smile and sliver of gratitude is worth it."
25,isfj,"Its like you keep running through a mental checklist of sorts to make sure this person is happy, and this person, and this person, etc, etc
And when something goes wrong I feel worse for them then they do themselves."
26,isfj,"I had a business of my own for a while making housecalls and fixing computers in office as well as selling new ones and it was great, but there are those times when there is nothing you can do and that feeling of helplessness is not fun.  
I once had a customer that had pictures upon pictures of family events, including the birth of her granddaughter and while I was working on the computer, the hard drive crashed and the files were unrecoverable.  That moment still hits me hard deep in the soul!  
I guess the upside of working where I do is that there are a lot of safety nets with our redundancy; backups upon backups of files and whatnot.  So it's nice to not have as much of a chance for things to go wrong.  I definitely know that feeling though."
27,isfj,"Hi,
I am currently in living arrangements with some of my acquaintances (2 couples - 4 people) and one of them is an ISFJ. We have been living together in rented accommodation for 3 years now. Me and her have always had civil relation with each other.
That gradually changed over time: due to our immense differences in tastes and interests, we started talking less to each other, and eventually it came to a situation where her behaviour towards me is the following:

She would never initiate any conversation with me. If I say hi, she would say hi back, and that's it. She never asks about how am I doing and if I didn't initiate the conversation, we could literally go months without talking to each other.
If I tried initiating - asked her about how her day was, etc. - she would give me very short responses and no 'hooks' to keep the conversation going. She wouldn't even look at me when giving these answers, and she isn't expressive whatsoever.
All of the above is not the case with anyone else: if someone else asks about her day, she elaborates, uses facial expressions such as smile and actually looks towards that other person. She also follows up with a question of her own. None of that happens when she talks with me.

​
Can you, dear ISFJs, enlighten why is this the case? Is this how you behave towards a person that you dislike? Maybe she hates me? Doesn't feel comfortable around me? Is it possible that the main reason she acts towards me like this is because we are just so different? Is it possible to reverse this?
From what I remember, I have never insulted her or acted unkindly towards her..."
28,isfj,"Sounds exactly like how I would behave in this situation. My main way of relating to people is through shared interests. If we don't have them, I won't want to talk to you that much because I know it's not going to go anywhere or get deep. Doesn't mean I don't like you, but it's not energy I feel like is worth expending, if that makes sense."
29,isfj,"Honestly I have acted this way with a housemate who I did not like because they weren't a nice individual in  any way possible and i wanted to cut my communication short with them. But you actually seem concerned and care about why your housemate may be acting this way. You may have done something that you didn't mean to personally effect them, but you may not be aware of it. If i were you , i'd confront them in the kindest way possible by asking if you did anything wrong because you really want to get a long with her, and that you're willing to fix it if u did something wrong."
30,isfj,"I'd probably find myself acting like this if I were annoyed or resentful about someone being inconsiderate towards myself or others eg being messy or not contributing well to household practically and emotionally. It'd take me a v long time to get to the point of actually showing my frustration outwardly in how I interact with them. No idea if this is the issue here, just thought I'd let you know how it is for me!"
31,isfj,"if she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't know how to speak with you that she actually knows makes you comfortable, then that makes her uncomfortable. this results in her not talking to you at all because .. she doesn't know what to say, and doesn't want to throw herself out of her comfort zone."
32,isfj,"Maybe with the passing of the years she just realized that you have nothing in common with her, but I feel like her behaviour is not just about not having anything in common, specially from what you said about her behaviour with your other aquaintances. Does she interact more with them than she does with you on a regular basis (I mean, spending time with them, even if nobody speaks)? Have you all known eachother for the same time?   
Another possibility is that you've made some comments that were unpleasant for her through all these years that were probably insignificant, but after being piled up they became a big discomfort and her way of avoiding more of those is just to cut communication with you, but hey! this is probably because she doesn't hate you at all and doesn't want to end up hating you (this is just a hypothesis of mine)  
Whatever it is the reason for her behaviour, I believe she doesn't hate or dislike you, she's just probably trying to avoid something that makes her uncomfortable, be it the awkwardness of not having anything to talk about, comments that she may dislike that are innocent... "
33,isfj,"I wouldnt blame her personality type. It seems to just be introverted behaviour to me. 
​
Women especially tend to open up to some people more than others and introverts and other introverts can often be pretty awkward together. There are a lot of variables here so its pretty hard to pin down. How you ask a question can lead to many different answers from another person. I used to get a lot of one word answers from women when I went on dates but now with a few tweaks women seem to give me better responses. 
​
Best way to tell if she dislikes you or not is if she is quick to get away from you or distances herself from you. Just keep a watch on her body language and what she does with herself when you are around. "
34,isfj,"She probably doesn't view you as more than an acquaintence. I know for me awkward small talk with acquaintences and strangers isn't something I enjoy. I will say points number 2 and 3 could be good signs that she doesn't like you. Those points honestly sound like what I would do if I hated someone or just avoid them. My advice is to just say something along the lines of "" Hey I've noticed you've been act strange around me. Did I accidentally do something wrong? I really value our relationship and want you to feel like you can be honest around me and do what I can to make this right"". I wish you luck. "
35,isfj,"I find her behavior very rude to be honest. Especially if she behaves differently towards the others in the house. But - that is her problem and not yours (unless you know of something you might have done to hurt her feelings. But my guess is you don't know of anything..). I would keep doing what you are doing - be friendly and ask her a question or two when you do meet. But give her lots of space, since she is clearly sending out signals of wanting to be left alone. "
36,isfj,"Well, you guys ARE introverts, after all, so I can definitely understand not wanting to expand much of extroverted energy into a hole (hole meaning that there is no chance of anything meaningful happening, friendship-wise and conversation-wise).
It looks like we have reached a zone of familiarity with each other and my acquaintance no longer feels that she has to behave in a very unnatural way (like she tends to behave when meeting new people, or people with whom she has similar interests) just to make sure I would feel included. Would you say my thinking is likely to be correct?"
37,isfj,"Well, she's a decent person, so, of course, she deserves consideration from my side.
Actually, I could see how she might see me as not a ""nice individual in every way possible"": due to my eccentricities, she thinks I'm defective and odd/weird and it might have been very easy for me do or say something offensive for her."
38,isfj,"Well... I am not too good with others' emotions and my behaviour sometimes can be a bit eccentric and there is a possibility that I might have hurt her feelings somehow... I just genuinely cannot remember doing that - I always make sure I abstain from any criticism of her, etc.
And yes.. Space she does indeed need, and I will give lots of it by maintaining the status quo - cordial politeness. "
39,isfj,"Your honesty is great. Can i make a suggestion? Just let her know what you've observed about her behavior and ask her if anything is up. If she's anything like me, she'll tell you if there is and will be grateful to get it out in the open. Solutions can begin to be found!"
40,isfj,"It's more of an uncomfortable feeling and it leaves me just absolutely not wanting to interact with that person. Some days the feeling is gone, but most of the time I just don't care about interacting with them. "
41,isfj,"It doesn't really matter that you can't read the emotions of your other roommates. You can see what conversations she has with with them right? Does that look different from how she talks with you? If yes, she must have a reason. I don't know if you find it worth the risk of asking it if you're kinda ok with the current situation. Otherwise you might ask your other roommates, but that also brings the risk of them telling it to her. Anyway I think the only way to find out how she feels is by talking. "
42,isfj,I am just fellow Isfj that consider my failure in those functions department. I cannot open up to people and try to cope with that with Ti function. It was once proven by psychologist I visited to solve other issue. I don't know what to do actually. Any advices?
43,isfj,"I discussed this issue in this thread and it includes tips for getting out of the Ti loop. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the_siti_loop_what_it_is_and_how_to_get_out_of_it/
​
I wish you luck trying to break this loop! I know it can be hard but it will be really rewarding and worthwhile in the end. "
44,isfj,"Can someone tell me their experience of dating an ESFP? Because I have been reading numerous posts saying that this wouldn't work out. 
I've only been messaging the guy because its a long distance relationship however we are planning to meet, but I just want to know from other people's stories, what its like to date an ESFP? and whether it can last? ( I know everyones different but It would be nice to hear other stories just as a heads up). "
45,isfj,"First of all, forget every stereotype or prejudice that you've read. Any relationship between any personality can work!
I've had no experience with an ESFP, but I have a similar experience. I used to despise INTJs for how blunt, cold and arrogant they can be online - and then I actually met an INTJ, got to know them better and now my perception has changed entirely. 
You clearly both like each other, so if you do decide to meet each other, I hope you have an amazing time :)"
46,isfj,"I disagree. I am an ISFJ, where my boyfriend (over 2 year relationship) is an ESTP. He is not a very strong 'T' so once over 3 times he did the test it came out ESFP. 
We are great together, nobody thought we will. We often disagree, but we find the things we lack in one another.
According to some strange info graphics I've found 3 days ago ISFJ would find a great much in ESTP or ESFP! I don't take it too seriously, but it is funny how I fit into that assumption.
For sure you shouldn't look at what the internet says about going along with a certain type. I think my boyfriend gives me a reality check when I am going too much into helping others or when it comes to underestimating myself.
In addition my boyfriend is from a different country what would maybe make it harder to manage, but it seems out types go along well enough!
Also, my best friend that I currently live with is a ESFP female and I know her since we are 3 and 5 years old, so I think the types match well :D"
47,isfj,"Yeah, true. I am also quite afraid of entering this because I'm not exactly sure if I'm fully over my last breakup. And he knows this, but I feel like maybe I need some time out to be single and focus on myself rather than start anything new. 
I'm really not sure. But I'm worried about letting this go because we both feel that there is something here. "
48,isfj,"Fellow ISFJs:
What do you do for a living?
Is this what you WANT to be doing?
Do you know what you want to be doing?
Practicality and resources aside, what would you do to contribute to society if money wasn't a factor?
I'm asking because I don't understand how any one person can know what they want to do with their lives ""career"" wise. Going to a 9-5 seems silly to me. Dressing up in professional clothes most people wouldn't otherwise wear, because it's company policy, seems silly to me (perhaps that's POLR Te talking). My INFJ family member knew from the time she was like 8, she wanted to be a professor, and she got her Masters at a very young age, and became a professor. I've had no clue, and still at the age of 29 don't. The idea of one linear path sounds boring. I'd love to do random things to make a living, but the lack of stability in that seems incredibly stressful. I'd love to podcast (who doesn't nowadays), but I feel I'm too boring, insecure, and lack the drive and discipline to meet people in which I can team up with to make it happen. I'd love to own a meditation studio, and provide yoga and meditation classes, but don't have the overhead, connections, or business know-how (not that I couldn't acquire that). But then thinking about what that really means, the back-end work, doesn't sound appealing in reality (just the teaching aspect, which isn't a feasible steady income stream). Am I destined, then, to work a basic 9-5? I very much hate that idea, but I also don't have any other ideas of how to make a feasible, stable living. I went to college and got a bachelors in an industry I don't want to be in, and got the degree mostly because ""that's just what you do"". Just feeling lost, without a life path or passion to pursue."
49,isfj,"I arrived at a field that (for now) I am really happy in. It took a lot of years and careful consideration of three questions: What am I interested in, what are my strengths, and what need can I fill in the world (ie. be compensated for). Somewhere in the intersection of those three questions might be your answer. 
About the 9-5 thing.. I recommend reading the first chapter of So Good They Can't Ignore You, which basically debunks the myth that fulfilling careers come from following your passions. The author argues that interests are actually irrelevant to the qualities that actually make fulfilling careers - having autonomy, control, creativity, impact and one other...  The point is, qualities of fulfilling careers can be instilled in any field, regardless of whether or not it is your passion, which you might just make you begin to loathe anyway. Instead the book explains how to build those qualities into your job, regardless of the chosen field. Highly recommend."
50,isfj,"I'm a critical care RN and it's a perfect fit. I work 3 days a week, wear scrubs. I make good money and feel good about my contribution to the world. Sometimes I get to just put my head down and work (sedated, ventilated patients) and sometimes I get to be chatty (family members or more stable patients). There's lots of order, problem solving and multi tasking. I'm def part of a team working for the best patient outcomes but have a ton of autonomy. I really love my job."
51,isfj,"I’m currently a student, majoring in chemistry and minoring in computer science. I want to eventually end up in some sort of lab/research job. Lack of variety doesn’t really bother me, as long as what I’m doing is intellectually stimulating and interests me."
52,isfj,"I’m a dental technician. I work in a lab, on a computer, headphones in all day listening to podcasts.
I would rather have no job or maybe work for a youtuber or company like DFTBA Records/Complexly. Something behind the scenes.
If money wasn’t a thing I don’t know how I would contribute to society. Maybe take care of cats lmao. "
53,isfj,"I'm an insurance agent. I'm good at it but it's definitely not what I want to be doing. I'm actually researching other career paths now. I kind of have no clue what I really want to do, but so far I'm leaning towards something in the computer science field. "
54,isfj,"I work and am completing my master's in environmental policy and sustainable development! I also do some work in refugee assimilation programs a few hours a week. This is definitely what I want to be doing, but I'm also open to getting a PhD in the future and going into teaching and research because I enjoy that as well. 
I was previously working in HR and it was really not my thing. I was like you, did my undergrad in whatever because it's just what you're meant to do, and I was miserable. I made it work, scraped together enough motivation to get a decent GPA and did a bunch of extracurriculars, but I knew I wouldn't enjoy working in that field (and I really didn't). 
However, I agree with the other comment that says you don't have to follow your passions to have a fulfilling careers (for one thing, this is just unrealistic considering how many people work in family businesses and inherited occupations worldwide); you can find fulfilment in certain aspects of any work or outside of work - I initially started working with refugees during my previous job to just feel good about something, and it really helped."
55,isfj,"I'm a 33 year-old spanish ISFJ. I also got a degree in an industry I don't want to be in (Civil Engineering). I'm currently trying to become a high school teacher, because I enjoy sharing my knowledge with other people, especially teenagers."
56,isfj,"I work in event/production management and I love it! It's a little bit of the same thing every day, but also varies depending on the client/event, so I have a good balance of stability and variety that really suits me. At the moment I'm maintaining a department that I'm not totally sure is a good fit with me (more technical than people focused) but it's fine for now and is a good building block for my next step.
I sort of just... ended up here by being at the right place at the right time. I wouldn't say it's my life's passion or anything, but it's mentally and emotionally fulfilling and I generally enjoy what I do so that's really all I can ask for."
57,isfj,27F isfj lawyer here. Ever since I could remember I have always wanted to be a lawyer. Now that Im here I've realized that there are so many aspects of the job that don't bode well with me. For example (no surprise) it is extremely adversarial in nature which goes against my need to be well liked and to be seen as a nice person. It may also be the quarter life crisis talking haha
58,isfj,"(26,F, pos) I’m currently working logistics in a retail store, and do a lot of the same process every day (with little extra projects). I work AMs, so there’s some quiet, productive time before the store gets busy, which is wonderful! But I don’t mind saying hi and helping guests!! 
I never had a set “career” that I wanted to go after, but I always felt like if I HAD to choose (people were expecting me to go to college), I would have tried to be a teacher for elementary children. 
But what I really enjoy is cooking/baking, but despite the compliments and affirmation I’ve received on my abilities, I also never thought I was good enough to consider being a real chef as one of my options.. 
Btw most of my work experience has been in the food industry and it’s been a few years but I’ll be working in a restaurant again soon!!! ~excitement~"
59,isfj,"I’ve worked all sorts of jobs trying to find one that I really liked. I was an EMT, a Chef, an IT Tech Support Person and now I’m working Human Resources.
I really like Human Resources to be able to share my knowledge and take care of people. Plus can shape help a lot of the newer employees and help young and inexperienced ones some good life knowledge."
60,isfj,I work in care (of course) but I'm making a move to working in the homeless sector (I'm homeless myself!).  Hoping it'll give me better opportunities and actually move up in the sector.  I want to go back to University to do a degree in mental health (I have a degree in psychology/sociology) and hopefully this will give me some experience in that field too.
61,isfj,"Thanks for the insight. :) In considering your questions, the challenge I’ve had is: the things I’m good at are boring to me, the things I’m interested in don’t appear to be something that could provide to the world. But maybe I haven’t searched hard enough. I think my insecurities don’t help either. 
Thanks for the book suggestion! I’ve added it to my Audible account. :)"
62,isfj,"I know I'm late. But how do you deal with the multitasking aspect of nursing? Like dealing with a lot of patients. Also, how do you deal with confrontational type situations that can occur with patients? "
63,isfj,"That actually sounds fun solely because it does sound stimulating. I’ve had a hint of consideration for computer science, actually. But then I convince myself those dumb ideas like- I’m too old, I don’t have the resources to start over, etc. I suppose my biggest issue is mindset. Glad you’ve found something that’s right for you! :)"
64,isfj,You sound like you’re using your Ne in a very healthy way! Going down multiple paths vs having one set linear life path is something I’m a fan of. Appears to make life more exciting. :) how was being an EMT? I’d crumble under that kind of stress! :p
65,isfj,"Indeed, yes. A lot of them feel like they can't figure out their purpose, so of course they can't tell what their life plan should be..
Although now that I say it I don't think this is quite the same as in ISFJ. I don't think you feel a lack of meaning?"
66,isfj,"Yeah it was way too stressful, having someone’s life in your hands and all of the crazy medical conditions that I can never unsee. I only lasted 2 years in the profession. It did make me realize that I love helping people so I just kept trying different ways to do it.
Two of those jobs I only did in the military. Really appeals so Si.  I was in and out of the military. So I definitely do use Ne a lot. Don’t regret it at all"
67,isfj,"I need your insight on this one.
So, I met this guy who is not really similar to the usual kind of guys I go for - I usually like men that are direct, assertive, and always the center of attention. This guy is quiet, but not really shy. He's got a lot of really strong values and he works in a managerial position. He doesn't lack confidence - he just prefers listening to talking, I think. He just considers his words so carefully that his feelings are kind of hard to guess.
When we met, we were on a retreat with a lot of other people, so we very rarely got a chance to talk alone. When we did, though, it was really intense. I can't explain it. UGH I've got it so bad. Anyway, I was pretty sure he was interested because I caught him staring at me quite a lot, and after he caught me staring he started finding reasons to come sit near me for meals and whatnot. When we were all leaving, he came up to my car (even though he was on the clock and should have been working) and helped me load it. Then we had a lingering hug, and I kissed him on the cheek. He smiled really big and said about 400 times that he'd definitely email me before going back to work.
Normally, I would have been much more direct and flirtatious with him, but I wasn't fully broken up with my boyfriend at the time, and I got the sense that ISFJ guy would have really been turned off by that. I don't think he knows that I was going through a breakup at the time.
It took him 2 weeks to email me! I waited a few days before replying just because I didn't want to look desperate. That was 6 days ago.
At this point, no one has had the balls to state our feelings. We're just having a platonic email conversation. I'm thinking maybe he doesn't want to verbalize that he's attracted to me, but isn't sure what else to say? Maybe he's hesitant to address these feelings because we live a couple of hours apart and things could get complicated?
Should I be the one to bring that stuff up? I'm usually really direct, but I'm afraid to be direct because I'm not sure he's interested.
I just don't understand this kind of thinking - I can't wait for shit. I sample all my food in the car before I get home from the grocery. I used to sneak downstairs at night, carefully open my Xmas gifts, look at them, and then re-tape them. What is he doing while I'm checking my email every 10 minutes? Has he just moved on to greener pastures?
I'm just so puzzled. Is something I'm doing making him uncomfortable? Will being direct making him less uncomfortable, or more uncomfortable?"
68,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ guy... I can relate to your ISFJ male friend. I'm sure he's a bit hesitant to fully express his feelings to you (he's an introvert, don't forget that).
In my case, it took nearly 3 years to express my love to a university course mate. I tried to make it as diplomatically as possible whenever I communicated. I didn't want to make her pressured to accept me out of pity or for any kind of reasons other than love. I was really considerate on her choices, I encouraged her to hold the ""driving wheel"" rather than being passive in our interactions. I listened to her a lot because I like to know the state of her feelings.
I gave her a simple but difficult choice to choose from: ""Yes"" or ""No"" to our relationship.
She chose ""No"" but gave me a possibility of a ""Yes"" in the future. Well, sadly, I doubted that a ""Yes"" will happen. She couldn't accept me because she needs to love herself first. Then, she listed all her flaws that she thought that might cripple our relationship in the long run.
I promised to accept her choices and pray for her well being and her future relationship.
Now, only time can heal my emotional wound (still a work in progress)... I can't blame her, it's expected in a relationship.
My advices to you: encourage him to talk to you more, make it really obvious that you're into him, tell him that you accept him for what he is.
I wish you good luck and hope everything will turn out well for you. :)"
69,isfj,"Thanks for the reply! As an INTP, I appreciate the rational approach you took. It seems like something he'd do, too. I'm an introvert, but most people think I'm an extrovert because I'm a performer and I tend to talk people's ears off. That role exhausts me, though, so I don't like to do it much. That's one of my concerns - one of the things I've liked about dating extroverts is that they take that pressure off of me in social situations. On the flip side, though, it would be nice to sit at home with someone on a Saturday night who wouldn't rather be at a noisy bar."
70,isfj,"Hello all,
I (an INTJ female) have liked this individual who works at my office (an ISFJ male) for quite some time. I've asked him for coffee once but he declined my request, stating that he didn't want to have a work-related conflict of interest.
I'm wondering if I was too direct in my request. I'd still like to get to know him and see if a friendship develops, but I'm stumped on how to go forward. How can I approach this from a different angle?
Thanks in advance babes"
71,isfj,"That doesn't sound like you were too direct, but he's clearly not interested. Pursuing a friendship at this point would likely be awkward, as you've already made it clear that you like him as more than ""just a friend.""
I would count my losses and move on, personally."
72,isfj,"Could be too direct, maybe caught him off guard. I would say try to keep it casual as friends for now, maybe try to engage with him more at work when it's appropriate, like maybe have lunch together, something like that. Invite him to do something (and clearly express that it is as friends only) outside of work sometime in the future after he's more comfortable with you. I dunno, tricky situation, ISFJ often like to follow the rules and dislike potential confrontation, so he may consider the whole thing off limits, hard to say tbh. Edited to add: If he keeps giving you excuses, he may not be interested but does not want to tell you directly. In that case, I agree with the other commenter that it's probably best to move on. Good luck!"
73,isfj,"I didn't know until I (very recently, actually) found out about my type that I absolutely hate being interrupted while in the middle of something. As random as that is, it really made me appreciate being able to complete a task from beginning to end uninterrupted! I've read many descriptions specifically for ISFJ that have stated this personality type hates conflict and longs to feel needed, and both of those traits seem to check out too. No matter how hard I try to not give a shit if someone doesn't like me, it still bothers me deep down. 
The descriptions I have come to find of isfj's kind of make us sound like a bunch of emotional softies, (true for me for sure, but that's still harsh!), but some things I feel proud of are having the need and will to care for and/or help others, having an outstanding work ethic, and the urge to be prompt (otherwise put, very punctual/on time.) "
74,isfj,"not isfj but from the isfjs irl I've met: good at remembering events related to people, tend to have good morals (not drama causing attention-seekers like esfps nor manipulative as esxjs), loyal to those they trust (not back-stabbing), plan stuff and do it (less likely to procrastinate), good at reading people (detecting indirect messages), caring (will mean it, not fake it to gain from others) etc. I really like you isfjs but your type finds entps annoying lol"
75,isfj,"This is a super long winded explanation and some of it might be more reflective of my friend rather than isfj's in general.  She's quite and serine unless you get to know her well. Afterwards she becomes something else entirely. Awkward stoicism turns into being a fully emotional and confident person. She has a hard time remembering to be logical and this translates into a lot of lost arguments and also a hard time explaining to people why she is upset when it is happening. She tends to overreact and she knows it so when she gets emotional and can’t get across why she is really upset and instead blows up irrationally until the other persons gets upset because of how irrational she is being. Instead of going through this process she holds in her emotions rather than having to deal with the aftermath of what amounts to a adult temper tantrum. Its not as bad as that makes it sound. Under the surface of all those emotions she always has a good reason for being upset she just can’t seem to say it. She is extremely punctual when she see’s got a good reason to be. She likes list and color coating, organizing and structure. She is afraid sometimes that she is broken because she likes to connect everything going wrong in her life together with thin connections and works herself up and gets depressed and cries a lot (this has to do with Ne being at the bottom of the stack i think). When she gets in these states it’s like she thinks that she has come to a full understanding of the world and the conclusion is that it sucks, even when the reality is very far from that she convinces herself for that moment that everything is horrible. Almost using that as a coping mechinism, like a prepare for the worst philosophy. She also has an obsession with people thinking that she is selfish. She is actually can be a pretty selfish person but not in the way she thinks she is. She has a hard time seeing past the way she is feeling about a situation even if there's a good reason to have caused some conflict. Logic will almost never break through to her when she is emotionally affected by a situation in which she feels that she has been left out or forgotten. She thinks if you are being logical that theirs is no way to understand what she is trying to say which is correct because what she is saying in that situation is that her feelings got hurt and when you try and rationalize it you are giving her an answer that she doesn’t care about. She doesn’t care why you weren’t there, she cares that you weren’t there. She is extremely loyal to a point and then will drop you like you are hot if she feels you are going to leave her. She either cares a lot or not at all(or so she wants people to think), maybe because it would be to emotionally draining for her to kind of care. "
76,isfj,"Oh my goodness, this is me! I usually consider myself even-tempered and can hide my emotions pretty well, but I have a hard time masking my frustration when I'm interrupted during a task. It gets even worse because I spend at least 75% of my work time interrupting myself with stuff like reddit... it's what I'm doing now.
I am an INTJ, though. Maybe it's a trait we share, or maybe one of us is mistyped, or maybe it's just independent of MBTI types?"
77,isfj,"My ex-gf was always impressed at how well I was able to remember our earliest dates, even years later. I'm proud of that.
ENTP is the dual for ISFJ (or ISFp) in Socionics. At least that's what I've been told. I remember that because I kept giggling at ""Ent pee."""
78,isfj,"THIS is what I came to this sub to find! Thank you so much. I have been looking high and low for someone, ANYone who is like my partner. We've searched through the MBTI types to try to find out ways in which we can better communicate and understand each other. She relates so closely to a lot of ISFJ characteristics, especially the fact that ISFJ sees things abstractly and has trouble explaining things in universally understood ways. It's talked about clearly in this video, but your comment made it all the more clear.
There are many things that she does not relate to in the ISFJ category. She is NOT punctual, at all! I used to be very punctual, usually early, and when I was not early or on time, it was a carefully planned lateness. My ISFJ partner will hear me say that we have to leave at 9:30, and she'll begin her 15+ minute prep time at 9:27. I've seen punctuality listed as an ISFJ trait in so many places, but she is absolutely not that.
Quick question: does this video remind you of your friend at all? My partner relates to this quite a bit, and it sounds like your friend might too. Kind of like she is an ISFJ with Borderline tendencies? This is her profile from 16Personalities. The ""strength"" of her personality type is ""turbulent"" rather than ""assertive,"" which could account for the difficulties she has (as well your friend)."
79,isfj,"Yeah that's right. Im an ENTP and my best friend is an isfj but it is definitly a relationship that has taken time to develop. We balance each other out well at our best and at our worst we basically want to kill each other. It's like each of us has the power to highlight the thing that the other is the worst at in life. But in all fairness, its much more likely for the ENTP to start the shit. We get bored easily and messing with people is fun. "
80,isfj,"Yeah, this video definitely sounds like her. It's interesting you say she isn't punctual because my friend is only punctually when she really feels like there is a need. I am a lot more consistently punctual than her. My interpretation of that has always been an extension of their ""organized"" personality rather than an end all be all trait of them. Just out of curiosity, what type are you?"
81,isfj,"Why are all the INFJ's appreciative and find meaning and value in my posts but so many of the ISFJ's are really resistant?  I've just tried to be honest and open and have been very complimentary and positive about the ISFJ (besides yesterday, lol).  Either way...thank you for your support."
82,isfj,"It's working now..
She IS SO ADORABLE!!! You are really a lucky guy! 
It's hard to believe that this is the person you spoke about in the first post.
Seeing her rekindled everything that I like about ISFJs (esp. the blonde ones).
​
You should shave. I remember speaking with an ISFJ and appearance (impressions really; aesthetic crispness) means a lot to them. I'm sure you would know your wife's preferences better than anyone, but as an IxFJ (If there is an consolation) appealing to our unexpressed desires are huge. 
Just try it, I think you'll be amazing at her response. 
​
Ask your wife if she likes Flynt Ryder (Disney's Tangled)!
​
Have you both taken the Love Languages test? I have seen that for most ISFJs, Words of Affirmation is their top one.
​
I may come off as some psychologist or counselor, that's probably because I counsel students (mostly women) a lot; I'm actually a political Science major.
​"
83,isfj,"You know how to cook or take a shower, at least, right ?
That is self care. Do the laundry and clean your home, and you'll have the actual basics.
It's really about taking care of your basic physical needs, so the way you do that don't much matter as long as it's done well. You need dishes done, not a dishwasher, after all.
The other half of that advice that may interest you far more is how to deal with doing those tasks even though they are unrewarding for everyone.
It's about discipline. You schedule a time to do those tasks, and do them no matter what, until it becomes automated and systematic."
84,isfj,"I rarely make lists because I am lazy and feel like it's a lot of work. However, I have found that if I want to be really productive, I need to make a list. Even if it's the most minuscule things that I need to do, I write it down and then go through and do the list easiest to hardest. Crossing things off of my list gives me a high. What helps you get productive?"
85,isfj,"i make lists as well.
another way is to tie the thing i have to do with a person. the obligation makes it hard to skip.
there are a few responsibilities i've gotten down to an automatic reflex. turning them into habits i don't even have to tell myself i need to do.
those methods work best but i've been really trying to work toward cementing a lifestyle of ""you do things because you want to"" and it's hard but i'm making progress. 
i'd be so amazing if i can just do stuff that are hard without thinking ""this sucks""! and take needed breaks/downtime without thinking ""i'm lazy and should be doing something""! both hard stuff and rest times become equally exciting and wanted because they're all steps toward my goals. i'm like 20-30% there."
86,isfj,"I'm not really good with lists because I find that I get more preoccupied with finding tasks (important or otherwise) to add to list than I am with actually completing the things on said list.
Making schedules, on the other hand, has worked out really well for me. Like from x hour to y hour, I'll do task 1, then a little break after and then the next task. I think this helps me because I can see a definitive ""end"" to when I can stop doing a task I don't particularly like, if that makes sense. And it's also an extra thing to hold me accountable otherwise I'll spend hours upon hours being useless in bed. It takes slightly longer to plan out than a regular list but I'm definitely more productive if I have a schedule.
Also turning off/hiding my phone. I am obsessed with my phone (not sure if that's an ISFJ thing or just a me a thing) and will check it every two minutes which can be a huge hindrance to productivity haha"
87,isfj,"I've never had a girlfriend, i've had a girl hold my hand before, and I was so shocked and freaked out at the experience she thought I didn't like her and ""broke up"" with me my Senior year in high school.  Though I have a lot of close friends, many times I cringe when people hug me. I absolutely hate to be touched, I'll hug people so I won't be socially stigmatized. Then don't get me started on kissing. When I see people kissing and holding hands it grosses me out. I know it shouldn't. I hope to get a girlfriend one day, but all the touching involved makes me anxious. Then don't get me started on intercourse. Having someones hot, sweaty body against yours, no thanks. How can I get over this?
A friend of mine suggested a sex surrogate or something similar but I would be too embarrassed to go."
88,isfj,"Generally, I don't like people I am not close to touching me in any way.
That thing where some vague acquaintance will put their hand on the small of your back to direct you or pass you - that triggers an instant anger response and makes me want to literally rip their hand off (red head - I have a bit of a temper sometimes)
But for people I'm close to it's a non issue, although I'm more likely to initiate when I've had a few drinks
I'm not so sure that what you're experiencing is related so much to introversion - your anxiety may well just be down to inexperience which is perfectly natural, most people are nervous before their first kiss, date, sex etc
Just make sure that when you have your firsts - it's with someone you are comfortable with!
Even then you might find you're not into the physical affection thing, which is fine, but anxiety should be saved for firsts"
89,isfj,"I think if you meet someone you like enough that you won't feel uncomfortable by the touching. First few kisses and etc and you will be able to relax. You should try practicing by hugging family members and friends. The more practice, the better it gets. Feeling the warmth of touch can be very healing and comforting! You are missing out on one of life's great treasures :)
I'm not an overly affectionate person. When people try and do the greeting where they kiss each side of your cheeks. It weirds me out and I try and pull away as much as possible to avoid full contact :P I hate it when strangers bump into me. Especially if they aren't apologetic about it. I'm like .. ""you see THIS .. this is my personal space DONOT invade it :P "" If I'm sitting on the bus. I will have my ass hanging off the seat in order to not touch the stranger beside me. I don't care if I fall off as it goes around the corner.
Practice makes perfect. I have kids now and have absolutely no problem hugging the crap out of them and slobbering them with kisses :D"
90,isfj,"There's an appropriate time and place for it.  During intimacy?  Sure (unless two people have the emotional height of a potato and then its just purely out of mechanized duty, then you'll have some of the most unsatisfying post-coital awkwardness).  After seeing a close friend / family member after a long time?  Maybe, depends on the person.  In public?  Holy shit I wish people exercised a little more tact.
There's a good chance you'll become more comfortable with the idea as you mature, and you'll find it'll be the people you consider worthwhile and important.  I entirely understand what you mean by social stigma's.  Our choices are often directed by social structures.  I'm not one to turn down a hug if somebody is moving towards me, arms outward.  I probably don't want it to happen, but I'd feel bad saying no thanks.  I've learned to be a bit more selfish, because you'll find that other people often don't care.
Then again I'm gay so my social identity in terms of gender are pretty skewed. "
91,isfj,"For me it's an intimacy thing. In general I don't have much issue with physical contact (e.g. in day-to day life, like being squished next to someone on the subway). But when it comes to intimacy such as hand-holding or kissing, I've got to REALLY be into that person. Otherwise it feels like I'm sharing a part of myself with someone who hasn't (yet) earned it. For example, one night some girls wanted to play a kissing game with me, and I strongly refused. Do you relate at all?"
92,isfj,"Just a general ""what's up?""
This morning I woke up and cuddled with my boyfriend, vaped, played a few games of League of Legends... Now I'm about to start cleaning the bedroom and then studying for my exam on Monday. I'll probably end the night by by watching some Let's Plays of Rimworld or Prison Architect on Youtube."
93,isfj,"Man, today has been a busy day!
Woke up early this morning, anxious to try out my brand new coffee grinder. I was not disappointed. Then I had to run into the office for a meeting(on a Saturday, ugh. But they served free breakfast, so that kind of made up for it). Stopped by my parent's place and visited with them for a bit. I also got to see my beloved little dog. After that, I hit up the gym and burned off some of those kolache calories from earlier this morning. Now here I am typing this. I'm getting ready to start doing my laundry. Whilst the laundery is laundering, I'm going to boot up Attilla: Total War and pillage some pathetic barbarian tribes just to the south of me. Finally, I plan on ending my night by indulging in some alcoholic beverages while playing League of Legends with some of my buds.
All in all, I think it will be a good day."
94,isfj,Slept in late which is one of my favorite things about the weekends. Cleaned the apartment while watching some that 70s show and getting high. Now I'm sitting in the shop about to finally get started on my next tattoo and I'm super excited about our
95,isfj,"I picked up some overtime hours this morning before my regular shift, then grabbed a couple groceries on the way home.  Now I'm browsing reddit and trying to convince myself I'm not hungry, as it's day 2 of my diet."
96,isfj,"Mmm coffee, I also had some of that today. And nice about going to the gym... I was thinking about going today and you motivated me a bit more to actually go haha.
Are you a fan of ARAMs or do you play mostly normals? I'm always looking for more aram-centric friends haha, normals are just a bit stressful for me so I tend not to play them unless I'm playing with a full group of my friends."
97,isfj,"Do it, go to the gym! Working out has definitely been one of the best hobbies I have picked up.
I'm more of a normals person. I like it being competitive. I have a couple of friends I play with, and usually we will queue up 3v3 games. It's lots of fun! I usually only play once a week, though. I don't really have time to play during the week any more, unfortunately :("
98,isfj,"^Backstory: From what I know, she's been in a bad (unfulfilled) relationship for years and I've known her since, but we never made an effort for any close contact. Recently I chatted her up and we may meet in a couple of weeks for lunch.
I am very oblivious when it comes to stuff like this and know everyone is different and mbti just goes so far, but are there any quirks isfj's do that could help me differ in what direction this may be going?"
99,isfj,"As an ISFJ I'd probably try to initiate a conversation about her deep emotions and try and let her open up. However don't be too forceful as it is very hard to try and talk about yourself, for an ISFJ."
100,isfj,"Even if an ISFJ is in a shitty relationship, and she were to meet her perfect man... she would still cling to her past. Never underestimate the inertia of an ISFJ relationship. Assume she is, for all intents and purposes, married.
At any rate, IxFJ's can get along very well with IxTP's. As an INTP myself, I'm very fond of them."
101,isfj,"Wouldn't that be a bit blunt after the first date, espc. since she's in a relationship? Even though I feel she might not be happy in it. ^edit: How can I help her leave a bad relationship?
I just don't want to scare her off"
102,isfj,"I'm sucker for nostalgia and therefor past loves, too. Even though it would probably be a different reason for an ISFJ... Well she's not married. We in Europe don't marry that quick
Same here; she's the first ISFJ I know. Totally loving in charming, so easy to fall in love with"
103,isfj,"If she's in a relationship, don't bother.
Most, if not all ISFJs I've ever known (myself included) aren't likely to leave their relationships, regardless of how unhappy they may seem in it. 
ISFJs especially tend to value fidelity and commitment. In my opinion, it's highly unlikely she'd be willing to leave her current partner for you, even if she is interested.
If I ever had people coming onto me when I was in a relationship (especially if they knew I wasn't single), I found it extremely off-putting, and I didn't really want to hang out with them afterwards."
104,isfj,"Then im fucked I guess..I had a chance to have my best friend(she is isfj, im infp) as girlfriend...I loved her..I was just too scared to put it on another level...I think she liked me too...I even think it would work out..But I was so scared...Ive waited for too long and now she has Bf. Even though she doesnt love him and she complained to me all the time(not now ), she never wanted to end it. :( And I am sure he doesnt want as well..I am an idiot. I missed my chance...How could I be so dumb. What if they will like marry one time :( oh jeez.
Im sorry for completely unrelated answer :/ just wanted to type it out"
105,isfj,"So I've recently went into the MBTI and I enjoy reading about people that indentify themselves with some certain types.
I've ran into the 'Fuck Marry Kill (MBTI Edition)' thread and I've noticed that ISFJs are the most killable ones out of the types I've checked (ISFJ, ESFJ, ESTP, ISTP, INFJ, INTJ).
Obviously as a isfj, I shouldn't, but I've started worrying. It kind of fits to my recent view how people can like me in general, but my boyfriend (ESTP) is not comfortable with me being close with people.
I'd like you to tell me what could I do to jokingly make myself less 'killable' in the eyes of other people?"
106,isfj,"My best friend is an isfj, and im an infp.
In my experience most people have little to no understanding of isfjs, they are maybe the most misunderstood type in mbti. everyone is judging them from an image based solely on stereotypes and when i read most descriptions they are inaccurate by a landslide.
Any qualms i have about her are enneagram related.
You guys are great, stay focused on your true identity and not ignorant peoples opinions"
107,isfj,"The kindest way I've learned to put it is:
Understand that you are great as you are. You have family and friends that care about you. You are someone who dedicates a lot of effort to do things for the benefit of others. And that makes you awesome.
And though there is nothing wrong with wanting to improve yourself, understand that all improvements you strive for are just that, improvements. They are extra added onto something already great.
If we can understand that, we become a lot more tolerable."
108,isfj,"ENTJ here.  Just ending contact with an ISFJ that had a strong crush on me.  Things could've worked out between us — but she just couldn't be honest with me, she just couldn't stop being manipulative in conversation tipping the topics in my favour just to keep me interested.  She just wouldn't follow up on things she would promise to do with me, she just wouldn't realise my directness informing her to be herself, to be real, that I don't judge…  You guys know the rest.  
You want to be better?  Talk to people who need direct talk, directly.  Be yourself.  Don't lie for any reason.  I've learned to walk away from SFs in general unless they're very mature.  "
109,isfj,"Stop worrying about stupid internet crap ?
Fuck/Marry/Kill is an idiotic sexist impossible choice game. Make a better use of your time by providing to yourself.
Only then you'll see you weren't even ""killable"" in the first place."
110,isfj,Isfjs who learn to be honest about how they feel are by far my favorite type like the isfjs I know are usually so obsessed with maintaining harmony that I can't believe that they actually care about me as much as they care about the idea of me not disliking them however the one or two isfjs I can trust are like literally perfect and I love them - random entp guy 
111,isfj,"I love how you put that about improvement. I used to have that bad perception that if I wanted to improve then it means that I am not good enough, which took away my self worth. It seems easy to understand that it's not like this, but it took some time for me to get it. Now I'm not afraid of self-improvement anymore! "
112,isfj,"Oh jeez, I used to do this with guys "
113,isfj,"It is hard to pretend to care about others if you actually don't.  Just think about how much you appreciate when others actually want to get to know and learn about you.  Then think you can make someone's day like that... if they don't want to talk, well that's okay.  Don't take it personally.. they could have been having a bad day/week that is entirely out of your control."
114,isfj,"Extroverted feeling is a function that I either don't have in my stack at all or just don't match with its stereotypical description.
Most sources describe a high Fe-user as the ""nurturer"" or an overprotective mom. Stereotypes of not only all 16 types can be misleading, but I think particularly so for I/ESFJs, which pigeonholes us into brainless sheep that exist only to serve others. Like C-3PO and protocol droids in Star Wars. Or Alfred Pennyworth of Batman, a butler and manservant of the main hero.
How do you all who have high Fe use it in your life? How does it manifest? Do you feel it is close to the typical way it is portrayed, or is it different?"
115,isfj,"Manifests as my emotions being directly affected by external sources. If I see someone sad, I wonder what I could do to help them. If I cause a smile, I become very happy. I really cherish the few friendships I have, and would do pretty much anything for them (short of hurting an innocent person). I think I am a pretty competent judge of how people are feeling, although not so much as good a judge at what they are thinking (I suspect a lot of false thoughts that aren't there and am overly anxious I have upset someone, working on that).
I reeeeeally don't like making people sad. If I do, even if I was mad at them (very rare lol) I instantly start trying to make them feel better... ""Oh, well... I wasn't really THAT mad... come on, it's okay, don't be sad. I was just over-reacting..."" blah blah blah. 
I don't only exist to serve others... but I really enjoy serving others, so I guess I'd just have to ask, ""Why shouldn't I serve others if it makes me happy to do so?""
Obviously everyone has a bad day sometimes, and I can be bitchy... usually only to those I am close enough to trust myself being bitchy around if that makes sense. I wouldn't confide all my sad thoughts to a stranger, I'd put on a fake smile and pretend everything is okay. But if I trust someone, that means that I know they can handle my craziness so I will let them know how I really feel and want to be comforted."
116,isfj,"This is kind of unrelated, but those stereotypes might be what drives me from the mbti. Makes me sad and frustrated to be called shallow, boring, and everyone's mom. ""I love ISFJs because they listen and are nice to me even though they are too dumb to understand or have their own creative ideas"" was a recent topic this sub. I'm not your dog ffs. 
The mbti structure has really invaded my thought process, which makes it hard to get it out of my life though. "
117,isfj,"In general I really try to avoid conflict as much as possible, even if I really want to argue something I'm afraid I may hurt someone feelings by potentially getting too heated in an argument. Before making big decisions I like to consult with at least 1 person I'm comfortable with the topic about. When trying new games/hobbies I try to make sure I know people or good communities already exist and really want to be a big part of them."
118,isfj,"I couldn't have described it any better, everything you said is exactly how I feel, too. 
My emotions are easily influenced by the emotions of people around me, especially if I really care about them. So naturally, I care about making sure everyone around me is content, even if it means pushing my own feelings aside a little bit, because in the end, if they're happy, it makes me happy too. "
119,isfj,"You know, it is so ingrained in mine too. 
I read statistics that ISFJs and ESFJs are supposed to be the most common, yet the internet is flooded with the seemingly most rare of the types. As I go through threads on here and on other related forums, it's pretty disgusting how outright nasty some people's blanket perceptions are of sensors, especially SJs.
I get so disillusioned with the system, and yet I keep coming back. "
120,isfj,"Phew. It's nice to know I'm not the only one who feels this way. 
I think the bias reinforces itself too. I bet many rare types are their sensor counterparts, but since everyone learns that sensors are all boring and stupid, they think they couldn't possibly be one. Then in their discussion with the community, they extend the definition of intuiting to include their strengths as well. So the definition of sensing and intuiting becomes:
N: smart, creative, individualistic, artistic, visionary, insightful
S: only aware of what is immediately in front of them in the physical world, spits out memorized facts and ideas with pavlovian instinct- good at remembering birthdays and crafts
How many people want to think of themselves as just that? I think this is also why there are so many ways people describe intuiting, but sensing is almost always described as: ""present in the here and now"" or ""concerned with concrete ideas."" I keep reading these phrases over and over and I wonder if people have even thought about what they might mean as the primary experiential method of a person."
121,isfj,"I think it's bias on top of bias with a side of bias.
Being ""nerdy"" I.e. Te or Ti is cool right now, and so anyone coming for the first time is going to want to type either Intp or INTJ.  Those are the classic nerd types, and thanks to the STEM push, everyone wants to be a nerd.  Then the tests are IMO, way too obvious with what the right answers are to get any type you want.  Plus they over emphasize N.  So 90% of intX types are completely wrong, but like the projection of nerd, especially since most descriptions available turn IN into ""smart"".  "
122,isfj,"Idk about others, but I tend to invest a tad bit too much emotion. Okay, who am I kidding. I invest A LOT of emotion and attachment it's not even funny. Then, I get friendzoned and shit hurts like Hell.
No one's ever told me they love me in a romantic way. My ex-best friend did, but only as a friend, but we're not friends anymore, so what the hell. But, to answer your question... I'd probably freeze, blink a couple times, and basically go blue screen of death tryna figure if the person truly meant it and what the fuck would happen henceforth."
123,isfj,"I'm a female ENFP in love with a male ISFJ. We're in the same university club, and it's a small group in a small classroom, so when I'm talking (really loudly) to my friend he tends to overhear and replies to whatever I'm talking about. However, he doesn't say ""hi"" to me if he sees me (and I'm too shy to say hi first) and he doesn't go out of his way to talk to me either. Is there a chance? 
Also, since male ISFJs are quite rare, could you guys tell me more about yourselves? :D"
124,isfj,"Male Isfj here: 
When I meet someone, I always take it slow. Trust is ESSENTIAL for me, and building it takes time. We isfjs respond warmly most of the time when someone else initiates a conversation, but we are not always likely to do it ourselves. Relationships take time in our eyes. 
For me personally, the most important part of who I am is someone who actively tried to help and comfort others when they have problems. Being able to be there for someone brings me joy like nothing else can. I know many isfjs are the same. 
Just know that isfjs are not going to take things fast in terms of relationships most of the time. "
125,isfj,"How could you be 'in love' when you haven't really talked to him one-on-one?  It sounds more like infatuation, to me.  Make an excuse to talk to him about a project/assignment.  If he's as shy as I think he may be, however, it will be a difficult task getting him to initiate, as all men should.  
I really appreciate others showing interest in me, but I find it difficult to talk about myself, as it makes me feel pompous.  I also often overanalyze things, especially interactions after the fact.  If you can get him to open up through the painful, but necessary, small talk, it should be smooth sailing.  Try to do it when it is only the two of you, as I find it difficult to talk in groups sober (as you should be at school).
Also keep in mind extroverts and introverts don't make great lovers but I'm sure that has no bearing on you at this point.  Infatuation is infatuation.  Good luck."
126,isfj,"His hair is always on point, he consistently dresses well, he records entire videos just from memory (good Si). There's an element of snarkiness in his videos (inferior Fi). He spits out a lot of Te facts. He lacks the kind of impulsive energy a lead Se or Ne user would have. He has said, in regards to Fi blind spot, something along the lines of 'yeah we're all sociopaths or whatever' which does not make sense, since if you're blind to something you aren't able to even recognise it as a weakness in yourself. It's other people that look at ENTP's and think 'is this guy a sociopath or something'. From an ENTP perspective, a lack of Fi just means a lack of personal bias.  The aim is to be as impartial as possible.
Oh and the fact that he had a semi-negative view of ISFJ's which from a socionics point of view (duality relation ENTP -ISFJ) also doesn't really make sense"
127,isfj,"My study habits consist of lots of writing and drawing, I'm horrible at art tho so I  just do what I can, but I'm very visual in learning. I need to see it in my head and it will stick . Like when I had to learn how the heart pumps, I could not for the life of me listen or read and just get it I had to physically see the heart pumping blood in  my head and I got it . Also making little inside jokes on things helps me get it too when I was in anatomy learning muslces was a challange for me so I would come up with things that sounded similar and funny so I would remember , example : Tensor Fasciae Latae muscle I would always have it in my head like tense up for fish latte , still laugh every time , I'm just weird like that but hey if I understand it in the end it works :P "
128,isfj,"If you're trying to absorb information, the best method is repeated testing! Recalling information over and over again strengthens those pathways in the brain, making future recall even easier. Source: INTJ in grad school for psych"
129,isfj,"Spaced repition, finding the best book resource and many many notes (important is to make them creative, f. ex. graphs, drawings). Simply make studying fun, be in constant pursue of new knowledge. The more brain regions you activate, the bigger ammount of facts you remember. 
Also remember about your mental and physical health, so do not cram, please! :)
You do not have learn 5 hours single day at a start. When I have been starting, I studied for 30 minutes and then took a break (reading a pleasant book for example). I do this also now, but with an app called Forest, it is fantastic!
Strive for knowledge!
Fingers crossed :)"
130,isfj,"""Various opinion polls have shown that the greatest invention of the twentieth century the invention of the pill, because people can love when they pleased, because women no longer fear that they will become pregnant. Wonder tablet have brought sexual and indirectly, economic independence, so they can compete for better jobs and no longer fainted when they saw a mouse - were no longer dependent on male stereotypes about women. Thanks to contraception have entered into a contractual relationship. The emancipation of women is actually a paradox of imparting a freedom because women requires more and more responsibilities and duties. What they once represented as a great social achievement and privilege today they are experiencing as a form of oppression."" (Europeana: A Brief History of the Twentieth Century by Patrik Ouredník)
A price of freedom? ""Glorious"" capitalism; crazy feminism!
(What do you think?)"
131,isfj,"ISFJ here; I think I would agree with the article. It's absolutely a more philosophical take on the subject (""what invention has created the most societal progress"" vs ""what's the coolest thing we've made in terms of sheer science"") but I can definitely see where they're coming from and agree. For a long time in our society, childbearing and rearing have been huge obstacles to women becoming more prominent members of society. 
Which isn't to say that it's impossible to do anything great if you have kids, far from it, but it does make working and studying far more difficult, particularly if it's difficult to control how many children you have or when you have them. It's provided women with not only more sexual freedom, but also more financial autonomy and therefore the ability to pursue any career or field of study that they want without having to worry about children. I think women (who are a full half of the population who previously had a much more difficult time making their voices heard in things like business and science, not to mention that they also often provide a different point of view on things than men) having more choice over if and when they have children has been a huge contributor to much of the progress we've been making in the 20th and 21st centuries, so I would say even if hormonal contraception isn't the most obviously ""wow"" invention, it's probably one of the most impactful. 
(Not to mention that hormonal birth control can be extremely helpful in treating a variety of women's health issues, not just controlling pregnancy.) "
132,isfj,"Wow, I never thought of birth control pills as one of the greatest inventions... I always hear ""sliced bread"" haha...
After thinking about it, I kind of agree though. Many great inventions of the past almost seem detrimental today (in terms of reducing the work people had to do through mechanization = eventually less work for people to do... automobiles/quick transportation = greenhouse gas emissions/temps rising... better weapons/stealth equipment = less ""personal"" fighting/easier to kill?). We've had lots of progress, but look where we are today..."
133,isfj,"ENxP, here.
I think it's the Internet. It has a bigger place in my life.
I think women are more free, not because to phoney pharmaceutical blessings, but because they are enlightened by mankind's knowledge and intelligence. (M'lady. Tip fedora) Thanks to communication and free sharing of knowledge, than anything concrete."
134,isfj,"hehe, how polite! :D And thank you for your oninion; I personally do not share the author's opinion on the pill and therefore your answer is more appealing (if we divide humans into two larger subgroups by sex and compare historically) - the opening of higher education to women was a great move (it is not the invention thou, this should be a different topic) to broaden women's knowledge and assure it is not held like a monopol in just men's heads. XD 
Not to my surprise internet is in the lead so far; but I posted it in the introverted type subreddits. I want to see the different (or similar) results and compare."
135,isfj,"Which is obviously impossible, because pegs and rounds. Both sex are meant to work together. I don't understand this little box logic.
That was what our mothers and grandmothers wanted for themselves and their daughter. I don't think having my sexual organs out of my abdomen really prevent me to understand where those ideas come from, and that it's also to my benefit, too, as it's for all mankind's benefit.
People don't believe in it because of the fear of the unknown and their own ignorance. It makes me sad.
Why such choice ? ENTPs have quite impressive insights to share, and be really happy to share them.
ENTJs are also a good choice for various reasons."
136,isfj,"Extroverts are next, don't worry. I just didn't have time to post it everywhere at once.
I agree, about the first part, but I am simplifying here. If I weren't I would write a novel simply because people, in general, are much more complex. yes. :P Burn the boxes, mbti box included :)"
137,isfj,"You must be an INFJ. I think ISFJs may tell you about respecting the status quo, and that the waves you make will punish everyone, yourself included. In a roundabout way, of course.
I know no introvert who want to challenge the status quo as much as INFJs. You guys want it down as much as ENTP do.
I should ask ENFPs, someday : I don't know if they want it down, too or feel conflicted."
138,isfj,"You know how to please me. I hate loving so much be praised. =D
ENFPs don't like debating as much as ENTPs do. I think I'll lurk a bit, just to measure the temperature. Basic anti involuntary troll measures. =P"
139,isfj,"I know I want things in my life, but I don’t how exactly I would go about doing that. Anything dependent on having someone else isn’t quite there.
Like I want to start a family but I can’t even find someone that’s interested in me romantically and etc.
I know I want to leave a legacy, but I don’t know exactly how I want to go about doing that. 
There aren’t definitive things you want out of life?"
140,isfj,"Been wanting a romantic partner since birth, too. Somewhere out there, she's got to be there.
It sucks, doesn't it? Wanting something, not having it, but should you ever have it, you don't know what to do with it."
141,isfj,"Here's my possible explanation. While we may have friends that love us, that love does not share the same quality and caliber of the love we give to them. It's reciprocated, we love them for it, yet it's still inadequate to fill our love tank so to speak. So then we desire a romantic partner subconsciously hoping maybe that partner will finally be able to match our brand of love. Someone we can go all-out loving and will respond in kind, will satisfy us."
142,isfj,"Hey everyone~
It's time for another discussion thread! Since it's now evening where I am, I decided it was time to post this. So, here we go. I guess you can just talk about anything you want. Let's all become friends here!
:)"
143,isfj,"For me personally, I work full time but also have three close friends I see regularly. One of them a few times a week on average, and the other two are a couple and we hang out maybe 3-4 times a month. I kind of want to change that, though.
Then I also volunteer for a local animal shelter and soon also for a social services organization in my community that helps low income families in need. :) I start the second one next week!
I also have a cat and several fish tanks. I also like to read, sometimes write, and occasionally do something artsy like paint. And I play Pokemon Go, which keeps me busy sometimes when it's not freezing cold out!
Right now I'm sitting on the couch watching Salvation. I'm in the middle of making Nanaimo bars, but I have to wait for the base mixture to cool before I can add the next layer!"
144,isfj,"Hello 
I am boring and my daily life basically amounts to:
-Eat cereal for breakfast
-Go to work
-Eat lunch
-Finish work
-eat dinner
-Play video games/watch anime/go on discord
-Sleep
On weekends swipe out work for more hobbies and maybe once every month or 2 hang out with friends
How are you guys?"
145,isfj,"Yay!!! I’m so excited that we’re doing this! 😇
Hi Everyone!
I’m a 22 year old ISFJ (F) & I guess the most interesting thing about me is I have Congenital Nystagmus (visual impairment). I have night blindness as well as horrible depth perception. It’s difficult for me to read 12 point font or to see license plates/street signs. With the technology of bi-optics I will be able to learn how to drive !!
I’m in my last year of my undergrad (Family Studies & Human Development with a minor in Psychology) & will hopefully be moving by this time next year to pursue my Masters degree. Once I’ve completed my schooling I would like to use my degree for Marriage & Family Therapy. 
Currently I am working on undergrad research with one of my professors on food & housing insecurity among college students.
For one of my Major classes I am working on developing some sort of workshop/training/career day that focuses on educating students K-12th grade on visual impairments as well as providing them with tools that they can use to advocate for accessibility for people with visual impairments (eventually I would love for this to focus around ALL disabilities, but since I am familiar with visual impairments...obviously lol...I started there)
There are still quite a bit of details to be hashed out, but this is the skeleton of my idea 😜
Moving on...
I have a cat who is about 14 years old & a red-eared slider turtle who is about 21 years old 🐢🐈💕
In a perfect world I’d own 5 cats, at least 2 dogs & a micro pig lol
FRIENDS is hands down my favorite show & I’m usually watching beauty or lifestyle related YouTube videos.
I’ve also been dating an INTP for 3 years
If you have any questions please feel free to ask :)"
146,isfj,"well hello there, I just woke up, and in my free time I like to ; read self help books, do skincare, read manga, be with my family and sometimes close childhood friends, be with my cat,, I like taking walks and exercise,, uwu. I am also trying to become better at reading non verbal cues!
do you ever think about how fart takes up such a big part of our lives?"
147,isfj,"Hello! I'm just a 18 year old ISFJ nearly out of high school. There's really nothing extreme to say about me, I'm a pretty average person. My daily routine is: wake up, get ready for school, go to school, come home, do homework,surf reddit/watch netflix (flash and arrow atm)/listen to music/talk in my discord communities/cuddle withy cat, eat dinner, and fall asleep very easily. 
I have a huge passion for music, especially edm. "
148,isfj,"I’m 24F, living with my INTP boyfriend in a different state than the one we grew up in. We both work full time. Some big changes came our way in the past two months, we had to get a new car (our old one was cost-prohibitive) and a new apartment, and he also is starting a new job. Things are changing a lot at once but we are making it work. We are celebrating our 12th anniversary next week! "
149,isfj,"I’m 22 years old and I’m graduating college this year. I have mixed feelings about graduating on one hand I’m glad to graduate college but on the other hand I’m going to miss all the fun times and friends I made in college. For fun, I mainly play video games and smoke weed haha. Oh my major is Accounting. "
150,isfj,"I’m a Romance junkie. 🙄😂 Me Before You is my all-time favorite and so far nothing has absolutely torn me apart yet made me long for more than that book. After You, the sequel, is great too. I otherwise try to read the books they have for free on Kindle. There’s some hidden gems in there, some not so much. You just never know until you try! What about you? u/variableidentifier "
151,isfj,"Yea hi everyone. This week i came back after two month of uninterest to MBTI subs. I love how this sub became more active, I love thread like this. Please make it regularly, admins!

152,isfj,"Also working on the non verbal cues! I'm fairly perceptive about things around me so as I've improved, I've gotten a lot better at reading people.
Omg that's such a random question 🤣 but it's true! We spend time making sure we don't fart in front of other people, when we should let it out, if it smells terrible, etc..."
153,isfj,"Hey I think my mom mentioned Me Before You! Perhaps I should acquire it. If I don't already have it... Which, I might, because she's constantly giving me books.
I have a Kindle unlimited subscription, I've found some great stuff in there. :) I like teen dystopian fiction/sci-fi and there's a ton of great stuff by smaller authors in there!"
154,isfj,"It kinda is. You don’t need to be harsh on yourself but when you are with someone in real life, it is kinda rude to be on your phone because you are ignoring their presence even though it’s temporary. 
It’s minor and most people don’t mind but you are right essentially. "
155,isfj,"I feel that way as well. As a result, I've instituted a ""phone box"" policy when I host parties. Ie, your phone goes in a box when you walk through the door and it stays there unless you actually need it for something"
156,isfj,"It's so cute though. For me it seems to help to talk about the past, or ask about what's up with other people. Not that I'm trying to be manipulative with my ISFJ, just sharing the things that seem to jump us out of Late Night Ne Hyperspace. Examples:
Her: ""OMG we could move to Spain! Seriously, we could do it!"" [Those convincing eyes...I'm watching my comfortable house begin to disappear as I sit in it]
Me: ""What's new with Trump?""
Her: ""OH MY GOSH. Did you hear about...""
OR
Her: ""Look, here are some people who live on a barge in the Great Salt Lake. What would our equivalent of that be?""
Me: ""When you were a kid, what kind of peanut butter did you get on your sandwiches?""
Her: ""Are you kidding me? We got the grossest brand ever, it was like..."" (long discussion about Mom ensues)"
157,isfj,"There must be some discrepancy between was each of us thinks Ne grip means. That or what I'm seeing isn't mbti related and more severe than can be addressed on Reddit.
Sadly, I'm thinking this is more and more the case. :/"
158,isfj,"Oh, I'm sure there are discrepancies. Sorry to hear it's an extreme case. If any type gets into extreme grip behavior, there are usually at least 2-3 of their ""letters missing"" from the situation, to use the simpler type model. Things aren't introverted / calm enough overall, or they don't feel physically well or comfortable, or they feel like their own feelings aren't being handled deftly, or they feel like they have little control over the situation. But I use type in a coaching environment and not in a therapeutic mental health environment, so someone like Naomi Quenk probably has better advice. Good luck."
159,isfj,"Then clean for her, you dork. You'll have none of her mental space if you do nothing to help her making some room for you.
Disregard her paranoid crap and find a way to bring her relief. Only then she'll see she can trust you with something. ISFJ are practical. Use it instead of dreading that trait."
160,isfj,"Hi! 
tl;dr:
I'm wondering a few things, and I'd be very thankful if you'd like to take the time to answer!

what is your prefered way of communicating your needs?
what makes you feel appreciated and loved, and how do you show other people love?

more detailed version:
The reason I'm asking is that I (enfp) am in a relationship with an isfj and while we suit each other well, there are a couple of hiccups that we have a hard time finding a solution to. So I thought I'd ask you and then check back in with him and see if any of it resonates with him. 
So far our biggest issues are:


Clashing love languages. He likes practical things, like doing stuff around the house, etc. I have ADHD, so cleaning and keeping things organized is hard for me because I constantly misplace stuff and forget about taking out the trash etc. I really do try, but I know he finds it very frustrating. My love language is more physical and verbally expressive, which he doesn't seem to feel comfortable with, and that makes me feel kind of unappreciated, because I am really trying my hardest at talking to him in his love language and not getting much back. I do know he loves me very much, but I need him to show it too.


Different ways of communicating. I like talking pretty frequently, both about the good and the bad stuff. Just checking in and see the lay of the land so to speak. He however is oblivious of any need to talk until he realizes something has been eating at him for several weeks, so he doesn't raise his concerns until much later, even if I ask him if there's something he would like to change.


Clashing energy levels. I am an extrovert and I spend my days mostly alone because of my line of work. He is an introvert and works with people, so at the end of the day when we can hang out I have a lot of energy and he is completely pooped.


Thanks for reading, and any input you might have! I really appreciate it! :)"
161,isfj,"I'm dating an ISFJ who is pretty different from yours. You may benefit from posting this in r/relationships as well, on help communicating your love languages and expressing love :) 
As for your introvert/extrovert issue, Id say plan a day on the weekend that you two can do extrovert things together that you like. Maybe one day during the week for something that fills your bucket that won't tax him too much (like dinner with a few friends or a board game night). And be content doing your own thing a day or two out of the week as well. You are both your own person, and having time to yourselves is important too. You're allowed to get a drink with the girls while he reads a book at home. "
162,isfj,"I (female) am probably 65%/35% INFP/ENFP and dated an ISFJ (male). We had every one of the issues you mention, down to the fine details! Unfortunately we broke up, so I definitely can't illustrate success with any behaviors. But- I think the key is the same as with all relationships- good communication. I'd also say to focus on treasuring and loving your differences- how you complement what each other lacks. The specific things I wish I had done more with my ISFJ is notice his subtle non-verbal signals when he was upset and, as you mention, get him more involved in helping me with various projects. He definitely needed to be needed, so to speak. Good luck!!"
163,isfj,"I'm in a fairly new relationship and honestly, it's hard to communicate my needs. I'd prefer to just submit them anonymously (as if you could ever actually do that IRL, this isn't Tumblr), or to be more realistic, just text them late at night when being loopy is acceptable. What my point is here, for the most part, I don't like being direct with my feelings at all. (And I know, it's something I need to fix, communication is important)
What makes me feel appreciated and loved, that is, my love language, is physical touch. I'm constantly craving hugs and cuddles from my SO. But it seems that's not his love language- so I guess, just try to communicate with him? 
And I tend to show other people love by touching them somehow (a hand on the shoulder, brushing against them) and complimenting them a lot? 
I don't know. I tried my best to answer your questions. "
164,isfj,"Hahaha.
No need to go there. I already have their standardised answer :


Dump him.


Lawyer up, quit Facebook, hit the gym.


It's bad advice. =')
I think there is just some syncing to do about each other's lifestyle. That's all. There's only the love language issue I don't think is solvable."
165,isfj,"Yup this sounds like him. I just wish he'd tell me when he's upset at something I do, because if he doesn't I can't change the behaviour he dislikes."
166,isfj,"Thanks for you perspective. It's great to hear from another -nfp too. I find it's difficult when you're usually energetic and expressive and open as an enfp and the other person is more closed off and not as expressive. It leaves me wondering if he really appreciates me or not, since he doesn't bother showing it to me."
167,isfj,"I totally feel you on the communication bit :/ Even with friends, I tend to just bottle things up forever and work myself into knots because I feel like it's not logical or acceptable for me to communicate the things I'm feeling, because they're selfish or silly or just not somebody else's problem, whatever the excuse is. But of course, I still secretly wish that someone would notice and ask me what's wrong and reassure me that it's totally okay and they love me anyway. 
I think for a lot of ISFJs that can be one of our biggest obstacles on the way to maturity, getting over the desire for other people to do the emotional heavy lifting for us. I'm worse than a lot of us because I've developed some weird anxiety issues around friendship in general, but I think feelings and feeling safe enough to share them can be hard for us. "
168,isfj,"Okay. If your partner was to ask you about your feelings, then what way would you prefer? It's important for me to know how he feels because I can't change anything if I don't even know there's a problem. But I don't want to make him close off even more by asking in the wrong way."
169,isfj,"I personally have more experience with online user INTPs I talk a bunch with than INTPs I know in real life (in fact do I know any?)
When they embraced more of their lower functions like Si and Fe I tend to like them more but when they're just on a Ti/Ne brigade they're either too meme-y or too overly negative about things"
170,isfj,"My husband is an INTP. One of the greatest compliments he ever gave me was in saying that being with me was like being by himself.  Meaning that he reenergizes with me while most social interactions drain him and he needs to take a break from people. 
We have common interests in books and movies but also interests that don't overlap at all. We have similar values. I've read some stuff that says ISFJ/INTP is not a good pair, but we both feel we compliment each other. I accept who he is and do not judge his changing obsessions. He appreciates my compassion and that I ""make a home"". I keep the house clean and organized, pay all the bills, and make plans or take care of logistics. I've learned that he doesn't even think to offer to help but will take care of anything I ask him to without complaint. He'll take the lead on things that require more research, like investing. 
He's not very emotionally expressive, but I know when he shares something that it's only with me and that's a huge compliment. Because he is a rational thinker I view him as conventionally intelligent. He can launch into an argument for either side and maintain it without any preparation. He thinks it's fun to argue for the challenge of it while I shy away from arguments. He has a good memory for things he has learned. I'm stronger at spacial relationships, wordplays, and creativity. "
171,isfj,"I'm actually the same: I only know some INTPs online, and none in real life!
I have to work with an INTP since we're both judges for a composition competition. He can be dense and stubborn, and, without having tapped into Si or Fe, he doesn't have a sense for things a judge would need (e.g. judging music fairly because it's the right thing to do rather than basing scores on more arbitrary things, or not knowing when the penalties are too harsh). In general, he can be quite negative when working or judging music. Still, he's quite ambitious with his own compositions and is very good at finding errors in other people's music (Ti?), which I really admire."
172,isfj,"My best friend is an INTP. We share similar interests and can talk for hours about them. He's a fun and mischievous person, I love his sense of humour. On the other hand, sometimes I feel like I'm boring him - I can notice when he's zoning out during our conversations. And sometimes he can hurt my feelings unknowingly. I'm not sure if it's just him, but most of the times I can't rely at all on the plans I make with him."
173,isfj,"I love INTPs. Like ENTPs they are infinitely interesting to me and a handful of my close friends are INTPs or very similar. We're pretty different, but they're great. Also they seem to love going on rants. "
174,isfj,"Ive kinda surprised the pair isnt considered compatable. ISFJ/INTP have the same functions, just swap the dom/aux with tert/inferior (same order for each pair)
So I feel like they'd understand each other well as long as their lower functions are either developed or aware of and they compliment the other"
175,isfj,"I am also married to an INTP! I was hoping I could add on to what you've said here, but you have really nailed the major points of what the ISFJ/INTP relationship is for us and how we appreciate one another. My INTP also lets me know that he can be himself around me, and I around him. We realized this very early on when we were dating and it's still true to this day. As a result, I see his true goofy self and I love it! We definitely have our different interests and personalities but that's just one of the great ways we connect and enjoy one another's company. Glad to see another ISFJ happily married to an INTP! :)
PS I read your post and he giggled the entire time because it was true."

177,isfj,"I can completely relate to everything you said. Another one to add is anyone who talks about someone who isn't around. Usually if it's something negative about a person, they might have done something that would be embarassing. I don't see other people's shortcomings as heaps necessary topics of conversation, and if they're criticised in some way, I'd rather just talk to the actual person about it instead of going behind their back. "
178,isfj,"So, there's this stereotypical idea of the ISFJ being a grandmotherly type...making warm cookies and knitting sweaters and you know. It's a joke, but...Seriously, do you guys have any good cookie recipes because I'm awful at following directions as an INFP. I cannot bake. 
PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY I LOVE ISFJS AND REALIZE THIS IS A STEREOTYPE YOU'RE ALL WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL PLEASE KEEP BEING YOU. THE WORLD NEEDS YOU ALL SO MUCH. Also, I am actually being serious..I need a good recipe."
179,isfj,"I mostly fit the stereotype, honestly.
I'm like the stereotypical ISFJ 1950s housewife in so many ways.
Cooking, cleaning, sewing, nurturing, the whole shebang.
I don't bake super frequently, mostly if I have a family dinner, holiday or occasion, and I'll bring a dessert of some kind. But it does come pretty naturally to me.
Here's my favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. It hasn't let me down yet."
180,isfj,"I am awesome at cooking but terrible at baking. Baking is just too strict for me, you can't just ""feel"" the recipe out, otherwise it won't turn out. 
Sorry this doesn't answer your question at all. :p"
181,isfj,"I loooove baking. Absolutely hate cooking though. I find baking very relaxing, practical (ie: all the ingredients are precise) and a great use of energy. Plus in the end I've made something everyone can enjoy"
182,isfj,"It depends on how you like your cookies.  I'm a ""soft and chewy"" guy myself.  The Martha Stewart recipes are pretty solid.
Soft and Chewy:  https://www.marthastewart.com/344840/soft-and-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies
Thin and Crispy:  https://www.marthastewart.com/343950/thin-and-crisp-chocolate-chip-cookies
Depending on how you deep down the cookie rabbit hole you wanna go, here's a good article that helps explain how to adjust a recipe to get what you're after:  www.handletheheat.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-chocolate-chip-cookies/"
183,isfj,"I was never good at cooking or baking because... I never tried it before, or barely did it. Si is also all about personal experience so I think an ISFJ can be clueless about it if their Si never got involved in it.
Lately, I tried baking and I've been loving it. Baking for others feel great so I guess that allows me to engage with both Si and Fe. 
As for the cookies... Well, I usually look up for receipes online and their reviews hehe (but they're in French so I can't share, sorry...). You can try a few and decide what works best for you and then go wild! Good luck on the cookies! "
184,isfj,"I was just listening to this podcast about re-framing (very interesting and i hope some of you might listen to it) and they mention a downloadable app, still in beta testing phase, but one i think might be very beneficial to a lot of people here. I just signed up but in doing so is just put on a waiting list. Might take some time before we can use it.
the app is called koko and it works like so: someone who is feeling bad can explain their situation and why they feel bad and other people using the app can respond by re-framing that situation in a more positive light. it creates a way for people to help each other by sharing their perspectives. so one person can be good at emotionally handling one situation but bad at another can help and get help from people with different mindset pros and cons.
i imagine it'll help a lot with anxiety and self criticizing behaviors which isfj can be prone to have. and it also gives an outlet for the isfj need to help others."
185,isfj,"Hey all! I (ISFJ) co-host a new podcast called This Much Love! with my partner (INFJ),and it’s now available on iTunes/Podcasts.app (also Spotify, if that’s your thing)
We wanted to make a show where we could channel our positivity, passion, and love for various things into 30-60 minute episodes. We hope it makes you happy, too (we could all use a bit more of that, huh?). Subscribe here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/this-much-love/id1437730010
Something that would mean a lot to us… If you like the show, could you leave a review? I know it’s tacky to ask, but it helps other people discover it on their own, and we don’t currently have the budget for a major marketing campaign. Word of mouth is key. ♥️"
186,isfj,"So what makes you angry? I find that really minor things can make me incredibly angry... or maybe frustrated is a better word.
Here's a short list:


kids getting their parents to buy them expensive cars


people getting upset at me while I'm driving


people being unable to see from another point of view


Some examples... I go to a private school and walking near the parking lot is like walking by a showcase of Mercedes, Audis, Lexuses, porsches, Chargers... So many fucking expensive cars and it bothers me so much that kids are getting their parents to buy them these ridiculous cars while they're still in college and don't even have their own jobs yet. My family is well-off and my mom bought me a car when I was 16 (which I know even that is a luxury) and I begged her to get me a cheap, worn-down car because I didn't want to seem like a brat when I drove around. I felt so bad when I drove her Mercedes, like people were judging me and thinking it was mine.
For people getting upset at me when I drive... I was at a stoplight under construction and waiting for the worker to give me a signal, and I was looking at the wrong person... A few seconds later a lady yells at me ""What, are you gonna go or what?!"" (because she had been giving me the signal and I hadn't seen). I just felt so bad and was like ""I didn't know it was my turn!"" but why couldn't she have said it more nicely? Like ""hey, your turn now!"" instead of angrily yelling it at me. I literally almost cried. And then today, I was driving through a parking lot and pedestrians were walking and so I stopped but one of them had held up her hand in a halt signal... and so I kinda raised my hands to say ""I was stopped for you"" and then her and her friend start making fun of me and raising their hands and waving them around and laughing and I got so sad. I was just trying to be like ""hey, I had stopped for you"".
And then the third point is self-explanatory... I posted a while back about a comment thread that made me so sad--it was comments under an article about poachers being killed and everyone was like ""Good, they deserve to die!"" or ""On safaris, they should hunt poachers instead of animals!""... Like oh my fucking god, these poachers are PEOPLE too, you can't define them from ONE thing they did. I don't agree with poaching, but I also don't agree with DEHUMANIZING people.
Even typing this gets me riled up... I know that these are just silly reasons to get upset about stuff and I take things too personally... Does anyone else relate to these experiences?
edit: Also what about just emotional investment into ""unworthy"" things like things that don't really deserve emotional investment... Like getting sad/crying because of a lonely old person you saw earlier in the day or something."
187,isfj,"I can really relate to your driving stories. I get especially irritated when you are on an interstate and see that 2 lanes will become 1 and the good majority of cars will begin to merge but then about 10% of cars will just keep going, trying to merge in at the last second. It feels so unfair to me. "
188,isfj,"Man, crying during an argument is so frustrating... I always do even when I don't mean to.
And I can relate to the anger at people being rude/disrespectful... Not following the ""rules"" bothers me so much, and if people act disrespectful to a teacher I'm just like... ""what the fuck, they're the TEACHER listen to them!"" And then people who don't behave respectfully... Ex: someone being rude to a cashier/waitress. They are just doing their job, they can't help if it's crowded and slow. People who do tickets for airfare can't help every single person if you're late to your flight... ugh. edit: and people who cheat... I remember I knew a person who openly admitted to cheating and I just could never look at them the same way. and I literally told a teacher in 6th grade that I accidentally looked at someone's test and saw the answer but I didn't mean to but if it counted as cheating he could mark the answer I got wrong.
Yes, I agree how one small thing can really wreck a day. And I feel like the person who said it/did it won't even remember it later, yet I'll always remember that thing and be upset. Grrrr.
On another note about emotional investment... I hate how sad I can get at certain things. Seeing an old lady eating alone in a restaurant? Cry about it later. Seeing an old guy in a movie who seems alone and sad? Cry about it. See someone in a wheelchair in Target? Feel incredibly sad and ruins the good mood I was in. I try to tell myself it's wrong because who knows, they could have a great life and want to eat alone in a restaurant! But at the same time I'm jnust like ""why is it not socially acceptable to go hug lonely old people?"" because I just want to go hug them and tell them that I'm thankful for whatever they did in life and try to cheer them up. I think it's partially because I feel so alone in life that I see it in other people too...
""The loneliest people are the kindest. The saddest people smile the brightest. The most damaged people are the wisest. All because they do not wish to see anyone else suffer the way they do.''
I feel like almost no-one would ever realize how sad I am most days because I would never open up to them and they see me as the kind of crazy girl who comes to class each day and smiles often but as soon as I leave class I take off the ""smiley-mask""."
189,isfj,"I suprisingly get on well with INTPs. I have a couple of friends that are INTPs. They are also pretty loyal in my experience to their friends. Not to say all of my interactions with them are great they can be really blunt at times but I think it comes from good place and they are just trying to be honest. I also really admire their strong Ti analytical abilities. I definitely feel like my tertiary Ti and even Ne come out more around them. I also feel like they appreciate my Si and Fe. Overall, I find that when healthy both of us can appreciate the others strengths as those are our weaknesses. So any ISFJs have experiences with INTPs? "
190,isfj,"My S/O is an INTP, we have been together over 10 years! I love him because he is so spontaneously funny.. he could be a unique comedian if he wanted to be. He makes me laugh every day. I could never come up with the stuff he does. He has some communication issues but as he is working on that, things get better. The thing is our perspective can differ a lot so unless we talk about it, it’s hard to know how the other person really feels. So he can come across as rude sometimes, and also projects his feelings into me a lot. But he is very sweet and loyal and I feel very lucky to live with such a unique guy like him! "
191,isfj,"I don't think I have any friends who I've typed as an INTP, which is sad, because I actually really want to meet an INTP!  xNTP's, generally speaking, interest/fascinate me because their behavior is very different from mine, but we have a very similar thought process (I've always noticed this when watching films with xNTP fictional characters,) and so even when I disagree with their actions, I understand why they're doing what they're doing.  I have a love for what I think of as ""INTP humor"" (Daria, Aubrey Plaza sort of thing.) I know it's the whole same-functions thing, but it actually fascinates me just what I've noticed I have in common with xNTP's on the Internet and through media, even though a lot of xNTP's seem to dislike ISFJ's."
192,isfj,"That's how I feel about ISFJ myself. My Si is definitely helped a lot. My Fe too, but it's not as dramatic as it's already became pretty strong by itself.
I guess sharing introversion makes that easier. "
193,isfj,There will be definitely some xNTPs who don’t like us cause we are opposite types at the end of the day. Im sure most of there complaints are about ISFJ parents. I’m pretty sure the feeling is mutual with the INTPs I know. 
194,isfj,"When drinking alcohol, or indulging in whatever stimulating substance of your choosing, do you always know how much you are taking in? Meaning are you always aware of the amounts prior to ingesting?
Example, would you be the kind to ingest alcohol on the rocks, knowing in advance the desired effects? Or, would you ingest a random amount, later to realize you took too much of a gulp?"
195,isfj,"I just drink it and I can tell how much alcohol is in whatever it is by the taste, and by the tiny buzz I get after the first couple of sips. I stop based on when I feel like if I drink more I will drink too much. I think this is pretty typical. "
196,isfj,"I drink more amount of alcohol when I am at home or with family, than when I go out, where I drink in limits. Both times I am always definitely aware of what and how much alcohol I take..
And yes, like the other user mentioned, I can tell the amount of alcohol I take and could further take by the feeling I get.. "
197,isfj,"Just to give context, I was simply asking to find better perspective based on my research I am conducting.
I have found that while I am good at knowing my limits, sometimes I may keep frequent sips like water and forget that it is alcohol. It is not until I start to get a deeper buzz that I begin panicking and have to calm myself down.
I drink mostly tequila on the rocks with grenadine. "
198,isfj,"I am not ISFJ.
I get drunk but I have a high tolerance because of my ability to function under the influence. I experience head highs, which is why i only drink tequila. This enables me to remain in my head and not lose control of my limbs.
Doesn't mean I can get behind the wheel, but I live in my head and when I start to feel that i am losing control, I stop. My body just doesn't allow me to go past a certain point because I will become to dehydrated and start having headaches. In my mind, I will then start coaching myself to reverse the process and calm me down."
199,isfj,"Is it something that can explain why my young adult intj friends have such weird relationships with alcohol?
They’re either deathly afraid of getting drunk or straight edge (sample size 5, which is big in my world :p)"
200,isfj,"Feel free to check mine out, especially if you live in a different country. It shows different country's flags under my profile's stats and I am measuring my success based on how many flags I can collect :) Sort of like collecting Pokemon :P

"
201,isfj,"As an ISFJ, does anyone else struggle to meet time limits on tests at school? Not for lack of trying, or being distracted, but simply that there is not enough time to answer all the problems and answer them well/at least comfortably.
(/r/iamverysmart) I always get told I'm smart, and I do have straight A's, but I chalk it up to being driven to prepare myself for anything that I might encounter on a piece of paper--no more, no less. This opinion of mine is also reinforced by things such as the fact that I scored fairly low on the ACT (<24), meanwhile others can breeze through tests such as these and achieve a perfect score, or at least a more rewarding one. 
I was wondering what causes people to function higher on the ACT, if anyone else--particularly fellow ISFJ's--endure a similar plight against timed testing in general, and what other comments, experiences, questions, etc. you guys might have regarding anything in this discussion.
Thanks :)"
202,isfj,"I can't give you input on the ACT, but I can say that YES I struggle with timed tests. I mean I'm not saying that I never met the time limits, but I would definitely be one of the last students in the room before handing a test in (in college). 
This is because of the following reasons for me:


I am a perfectionist/high achiever. I feel my work is a reflection of me. Therefore, I must feel good about my work to feel good about myself. This means double or triple checking stuff I KNOW is correct.


I don't work well under immense pressure. When the clock is ticking dangerously low, my brain starts to shut down into panic mode. I work efficiently at the beginning of a test and as people leave or there's less than 5 mins left, I start to worry I won't finish in time.


My comprehension sometimes craps out on me. If there are verbal instructions, I may need to hear them 2 or 3 times before I retain it. Same with visuals. This causes me to panic when gears are switched too quickly for me. In most cases, ill be trying to hear verbal directions and my brain starts jumping ahead and distracting me from listening. Its quite frustrating.


Ive been told I'm smart too, but honestly I've just been a good student with a fear of failure."
203,isfj,"I definitely struggled with the ACT. I took it once and didn't finish most sections. The SAT went better for me and I had just enough time for each section. I definitely agree that we are slower test takers. In my case, I like to make sure my answer is correct before I let myself move on. For me, this was only a problem in high school (and not often). Now that I'm in college, I'm allotted much more time for each test which helps significantly "
204,isfj,"I've never done well with standardized tests that have timed sections. I'm far more concerned with finishing all the questions in the time given instead of the quality of my answers. It was the most egregious with timed essays, and I'm pretty sure that's why I scored so low on the Writing section of the SAT when writing is one of my stronger suits. I can't churn out a coherent essay within 25 minutes. Not that it matters anymore, since colleges hardly looked at the writing section of the SAT and it's been done away with since I took it. I never took the ACT, so I can't comment, but I suspect it would've been the same. "
205,isfj,"This matches me to a tee, oh my goodness. Also, I'm considering university, but I fear it could be very stressful for me with the workload, (timed) tests and essays, and how I operate as we've both described here. How has it been for you, any coping required? Perhaps intensive therapy :P? Were your professors accommodating?
Also, what did you decide to study? And as for your career?"
206,isfj,"I had a super positive experience with college (just graduated this past May--currently looking for a job). Even though I took long on tests, I always was done before the last couple of students. Despite these small issues with timed-tests, my desire for perfectionism was super helpful because I was ALWAYS well organized, prepared, and had a plan. Plus, as an ISFJ I thrived helping fellow classmates and was placed in leadership roles. My professors always trusted me and knew I would get the assignments done.
This where the smarts vs. good student applies to me though.  I studied Graphic Design. I didn't have to take tests often, and when I did I just studied my best for them (made flash cards, Q&A sheets and went over them) and asked a lot of questions.  There were only 2-3 classes I took where I was worried about the outcome and in the end I was fine. 
In terms of any anxiety or coping I had, no I didn't need therapy. But everyone is different. My family/boyfriend was incredibly supportive when I was stressed out and without them I would have been a wreck. In the end, I had to remind myself that a test was just a test.
Once you find a system that works best for you, you'll be good."
207,isfj,"Hm, well that sounds rather foreboding considering I'm not close to any of my family and I have literally zero friends lol... I guess I could meet people along the way if I actually went though! The way I've coped through high school and all the AP classes (I've graduated, and am in the middle of joining the military :D) has been just doing things online that I can enjoy by myself. Ever been in a drought of company, and how, if you have been, did you overcome that :(? Also thank you so much for your time and input, I appreciate it, especially considering this isn't the most lively of all places. Congratulations on your graduation too by the way!"
208,isfj,"Thank you! I'm sorry you seem to be in a position where you don't quite have a supportive group of people in your life. However, one of my best friends is a new Marine and he has found a sense of community and leadership in his position. I wish the best of luck to you in this path of life :)
As for having a drought of company, not quite as I lived at home with my family during college (and still do now). However, that's not to say I didn't feel lonely. School took up a lot of my time (graphic design his very time-consuming) and I had to say no to social events quite a bit. However, what made the difference for me was intentionally choosing to put myself out there and be part of a church family that has been active in the community in addition to meeting on Sunday mornings. It helped me recharge for the week ahead.
For you, whether you consider yourself to have a faith you live by or not, perhaps volunteering in your community or being part of a club would help you find a friend or a ""family"", especially at this time in your life as a member of the military. It's so easy as introverts to just stay behind-the-scenes when we don't have a small group of people to hang out with, but that can really harm our outlook on life."
209,isfj,"A while back, we asked folks in this community to take a survey and you all were kind enough to help us out. This post is a high level summary of the results of that survey.
(Note: for this summary, we will be using the term ""extravert"" as used in clinical analysis initiated by Carl Jung instead of the popularized spelling, ""extrovert."" )
Introduction
The Movers & Makers company is engaged in ongoing research about introverts, extraverts, age, occupation, and communication preferences. The original hypothesis was that introverts, or individuals in introvert-friendly occupations such as STEM, were more adverse to having a phone call disrupt their time, with some exceptions. In contrast, extraverts, or individuals in extravert-friendly occupations, were more open to phone calls. Our formal interviews showed this hypothesis to be incorrect and revealed a trend based more on age and occupation than temperament.
As an informal triangulation of our data, The Movers & Makers research team decided to conduct surveys on popular social media and internet forums. The research has not yet concluded, but ""Phase 1"" of these informal surveys are complete and we'd like to share the results of these surveys. The results of this informal survey coincided with our formal research and also contradicted the original hypothesis. This summary is not an analysis of our hypothesis, our formal research, or of the informal research. This summary is only a brief overview of the informal survey results.
Summary
In addition to essential demographic questions, the questions of the survey took the form of ""I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself."" The possible answers included, ""Call your phone number,"" ""Send you an email,"" ""Send you an SMS,"" ""Send you an MMS,"" and ""Send you an IM."" We also asked two, somewhat open-ended questions that emphasized the positive and negative consequences of the communication preferences.
Overall Preferences
Our initial observations, which initiated our research, were that there are some people that don't like to be called on the phone and would prefer to be contacted by other means. This survey supported the observation with less than a third of respondents preferring  a phone call (31.3%) over alternative methods. Email was the preferred method by half of the respondents (49.6%).
Overall Response Breakdown
Granted, the spectrum of scenarios may have been biased toward phone-call-aversion, so this is not an absolute reflection of preferences, but merely a summary of the preferences reflected in this survey. 
Introvert-Extravert Preferences
Breaking down the data between introverts and extraverts yielded an insignificant difference between the two temperaments. Introverts preferred a phone call in 30.61% of responses. Extraverts preferred a phone call in 31.41% of responses. This is a difference of only 0.8% and is much smaller than we anticipated.
Introvert Response Breakdown
Extravert Response Breakdown
The similarities between introvert and extravert coincide with our formal research and are also reflected in the breakdown of most of each questions that follow.
Ambivert Preferences
While ""ambivert"" is not a part of some personality/temperament models, many contemporary research make allowances for ambiverts. In our case, we are including the term because people that identify as ambiverts seem themselves as distinct from both extraverts and introverts and they may have a distinct profile. However, the number of respondents describing themselves as Ambiverts is too small to comprehensively study and we recommend a more in-depth study of ambiverts and communication preferences.  Still, as a note of interest, we'll include the results here, though we caution against drawing any conclusions. Ambiverts responded with a preference for email at 54.6% and phone calls at 19.2%.
Ambivert Response Breakdown
Male-Female Preferences
Our original hypothesis did not account for sex or gender. We allowed for the selection of ""sex"" in the survey to satisfy any curiosity of biological temperament selection. As we suspected, there isn't a large or significant difference in correlation of sex to communication preferences as borne out in our formal research and reflected in these survey results.
Male Response Breakdown
Overall, male respondents selected a preference for a phone call in 34% of responses with females selecting phone calls in only 28.6% of responses. Email was the preferred response for both males and females in 49.3% and 49.7% of responses respectively.
Female Response Breakdown
Gender and Non-traditional Genders
We specifically did not include the word ""gender"" in this survey because the study of gender is outside of the scope of our current research. We allowed for the answers of ""Prefer not to say,"" and ""Other"" with an open field to promote the completion of the survey, but this survey is not equipped to tackle gender. Even with this allowance, only 0.1% of respondents answered with a non-traditional sex. Of that 0.1%, some of the respondents showed open hostility to the survey in their comments, indicating that this answer was not truly reflective of the respondent. The answers from these respondents were removed from our analyzed results.
That does not mean, however, that we do not value research regarding gender. We believe that the identification of gender and that correlation to communication preference might be quite significant. It is simply that we have not begun to tackle the question at this time. We would openly welcome input or recommendations from anyone with knowledge or expertise in this area.
Generational Preferences
The first of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in generation. The age groups that we call ""Millennials"" are the least resistant to phone calls, with 31.6% of responses, and yet 48.4% of the Millennial responses prefer email. Millennials were also more open to ""alternative"" communication methods such as IM, SMS, etc. with about 20% of the responses in total.
Millennial Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Generation X,"" or ""Gen X,"" are slightly more resistant to phone calls with only 29.1% of responses preferring a phone call and 57.3% preferring email.
Gen X Response Breakdown
The age groups that we call ""Baby Boomers,"" or just ""Boomers"" are the most resistant to phone calls with only 23.6% of responses preferring a phone call and 72.7% preferring email. Boomers were the most resistant to ""alternative"" communication methods with only 3.6% of responses for SMS and zero responses for the other methods.
Boomer Response Breakdown
Occupational Preferences
The second of two areas with distinctive responses is the difference in occupation, or, occupational ""wings"" as we call them. These wings are simply divided into occupations that are STEM-related and non-STEM-related. The survey results reinforced our formal research and part of our hypothesis that respondents in STEM-related fields are more resistant to phone calls than their non-STEM peers. Respondents in STEM-related fields responded with 23.5% of responses preferring phone calls and 57.4% preferring email.  
STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Responses in non-STEM-related occupations were more receptive to phone calls, but only with 34.2% of the responses and 46.7% preferring email.
non-STEM-Related Occupation Response Breakdown
Scenario Preferences
We asked respondents to imagine a range of hypothetical scenarios and how they'd prefer to be contacted in those scenarios. The scenarios spanned a variety of business-oriented communications that fall onto a spectrum what we term ""cold to hot"" in order indicate the amount of familiarity the two parties have already established. We also asked about preferences in various degrees of urgency and responsibility.
It is probably unsurprising that the more distant and less urgent relationships are the most resistant to phone calls and the nearest and more urgent relationships are the most receptive to phone calls. In the ""coldest"" scenario, I work for a company that has never done business with you and I'd like to introduce myself, responses were predictably low on preferring a phone call with only 8% of responses and 85% preferring email. In this scenario, the differences between introvert and extravert were negligible, but the differences in generation were in-line with the overall responses. STEM and non-STEM responses were also in agreement with the overall responses.
Cold Business Introduction Response Breakdown
Also, predictably, the ""hottest"" scenario, I have an emergency (business emergency, not life or death), included 74.6% of responses favoring a phone call and 5.9% preferring email. As an interesting note, in this scenario, more respondents preferred SMS to email with 13.7% of the responses.
Emergency Response Breakdown
The scenarios that emphasized cool or hot combined with responsibility, however, were a little surprising. For the scenario, I'm a customer with a question (it's your responsibility to answer customer questions), the responses were similar to the warm business responses. 19% of responses preferred a phone call for customer questions and 72.2% of responses preferred email.
Cool Customer Response Breakdown
The scenario, I'm a customer with a problem (it's your responsibility to handle customer problems), showed a surprising 61% preferring email and only 31.2% preferring a phone call.
Hot Customer Response Breakdown
Consequences
We were also interested in understanding what impact these preferences have on the communication recipient. We set up a pair of questions in the survey to give respondents a chance to demonstrate the perceived consequences, both positive and negative. The negative consequences include, ""I mostly roll with it--no big deal"" (16.8%), ""I find it irritating and frustrating"" (24.3%), and ""The interruption negatively affects my work"" (16.5%), as well as, ""I may decide not to reply or continue communication"" (17.8%). The most damaging consequences would be ""I lose some respect for the person contacting me"" (7.3%), and ""I may block that person, or mark their contact as 'spam' or 'junk'"" (6.5%).
Negative Consequences Response Breakdown
Conversely, when the respondents' preferences were respected, there were positive consequences, including, ""It helps me manage my schedule"" (14.3%), ""I feel I'm more productive and efficient"" (13.9%), ""I believe I can dedicate the proper amount of attention to the communication"" (21.5%), ""I'm less irritated"" (20%), and ""It reduces my anxiety"" (18.8%).
Positive Consequences Response Breakdown
Conclusion
Our initial observations were that most people don't like receiving phone calls. Perhaps it's no mystery that the manner in which communication technology evolved puts the telephone front-and-center to business communication. However, our ongoing research shows that most people find phone calls to be disruptive and intrusive. Using the phone as a primary source of communication could be damaging to business relationships and to the overall economic health of our collective society. 
Looking at this research, we can see why ""cold calling"" feels ineffective and like ""a waste of time"" to many people. ""Cold emails"" are more likely to be effective and seem to have a lower downside. In fields like recruiting, it may be damaging for the hiring side of the relationship to initiate contact with a phone call. 
Yes, the research is ongoing, but it seems relatively clear that the phone should not be the first point of contact in any scenario, unless we know for certain that the recipient would prefer a phone call or we know for certain that the purpose of the contact is an emergency (the definition of ""emergency"" is somewhat subjective and needs to be judiciously applied). In business scenarios, the least risky option for contacting anyone is to use email and the most risky is to use alternative methods like MMS, or even IM. But, phone calls seem equally risky by the same standards considering that email seemed to dominate the responses.
As an illustration of the resistance to phone calls, this is a comment from the survey, ""I hate phone calls, almost unconditionally.  Texting or e-mails are always preferable unless it's really an emergency."" And, another comment, ""I do not generally like speaking on the phone because it's a purely auditory activity, and I am a visual person... I like time to process what's going on and formulate a response, otherwise I feel flustered and anxious."" These and several other comments are reflective of the overall tone of this survey. There were no equivalent comments showing resistance to email. 
Our research currently only analyzes the state of things as they are, not why things are as they are. For example, why are Boomers more resistant to phone calls than Millennials? Why are STEM-related occupations more resistant to phone calls than non-STEM-related fields? Why are extraverts as equally resistant to phone calls as introverts? What is the significance of gender in communication preference? How might this study be different if we focused on personal scenarios instead of business scenarios?
All of these questions push us to recommend further research in this area. We know that we are continuing to research this area, but our small contribution covers only a fraction of needed research.
We will begin ""Phase 2"" of this research soon. If you're interested in participating, keep a watch on our blog for updates. This topic will remain a topic of interest for The Movers & Makers Company and our research is ongoing. If you are interested in this research or our other research, please contact us; but, please refrain from calling us on the phone, it's so disruptive.
You can find a copy of this article over on Medium if you'd like to read the article with the chart images in-line."

211,isfj,"Recently, I was called a dichotomy between being a wallflower and the nature of my ""true"" personality. I was told I present myself as a wallflower and am easily overlooked until I allow others to experience and know the person I am underneath. And, if I would allow others in, I would lessen the isolation I potentially lock myself in.
I am conflicted by this. Have you any similar experiences? "
212,isfj,"This is a huge source of inner conflict for me. I think the wallflower status comes with being an introvert in some ways. Isolation has been an ongoing theme in my life and I've been told there is a wall I keep around myself. This was unbeknownst to me as I have felt that there isn't much to tell or that I'm straightforward and open. People clearly don't see it that way though. I feel like this issue lessens my ability to form connections and to progress in the way that I want to in life as people don't feel like they really ""know"" me well enough and this translates to a lack of trust on their part and a hesitation. "
213,isfj,"Yes, yes, yes. Exactly. I have been told I am hard to get to know, and it was surprising to me at first. I feel like I am open and honest with those that I trust with personal details. I do not like people to know too much about me, especially those that I do not care to know me. "
214,isfj,"Honestly, just give them your time and attention. Show them you care, it goes way longer than you may think. We ISFJs are content to just be with the ones we love. Also, be genuine. We’re pretty good at being able to tell when you’re not being genuine. Open up to them, let them know they can trust you and you them. All of that, little by little and you better believe they’ll be loyal, and you better be in return. "
215,isfj,"Just be you. I like everyone as long as they seem genuine to me. Also we like to know we're loved/appreciated, etc. and can be a little dense about noticing it if it's not spelled out explicitly. So don't be shy about saying how you feel. As with all dual relationships, you may need time to ""grow on"" one another so just give it time."
216,isfj,"The fact of the matter is, you can't force anybody to like you, and a certain amount of this is going to boil down to natural compatibility and biological attraction.
If I'm not naturally attracted to someone, and I don't like their general personality, it's not like them changing their behavior is going to make a real difference, once that opinion is formed.
Pay attention to their nonverbal cues. ISFJs are typically pretty friendly to everyone, and I've personally had that misinterpreted to be flirting, when really, I treat everybody that way.
If they're avoiding eye contact, looking elsewhere in the room, not making an effort to really continue the conversation, stuff like that, just back off and leave them alone. There are other fish in the sea, and you can't force anything.
All that being said, there are some things that can help, if they do like you.
For me, a real big thing is being easygoing, and not rushing anything.
I like to move at a snail's pace when it comes to dating, and it's really intimidating when someone tries to rush things.
Make your feelings known, by all means, and don't be afraid to initiate things (because most of us aren't likely to initiate anything first), but then let the ISFJ set the pace, and make sure you know they're comfortable before escalating things too much.
Kindness to everyone is something I notice in other people, and I admire it when I see it. If you're rude to anybody, it's going to be a turn off. 
ISFJs aren't generally very forthcoming when it comes to talking about ourselves, but that doesn't mean we don't want to.
I often feel like I have a lot to say and share, but it's either not interesting for other people to hear, or I don't want to burden them, or I'm afraid of sounding dumb, or whatever, so I'll just keep a lot of stuff to myself.
When someone genuinely asks me questions about myself and my life, and really listens, it makes me feel special. It's easy for us to blend into the background, so frankly, any individual attention can be nice.
Remembering details about me makes me feel special. A sense of humor is always a good thing. 
Don't put on an act and make yourself into someone you aren't, though.
You really do have to be yourself, and it's either going to pan out or it's not."
217,isfj,"It's their choice to choose who to be with, not who they like, we are all the slaves of brain chemicals and victims of our environment. Of course this post didn't say how to FORCE them to like me, but you're too pedantic: it was obvious that I said ""how to influence x person to like me"". What you're saying is like doing ANYTHING, making ANY steps is manipulation, with that logic it means I'm forcing every chick to like me just because of my existence and that's absurd and egocentric bullshit. "
218,isfj,My INFJ husband and I (ISFJ) are looking for questions for us both to answer in a video. It would demonstrate how we both answer the same questions differently. Can you suggest any questions (perhaps related to everyday life) ? Thanks! 
219,isfj,"Fun! Here are some of my questions:

How do you each prefer to spend your free time?
How do you both handle conflict?
How were you each introduced to MBTI?
What are 3 things you admire about the other person's type?
Do you both like the same movie and book genres?
Which one of you is more outgoing or can handle more time with others (extroverted introvert)?
Is the house usually clean and organized since you're both J's (Hehe, I'm surrounded by P's so my space is usually a mess!)?
What's one thing you love about being your MBTI type?
"
220,isfj,"I think a great example (if you're still working on the video) would be the answer to questions like ""What do you want to do?"" ""What do you want to get for dinner?"" ""What's your favorite band/song/movie?"" 
""How was your day?"" Would also be a good one. For me the answer to this depends on who asks.
At least for me I know the answer is usually along the lines of ""I don't know, it's whatever you like/want!"" and the whole ""I don't know"" thing drives my INTJ friend insane. Haha."
221,isfj,"Do you feel underappreciated? Please share if you do! I'd love to talk and learn with you.
Please never stop being you! I see many ISFJ who sell themselves short, if only they realized how much of a positive impact they really have!
I learned a painful life lesson when I drifted away from someone dear to me who typed as ISFJ once. I failed to appreciate her properly and now I cannot at all. Please know that you are appreciated for who you are and that sometimes especially a high Ni type may struggle with showing appreciation if we are immature. I am positively affected by ISFJ very regularly in terms of learning practical growth and emotional comfort. Your presence often feels like a campfire for my soul!
Thank you for listening to my rambling! It may seem like I'm lost at sea and dumping my emotions, I apologize if that seems to be so. Live happy, friends!"
222,isfj,I don't really know if I have that effect on people. I often find myself second guessing if I truly belong here. I know I often have felt this though. Like I give so much for others only to always feel like I myself have no one to turn to when I'm in need. 
223,isfj,"Def have felt under appreciated by my SO before. He (ENTJ) never thought I did anything towards THE common goal we had. Unfortunately, we take under appreciation to the core but I guess that it is part of the F in us :)"
224,isfj,"He didn’t see me working hard enough towards “the goal”, which was his first priority. Everything else came in second (ENTJs are very goal focused). So providing the emotional support I needed at times was never a priority. It didn’t work out unfortunately..."
225,isfj,"Please believe me, someone is always available to listen if you need it! :) Reddit and Omegle have been quite successful vents for me.
Does it sometimes feel like you have emotions building up inside and no way to get them out?"
226,isfj,"Thank you! I've been feeling better about it lately as my best friend/boyfriend is fantastic, it was more all my other friends that I'm always there for but never seem to be able to contact them when I need them. 
Honestly as much that is accurate I also have a lot of issues with dissociation and shutting down entirely"
227,isfj,"Not generally, it more seems to be that they hit me up whenever they need help or support but whenever I hit them up they're busy. 
No unfortunately. I despise dissociating with every fibre of my being. "
228,isfj,"Don't get me wrong, having empathy is a good thing, but there are points when it's just too much for me - for example, when it comes to songs - yes, I love songs, but the emotional connections I have with them- something about it seems like too much. "
229,isfj,"Me too, but not with songs. Although I do cry whenever I hear ""Tequila"" or ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree"" because they remind me of my grandpa.
For me it's more about having trouble making connections with people because I'm resistant to the insane amount of empathy I know I will feel for anything they confide in me. Makes it feel like human connection is more of a burden than it really should be..."
230,isfj,"Isn't empathy subjective to a certain degree? You can't ""switch off"" feelings, but you can choose to put more or less weight on a given thing. That's how you ignore work, studies, social obligations, etc..."
231,isfj,"That I feel like I could use my abilities to manipulate people to get what I want. I keep it in check. People would be shocked since I'm a good girl. 
I feel like I outgrew a lot of the more negative qualities that are common in ISFJs, however I still have a lot to work on. The biggest is to not be take everything so seriously and to be less dramatic. "
232,isfj,"Traits I consider dark in myself; aggressive controlling, impatient, uhh pretty much every opposite trait of the traits I display most of the time  and is the most familiar with.. however, keep in mind that those traits have are on a scale,  and it varies how strong they are.
I think many would get surpires that I can get very crazy sometimes, and the fact that I really like to perform in front of my family and I love to talk A LOT (sometimes..) "
233,isfj,I am scared when I am on verge of pissed of because I think I could throw every bullshit I know about him and the every label I made of said person. It isn't about winning debate It just about destroy his self esteem. I am scared of that so I am try to disengage. Yeah shadow Fi is all about it I guess.
234,isfj,"Warning, trying to determine if I am mistyped INFP.  Its also very possible I am ISFJ or INFJ. This may mess up the results. That being said, it may help type me further:
I had a pretty rebellious past, but not until my 20s. I got really into drugs for a while, which seems very much against the grain for the ISFJ based on the description. Same with alcohol. That may be how I learned to pick up on people trying to take advantage of me so well, because throughout that time I still had an ""innocent"" vibe that a lot of people commented on. The people in my life now would be very shocked to find out about my history with drugs, because I rarely if ever talk to them about anything like that. A friend I met when I moved to where I live now told me she couldn't believe it.
I also very much enjoy learning new ideas and concepts a LOT. I can spend hours on things I love to listen to, read about, etc. Those things are usually a bit ""dark"", too. For while, I listened to some really interesting podcasts about what North Korea is like and tourism there. If I wasn't such a chicken because they hate Americans so much, I would love to go there just for the sheer fact that its such a mysterious place.
A little more every day: I love horror movies. Its my favorite movie genre, and seems very not ISFJ."
235,isfj,"Agree with what another Redditor said about knowing how to manipulate, and just not doing it. I know how to ""mess with"" people by playing onto their insecurities, or at least what I can say that will have a negative effect... once again, I really try not to do that. I also think up multiple different ways for revenge, whether direct or indirect, when someone pisses me off - I don't usually go through with them. I'm actually kind of judgmental, but I sometimes don't even realize it until I've decided I don't like a certain person.  I'm also a fantastic liar if I know that there's a low chance I'll be caught, but I try my best to not lie to people."
236,isfj,"That I can be super critical and mean if you piss me off enough. Also, giving to other people and resenting it because of failing to state my needs in a timely manner. As I've gotten older, I've gotten better at keeping this in check and being more honest about my needs. "
237,isfj,"I appear to be a regular petite girl, not necessarily super feminine but that takes care of herself. However I think that the biggest surprise for people who know me is that I smoke A LOT of weed, like I have a real lack of control with the amounts I can smoke haha am trying to quit though. 
Dark traits : I can have a cynical view of life , and be a bit raw with my humor and people that dont know me may find it offensive. Also sometimes I enjoy a bit of social network stalking (only stuff that is freely available for anyone that digs enough) because I like to construct my idea of a person by collecting aaall the possible details about them. I would like to think I end up having a pretty accurate idea of the other person. Sometimes I use this information I gather to bond with people or other (mild) purposes.
I have always been ""the good girl"" with whom all the parents compare their children with. However to me this contrasts with what goes on in my mind. In my head I'm quite judgemental (but rarely I voice my criticisms), sometimes I picture violent stuff if am irritated and also I don't consider myself traditional at all (as ISFJs are depicted), and my emotions can get very intense and unstable. "
238,isfj,I'm the exact way.. The only difference is I'll don't try to destroy that person self esteem. All I do is speak the truth. Including wishing bad things happen to them. I do try my best to not go down that route 
239,isfj,"Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:

241,isfj,The in charge of the gym I go to asks me to be more outgoing and interact with others a lot. He doesn't understands the concept of introversion and how it's different from shyness. I have a feeling that I have read someone else complain about this very thing before. Is this a common problem?
242,isfj,"I go to a YMCA to work out and never have had an issue with forced interaction at all. Most people at my gym who are working out by themselves wear headphones so small talk isn't a big thing. Maybe you could try that? If I were you, I'd Just be confident in yourself and talk to people only if you know them or want to talk!"
243,isfj,"Nothing about your gym sounds normal to me. It's completely normal not to be social at the gym, and while it's normal for them to play music, I've never been unable to hear my own music. I don't know if there are other gyms in your area, but in any case I would start saying ""no"" to Mr. Be-More-Outgoing, because exercising quietly is a perfectly valid and very common thing to do."
244,isfj,I’m a male ISFJ so I’ll throw in my 2 cents. Female ISFJs usually don’t have a problem with feeling accepted by society. There traits are seen as sterotypical normally. They also are able to develop their Fe more than us usually. I as a male ISFJ tend to hide my Fe a lot. On cognitive functions test my Fe and Ti are very close in terms of scores. I don’t show much emotion if I’m not that close to you so you could probably mistype me as an ISTJ until you really got to know me. It also depends on who I’m talking to. With my thinking friends I don’t show very much Fe. With my feeling friends I tend to feel more comfortable showing more Fe. 
245,isfj,"From what I've seen, I think female ISFJs manage to develop Fe a bit more easily than male ISFJs due to social expectations (men having to be ""tough"" and ""emotionless"" and all that...) 
My dad is an ISFJ as well and he was in a Ti loop for a long time because of that as well as other things!"
246,isfj,"my experience: as a male ISFJ i find it sometimes hard to be around other extraverts, both female and male. what i find most surprising is the sometimes lack of acceptance from other people. but back on point: i'm not an active contact seeker near females, and when eventually i might start talking they always call me a nice guy and continue on. mostly due to the fact i'm not a daring personality. but also the fact of most people not recognising the different personalities. "
247,isfj,"My Dad I COULD NOT STOP TYPING ISTP. It took some serious result analysis, and observing the common ISTP traits, until I realized ISFJ fit perfectly. This is because he acts like an ISTP in EVERY WAY, but he cares too much, isn't as guided by logic, and isn't as stereotypically lazy."
248,isfj,"Actually, as a female isfj, I seem to attract a lot of ladies. I think it’s the way I carry myself sometimes comes off masculine somehow. Makes me wish I was gay sometimes, lol
Also I’ve seen male isfjs who are quite committed to their male identity. One of them dresses very well but more towards the street wear end of the fashion spectrum.
But yeah, I’d agree with you that on average the isfj personality type is more “submissive”, orderly, and concerned with appearance which are all stereotypical traits of straight women and gay men. Just doesn’t apply for some reason in my personal experience."
249,isfj,"I could see that, I am dating an ISFJ guy and he is very ISTJ, almost more than some that I know tested ISTJ. Super traditional, hard worker, family above everything type. 
I do think its funny about the way the dress/come off as presented in this thread though. He does dress very well and is well groomed. "
250,isfj,I would not say that all isfj are submissive - more like polite. And I actually could see how some isfj ladies would be attractive to lesbians - we assume all isfj's are materialistic but you guys can also be paternalistic just like istj....
251,isfj,"That's the same conclusion I came to, when I realized he only acted like the stereotypical ""aloof"" but inserted in ""theory"" type, in his spare time when he was having fun. It didn't dictate his life in any way."
252,isfj,"Hi Everyone, we have created a welcoming Whatsapp home. It's a very active group and it's super fun! Everyone is hilarious and very friendly. It's equal number Feelers/Thinkers. It's a very warm community we've formed together.

254,isfj,"I have a degree in finance and have been working for wealth management firms.  Recently, I was ""restructured"" out of my job and am unemployed.  I just recently found that I am an ISFJ, and, in fact, am realizing that I wish I may have chosen a different path.  Have any of you found yourselves going back to school or using an existing degree in a different industry?  Do you have any help you can offer me?
Thanks"
255,isfj,"Originally I had started my post-secondary career with the intentions I becoming an archivist, however the job market is basically non-existent. So I did the teaching thing but realized pretty quickly it'd be exhausting. Now I work in agriculture with animals! I sill have to talk to people but I get to talk to the animals more! :)  "
256,isfj,"I was set since 5th grade to go to Devry for programming and game design, was all set by the end of my high school career and ready to attend then had a very outta the blue epiphany about WHAT I want to do.  Now I'm geared more towards the musical engineering path. 
All i can say is that its never ""TOO"" late to make a career choice, just make sure when you do choose one, you hop to it. You can only wait for so long."
257,isfj,"I was in medical school but I've recently left it to pursue my PhD in cell/molecular/cancer biology...so I'm starting to wonder if I'm actually an ISFJ at all! You'd think I'd want to help people via medicine...but there's way more to being a doctor than just helping people, which I found out the hard way."
258,isfj,"That's a really good idea.  I would like to work in some way to help people.  Thought of doing finance for senior living communities or hospitals, but no one seems to be hiring or requires medical background in order to look at me.  With a degree in finance, I could just take some accounting classes and take the CPA exam, and that would open up some more opportunities, but I feel like would be me just choosing the shortest path, but I wouldn't really be satisfied by it.
I need to find out how to do something with healthcare without having to deal with body fluids.  I think I might try out your mapping technique.  
I feel like there are so many careers out there, but I only know of a small percent.  I get afraid that I will head down one path, the uncover a new career that I will wish I was working toward."
259,isfj,"why don't you find the possible employers for the jobs that you are looking for and express your interest/ask them how they got there and what their job is like etc etc. they may even inform you of other similar things or opportunities that you wouldn't really know of, unless you're in that field already! you never know if they're hiring or not! i mean you have nothing to lose by doing this! as redundant as it is, networking is key!! for getting hired but also useful for finding inspiration! :)"
260,isfj,"HR is something on my list!  :)
I did the Self-Guided Test which shows I am an ICS (investigative, conventional, social).  That result does ring true with my desires in a career, so I really need to keep that in mind as I decide what to do.
Edit: so, on the test you sent me, I scored highest on Helping followed closely by Technical."
261,isfj,"Two things that I find myself doing subconsciously when I'm attracted to someone:


Making an effort to be around them as much as possible, for as long as possible. Calculating excuses to interact with them more often than normal.


Acting exponentially more energetic and social than normal. This is huge. Normally I am more reserved and less talkative at social events, but if someone I'm interested in is around, I find myself acting more extroverted in groups (joking and goofing off, telling stories, and generally taking a more active role in conversating).


These signs of attraction are probably true of most personality types, but with introverts it's a dead giveaway.
(copied from a previous post)"
262,isfj,"Observe how he treats others. If he's being nicer and caring to you (to great lengths and overexerting himself) much more than than to others (and if you seem to be the priority person), he probably likes you."
263,isfj,"You’re a hilariously brilliant entp, he’s interested. My entp boyfriend and I (isfj) had a natural pull to one another - we just wanted to be close to one another and spend time with each other. Our first date ended up being around 10+ hours long, with excessive texting after when we couldn’t see one another. Prior to either party indicating interest, we may not be as inclined to be so foreword with texting, conversing, and making attempts to be too close as to not overwhelm you with our fascination with you. ;) "
264,isfj,"Fellow ENTP here. As you can see from my own posting history here, I have my own experiences trying to uncover whether an ISFJ coworker is interested in me or just being friendly (genders reversed though). And actually this seems to be a very common occurrence on this subreddit --- there's some undeniable pull between ENTPs and ISFJs, so that should all give us hope. 
From my experience, being more talkative in 1 on 1 settings compared to in groups is a great sign. ISFJs don't open up and give their trust easily, meaning they're going to be on guard in mixed company. As a super open ENTP it really threw me off for the longest time when my ISFJ coworker would act in such a cold and detached manner with me if we were having lunch with a larger group of people she wasn't particularly close with --- and then BAM nothing but smiles and laughter and smooth conversing if it were just the two of us (or with a few other trusted friends). 
So yeah, it takes a little getting used to. But then again, would you want it the other way? Where they will be talkative in a group but clam up if you're alone together? Definitely not. "
265,isfj,ISFJs tend to like people who can keep a conversation (because we can't) so if he just invited you that probably.means he thinks you can do that which is a good thing. Also think Jim and Pam from the office. 
266,isfj,"ENTPs and ISFJs are said to be ""dual"" types or ideal matches for each other, so this type of interest and certain magnetic pull between them is certainly not uncommon. p.s. it doesn't even have to be romantic, friendship will work just as well: Love Types for ISFJs & Love Types for ENTPs."

268,isfj,"Hello there, ENTJ here.  
My dad is an ISFP, and my stepmom/his ex-wife is an ISFJ.  They've been having an on-off relationship for 5 years now, and have broken up twice now.  She broke up with him both times because she had problems with him not being emotionally supportive as she would have liked, and his general ISFPness of not liking to be tied down and at her beck and call.  Having spent long amounts of time with the both of them around, a relationship with either of them can sometimes feel like walking on eggshells.
As of 6 months ago, my stepmom told me they were definitely not getting back together.  But due to a string of recent events this summer, her anxiety has risen to the point where I cannot stand to be around her.  Along with the anxiety came a renewed interest in trying to get back together with my dad.  In fact, she is supposedly 100% invested this reunion.  My dad is unsure about it, but willing to try for the sake of his kids with her.  They're both so stubborn and don't communicate their feelings well, so even if the relationship sucks, they'll both suffer in silence until it reaches a boiling point.
My question is, why might my ISFJ stepmom be suddenly interested in getting back with my dad?  I'm thinking it's just the anxiety and need for human companionship, and she's willing to settle for my dad.  Is it a long-term thing, or should I plan for her to become a barnacle in his life?  I'm just worried that my dad will get stuck in this loop all over again, when it took him several years to get back to total contentedness with his life.  I don't want her to just use him until she feels like she doesn't need him anymore.  My dad is already starting to feel some resentment from this new relationship, but he'll stick it out forever because he hates confrontation.  
I also want to continue to have a relationship with my dad, but he doesn't have any time because my stepmom has been so needy, and her and I are not currently on speaking terms (arose from her fictitious anxieties).  What do you think, ISFJ's?"
269,isfj,"Sounds to me like you might be pretty close to accurate. Obviously I don't know your stepmom, but I know when I'm feeling very anxious I have to fight down the urge to reach out to other people for comfort. Personally I try not to do that because it makes me feel selfish, although I couldn't say if that's really true or just my bad self-esteem talking :P Anyway though if your stepmom isn't very mature/self-aware it seems possible that she may be using a similar coping mechanism. 
Anyway if you're comfortable with it and think he would be open to hearing it, I would try and talk to your dad about it. Hopefully hearing from you that the nature of their relationship is making you feel isolated from him will help him to step back and reevaluate, but I can't say for sure that that will be the case. My aunt's ex-husband has ended up in a similar relationship and for a long time he wasn't willing to do much about it, so it will probably depend a lot on your dad. Good luck, though! "
270,isfj,"Yeah, neither of them are very self-aware or mature.  My dad is a free-spirit and just goes along with everything she says (but then complains to me).  He wouldn't like it if he felt like I was pressuring him to do anything, even to stand up for himself.  My stepmom is generally selfish and egocentric, and really plays the needy victim a lot.  My dad will want time to himself, and she'll be like, ""So you don't care about me anymore?""  It's not a question of whether they'll break up, it's just when.  The disfunctionality is starting to set in again, and I'd rather it not drag on for a year or more.
Btw, you should not feel bad about reaching out to people.  Everybody has the same anxieties to some extent, so it's easy to be compassionate; it just seems that some types feel them more.  What drives me crazy is being a target of the anxiety/anger (as was my stepmom's case)."
271,isfj,"I'm a 29 year old guy, married.
Right now I work for my cousin doing data entry very part time (no more than 15 hrs/w) my wife works part time as well (she is an ISFP.) We both enjoy working part time as it gives us a lot of quiet time together.
But I often feel bad that she works more while I sit at home and I have recently started searching for a new part time job with more hours, but I want something satisfying.
what kind of job should I look for?
I have a decent history in medical, which I didn't hate, but didn't like either (was a CNA, EMT, and have an expired Basic X-ray license.) I really like working with computer and have a basic talent for it. I prefer to work evenings and again part time is preferable."
272,isfj,"If you have a decent bio background as well as a love for computers I would suggest something like bioinformatics, the jobs are kind of few and far between, but it sounds like something you would love from the thirty seconds I spent reading this post :P a lot of them have potential for telecommuting as well.

274,isfj,"I internalize most of my thoughts and find small talk/conversations about nothing to be incredibly tiring. I often don't even have words to say or contribute. If I'm not going to say something important, I'm just not going to say anything. 
If the conversation topic is something I'm passionate about or extremely knowledgeable about, or the person I'm talking to is, I can talk for hours. I love love love those conversations. The problem is the opportunity for them is rare.. So if I'm with a group of people talking about nothing in particular I typically won't have anything to contribute. This can make me feel awkward/ seen as the boring one of the group. It maybe makes them feel awkward too.
Does anyone else deal with this? Is something I should even work towards changing?"
275,isfj,"I still feel a bit tense during small talk, but it's mostly pretty easy by now. Generally, I only make small talk for a little bit -- if the conversation doesn't naturally go somewhere more interesting, I'm content to let it die off. 
I'm sure you can find tons of advice on making small talk on the Internet and on subs like /r/socialskills, like ""Be interested in other people and ask them questions about stuff they bring up"", so I won't give you general advice on that; besides, I'm hardly a master conversationalist. 
Really, you can try to make an effort making small talk -- and I think you should at least sometimes, small talk is an important step to real, in-depth discussion. But if you don't feel like talking, it shouldn't be too rude to participate only when you're addressed. Like /u/robotrick said, there's a certain value to remaining silent. It's what I personally do when I don't really want to participate. Of course, you shouldn't do that all the time. If a conversation doesn't seem to hold anything for you, it's fine to sit it out, but personally I usually like to say one or two little things, maybe ask some small questions, to show that I'm paying attention for most conversations. "
276,isfj,"I'm in a profession where I have to do meet-and-greets with the public every now and then, and I've found myself reading off of a list of questions in my mind to keep a conversation going. Once it's done, I can say goodbye and move on, or hopefully they will have already started talking to me about something else."
277,isfj,"I don't typically enjoy small talk for what it is, but I find awkward silences to be even more uncomfortable. Like other posters have mentioned, an effort needs to be made - and the best part about small talk is, you don't really have to pressure yourself to keep the conversation going beyond what you're comfortable with."
278,isfj,"This was one of the biggest struggles I've had in life. I feel like I've gotten better but sometimes I get insecure about small talk but as someone else said, I dislike awkward silence even more since I'm afraid of just being boring to the other person."

281,isfj,"I just watched it for the second time and I laughed just as hard as when I saw it the first time. My wife and I really enjoy this film. The main character seems like an ISFJ to me, not only in his hilarious occupational role (finding crafty ways to break apart relationships, Fe-Ti with Fi helping him repair things and kind of find his north star in the end) but also in his general ISFJ-like appearance and organizational approach. I'm a comparatively brutish thinker-dude and this protagonist is SO ADORABLE. His love interest seemed like an ESTJ to me, much more direct and up-front (maybe pushy at times) in her communication style (Te-dominant), softened by a values-oriented feeling side (Fi) with an impactful aesthetic (Se). Anyway, not to blab but I wonder if anyone else here has seen it.
We also watched the first episode of Young & Hungry, and Gabi & Josh seem like ESFJ + ENFP. OK I'm done here. Thanks :-)"

283,isfj,"I am an ISFJ girl dating an ENFP guy. I rarely see posts about the ISFJ and ENFP combo so I would love to learn more! 
I want to know your experiences dating an ENFP and how it turned out.
I know communication isn't our biggest strength but I am actively trying to improve on that. 
I am trying to figure out what makes them happy, sad, their love language, etc. 
Thanks for sharing! "
284,isfj,"Hello you lovely ISFJ, 
I am an ENFP girl, and currently in a relationship with an ISTP. 
I had an affair with an ISFJ - thus the throwaway account - Meeting an ISFJ was something new for me, probably why I got into that affair in the first place. I absolutely adore the way they will put you in the center when they love you. I remember feeling particularly special when an ISFJ loves me. I get showered with attention and affection.
... And you know what ENFPs like - it's attention. 
What makes them happy : being with people that they're comfortable with, new and exciting things, affection (which ISFJs have plenty of when you love someone), receiving things (doesn't necessarily have to be huge or expensive - the more thought you put into it, the more sentimental it becomes to us)
What makes them sad : conflicts, criticisms, isolation, we feel it when you get frustrated at us, being ignored and being left out
Love language : very affectionate, likes giving things, likes being around you when we like you, gets jealous when you start showing attention to someone else, likes doing things for you, would please you first sexually (like, I get turned on knowing my partner is turned on)
I don't particularly remember that the ISFJ I met had problems with communication. He easily opened up to me and back then he had depression problems. When he found some other girl and when it was time to end the affair, he didn't have difficulty either expressing what he wanted.  
Do not worry about expressing emotions, ENFPs are good at understanding them. I think being both F's makes it easy for you to love each other. "
285,isfj,"Enfp woman with isfj guy. We've been married for 19 years. I wouldn't have it any other way. I feel like he's the yin to my yang. He keeps me grounded when I'm flying every where. He understands that I need light and will drag me out of the dark, sometimes against my will. He's easy going when i should be. 
The only thing I'd change about us is that we never seem to finish a project. Have a boojillion started. About 3 completed. In 19 years. :-)"
286,isfj,"I like older cats that are calm and don’t need constant attention. I like older dogs that like to play but don’t need constant care. Dogs are better for hugging and cuddling. Cats can be too much for me. 
At the end of the day I’m a dog guy. "
287,isfj,"I don’t know, maybe it’s just me and not an ISFJ thing but I just felt like getting this out of my system. 
So I’m in my first year of university and it’s been amazing. Everyone is so great and cool. But I feel a bit behind, in a sense. Everyone seems to have something to say about the world, like politics and humanity and civil rights and stuff, things that feel very “intellectual”, if you know what I mean. I can never participate in those kinds of conversations because I can’t hold my own opinions. And I just don’t feel that I’m “educated” or “smart” enough to have those discussions. 
I’m trying to learn more about those things so I can at least understand what they’re talking about (and my introverted ass finally has an excuse to attempt joining the convo) but the more I try the more weird it feels because I’m essentially trying to be someone I’m not, if that makes any sense at all...
Idk i guess i’m just asking for validation. anyone who’s had similar experiences?"
288,isfj,"First & foremost don’t beat yourself up about it!
If you haven’t traveled down the rabbit hole of “cognitive functions” I would suggest looking into it, Type in Mind seems like a very resourceful website because it breaks down each personality types cognitive functions.
ISFJ’s top weakest cognitive function is Ne (extroverted intuition), from what I understand, this is what sparks our curiosity & what triggers learning.
So for example my INTP boyfriend will go on about WWII or astrophysics & I kind of just sit there & listen, (frankly those topics don’t interest me), I do feel bad for not contributing to the conversation tho because I really just don’t know what to say. Or he’ll want to watch something educational & I’m like noooo 😩 haha
It’s just how our brains function, but if you feel embarrassed for not knowing as much everyone else in the group you can always do your own research on the topic & come back to continue the discussion."
289,isfj,"Take it from someone who wasted too much time arguing about politics in 2016 - 99% of political discussions are the philosophical equivalent of gold-plated poop.  It's all just bumper sticker rhetoric and biased partisanship dressed up to sound smart so people can pat themselves on the back for being ""on the right side of history"".  The people who sound ""smart"" are often just reciting sound bites someone else came up with and don't actually have their own ideas.  This is especially true in the early years of university where 99% of people have spent their entire life living at home with little to no responsibility or real world life experience. Most conversations at this point don't even go beyond the first layer of depth to any topic since everyone's just learning these things for the first time. 
You can learn a lot through active listening and asking pointed questions during these conversations.  Take your time figuring things out and let yourself be curious. But I think you just want to relate to other people who are in your shoes; my friend said the same thing to me (""how do you know all that stuff?"") two years ago (age 26) and current me can confidently say I didn't actually know much at that point. I'd just spent a few months listening to conservative podcasts and reading opinion articles. "
290,isfj,"I struggled with this problem in my first year of univeristy too, I felt really out place and the fact that I had SO MUCH to learn made me feel really uneasy, so that problem ended up being a terrible burden during those days. Whenever I tried to learn about something I didn't really enjoy, I couldn't keep any information in my head. But I can tell you that you'll be happier if you don't force it and just try to learn little by little all the things your environment asks you to, your years of study and the experiences you'll have to live will teach you.   
Plus I can give you a little tip: if there's something you want to learn but it's really hard for you to do so, you can try to asociate that thing to something you actually really like. My favorite way of learning about history of the world, which was something that made me really worried because I didn't know ANYTHING, was through events on the history of film (which I had to study as a subject at uni), scenes that appeared on actual films, and music. "
291,isfj,"Yeah, I think I do something familiar. Since we're like people pleasers, in a sense,  we want to get along with people and are interested in THEIR interests. However, as you said, we lose our individuality kind of because that's not who we are, really. 
Don't worry though, university is a big place and I'm confident that you'll find someone who has the same interests with you and can actually connect with you, mutually and not one sided. Don't lose hope! It's my first year at University as well, and it's such a big transition from high school. High school really didn't prepare me enough for University and life, haha."
292,isfj,"Ah, the good old imposter syndrome. It's definitely a thing and you're not alone!! I was in the same boat back in my first year too. We meet so many new people with different areas of ""expertise"", knowledge, and interests so it seems like the areas we aren't as familiar with are magnified. I'm in my third year now and most, if not all, of my imposter syndrome is gone. To put it as politely as I can, people are actually way more stupid than you think lol. Now that I've made friends with the people that seemed so far and out of reach, theyre great and have inspired me to work hard. They also know that I am a competent person and have thoughtful opinions, so that put all my anxieties at ease. I hope you get through this OP, as you're definitely NOT less than those around you. It might take some time or as cliché as it sounds, just finding the ""right"" people. "
293,isfj,"ahh i see sometimes i actually enjoy learning random stuff from people around me, but sometimes i just don’t feel like listening to them ramble on and on and on like they’re some pro when they’re not. like my roommate. she’s in chinese medicine and she’s only in year one too but she keeps diagnosing me on how terrible my body condition is and while it’s nice to have her around telling me random facts, i can’t stand her when she nags me to eat less fried food like a controlling mother. "
294,isfj,"i did ponder for some time whether they were trying to be fake... it would make me feel better if they were, and i agree that they might not have much experience. i think i was more envious of their quick wit? and how they’re able to counter-argue each other so rapidly."
295,isfj,thanks so much!! it is so overwhelming and sometimes it just feels like i’m not smart enough to be there. (my uni has a collegiate system and it’s well known for taking in kids with great scores i.e. mostly smart and idk how i got in loll)
296,isfj,"omg yes i feel like i do lose my individuality at times when dealing with other people. it’s why i periodically feel completely empty and alone because of something like imposter syndrome? like i don’t ever show my real self and the friends i’ve made don’t actually know me when i never intended for it to be that way.
wishing you all the best in your first year, too! let’s both do our best<3"
297,isfj,"Oh don’t get me wrong, depending on the subject I enjoy listening as well, however I tend to zone out if the subject isn’t particularly intriguing anymore or at all for that matter lol 🤣
I totally understand what you mean! It’s really annoying when people are like that & in my head I’m like “OKAY I GET IT!!!!!” But I’m sorry your roommate does that :/ I can only imagine how frustrating that can be, I’m sure she doesn’t mean anything by it."
298,isfj,"They are intuitives.  A lot of them go to college, fewer sensors do. You aren't used to seeing them interact in groups.  Its the same with teachers. The lower grades have more sensor teachers and the further you go the more intuitive teachers there are. 
The person who commented that what they are spewing is poop was right. Stick to your strong suit which is actual facts. :D You are going to be amazing in whatever you choose to do."
299,isfj,"OMG CAN RELATE i totally zone out all the time and i just end up beating myself up a little for not paying attention to someone who’s kindly ‘teaching’ me stuff lol. 
well my roommate is just like that i can’t really help it. i just don’t talk to her if i don’t feel like it lol like every time i do i make sure i’m feeling up to giving her a lot of reactions and stuff lmao"
300,isfj,"I wouldn't try to develop it at all.  Maybe spend a little time in conversation with an Ne primary or secondary.  Maybe spend a little time drawing up abstract gardening designs or writing poetry.  But from what I've read it's best to focus on your strengths and mitigate the damage caused by your inferior.  Often this damage is caused by obsession with what you think you want (inferior), and what you're best at; how you perceive primarily.  "
301,isfj,"I have an Ni-inferior, as opposed to an Ne-inferior, but the best advice I could probably give you is don't even worry about it.
Your inferior is unconscious, and it's already pretty happy there! Just focus on your Si-Fe, and use Ti when you're in the mood to relax. The routine will soothe you, and when you're in the flow of it you will have the opportunity to catch glimpses of your iNtuition. "
302,isfj,"Hmmm, I do spend quite a bit of time with a Ne secondary (INTP). I have not come across this theory of mitigating the damage caused by the inferior, in favour of trying to develop them. I'll look into it further thank you for taking the time to reply. "
303,isfj,No problem.  If you find anything on it post me it if you would.  I read it quite a while ago and haven't looked into it since; though I think it makes sense to focus all your energy on developing strengths since it would be far less efficient to spend energy on inferior function because it takes far more energy to develop for the time spent and also may have limits to how far it can be developed at all.
304,isfj,"Piggybacking off of this recent post about how we act when we're drunk, I am wondering, how do you know when you're drunk? Can you steadily feel yourself getting buzzed and then drunk or do you feel sober until you try to go to the bathroom? Is it your vision, your balance, your speech, mannerisms, etc.? 
​"
305,isfj,"I personally feel like my limbs are very loose and kind of heavy. I like to shake my shoulders to tell if I'm just buzzed or if I'm drunk. Also, I usually hear my speech start slurring before I feel drunk, and at this point of being buzzed I will be friendly and talkative, so then I'll think, ""uh oh, I can hear that I'm drunk!"" and usually within a few minutes I start feeling a bit dizzy or lightheaded. Going to the bathroom is where I face exactly how drunk I am because it's one of the things you've been doing your entire life and you do it often so it's usually quite easy, but it just feels like a quest or something trying to keep it together while I pull my pants back up without falling over or something, lol! I feel this need to walk! Especially if I am drunk at night, I just really want to go outside and go for a nice drunk walk so when I start feeling that pull, I know I'm more than buzzed. 
I wanted to ask this question because a friend of mine said his first sign of being drunk was his eyes got kinda fuzzy and then his balance was off, and had no idea what I meant by loose heavy limbs! "
306,isfj,"Not an ISFJ, but I like the question. ;)   
Drunkenness is a continuum, so I suspect it'll be interesting to see where everyone decides the line is.   
In the past, I've been a bit of a tank--to the point where most people can't tell that I'm feeling anything, even if my subjective experience is screaming to the contrary. It can be hard for me to will myself to engage with other people, and I count myself as ""officially drunk"" at that point where my face feels like a swarm of bees and it takes herculean effort to remain present for a conversation. This is when I retreat to my cave. Lol.  "
307,isfj,"When I'm drunk, I start to feel very lightheaded. My arms and hand numb, and as I drink more, my face goes numb. I can't speak for everyone, but for me, I start to talk much louder than I think, and I start to say weird or random things without thinking about it."
308,isfj,"I get this (( l i g h t )) sensation in my head, then my limbs.. it's like.. an internal floating yet some sort of heavy sensation :D ..I can't explain it.. and I feel what I call 'high', wherein I'm just :) :) :) and soooo relaxed.. in my speech, actions, calmness.. I feel as if the time slows down, and I am more aware.. like, a stillness mentally, despite physical 'floating' or dizzyness all over the body.. I love listening to music, because it feels more beautiful to listen to music in this state, sometimes, I feel more high because of intoxication I get from music that only heightens my drunken experience :D While walking, I feel I may fall down if I am not careful, has never happened.. but I love that feeling, it makes me laugh to try to walk without falling down :D I also blush easily during this state.. 
On the outside, I look :) :) :).. almost the same as my sober self lol"
309,isfj,"Proper drunk? The thought ""Oh god I can't feel my teeth"" normally pops into my head.
Most people can't tell when I have a good buzz going until it's approaching drunk. Probably because  the entire time I actually act like a normal human being that can interact and chat with others haha."
310,isfj,"I love that sentence so much, lol. I think it'll just be interesting to see how different everyone actually is"
311,isfj,"Yes! The light sensation, it's heavy and light at the same time... that's why I said heavy but loose... and I shake the limbs lol! My friend looked at me like I was insane when I tried to explain this lol "
312,isfj,"Well, long story short I had an isfj coworker, at least I'm pretty sure he was an isfj. Admittedly we didn't work together very long but when we did we bonded extremely well before he was transferred.We had all of the same interests and would talk for hours sometimes. Also, he was constantly joking around with me, going out of his way to approach and mess with me, literally every possible opportunity. Well, a problem happened at my work after he left and I texted him for the first time asking for his opinion on the issue. His response was very brief and curt so I assumed that I had crossed over a line since we didn't work together long and didn't text him again. 
Well, he came back to my workplace to get his last paycheck and went looking for me to talk. When he tracked me down, he was super friendly, asking me if everything was ok, and encouraging me to text if any other issues came up, saying he wanted to know and that I wasn't going to bother him. After he left the building he also sent a text reassuring that I wasn't bother him and to let him know if any other issues came up. So weeks later I texted, updating him on the situation which had gotten worse and asked him how his new job was going. He basically only responded to how his job was going in one short curt sentence and didn't respond to my situation at all. That was about two months ago. Idk.. I know he didn't have any obligation to respond to me at all but it seems weird because he was encouraging me to keep contacting him then his responses almost seem like he's annoyed when I do. I've seen other threads on different sites about how isfj's are bad with keeping contact with people but I don't know if that was true and just thought I would get this subreddit's opinion. Thanks. "
313,isfj,"I’m good at keeping in contact with people who are part of my daily routine - family, current coworkers, close friends - but absolutely horrible with keeping up with people I don’t see regularly. It doesn’t mean I don’t care about them, but it gives me a lot of anxiety to reach out to someone I haven’t seen in a while. "
314,isfj,"I am absolutely awful with keeping in contact with people. I will go several hours without checking my phone.
Now, that's not to say that's the reason your former co-worker is being short with you. Some people are just really bad at texting and others just forget about people quickly.
Maybe text him again in the future and decide if you are still interested in talking to him?"
315,isfj,"I'm really bad at keeping in contact with most people, especially via text.... there are a few people I'm very close to who are exceptions, but generally speaking, even if I like someone, I don't want them to text me. That sounds bad, but it gives me anxiety and I'm bad at keeping a conversation going (plus half the time I just straight up check the text, close the app to think about my response, and then forget to ever answer because the notification is gone), so old friends/acquaintances texting me out of nowhere gives me huge anxiety. If they're not someone who I click with on a level where I wanna be texting them every day, my anxiety wants me to just forget they exist so I can forget the shame and guilt of not being able to start/keep up a conversation like a normal human being lol.
Aside from all of that though, it also just sounds like he might not be a great texter?? Some people totally forget or just don't understand that tone comes across very differently via text than in person, so they can accidentally seem really harsh or rude. It's hard to say, but if he deliberately sought you out in person then I doubt he dislikes you at all. "
316,isfj,"100% true for me. Even when I want to, I feel like I just can’t"
317,isfj,We mean well but we get caught up in current life and it will stay in the back of our minds as a quiet reminder to reach out as you said you would. Almost never happens. My true friends will make plans with me then just bail at the last minute. My friends are introverts.
318,isfj,"Wow you sound exactly like my boyfriend. When I first met him I was sure that he wasn't interested in me because he would go hours with messaging me be back, but after a few months and a confused talk I realized that's just how he is."
319,isfj,"I created a new account just to ask this because it's kinda embarrassing but here goes: I'm a female INFJ in a questionable fwb situation with a male ISFJ and, from the very beginning, I've always liked him as more than a friend. However, he never seem interested in anything romantic from the get-go despite the mutual flirting. He has a flirty nature so I never expected anything out of that; I was just there for the good time. I told him I didn't want to label our flirty rls as anything (to avoid the pressure of getting boxed into one thing) but he was insistent that it be labeled for his peace of mind and so fwb it became. But time has passed and I've felt the need to try and get closer to him as a friend. (The gf desire has been trashed, so no worries there.) So now I'm wondering if it's even possible?   
He's become comfortable enough with me to share some personal things he hadn't been willing to before so I took that as a good sign. However, making small talk with him feels awkward and all my attempts to pry into his life like a normal friend would (""How was your day?"" ""How do you like that episode?"") gets met with disinterest. After writing this out, it seems obvious that he's only interested in me for the ""benefits"" part... but I guess I'm looking for another perspective to see if I've missed anything. How do I get to know an ISFJ better as a friend?"
320,isfj,"Maybe I'm a traditionalist, but perhaps starting with benefits undermines your ability to form a friendship.  It doesn't sound to me like this guy wants anything beyond getting off.  Is he ever willing to hang out when sex isn't on the table?"
321,isfj,"Irregardless of him (possibly) being an ISFJ: honey, fwb relationships where one person wants more romantically while the other one is only interested in sex never end well. Trust me, I have experience. Even though it was 8 years ago it damaged me, and has altered the way I look at sex till this day. Offering your body to someone who doesn’t want you romantically (and from your story: isn’t even interested in you as a fellow human being) is bound to end badly. I’m not telling you what to do but your question hit a nerve. Please, please, reconsider what you’re doing to yourself."
322,isfj,"That's how I am. My answers would be ""good, you?"" and ""it was good"" or ""It sucked."" If we were watching a show together I would react and discuss during and immediately after the show. But those questions aren't for me they feel like they're for you to fill up silence. Talk to me about the episode or something, like, ""when X was revealed to be the kidnapper I had no clue that was gonna happen, did you?"" 
Small talk seems no good for ISFJ. However I dunno if he's just like this or if he is treating you with disinterest because talking isn't a ""benefit"" :("
323,isfj,"I agree with u/sunzusunzusunzusunzu
I feel like in this situation, instead of asking about his day and asking him to reveal details about himself straight up, just talk to him and ask his opinion on things. Get him talking animatedly about a movie or a TV series that you both know - find an inside joke and use that to progress further. Keep it very much about other things than personal things to start off with.
I also feel like either he is not interested in taking this relationship beyond simply what it is at the moment , or being very careful not to let it become something possibly complicated and ambiguous.
Just my two cents"
324,isfj,"No need to be technical.  I just want to know how you perceive yourselves and others specific to this type.  What do you notice that resonates with the ISFJ personality type? Instead of “traits or characteristics” that are so often used within the Myers-Briggs terminology, I would like to hear examples, stories, and/or perspectives you can offer.  I plan on posting this question in each Myers-Briggs specific subreddit to help foster understanding and create insight through first person experiences and perceptions. "
325,isfj,"In 3 words: Quiet, Loyal, Systematic
Quiet - Obviously most introverts are perceived to be quiet. Generally through a mix of general shyness and not wanting to be a burden or potentially annoy other people if we didnt speak when they didnt need to hear us. If going through stress, anxiety or just trying to avoid conflict or say something negative we don't want to.... expect an ISFJ to clam up even more. 
Loyal - For better or worse we really like to stick to/be loyal things we have a emotional connection to. It could be to just a few family/friends you know well,  sticking to a certain few hobbies/restaurants a lot and getting very invested in them, or sticking to a job because you know how to do it and/or you'll feel bad leaving for something else when the people need help. Our past helps defines us very well and we consciously or unconsciously refer to it when doing anything.
Systematic - I don't want to say organized cuz even Judging types can have things like messy rooms. When an ISFJ wants to do something they have a set way with steps and how long it should hopefully take. They are very particular of when to use money, more than most/all types. If something needs to be done if it's not laid out in a way thats easy to understand way or includes some kind of instructions, could throw ISFJ for a loop."
326,isfj,"I never thought of that, but when I don't have a clear plan, I can procrastinate indefinitely.
Thanks for the insight."
327,isfj,"It was a huge revelation to me that i could just drive wherever i wanted, however i wanted. 
i was on the way to the gym and wanted to give a homelessman some money but the light turned green and the road was under construction so everyone was pretty mad as is.
i thought ""i guess i can't give him cash because i have to go now""
and then i thought ""wait....what if i drive around the block. my car isn't on tracks and i don't have to take the same exact route there"".
adaptability has been a constantly difficult thing to master."

329,isfj,"Suppose, Lord willing, in the distant future I finally settle down with someone that I want to spend the rest of my life with. And for our anniversary I go up to her and say, ""nothing will delight me more than to spend the evening with you tonight."" She would never say to me, ""Sam, you are so selfish. All you ever think about is what will bring you pleasure. That is why you asked me out tonight. Only because I make you satisfied."" She would never say that because I am glorifying her satisfying qualities and holding her affections worthy of praise.  
This approach may appear very hedonistic but Duty, although necessary for a relationship isn't sufficient. 
We don't glorify pleasure when we take supreme pleasure in enjoying somebody else. But rather, we are offering the highest of praise to our significant others. 
Just thoughts. "
330,isfj,"None of them are appealing to me. I don't think I'd be suited to the medical field. Compensation manager wouldn't be ideal as I wouldn't like having to tell people they cant get compensation because of some little clause in a contract (I think F types wouldnt like that job)
I'm an engineer by the way. I'm quite fascinated by psychology these days and think I would of been quite good at it. I think anything where you are one on one with someone such as a nutritionist or a personal trainer etc etc.. could be good jobs for isfjs"
331,isfj,"Who doesn't ?
¯(ツ)/¯
It's mesmerizing.
It reminds me videos with gyroscopes I've seen on Youtube.

Also, I'm an ENTP. So …

On a side note, can the mods here pull up the flairs ? It will prevent me to state my type every time I post here, which is good for my natural laziness. Wink wink"
332,isfj,INTP (supposedly) here.  I can be entertained rather easily with only a spinning chair and enough leg room to spin around without obstruction.  That one Gravitron-or-whatever-it's-called carnival ride is also one of my favorites.
333,isfj,"So I've had an insecurity where I'm aware I'm a very quiet person even among friends. It's not that I don't have anything to say it's the stuff I want to say I either feel is: I'm not knowledgeable enough on subject to say something, someone has already said something I would have said, what I want to say not relevant to conversation, if I say the wrong thing I'll get people angry.  
Even when it comes to just talking about what I've been up to I get super conservative about talking about myself. Just don't want to bore/annoy people with my life since a lot of stuff I like isn't stuff a lot of my friends either don't know about or don't like. 
I just want to be more open to talk in conversations. Or just talk more about my life because I doubt it's as boring to talk about as I think it is. Anyone have any suggestions to deal with this or have dealt with this before?"
334,isfj,You sound just like me. I do believe it is a confidence thing. It helps when you've got a lot of things going on for yourself and you're working towards accomplishing a goal. You have to put yourself out there and speak your mind. More reference experience will help you gain the confidence to contribute to future conversations.
335,isfj,"Lack of confidence seems to be a big part of it.
Normally I suggest to do sports to gain confidence, but I don't know if that would work in this case. There are courses that can help you gain confidence. A former friend of me once did such a course and it did really changed her. She's standing much more her ground now.
Good luck!"
336,isfj,"Also, it sounds like you're very mindful of what you're feeling and what others are feeling. I make it a point to have others talk to me about what's going on in their lives or what's interesting to them.  They'll get to the point where they ask you about what you're doing. Don't water down your own thoughts and interests because then people will think you're unwilling to share with them. "
337,isfj,"Hello,
I have always had a hard time connecting deeply with others. I always just thought it was me until I recently did the personality test and found this community. I'm blown away by how similarly I feel.
Basically, I'm very nice and friendly with everyone and will go out of my way to make sure everyone around me is comfortable, while I feel out of place myself. But you would never know it by seeing me. 
I find it practically impossible to open up to others and have been feeling increasingly more lonely as what I need is a deep bond to feel connected. I will always help and take care of others as much as I can but don't feel comfortable enough to be open with others with how I am. All my friendships are basically just ""surface"", very rarely have I felt close enough with someone to consider them a true friend, and that doesn't always last, I put in the effort but need to feel it reciprocated. 
I feel alone in large groups and can get easily overrun by others, mostly I stay silent unless I'm spoken to. In smaller groups, it's easier but I still have a very hard time being comfortable.
Anyway that's about it! I just wanted to introduce myself and see if anyone feels the same way or would want to talk :) 
Have a wonderful night!"
338,isfj,"Making new friends is very exhausting to me. 
In the past I had many one-sided ""surface"" friendships and the older I got, the more selective I became in the people I befriended, because non-reciprocal ""small talk"" relationships cost me too much energy (and frustration).. Whenever I meet someone and it doesn't go smooth from the beginning, I realize I'm better off alone (with my boyfriend), eventually. I relate to the other stuff, too. * THE INTROVERT LIFE *"
339,isfj,"Hm, posts like these make me question whether I'm ESFJ or ISFJ. For me, I find it relatively easy to open up to others and consider many to be friends. Despite all of that, I feel like I don't belong sometimes as well, which is probably why I'm perceived as really quiet when first meeting me. "
340,isfj,"I find that my deep bonds with friends have been formed over years of friendship and ups and downs, my two best friends I've known since I was 13 and I can honestly say I feel the deepest connection with them, their types are INTJ and INTP. The INTJ hates being around people for extended periods of time and the other day we were hanging out, she stayed over for about 8 hours and we were just enjoying each other's company which we hadn't done in a while, she said I'm one of the only people she doesn't feel exhausted around and I think that just comes from how long we've been friends.
I also find it easier to feel connected with people when it's one on one as opposed to groups so if you're struggling in a room full of people, work on pulling someone away from the main conversation and having your own with them on the side."
341,isfj,"Yeah I totally get you on the need for reciprocity. Honestly kind of giving up on finding it. It shouldn’t matter though at the end of the day I feel like as long as you keep true to who you are then it was worth it in the end. 
Like you I tend to avoid large groups and feel like I can only ever open up in a 1 on 1 situation with a very select individual. I always feel like they do fall flat, but I haven’t quite given up on the search for a true friend, yet."
342,isfj,"http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2sdzdb/3_poachers_killed_by_forest_guards_in_indias/
By this, I do not mean the post itself... I read the comments that others wrote about the article and it just really got me incredibly upset. So many people saying ""Good!"" that three poachers died, or ""this should be on r/upliftingnews"".
I am an environmental science major, so it is not as though I do not take issue with poaching. But to write about how good it is that people died just really amazes me. I felt as if they just totally dehumanized the poachers into that ONE aspect. The poachers are people too, who knows what else they have done in their lives. They could have been very good people who were forced into bad circumstances. 
I just really can't get over the fact that people were just saying that it was good that others died. Yes, rhinos are very endagered but at this point in time there is nothing that will change that. Humans have caused their extinction, not these three poachers who are just stuck in the system. We need to stop thinking we can save every species this close to the brink. And for those who want to fight for them, I mean it's a lot of Western society that has created problems so redditors being high and might about wanting poachers dead just seems so stupid to me.
I got downvoted for my comment on that article, saying how I was sad people could be so cruel to others and just so plainly dehumanize them.
Am I looking at it wrong? Does anyone feel the same way I feel about it?
I took a philosophy class called something like ""Philosophy of Society"" and one of the things we went over is that even Hitler is human; you cannot just declare someone a ""monster"" because they are evil and try to pretend that they are no different than yourself. Humans can be ""wrong"" or ""bad"" but they are still human and I guess to me that means that they still deserve some kind of dignity upon death. And especially if their crime is poaching which I feel is much less morally wrong than molesting a child or killing another human being.
Even comments on posts about murderers in some way gets to me--I do not sympathize with them at all but I feel that others saying ""I want to kill them exactly as they killed ____"" is just... making yourself just as bad as the murdered. Instead you should hope that they spend a long time in jail and perhaps get help but not that they should be killed in the same way. Because then it would just be an endless cycle of a murdered being murdered, then that murderer being murdered, neverending...
Sorry for the rambling, I was writing an essay but started thinking about this and I just want to know I might not be the only one who feels this way I guess."
343,isfj,"I feel the same way; I cringe whenever I hear someone called a ""monster"" on the news. My reasoning is that people who get caught up in crime often need a lot of help, and name-calling isn't going to make their (or their victims') situation any better."
344,isfj,"I’ve only seen the movies but I.... well I was gonna say Sam, and I do love him, but actually Gimli is probably my fav. The gruff character with the heart of gold is a trope I’m a sucker for, and he’s hilarious. "
345,isfj,"Haven’t read the books yet, but I finally finished the trilogy with friends last week! Sam is definitely my favourite, because I feel like I can relate to his dependability for friends. On the other hand, Aragorn though is quite the looker..."
346,isfj,"When I first saw the movies as a preteen, Arwen and Frodo were my favorite characters. As I've become older, I appreciate Aragorn more. I'd say it's about the same for the books, except of course Arwen only really exists as a footnote in the trilogy."
347,isfj,"Hi all! I am really bad at keeping to schedules I make. I'll always justify slacking off or doing something else by ""it's only 5 minutes"" which I then repeat to myself every 5 minutes. I end up procrastinating on my work until it is close to being done, and then I feel rushed, which I don't like even though I tend to produce pretty good work (I am currently in school).
HOWEVER when someone else asks me to do something or to complete a request by a certain time I stick to a very strict schedule or get it done ahead of time. I don't know why it is so different when it is asked by someone else. Do you guys have a clue? How are you all with your scheduling abilities?"
348,isfj,"same. i'm suuuuper strict when it comes to scheduling, but only when it involves other people: work, gym trainer, friends, etc.  i do that for people but i hate scheduling. in my free time i don't even look a the time. i just do whatever, whenever....we're meant to be together. i'll be there and you'll be near and that's the deal my dear. "
349,isfj,"DAE forget certain details about people we love? Like, logically we know it's something we're not supposed to forget, yet we forgot it. Could be their favorite food or certain dislikes.
Also, when I'm mad at someone and I don't get the chance to engage/confront the person or something, as weeks/months pass I eventually forget why I was ever mad at the person. Yet I still want to hate the person even if I don't logically know why.
Is this an ISFJ thing?"
350,isfj,"I don't relate with the first part of your question really, few times I forget about details of people I love. But I can relate more with the second part. Sometimes I get angry and I know in that instsnt what makes me angry, but as times pass by, I forget about the specifics and only the bad feelings remain. "
351,isfj,"Regarding the first part, I do this a whole lot with people. I had to end a friendship because I was horrible about forgetting triggering subjects for her and some of those topics were things I discussed daily with other friends. But, usually after 2-3 times, I remember it, same as with learning new things (except things like playing along to music, usually takes 5+ tries to remember it)"
352,isfj,"I don't have a specific favourite movie right now, per se... But I've been loving the MCU! Oh, and most any action movie that's not too gory and has car chase scenes... I love those... Lol. I love CGI gimmicks, it's bad. I literally was obsessed with the tornado movie Into The Storm for years because it just fascinated me so."
353,isfj,"I don't really keep track of favorites in general. Reason? There's so much to like! You can't pick just one. 
Some mentions I can think of though 


Avengers: Infinity War


Doctor Strange


Jurassic Park 


All the Harry Potter movies 


Star Wars: Revenge of the sith (Order 66 is incredibly chilling) 

"
354,isfj,"Not much of a fan of having favorite movies. Is there a difference with having a ""favourite""? (I joke)
I'm not into sharing favorite movies, its personal to me. I do have one favorite but I won't share the title. I usually like horror genres or ones that get me thinking and figuring out things or seeing what a character will do. Finding a movie I can relate experiences to is nice. 
I'm mostly into animations. I do enjoy live action remakes of animations. Not my #1 favorite but its one of my favorites is Star Wars. I liked watching the fight scenes, who gets killed, who will win, what they'll do. But also just because I watched them years ago and like to stick to watching the rest of the series. 
Ohh but with horror movies, gore scenes don't bother me, I want to see what really happens and also challenge how I can withstand watching scenes. Thrillers are exciting. But it really depends since it's just genres and don't always make great movies."
355,isfj,"I figured this could be a fun way just to see the world through an ISFJ's snapchats... or something like that, lol.
I like to see snapchats, especially of just random things but I don't have many snapchat friends. Maybe this post can help facilitate some new bridges being made. I got this idea because I recently added a redditor so I could see her cute ferret snapchats!
We could each comment what we normally send on snapchat, and if others are interested in adding someone just send them a message. I don't feel comfortable straight-up posting my snapchat name on here, so asking for it via private message works better for me!
If you add me, you can expect snapchats related to: hiking, my stuffed seal pup Plumpkin, flowers, coffee cups, 420, funny magazine covers I see, California sunny days, League of Legends, my boyfriend's silly faces, Just Dance...
If you're interested, send me a message!
Looking forward to the comments, I'm happy to expand my friends list :p"
356,isfj,"For me you might see a picture or two of me doing random things around Western New York, some cat pictures, a hedgehog picture now and then (not mine) and concerts this summer. 
*edit: PM me if you want my snap!"
357,isfj,"Mines Stratajim if anyone wants to add me although my name isn't Jim. I usually share snaps of road trips, outdoorsy stuff, humorous things I find around town, graffiti from around Austin, pictures of my adorable little cat, and a diy flame thrower has shown up more than once."
358,isfj,"I'd love to get in on this - have a few snapchat friends but none that share things often enough! And I bet we'd all be on the same page eh? Username is same as my reddit name, add me! I love random things and take a bunch of cool photos, so I'd reply ^_^"
359,isfj,"It's usually like this around here. There's not that many of us and I don't think most of us spend enough time thinking about MBTI to warrant a lot of posts, honestly. Plus I'm pretty sure a lot of us are kinda shy. 
I think we get almost as many posts from other types going ""help me how do I ISFJ"" as from ISFJs ourselves lol. "
360,isfj,"I found this board last night and have been unable to tear myself away. I can't believe some of the posts I have read; many thoughts and feelings I have never been able to articulate to another person. Of course I just read and read, saying nothing but trying to take it all in.. your post made me want to make an account. Hi!"
361,isfj,"Well, as I shared with you, I was mistyping myself as an ISFJ recently since I usually resonated with INFP in the past, and your sharing of the mbti notes helped me get clarity on this. Since reading those notes, my last week has been quite extraordinary and can't believe how much I'm growing! So I wanted to thank this sub because that's where my inquisitiveness brought me last week and it felt very welcoming and helpful here and you especially sharing that info changed my life, I would have to say! I still want to keep learning about all types as there is so much to learn from all!"
362,isfj,"I have social anxiety and i think it's because I'm always hyper aware of other people's feelings. I've always been really sensitive, not only for myself but for other people. I'm constantly afraid of saying or doing something that'd hurt someone else's feelings that I get anxiety over it. If I go to a party, I have to act interested and excited and invested in small talk or conversations I don't enjoy. If I do otherwise, it'll hurt their feelings or make them feel bad. I can go on with different scenarios. It's easier to stay at home. "
363,isfj,"Can you describe the experience of social anxiety for you? Social anxiety is very common for us, yes, but there are ways to combat it. If you can tell us how you approach social situations / relationships and what happens that causes you anxiety, we can give you some advice. =)
For me I get really insecure about whether the people around me are actually attached securely to me, and I also get this persistent feeling that I need to be in front of the people I care about or I'm going to be forgotten about. If I say anything I consider emotionally risky I obsess over what their response will be or if I was out of line in what I said."
364,isfj,"I tend to be really anxious whenever I'm dealing with a situation that I'm not prepared for; whenever my Ne doesn't give me an idea on how to act during a certain situation, then my stress is expressed through nausea."
365,isfj,"I've had it for years. I've went on medication for it (slowly getting off of it atm) and therapy. It was a LOT worse when I was younger. I still have it buts it's not as bad. I still go through cycles and pit falls but in getting better at it. Exercise helps and such. Honestly reading up on it, MBTI, therapy, and exercise have helped me ""deal with it"" a little better but that's just me "
366,isfj,"The only situation in which I'm absolutely certain causes me social anxiety is giving presentations. I'll shake (violently), sweat, stutter, do anything to avoid having to speak, and dread every minute leading up to it and while it's occurring. Then I have to calm down after I've actually gone through with it.
Workdays would overwhelm me easily- if too many people were in line I'd get headaches or have to keep myself busy in the back if I could get away with it. 
Trying to communicate with my SO makes me nervous - he's not abusive or anything of any nature, he's perfectly fine - but the type of nervous I get isn't that cutesy ""oh teehee this is embarrassing"" like I'm afraid of doing things even though I really want to and I hold back a lot because I'm scared he'll judge me even if he reassures me that I'm not and even though we've talked about it before. 
I hate eating certain things in front of people - mostly sticky or crunchy things, messy things, because I worry about whether I'm being too loud and making a mess in front of them. 
Approaching groups of people makes me nervous and makes me feel like I'm intruding in some way unless they're close friends. 
Having to fumble around in my bag for things also makes me anxious - everything should be in its place and people will think I'm weird for fishing for those coins at the bottom of the bag ESPECIALLY if i'm line to pay for something. 
At school I even used to grip my friend's backpack and walk behind them as we went through the crowd because there were so many people around us. 
I guess I'm hesitant because I usually don't seem to experience the physiological parts of social anxiety but I get nervous around people when I don't need to and sometimes it's incredibly annoying. 
(sorry for the essay.)"
367,isfj,"I relate to 2 so much.
For the longest time I thought I was ISTJ because of the logic I like but I prefer/developed the the consistent/accurate Ti vs the well controlled/rational Te.
5 is something I've developed more of recently.
Been in 6 situations.
Have done 8 a couple of times."
368,isfj,"so impressions is the word used most often to talk about isfj memories. but i'm not sure how well that explains it to an non isfj.
the way it feels to me is like: the memories aren't 100% exact but they're close.
they're fairly accurate. but they're feel based. the details remembered are focused around the thing that we felt strongly about.
so, imagine that you're detail focused. you notice how things feel, how things sound, how things smell, that's like all the time all you notice. and then something happened. and it made you feel something (like someone said something harsh or you ate a new something for the first time and it was delicious). 
so you store the memory of that feeling and the particular things you sensed that have anything to do with that feeling. and when you recall the feeling, a bunch of those senses come back up.
if your emotions related to words someone said, you'll often remember the exact words and tones and expressions and how they made you feel as you sensed them bit by bit. if it was the food example, you'll remember the texture, the smell, the taste, and how when you sensed them all at once, it made you so happy. each little thing as reacted to. each little thing was something that lead to how the event as a whole impacted you and the way you felt. so since the memories are based on each of those feelings, the details are easily connected and can be recalled.
that's why impressions is a great word to describe isfj memories. it's not like we're able to remember everything accurately. it's only around our feelings that we pull up details, and only the details we notice or associate with those feelings."
369,isfj,"I'm really late on this but I just wanna chime in and say nope, not for me!! This is one of my least favorite ISFJ stereotypes because my memory is really terrible haha. I have some sleep/attention issues that are probably why, but I just wanna point out that it isn't universally true! 
But to answer your question a little better, what memories I do have tend to be single images, which I recall the main focal point of but not necessarily all of the smaller details. For me it's like primary vs peripheral vision; I technically see what's on the periphery and I might be able to identify some of it, but most of it is almost subconscious. "
370,isfj,"Thank you. It's good to know I'm not the only ISFJ with a terrible memory. 
I don't have any movies playing in my head, maybe small clips with sound/ emotion attached. Mostly I just recall images as well. The details all seem to be there, but I can't focus on a detail without it slipping away. It's like when you stare at a word for so long so that it starts to look funny and you might even forget how to spell it. I think mental images are sort of like that.
I forget faces, names, and details all the time. But, I think it's because those faces, names, and details were never important to me. 
Related to Si (but not necessarily to memories):
I usually notice when something has changed. 
I'm hypersensitive to noises, lights, smells, and tastes. I easily become nauseous.
I have to get out and do things. I like the feel of running, hiking, yoga, or just walking. I tend to tune in and intensely concentrate on the activity.
My attention to detail is insane.
I don't like to admit it, but I like to fit the mold and don't like going against convention. 
People say I'm too sensitive..."
371,isfj,"Sometimes! Or just mentions of the person/situation/etc. That's one of those things that's really hard to describe because it takes place on such a fundamental level, but generally if I'm thinking about a person or experience it'll trigger my strongest mental images of them, or if I'm in a situation then yeah it'll sometimes call up images of similar experiences for comparison. "
372,isfj,"I actually thought about this a lot after reading a bunch of novels on my commute. I realized I actually have horrible visualization. When I read novels I'm skipping the intermediary step of ""imagine a red wheelbarrow"" to the impression a red wheel barrow gives me. The character's experience. 
I have a great memory, but sometimes when I remember something I have to work backward from the emotion and impression. Who is that actor? An impression of a child feeling wistful during summer. Something about crossing something to adventure. Oh yeah, he played the kid from Bridge to Terabithia. Coming up with the wrong answer to the impression is also how I come up with metaphors. "
373,isfj,"ENFP is probably my favorite personality type. I love your open-ness, your depth, your empathetic natures, and your willingness to talk about literally anything. I appreciate your love of meaningful connection and of getting people to open up. I have a hard time talking about myself, so it's nice to have someone who shows a lot of interest and encouragement. 
However, I often feel like you lose interest in friendships, which can be hard. It seems like you have the ability to become close with pretty much anyone, so friendships are ""a dime a dozen"", and becoming close with someone isn't always very noteworthy or special. I know that's not actually the case, but from my perspective, I usually only have like one close friend, and they are SUPER important to me. If you have earned my trust, you have my consistent support, my loyalty, my respect and my affection until the end of time. So it can be hard to come to terms with the fact that my ENFP friend can easily find closeness with someone else. I feel like I could be replaced with someone that the ENFP finds more interesting. In other words, ENFPs are not very consistent or committed, which can be very hard for an ISFJ, because we are very strongly both, so when the ENFP doesn't show those qualities, we feel slightly betrayed. "
374,isfj,"My SO is an ENFP, and so is one of my coworkers and close friend. 
What I like about you ENFP's is your way of thinking and how deep your thought processes are. You guys can get really deep into a topic yet talk about literally everything. This is great because sometimes I don't want to, or feel like, opening up or talking about a topic.  
But another plus is that even if I don't feel like a topic is worth me mentioning, but I mention it anyways, you guys would pick it right up and can make that topic of discussion into something that is worth talking about. 
You guys are uplifting to us ISFJ""s when we have our sad moments and you are, in my experience, quite loyal to your friends.  
One downside I have noticed is that sometimes you can get a little side tracked with things and need a few reminders here and there to get you going. Or you guys get distracted really easily. But it's honestly what makes you guys so awesome, unique and interesting. 
I hope you love us ISFJ""S just as much as I love ENFP's :)"
375,isfj,"My first boyfriend and serious relationship was with an ENFP whom I met online in 2009. We were friends for years before dating and I always felt a very strong connection and admiration for him. Perhaps it's because he was often able to speak up and do things that I was far too shy and soft spoken to do. When we dated our communication could be rough on my side, I don't like to speak up and confrontation is hard but he'd bring it up sometime or eventually get what was bothering us out in the open. Something that I took for granted because others have been content to let things go and allow bad feelings to fester. 
I found that he would often get caught up in a crazy plan or really into a game or something of that nature and he'd devote himself to it 100%. I'd kind of be forgotten in the midst of it all. THere were often times in our friendship where he was not at all present because he lost interest and was drawn into other things. ENFP's seem to get caught up in fantasy and unrealistic things that I don't think about much so I grounded him in that sense. Whereas he was there to ground me when my anxiety flew out of hand. He was the most passionate, caring and hard-working person I've ever met. A truly unique and special person I'll never forget."
376,isfj,"Enfp's are great. I don't know about all isfj's but I don't usually come up with new ideas all that much. I tend to just stick to what I know, but my friend since I was 3 is an enfp and he's always got great ideas, just doesn't notice all the little logistical details that go into things and that's where I come in. Makes a good team"
377,isfj,"Used to date an ENFP and it was a fun experience. I love how you guys are totally unpredictable and could make things interesting especially in a relationship. One more thing I liked is that you seem to wear your hearts under your sleeves, making it easier for us to open up to you and form deeper emotional connections."
378,isfj,"Thanks Mate! And it depends on the ENFP, we have an inner adult behind that childhood shit. But I remain committed to my friends, I just find a little bit more. And its more or so a habit, I would say that I don't lose interest. I would just say I obtain so many I lose track, not to brag. That isn't always a good thing at all. You guys tend to develop closer bonds and I respect that."
379,isfj,"I am sorry to hear that, but restricting us is never a good idea. But yes we do get caught up in unrealistic things, but we make some true. And you're never forgotten, we always think about the people that we love. But we have to have are own areas to be flexible in. And when are flexibility is restricted, bad things could occur."
380,isfj,"And I think that's also a strength on your part -- being able to connect with so many people and make so many friends. But it doesn't feel great when you realize you're one of the ones the ENFP has ""lost track of"" . . . even if they claim they still love and care about you. "
381,isfj,"Oh, I never restricted. I always supported and tried my best to understand what it was that he was going for and why he was so passionate about it. I was just there for if things got bad and he felt defeated or like his effort wasn't enough. I was reassurance and reality when he wanted it. "
382,isfj,"That is very true. I think if someone needed help I would help them till they are stable, for a short time. Relationships is different, romantically I have done relationships that lasted 8 months. But even that served its purpose. But I guess were simply here to motivate and help, but also be a very temporary but inspiring aspect in others lives. "
383,isfj,"Yes you definitely are wonderful motivators and helpers -- I think your empathy allows you to know how and when to be there for people, and that is very special =) 
So what about you? What do you think of ISFJ's? "
384,isfj,"I think they're amazing people. Sympathetic and kind, and my personal favorite. Your generous behavior is great, and one of the hardest but most rewarding things is getting you guys to open up and share your thoughts to us. A few of my ISFJ friends criticize me for being to honest to some people, but that's okay. It's understandable, they're probably the best kind of personality out there if you are looking to be a kind person."
385,isfj,"Depends on your emotional state, since you are more introverted. And one of the most introverted types, you felt like you relied on the ENFP because he is one of the few willing to open up and hear you out. But ENFPs may hear you and feel attached, but most of them are temporary throughout our lives. I have a few I will stick to, that's about it. Fortunately most of the people I am willing to open up more to and show that adult behavior that all ENFPs have to happen to be INFJs. I say that INFJs are the most probable to see the ENFP behind that childish behavior. Simply because ENFPs rely on people as well."
386,isfj,"Childish meaning, we act like children, we mess around and like to have fun. We tend to act immature, but in reality we are adults. We just don't prefer to act like it and open up, since ENFPs are the most introverted of extroverted types. When we show are adults side, we are usually calm and logical and have a strong motive to get are point through. Some may have these short bursts of anger to defend someone they love, but will often revert back to are childish self minutes if not seconds after winning a debate or after successfully defending there friend, since acting mature just isn't are preference. I like getting logical from time to time, but it's not my preferred mood, but the thing is we have a motive to help. And we often notice your kindness and devotion. Which will give us a reason to open up and show you are realistic, mature, logical selves. This may differ. Depending on the ENFP."
387,isfj,"hey so i just read some of dario nardi's work about the neuroscience of personality,and he has done brain scans on the different mbti types,and it turns out that isfjs are the most right brained out of all the types,and this got me interested.so 1)do you guys feel like you very visual people,that its easier to learn from visual material,2) do you guys feel very intuitive about things people nature ect.?...and what kind of creative things do you liek to think about?"
388,isfj,"I am very visual when it comes to learning and putting things together. I see instructions putting together furniture or something and it will take hours. If Im shown i can pick it up easily.
I have great intuition, very observant and will remember key things people say to me.
I also daydream"
389,isfj,"

Yes, I am a visual learner first and foremost. I grasp things most readily when it's displayed in front of me.


I believe I have good intuition. I'm observant which helps.


daydreams and stories. I'll have music on my mind when I listen to it and art when I see it

"
390,isfj,"

I’m also a visual learner, I find it hard to understand new concepts without being able to see it or work with it directly.


On the myers briggs, I only tested as a sensor slightly over an intuitive. So I do think that I’m intuitive and can use my observations to make educated guesses.

"
391,isfj,"Yes it's much easier to learn from visual stimulus and also I rely a lot on vision to memorize experiences. I enjoy observing every detail.
I would say I am pretty intuitive, the test was almost 50/50. I don't know if that means anything. But I catch things easily, read between and I would say I perceive other's mood states with few clues.
I have realized I daydream a lot, many times is about things that generates an emotional reaction/feeling in me. Also I try to explore my creativity learning how to play ukelele. My SO always tells me I am very good with rythm, but sometimes I feel I am very rigid and don't 'loosen up'. I also would like to learn to draw properly. "
392,isfj,"I learn best when I am being shown what to do and am allowed to ask questions. 
I have really good intuition for the most part, but it can get easily over shadowed by what I WANT to believe, rather than what is actually in my face.
I day dream about my future (which sometimes as of late causes horrible spiraling) I watch A LOT of TV and movies, it's kinda obscene, I read a lot, sometimes I write (but I don't think I'm very good at it) I listen to music and I LOVE to make music with people I love."
393,isfj,"i also thought so its not the case,it depends on the cognitive function,if someone has a dom perceving function they would be more right brained,but if they have a dom judging function more left brained,like an infp is actualy very right brained,.on account of his dom judging function,...anyways idk to much,but according to the research isfjs are actualy the most right brained,"
394,isfj,"Usually dry, sometimes sarcastic is how I convey humor but a lot of stuff I hear or watch isn't funny because it's so predictable to me or it comes to me before or as the joke is being delivered. Something has to be silly to get me to laugh."
395,isfj,"Things don't make me laugh often but when they do, it's all out, sides hurt, can't feel my face. Case in point? This made me laugh for a good 5 minutes. http://weknowmemes.com/2012/01/who-put-a-dick-in-this-box/"
396,isfj,"I have little patience with overused or obvious jokes (the typical observational type humor that has to do with gender, race, or air travel experiences, etc.), which is why I find so many stand-up comedians tiresome. On the other hand, I think potty humor is hilarious, so go figure."
397,isfj,"Yes, I can completely relate to this, especially if they don't get the sarcasm. I find myself laughing to myself over my own jokes too, which can be awkward because you're randomly laughing but it wouldn't be that funny to explain."
398,isfj,"Me too. Funny thing is, I'm an ENTP who just came here to see what the opposite side would be like. I guess humor type is completely independent of MBTI. Perhaps there should be a seperate listing for humor types. Man, that would be hard to implement though. Time to think on it and never do anything about it. Being an ENTP is weird, mate."
399,isfj,Yeah! I think most of the time people aren't sure whether or not I'm joking. I'm pretty sure some people in high school even thought I was stupid there for a little while. I have clearly found my people.
400,isfj,"My ISFJ girlfriend often has this issue since she runs her own business as a graphic designer. I'm ENFP so almost the exact opposite. 
I find what helps her most is to sit down and start mapping out a path to some goals whether it is financial, fitness, social etc. Just having a clear blueprint on some achievements and getting her to take small steps along that is enough to put her at ease. "
401,isfj,"I wallow in anxiety for a bit, step back breathe consciously and then I try to divert myself by trying to realize what will be will be, ways of universe being beyond our control or understanding blah blah blah (all sorts of life philosophy quotes/concepts that I believe in, actually) and divert my attention to music or sketching or studies..
I am learning to 'give up'/accept with a stoic resignation after a point. Because no point in my anxiety, I can cry/smile/be nonchalant - what will happen will happen... Sometimes it's not easy, obviously, but I guess trying to come out of anxiety in itself provides some relief..
To tell you what works for me - music, breathing long and deep, sketching, going out for walks, watching nature, watching everything around me by 'switching off' my mind dissociating myself and bearing the view as a cinema screen helps me (in most cases)
EDIT - I also talk to my parents sometimes. Or just stay around them, follow them around like a puppy.. "
402,isfj,"I accept the thing things I can control, try to be prepared for the future by using the past, and know that not everything can be controlled. Let go and let it be. If it is meant to be, then so it will be."
403,isfj,"In trying to let things be you are not letting things be. It's a call for lack of action, not a need for action. It's recognizing there's nothing you need to do.
This contradicts a lot of what we think, that there is something we must do or could have done. You don't even have to try in letting things go because in doing so you are merely creating subtle tension, once again that there's something we must do. There's really nothing to do. This current anxiety about the future is fine in that you don't have to make it go away. What you're doing right now--seeking out help, asking for advice--is your manner of coming to terms how to deal with the anxiety, or more accurately it's the anxiety resolving itself. 
Still, if you insist on coming up with a method of sorts then the best I can suggest is re-defining your relationship with the anxiety. Why is it bad? It may help to view your anxiety as an annoying family member. You obviously can't get rid of them but they are obviously still annoying you. So you gotta learn how to live with it in a productive manner. Before you know it, the annoying family member has matured and is no longer annoying. In fact they may be rather pleasing to hang around with :) Just gotta treat them with patience, understanding, and a bit of love. Accept the anxiety rather than pushing it away; it's there for a reason."
404,isfj,"I agree with the rest of these responses!
I find that music helps a lot. Genuinely taking life one day at a time forces you to live in the moment, preventing you from becoming too caught up with what could happen. Make sure that you have  things to look forward to! Reward yourself for a hard-days work. 
It’s all about the details."
405,isfj,I try to tell myself that everything is going to workout. If I can I try to plan ahead for potential mishaps or problems. I also try to know things that could happen in the future so I can mentally prepare myself. 
406,isfj,"By embracing the awareness of what I can control and what I can't.  Looking back, I've realized that as long as I just use common sense and trust my gut, plan the way I want to plan, control the stuff I have control of, things have mostly worked out okay for me.  Sure, there has been some stuff that didn't happen the way I'd hoped, but again... focusing only on what I can control means I typically have a Plan B or at least some preparation for things not going my way.  "
407,isfj,A step you can take is further realizing there's no need to have a life philosophy since everything will continue to work regardless :) The life philosophy is for our sense of safety when in reality we were completely safe all along. No need to try to feel safe since that in itself spurs anxiety.
408,isfj,"For sure, the beauty of this is that you don't even have to try hahaha, seed has been planted. Just keep on chugging doing you with a little bit of love thrown in to soften the rocky bumps in your journey."
409,isfj,"I continually come back to ISFJs for advice. You all make me feel comforted and like I can actually do things. You're encouraging, basically. You give me good vibes and that's something I come back to. I have a job interview in the coming days, I have had a few before, so I kind of know what I'm doing, but I was wondering if you had any tips. Thank you in advance, stay wonderful!"
410,isfj,"People have said a lot of good things here but I want to mention something else. 
Have you been just springing the plans on her last minute, or have you been giving her a heads up? 
For example, if someone says to me ""hey you want to see a movie tonight."" and the movie is in the next few hours, the answer is most likely going to be no. If they ask in the beginning of the day, it might be a yes. If they ask a day or two ahead of time it probably will be a yes. 
Why? Because I plan stuff out. Even my recharge time. If someone asks if I want to do something a few days ahead of time, I can adjust and make sure I can rest up if I need it. When if you ask me a few hours before something happens in the evening, I'm already winding down and probably getting into the process of getting ready for bed, I'm not going to be going anywhere. 
I figured I would mention this, because I noticed a lot of my extrovert friends like to spring stuff on me the last second, and those plans never work out. "
411,isfj,"Just have some one on one time with her outside of the house. They need this kind of safe, non-exhausting bonding time before they are ready to go out with you and other people. She needs to feel 100% relaxed and comfortable with you."
412,isfj,"I am an ENFJ dating an ISFJ :-)
Our first few dates were just us - dinner, drinks, (watching sports), and then going and doing some one-on-one thing (arcade, bowling, adventures at parks/beaches)
you just got to appeal to their interests as much as possible. he loves food, beer, sports, and outdoorsy stuff so like its easy. we even like grocery shopping, its little small things like that too. maybe try a library or small coffee place, something that has an appeal.
like many others have also said about the ""people"" thing - 
we still haven't done the whole friend introducing thing yet - but from what I gauge from him, anything with more than a few people is overwhelming. its just a slow but sure process to feel comfy bout who they are with. I'd suggest maybe going out around her friends? or just anywhere she would know people. No one kinda wants to feel like a small puppy following/clinging to that one person they know. "
413,isfj,"She prefers spending time with you alone, or at most a few close friends or family members. Big parties is a no no. But - talk to her and see if you can reach a compromise - that at least once in a while she goes out with you to do something you enjoy. And make sure she gets plenty of alone time afterwords. She will need it to replenish her batteries. "
414,isfj,"By the way, why does it take you guys so long to open up? I feels like ages before we get to the ""good stuff"".
I might not be able to speed up the process but understand your nature my help me be more patient. Sometimes I feel like I have literally pull on things."
415,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ and social situations are such a struggle because while I love interacting with people, I often get overwhelmed when it’s a bunch of new people I don’t know well. Since I’m introverted, it can be hard to break my way into a group conversation. 
When you go out with a group make sure to check in on her every so often so she feels comfortable/included. Could be something as simple as touching her leg, giving her hand a squeeze. If we start to get quiet or seem overwhelmed that touch can help ground us again....make us feel important "
416,isfj,Aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!! This makes A LOT of sense!! I will take this advise by heart. This is exactly whats going.on. I have spontaneous suggestions and I get rejected lol. But its all.good. All this makes a lot.of sense. I can finally understand how to plan dates and hang out!! Thank you :D
417,isfj,"I second this.
I'm the same way, I really need some advance warning to be comfortable with making plans. 
If I'm very close with someone and feel super comfortable with them, I'm more likely to say yes when they spring things on me, but it still pushes me out of my comfort zone, and I really prefer to have things arranged at least a day or two in advance."
418,isfj,"Yes!! Absolutely. When were one on one is great! I love it. It calms me down however I still have to adjust my energy levels to her. Im wayy..wayyyyy up there sometimes but she likes that it seems. Its just that its hard to gsin insight in what she thinks. Sometimes she burst in to laughter.. and Im left completely clueless. 
I deeply appreciate your adviser. How do you deal with the ""cold showers""? How do you gauge how long he needs this recharge?"
419,isfj,"This could just be me, but it’s to avoid getting hurt. If I open up to someone, I’m more vulnerable if they leave. Historically I’ve been more apt to have one really close friend that I spend most of my time with and then a less intimate outer circle. That friend tends to know everything about me after some time, and feels like an extension of myself in a lot of ways. When those relationships end for whatever reason, it’s incredibly painful. I need to test the waters to be sure someone is trustworthy before I start sharing the really personal stuff. "
420,isfj,"For me the I and the J are very firm, and the middle two end up being really close to 50/50 splits on the tests I take. (like 52/48 as a random example)
But yeah, I plan out all my stuff and don't really go out a whole lot. I usually will when people ask (with enough heads up) but there's someone that's trying to do stuff with me on a weekly basis and it's stressing me out a bit. x_x"
421,isfj,"Well, tbh I dont deal with them well, just given my own past worries. but When I feel him being kinda cold or distant I tend to just reel my energy in a bit, tone it down, and wait a little bit to reply or something. then ill just ask him bout his day or send him something to maybe get him a little happier, either it be a meme or song or something alike. but some breathing air/space is needed for sure.
He does need his time for recharge, most times its when he decides to play video games and i know thats his time to relax and recharge or when hes watching a show and i just be patient and wait for him to spring back into energy mode. or get back to my text or whatnot.
I usually gauge the time depending on how withdrawn or busy he seems, just so i dont seem.. annoying to him bc as an ENFJ, it can be hard, especially bc I dont deal with inconsistency that well since it makes me think that they lost interest or something, but he always reassures me my coming back and then giving back effort as I put into him. "
422,isfj,"What is Si like for you? How does it work? What does it do?
I want to understand Si better. Based on what various SJ types have said, the canned descriptions are inaccurate or misleading. Therefore I would like your personal ideas about that it is or what it means, or any information you can give me about it."
423,isfj,"To me, it's basically just storing experiences in a sort of ""bank"" that I pull from to create a frame of reference for myself. 
On the downside, that means that, for example, when I enter a new/unfamiliar situation, I'm often very uncomfortable at first because I have no frame of reference to work from. I'll look to other people and try to follow the patterns I see being displayed in behavior, or do research in advance to try to mitigate the discomfort. Having a familiar person whose example I can follow is also great. Once I adjust to a situation and form my mental framework, though, I'm totally fine. 
On the upside, it means I'm able to make connections between situations and pull from past experiences to improve my current situation. I can judge the ways in which my experiences are dissatisfactory, compare it to similar situations in the past, and see what changes can be made to correct the problem based on solutions I've found in the past. When I was in college, this also benefitted me academically, since I was able to easily make connections between subjects and apply different perspectives to whatever I was learning about, such as applying what I learned in my psych or science classes to my history or philosophy classes. That's how it is for me, anyway. "
424,isfj,"I'm constantly referring to and comparing to past experiences. Life's experiences and lessons are like many strings that I weave and connect together to create and understand new ideas. If something is completely unfamiliar, it will either put me slightly on edge until I've gained some understanding, or I will find something to relate it to, even if it's ridiculous and far fetched.
I find it very enjoyable to revisit good, old experiences, like going to the same restaurant each time I visit a certain area or reading the same books again. (Don't confuse this with being a stick in the mud. I really love to try new things.)"
425,isfj,"really hard for me to explain. for me it occurs in many ways
1) you give me a new concept/theory/information. i look at what i already know, may be something unrelated but helps me understand, and i analyze the new information/concept based on what i already know.
example: someone talking to me about creating h20 and if it's different to natural h20. me, not knowing a single thing about chemistry, remember about the smallpox virus and how it was eradicted but part of the virus that was being researched seeped through airvents, connected with a photographers chemicals = gave her small pox. so i can use my knowledge of that to say ""there may be external circumstances which can change the outcome when creating h20 in a lab"". might not be correct but that's based on my limited understanding of the topic. 
2) you just anything, could just be one word within a sentence, that has an emotion attached to a memory i have. and i remember it. so you could be talking about a tree and i remember a tree that i looked at from my friends house at a sleepover, i'd have remembered that memory fondly.
3) these ones are less conscious to me. i just hear a piece of information about someone, like their favourite movie. i don't think anything of it. but later i see them talking about movies and i'll suddenly remember what their favourite movie is.
4) i have movies, songs and books i can go to if i want to feel a certain feeling. these tend to be associated with the feelings eg ""this song was playing when i first met ____, therefore im gonna reply it because it's associated with happy feelings. i replay the same songs from the past. or i replay new songs and then later when i hear them they remind me of the time period i was listening to them and how i was in general.
i dunno it's hard to explain lol and it interacts with Fe particularly and sometimes Ne ^_^"
426,isfj,"it's cool. i have bias against other types due to, again, bad experiences. it is true that perhaps there are certain types more compatible than others...but you need to remember that typism is very similar to any other ""-ism"" there is, and stereotypes and bias can cause more harm than good- and at the end of the day, it'll be your fault for holding onto the bias in the first place."
427,isfj,"Maybe it's the genetics, maybe it's the way i was raised, I lack confidence in myself. I think this has something to do with ISFJ perfectionism, like when I put in serious effort in what i do but still fail or pale in comparison to other people, I would get really discouraged and begin self-blaming and pitying (not a real word?). I feel like I want to strive to be the absolute best, and I consciously know that is impossible for a normal guy like me, but deep down I can not acknowledge this fact, and my sensitivity introduced a whole array of negative emotions whenever my inferiority is proven. My point is, I feel like I can only be loved or valued if I am the best aka perfect. After all, the society loves the best, the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, the best-looking, the wittiest, etc etc. 
I hope I haven't typed a bunch of nonsense, and I hope to exchange experiences with people alike. How do I counter this thinking? Hoping for replies."
428,isfj,"I completely relate to this.  I find it frustrating how I can logically know I have low self-esteem and yet not be able to reason with myself until I improve it.  This may be the least helpful advice ever, but I'll tell you what has worked for me:
1) Not caring.
When I just focus on what I'm trying to be good at, rather than how I think I'll be judged, I'm more at peace and can leave negative emotions aside.  I mainly learned this from art/painting, in that overthinking whether my work-in-progress is good enough will completely paralyze the entire art process.
2)Pretending my best friend just did whatever mistake I'm beating myself up about.
I would never ever treat the people I love the way I treat myself, so this helps me to re-frame my perspective and give myself some compassion."
429,isfj,"Take this with a grain of salt but acknowlegde that you're, in a way, 99% a product of environment until you're somewhat in your 20's. It is not your fault you lack self-esteem, it is because of your environment. If your parents had raised you just a little bit different, you maybe could've had high self-esteem. Now don't start resenting your parents, they did their best. But now it is up to you to start taking the reins and start developing that self-esteem :)  There are enough retards running around who are much less capable than you and have more self-esteem, because of their environment, parents, peers, teachers etc...
Now for the advice, look into and research the following topics and make your own routine/practice after you learn about these topics. No one knows you better than you, so you need to make a practice/routine that fits your needs (developing self-esteem) and goals.
Topics:


Sport, excercise and diet


Read books, try to avoid fiction. Look for popular self-help books and read the reviews


Start journalling, get a sense of whats going on. Get to know your thougths, ideas, identity, patterns, reactions, weaknesses, strengths etc etc... get to know your problem in depth


Learn about self-help, philosophy, psychology, the subconscious etc... Youtube is filled with great content


PS Don't try to implement this all right away, take it reaaaally slow, enjoy the small victories, be very patient, have fun while doing so and keep going :)
PSS message me if you have questions "
430,isfj,"Hey all :) how are you at keeping secrets? Secrets of others, secrets of your own. Do any of you have any secrets you plan on taking to the grave? No need to spill them, unless you feel the need. If so, how do you handle it internally? "
431,isfj,"For the most part, I'd like to think I'm pretty good at keeping other people's secrets, unless it could bring harm to them or someone else in keeping it. 
For example, one of my friends once confessed that he was planning to cheat on his girlfriend, and there was no way I could keep that a secret with a clean conscience. I told him either he told his girlfriend, or I was going to, but I couldn't stand by and watch it happen like that. 
As far as my own secrets, it depends. There are a few very select people in my life who know most of my secrets, but even then, I still keep a lot to myself, and there are a few that I'm taking to the grave. Sometimes it's just better for all parties involved if things stay buried."
432,isfj,"Good question.
When it comes to someone else confiding in me about something, I usually don't have a problem with not telling another person about it. I kind of have this ""counselor"" type rule for myself where I am intentional about not spreading other people's business (unless it's in regards to their personal safety or the safety of those around them).
How about you, OP?"
433,isfj,"I will keep a secret until the grave. I take it really seriously when someone trusts me with a secret. I have maybe two secrets of my own that I will probably keep to myself until the end as well heh. I really don't feel like I have to handle anything by not telling the secrets of others or my own. If I have something to fess up to I will, I really hate how it feels to hold something in if I shouldn't."
434,isfj,"When it comes to the secrets of others I kind of have something like a personal ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. Sure there are things that I will not tell no matter what, but for a lot of things I won't bring it up unless the information is relevant. Now, there are different levels of relavence. Something that is not important at all might get brought up because the conversation was barely relevant, whereas somethings will only be said if I am directly asked about it. Again, if it is something that I know the person wouldn't want revealed to others, I won't give out the info to any circumstances, but for things that are causal info or won't have any effect on anything, then there's this policy.
As for my own secrets.... Some of my friends really hat how little I actually tell them about my inner feelings and secrets... Take that as you will."
435,isfj,"I have a very tight lip about secrets. For my own secrets, it depends on my relationship with the person. Assuming we're talking about a really close friend, I will tell them only if they bring it up. Almost like I need permission for spilling the goods. There are some times where I go all Tsundere and really want them to ask me and try to start conversations that pertain to that secret without directly hinting at it. 
I have a hard time dealing with difficult secrets and I have a hard time reaching out to people to help me. Again, wanting permission to talk about it. It usually gets to the point where I talk about the secret but not directly. Ex. I have a hard time petting dogs but I actually say, ""I have a hard time interacting with animals."" Essentially just making the secret really vague. 
In regards to other people's secrets, I stand firm to how they want the secret to be treated. If they only want me to know, then I'll keep it locked up tight. "
436,isfj,"It's funny you mention ""counselor"" I actually have a friend who calls me their counselor lol. I don't mind. I don't tell others secrets unless they talk about it in front of others, then I'll chime in. Although I guess that's not a secret lol. My own secrets however, I feel like no one knows 100% of me. So I have alot I suppose. "
437,isfj,"That reminds me of the Fifth Business by Robert Davies. If ISFJ are doomed to be side characters, at least we can be these ones:
“Those roles which, being neither those of Hero nor Heroine, Confidante nor Villain, but which were nonetheless essential to bring about the Recognition or the denouement, were called the Fifth Business in drama and opera companies organized according to the old style; the player who acted these parts was often referred to as Fifth Business.""
Also, despite what people say, I think the main character of this book(said 5th business) is an ISFJ. "
438,isfj,"What helps me is to be slightly away from the crowd, and only talking to just 1-2 other people at a time. Social interaction is mentally draining to ISFJ's, so being part of the crowd is the fastest way to drain your ""psyche"", and make you want to go back to being alone again. Another thing i like to do, is just sit right next to the main crowd, and just listen. I love to listen in on the conversations, but the second someone tries to drag me into it i lose interest and just want to leave.
For example, parents would have their friends over, and i'll usually be inside the house, doing whatever i feel like while they all sit around a fire pit we have outside. Occasionally i'll come out and sit with them, and i'll be there for about 20-30 minutes until i feel like i need to be by myself again. And if i'm ever at a family party, i try and bring something that'll occupy me, like downloading a couple videos on a mobile device, or a handheld to play a couple games on to pass time."
439,isfj,"Lots of alcohol. Just kidding...sort of.
What to do is definitely going to depend on your comfort level and relate ability with the people around you. When I am with someone I can have a legitimately interesting conversation with(as opposed to simply acting like I am interested) I try to stick with them and continue the conversation as long as I can, but not be a pest.
On the other hand, if I don't know anybody at the gathering I try to peel away from the crowd every once and a while to spend some time to myself. Usually, I will pull out my phone and browse reddit or something else which interests me. I know it sounds lame, and people may criticize you for it, but it may almost be necessary.
My tactic is to be really engaging with a couple of people for a good 20-30 minutes, then try to get away for 5-10 minutes. Rinse and repeat. It is still draining, but I am able to cope by taking those intermittent ""me"" breaks.
Use this situation to learn about yourself, what you can and cannot tolerate, and ways to be more engaging. Unfortunately(for us introverts), being a part of groups is going to happen quite a bit through life, unless you are a complete hermit.(which I hope you don't become, because some people can be pretty awesome!) Good luck!"
440,isfj,"I really agree on the 20 minute on and 5-10 minute off thing with people.
I browse reddit with that time like you said, and I am criticized when doing that.
But like you said, it is necessary, atleast for me hehe :)"
441,isfj,"There's a huge tendency for ISFJs to identify as INFJs. I don't know if I'm that way or just very middle of the road. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/515xlw/infj_users_guide/
I'd like to know what parts of this you identify with and which parts you can't relate to?
Thank you all so much for helping! :)"
442,isfj,"If I might add an additional question: Can you tell me what you relate to in this ""Things INFJs Say"" post (easily digestible top 20 list)?
Someone commented that ""All people say stuff like this. You could even change the title to ""Shit people say (and why)"" which is far more holistically correct as a set of observations."" So I looked at the old ""Stuff We Say"" posts for all the other types (including ISFJs and didn't see much overlap. 
Since y'all are doing an INFJ/ISFJ compare & contrast anyway, thought I'd ask!"
443,isfj,"What DOES APply
-Do try to get as much sleep as possible
-I do (Ti) analyze a lot and read into people and stuff
-I like hugs and affirmation but dont always ask for it (fe)
What does NOT Apply
-Forgetting to eat. I love food so even when stressed I never forget to.
-Sometimes I can think of consequences but I do have a tendency to act without thinking 
-Se occasional overeat/sleep. Im usually very specific of how I do these which I guess would be Si.
-Hygeine: I ALWAYS brush my teeth and shower in the morning, no exceptions outside emergencies"
444,isfj,"I thought I was an INFJ for, what, eight years? So there's a fair bit I identify with:

able to think of any consequence of their action 
sudden realisations 
over-analyze the crap out of people, pay too much attention to insignificant detail and read too much into said detail
occasionally overeat
becoming emotionally cold when stressed
sitting in the corner of the room staring into the air for three days

Can't relate to any of the things about sleep, hygiene, forgetting to eat, or the social awkwardness with strangers (I'm best with strangers, worse with acquaintances and casual friends). I absolutely never forget to eat, shower, or generally take care of myself, as I need to do all of those things to feel even vaguely human - and I need to do them in my particular routine and at my particular set times to feel 'okay' in myself."
445,isfj,"I don't know if you want this much detail but here goes! :D
Oh yeah! 
This is me SOOO much.
kinda. I used to follow my intuition hardcore and it kept being wrong...
I don't usually say this because it seems rude but I'll try to ask this non-verbally
Yeah, I have super cool deep thoughts and then when I try to explain them, it sounds stupid.
Yep. See above. :p
I'd say so. I don't like people to dislike me so I'll usually not share my true feelings about something.
It seems like a lot of these kinda repeat. This is a combination of two previous ones. When I share my abnormal thoughts/ ideas I usually follow it up with something like this.
Again, essentially a combination of previous points. 
"" ""
"" ""
okay so this is something I try to avoid nowadays. I used to think that EVERYTHING had a meaning and purpose but due to my radical switch away from religion, I try my best to not assign meaning to things anymore but this IS something I would have said in the past. 
The way this is written isn't SUPER specific but I usually do understand what people mean but don't always say so. Most people like to inform people and who am I to rob them of that joy. :p
YEEEES! I'm always trying to calm things down between people and make people see each others' perspectives. Ironic because this is what I struggle with in MY relationships.
SO MUCH! I always argue the opposite side/ underdog viewpoint.
Yeah, I don't like being a burden. 
Ripples aren't my preference so I totally say sorry a ton.
I'd say ""waste my time"" is harsh but I'm just really bad at explaining so I do this.
Oh, isn't this the same as the above?
Very, very much. very much. so much muchness.
So yep! A lot of repeating/ rewording/ combining but I relate to most of this. The big thing for me that concerns me is that my crystal ball that shows the future is usually wrong. :s"
446,isfj,"Everyone gets tongue tied every now and again. What INFJs tend to do is pause alot or even forget some words while speaking due to being unable to find a proper way to accurately articulate the thought in general. Other times thoughts literally just seem to vanish, resulting in awkward silences and the INFJ staring into oblivion to try and find it. It can get really frustrating at times, especially when we are proud of or excited by the thought. Every thought is crystal clear in our heads and we can explain them to an imaginary audience with no issue. It's usually easier to explain things via text as you have more time to find the correct wording.
This only really happens in meaningful and personal conversation though just so you know as I don't want you think we suck at speaking all the time lol Theres usually no issue inane chit-chat."
447,isfj,"What led to the realization that you're ISFJ after 8 years of believing you were INFJ?
Also, why do you think you become more socially awkward around acquaintances and casual friends than you do with strangers?"
448,isfj,"Well, I had a bit of a personality shift about a year and a half ago following some rather major life events (mother involved in bad accident, moved away to university shortly after), which threw me back into thinking about MBTI, and I actually started thinking I was an ISTJ. I've mellowed back out a lot since, even having a moment of wondering if I was an INFP, but what I've come to realise is that I'm Si-dom and Ne-inf as hell - I always have been, I just simply dismissed it and brushed it off as being Ni-Te or something else. 
Whilst, superficially, I matched the INFJ profile pretty much perfectly - and if I were to be typed on the dichotomies I would certainly be INFJ - as soon as I started to check out the functions, I realised that there was absolutely zero way I was a Se-inf. Furthermore, what I thought was Ni was actually Si all this time, it seems - I just didn't realise it because I'd been described as intuitive in everyday life, and because I love metaphor, philosophy, myth, etc. I started considering my weaknesses, and started paying attention to ISFJ areas (forums, message boards, subreddits), and realised within the space of around an hour that ISFJ was pretty much a perfect fit. 
Strangers are super easy. There's no...depth or familiarity required beyond your standard, genuine human warmth, if that makes any sense? I can smile, laugh, ask them about themselves, generally charm them - I dislike small talk, but I'm good at it when I need to be, because anybody can be really interesting if you ask the right questions and actually listen to the answers. I really, really don't mean this in a bragging way, but I've only ever met a very small handful of people in life who I couldn't connect with and eventually win over. 
The best thing about strangers is that you're unlikely to see them ever again, let alone have them remember you - whereas with acquaintances and casual friends, you can't just charm them and move on in the same way. There's this awkward middle ground where they're not My People, so I can't relax around them or really be myself, but they're still people I'm pretty much certainly going to see again - there's a lot more pressure to get them to like me, but at the same time I don't want to be overly familiar, and I most certainly don't want to show them the real me and let my guard down. 
I feel there's too much pressure to read them correctly, to remember every little detail about them, and after a few meetings it gets very strained inside my head. People tend to be more familiar with me than I am with them - both in the 'people know/remember me, I don't know/remember them' way and the 'they treat me like I'm their new best friend' way - which is flattering but makes me very, very anxious. I'm also very wary of casual friends because all too often I simply get roped into being their personal counsellor, so I'll end up acting chilly until I feel it's safe enough to be as warm as I'd naturally like to be, without them getting any ideas. 
This was a very long-winded response, sorry! It's weird inside my head - I have very, very strict rules on social interaction which I sometimes find hard to articulate clearly to others. "
449,isfj,"Yeah, that's what Ti is like for me. Jumping a dozen steps ahead without stopping to thoroughly explain the steps there. I'm also really confused about why you describe Ni as chaotic? Ne is far more chaotic, imo - but then again, that may only be my experience of it as an inferior function. 
This is rather connected with 1. for me. I'll be thinking about something that my brain has rather latched on to, go down a mental rabbit warren, and then turn to whoever is near me and ask them a question related to it. I've not explained why the hell I'm even thinking about such a thing in the first place, so that confuses people. This isn't so much specifically Ti alone, for me, as a weird combo of Si-Ti-Ne - my experiences (Si) feed into 'what ifs' (Ne) which is then analysed by Ti, and I start wondering about things. 
Experience suggests, logically, that X will result in Y. (Si-Ti) The difference here is that for an INFJ it might be Ni-based rather than Si-based - I have literally no clue how anybody could ever guess something will happen in the future other than what has been evidenced in the past, though, so I'm not even going to try to explain it. Ni rather baffles me! 
Not sure how I can really explain this one - it pretty much says it on the tin. Again, my thoughts can go all over the place and I try to 'info dump' on people without really being very good at deciding what they need/don't need to know - I want to convey every single detail, the more the better, and I invariably lose or confuse people. 
Yeahhhhh. Sometimes there are just concepts that are so incredibly difficult to put into words - they're deep, they're nebulous, and they're constantly floating just out of reach of my brain. It's like seeing something out of the corner of your eye and then being asked to describe, in detail, what exactly you saw. I don't usually try to share with people, because ime this leads to nothing but frustration. Plus the whole 'can't stop cringing over it as I try to sleep'? Welcome to my life, a.k.a. vividly replaying things that have happened over and over in my mind 24/7. 
‎
All of these are when my brain is going at a thousand miles an hour and my tongue is struggling to catch up. I can barely finish a thought before I'm instantly on to the next one, and it's rare to find a person that can keep up with me, especially when talking about more abstract things. 
‎
Not so sure about this one, to be honest. If I understand somebody, I will typically rephrase it back to them and ask them if that's what they meant, just to make sure. If I don't understand, I'll ask them to 'talk around' it until it makes sense. 
Idk this has always just been common sense to me. It's not exactly rocket science to try to understand where somebody else is coming from and then figure out the reasoning behind their behaviour. 
See no. 15! Being able to 'see both sides' is a blessing and a curse. My problem is that I never know which one is 'right' - sometimes the rules are very clear, but even then that doesn't mean I stop empathising with the other person who is 'wrong'. I put this down to Fe-Ti, tbh - empathising as a starting point, and then unpacking the reasoning behind each stance. 
Think this might be Fe, actually, but I really don't know. Idk I mean I apologise as much as your average Brit (i.e. quite a bit) so I'm not really sure what would make apologising standout. In my experience, the most prolific apologies are the ones with the most cripplingly low self-esteem and anxiety - not a particular personality type. 
Depends. I'd say this is Fe again, but whether this is me depends on the conflict and the other person. 
All of these, to me, seem like the rabbit warren that can be Ti. In tert position (both INFJ and ISFJ) it can be slightly weak and confusing at times, making it difficult and frustrating to communicate where the heck our minds are going, especially when talking.
This is...long and not really only specific to Ti, but I hope it gives an overview of how I related to the list as an ISFJ. I would imagine people from all different types can relate, to some extent, even if the functions behind the behaviours are different. "
450,isfj,"IxFJs have Fe-Ti so making sure something makes sense internally before conveying it so as to not cause any misunderstandings could cause verbal slip-ups. Some are more particular with their words than others but happens regardless. I mean I think it honestly happens to everyone at some point, we are all human after all but it tends to happen to INFJs alot."
451,isfj,"Ni. Both Ni and Si are essentially the same function in terms of actions. They both work unconsciously, they both focus on pattern recognition, and they both reference the past upon looking at the present and future. The difference between the two is the type of information they collect. Si focuses on subjective physical impressions as where Ni focuses on subjective conceptual impressions. Ni tends to be more abstract so it can be tricky when it comes to Ti making sense of these perceptions in a way that Fe can properly convey. "
452,isfj,"Yeah theres alot of descriptions that try to depict Ni as this grandiose, mystical function. It's really not. It's no more or less complicated than the other three perceiving functions. Ni likes patterns and tends to make internal, subjective connections between things at odd times. It likes to form views of the future for the user as well. It doesn't make someone some mystical, future telling unicorn that is always right about everything. I just looks at patterns depending on the function it's being used with. When focused through Fe/Se the user will tend to see behavioral patterns in people in civilization. It might also cause the user to look at what they would like civilization conceptually to be as it pertains to people in the future. When focused through Te/Se the perceptions tend to pay attention to patterns in systems in civilization. In contrast it may cause the user to see how new theoretical systems may improve the productivity of civilization in the future. "
453,isfj,"See, maybe I'm being really dumb, but honestly so much of that sounds very, very similar to Si to me. Patterns, connections, and general principles are based on experience, after all. My understanding is that Si is more focused on personal, subjective experience and recollection - the individual's experience of something being the primary thing everything else is filtered through. From what I can gather, Ni seems to be more about drawing what is understood to be universal truths from the particulars? 
Caveat, here: I've always, always struggled to tell where Si stops and Ni begins, because conceptually they're so tangled up together for me. It was the Se-inf vs Ne-inf that cinched the N vs S for me and confirmed ISFJ over INFJ! "
454,isfj,"Just wondering. Personally I drive a 2011 Subaru Impreza. I love Subies; my parents have had them for years. My first car was a stick shift 2001 Forester, then an automatic 2005 Impreza, and my car now is a stick shift. To me they strike a good balance between fun and practical. What about you?"
455,isfj,"Honda Fit for me. Hondas never gave us mechanical issues when I lived with my parents and the hatchback design means I can transport decently sized cargo conveniently. Gas mileage and high safety ratings are both great, too.
My ISFJ SO drives an SUV because she's tiny and likes feeling big, lol. "
456,isfj,"'06 Corolla.  It's still chugging along fine and I'm in school right now, so I probably won't be getting a new car for a few more years.  I don't really care about what my car looks like, I'd just like more inside comforts since what I have is very basic.  Also car tech has changed a lot and I want that bluetooth and backup camera.  Thinking of maybe a Honda next? (I'm so wild and adventurous!  Honestly, reliability is most important to me.)"
457,isfj,"I have a ford fiesta in bright blue :D I'm not too picky with cars as long as they're clean and run well. I do prefer smaller cars like the one I currently have, though. Easier to park & less stress when changing lanes."
458,isfj,"I went with practical over appeal. ‘08 Suzuki SX4 JLX. Nothing beats 8 months of winter like a front wheel, all wheel drive, manual transmission on all weather treads. I like to disengage the electronic stabilizer to drift with the wheels locked in AWD. "
459,isfj,"Have a 2012 Honda Insight. It was originally my brothers but he liked my 2007 Scion TC more. I do like the perks of paying less for gas and much less often.
I don't really have a dream car, I just want something red and has good milage and 4 doors that's not too big."
460,isfj,"First car was a 2006 Chevy equinox in red, not my favorite had lots of issues and spent lots of money on repairs but it worked for college travel back and forth 2.5 hours! Now 3 years later I have a 2015 Ford Escape🖤 I needed something reliable for my 40 minute work commute. It’s black and if you look closely it’s almost glittery, has heated seats and came with a remote starter, I couldn’t be happier!"
461,isfj,"Haha, I was kind of picky (wanted a Subaru, most likely red), so I got a red Impreza. I don't need like, crazy features, but omg my Bluetooth radio (actually aftermarket from the last owner) is amazing!!! Also my phone is one of those without an aux jack... Lol. Hondas are great cars! (Full disclosure: I once worked for Honda. xD)"
462,isfj,"My parents have strictly owned Priuses for the past 10-15 years. I love driving them, they handle pretty well. And the fuel efficiency is a nice bonus. I would get one but I prefer having an AWD car due to the weather where I live."
463,isfj,"I'm new to this sub and am also a huge nerd, so I was wondering what RPG class an ISFJ would most likely be? I play a lot of WoW and have constantly wondered this. I'm pretty into categorizing, so it's always peaked my interest to know what shoe fits best.
I know that types may not perfectly fit a class, but which one would an ISFJ most likely be? If possible, answer in terms of a class and not a role, unless a role is what is chosen most often.
*NOTE: Just copied this from my post on /r/ISTJ as I'm curious about this sub as well."
464,isfj,"I play D&D, and my favorite class is probably the monk. The one I'm currently playing will do anything he can to help the common folk. I guess I just really like the idea of a super disciplined fighter that needs nothing more than the clothes on his back to kick ass."
465,isfj,"ISFJ here, and I love Hunter and Paladin and Warrior. Hunter for independent running around. Paladin and Warrior tanking for groups as far as WoW goes. When it comes to tabletop games, like D&D. I typically play Cleric.  I end up being called ""the glue"" because I'm the person who makes the group stick together....."
466,isfj,"I like playing healers but not all the time, sometimes I like to be an adc instead of support in League of Legends. Jungle is nice sometimes but I feel too much pressure with the wrong teammates. For WoW I have always absolutely loved playing druids, hunters and anything kind of earthy. Alchemy and herbology are always an interest in any game. I always prefer to be a ranged character no matter what game I'm playing, I like to stay at a distance and deal out damage whilst dodging or support with heals and such."
467,isfj,"I'm always playing as a healer or white mage on Final Fantasy games, I always pick Andriel the elf on LOTR: War in the North which I play a fair amount, I have her with healing style skill trees to support people, and it works very well. "
468,isfj,"I resisted identifying as ISFJ for a long time. I think SFs in particular are generally assumed to be dumb or at least not nearly as smart as those brilliant NTs or whatever.
My IQ is 140+. I was valedictorian of my high school class. I have lots of high-level discussions with my friends, I love art and intellectually challenging activities, and I easily make connections between seemingly disconnected things.
But I'm undoubtedly an S. I can't stand impracticality and dreams that aren't grounded in reality. I'm observant. And Si is huge with me. It doesn't mean that I'm traditional and that I wear really generic clothing and I always follow the rules and always do exactly what my parents ask of me. It simply means that I value experience. That's it. Seriously.
Anyway, just wanted to dispel some of the myths about us. Part of the reason it can be so hard to type ourselves is because of how poorly understood most of the MBTI types are."
469,isfj,"Hello, I'm a Ne dom, and I've been tested at 127, when I was around five. A bit more than twenty years ago. (It means I'm somewhat of an average idiot by now. I'm just so prideful of an intelligence I apparently don't have I reach my intellectual limits constantly, unable to learn. I'm the opposite of OP, proving him/her right.)
I used to be an average student, and am a college dropout NEET for the last five years. I'm an active internet user for the last fifteen years, but always lived with computers around.
Don't believe what's written about your type around the Internet : it's because we're the masters here, and we're jealous.
Sensors get shit done, with maximum comfort and efficiency. When I struggle on my daily chores, I take it as a reminder it's me who's unfit.
The statistics says the same : Around 6% of Ne doms, intuitives are minority. ISTJ most represented, with ISFJs in second. You're the most represented among women.
ISTJs are found surrepresented in high responsibilities roles in the work place : CEOs, Directors, engineers. 
Don't bow in front of our bullshit. You're people of integrity.

PS : ""Valuing experience"" is the best way to explain Si-Fe I've ever seen. "
470,isfj,"Yeah the idea of sensors as lower intellectual beings can be really grating. I literally once had someone ask me if I was sure I wasn't INFJ because I was so good at understanding people and concepts lol.... 
I try not to pat myself on the back for my intelligence too much because it just doesn't seem like a nice thing to do, and it's something that's largely out of my control, anyway. But at the same time, it can be interesting to observe differences. Backstory: I dropped out of college for mental health reasons. I've always done quite well in school and my professors were pretty dismayed when I left lol, but I couldn't handle the pressure after basically sleeping my way through high school, still making good grades, and walking into college totally unprepared. 
So these days I honestly do feel less intelligent without the constant mental stimulation that school provides, but still, in day-to-day life sometimes there are things that are interesting to note. I pick things up faster than a lot of people; it's easier for me to memorize patterns and tasks, and to understand the reasoning behind what I'm doing. At this point I'm just a part-time cashier, but I still understand why and how the dumb credit card machines work the way they do better than my coworkers lol. It's a silly example, but that kind of thing happens a lot, even though I'm chronically exhausted and my memory is horrible. Not all the time; I'm basically useless in math beyond basic arithmetic, for example, and sometimes random things will just straight up refuse to click in my brain. But often things that other people struggle with just seem to flow more naturally for me. 
And honestly, I think my intelligence is because of my type, not in spite of it. Being able to pull from stores of data to make connections between situations and subjects is an incredibly useful skill to have! It's wonderful for analyzing and for cementing things in your memory by placing them in a context and creating an interconnected web of knowledge that backs your understanding of whatever the task or idea at hand is. I think part of the reason I'm so bad at math is because I don't have anything to connect it to; it all feels like totally random and isolated principles, and I have trouble making sense of it without a context to place it in. 
Anyway, that's enough rambling from me haha, thanks for sharing your thoughts/experience! It's always good to fight back against stereotypes, and the online mbti community can be ridiculously unfair to sensors :/ "
471,isfj,"For whatever reason, the idea of being nice and the idea of being intelligent at the same time are hard for people to grasp. I live my life as mindfully as I can and always try to be kind first. But, I'm a phd student in Biology and I constantly feel like no one takes me seriously because I am more than willing to put other people first. As annoying as it is, I would much rather people underestimate me and feel good about being kind than people taking me more seriously because I'm not."
472,isfj,"Thank you. I also had trouble accepting I was an isfj for the minor achievement of ""not being dumb as rocks."" Over the years, I've written a virtual novel on how s-type misconceptions skew online mbti demographics and discussion. I eventually gave up and I only check in here now and again. It's nice to see people still fighting the good fight. "
473,isfj,"I agree. The assumption that ISFJs aren't very bright gets annoying.   I will say that I don't remember facts (history, etc..) well, but I think that we are very good at understanding concepts and people. I feel like I'm ahead of the other person in the conversation a lot of the time.  And I can't figure out why, but it seems like people with Te (intj, entj, etc..) are always underestimating me. Like In conversations, I'll completely understand what they are saying, but it's like they treat me as if I have no concept of the way anything works, which can be annoying.  I'm a computer science student at a university currently, and I feel like we can be just as good, if not better, at problem solving and logical thinking than other thinking types.  Sorry for the jumbled response, I'm just throwing my thoughts out there "
474,isfj,Apparently since I was born a 'genius' (through tests because my behavior learning patterns were weird as a channel) doing well in school and being a general rational thinker I think people have seen me as a Thinker type and cant possibly be a Feeler Type 
475,isfj,"Yeah the stereotypes are so stupid. I’m an ISFJ an Accounting major who’s doing very well in that major. I think it’s just that intuitives are rarer than sensors so they automatically think they are smarter. I might not like dealing with abstract concepts like effective intuitives can. However sensors are much better with the practical concerns. For example, I am able to mermize a concrete concept or procedure like data, fact numbers and be able to apply it on an exam and daily life. So yeah sorry for the mini rant but ISFJs can be smart and don’t let anyone tell you different! Besides I think the stereotypes of NTs being smarter than SFs are stupid, we all are intelligent in our own way and we should all respect our differing levels of intelligence . 
TL,DR: ISFJs have a great logistical and administrative intelligence compared to intuitives "
476,isfj,"""often things that other people struggle with just seem to flow more naturally for me"" 
""the reason I'm so bad at math is because I don't have anything to connect it to; it all feels like totally random and isolated principles""
Great definitions in which I see myself. "
477,isfj,"Fitting. And interesting.
I read all three types and it's really hard to pick only one."
478,isfj,"I've been typed as a 6 by online acquaintances (the full tritype being 6w5 4w5 9w1, ""The Seeker""). Despite it's reliability I sometimes question my full tritype. However, i'm pretty dead set on being a Six. This one video in particular hit so hard i gushed out literal tears.
​
On a related tangent, i believe most ISFJs would be 2, 6, and 9. Keep in mind that this is mostly my conjecturing and i mostly have done research into 6 and 9. Anyways, 2 because the very nature of shame and martyrdom really aligns with ISFJ's demonstrative Fi+ ""no no no, i'm a good person"". 6 partly in because, well, Si dom and inferior Ne. 9 because Pi. IxxJs in general are glacial. 1 may also be a possibility. "
479,isfj,"Hey that video is definitely interesting with the depth it went into! I used to think I was a 6w7-4w5-9w1 a while ago, although I was confused whether I was FiSe or SiFe. But I realised that I was ISFJ, and 6w7-9w1-2w1 was more fitting for me personally when reading up more on 2's and it also fits well as an ISFJ type like you said.
Enneagram can sometimes cause some dilemmas for me though because it's a lot easier to get caught up thinking you're different types all the time, especially with the tritype! I feel like the self-doubt that comes with the 6's and to a degree 9's, can make it difficult to type oneself properly."
480,isfj,"My wife (age 31) is going through an existential crisis since few weeks after she started a new job 1 month ago. The current and previous job are both in quality assurance. But the new job as twice much work and stress according to her and she is not equipped with high degree of computer skills that the new job requires. The job change was a result of her parents expectations for her to progress more. The colleagues and boss are all nice but extroverts and she cannot make short talk so she is silent all day and feeling isolated. A temporary worker who joined alongside her is charming everyone while she is finding it difficult to concentrate, understand and deliver on the expectation arising from that she already have five years of experience. The result is that she is crying everyday and burying herself in self-doubt. According to her, she is disappointing everyone at work.  She is trying to work extra hard but she is saying that she is not learning. She is also thinking that she will get fired, which in my opinion is impossible. She is quite depressed and thinking about changing career to more practical work like biomedical analyst, which according to her does not require to come up with new ideas and leading at work. This would require three years of study. In all of this, i have to be away for work on a 2 week basis for a total of four months. She has assured me that she will be in touch with her friends.
Any advise from you will be useful.  As ISFJs how long have been your crises? How do you get over them? "
481,isfj,"Hi, sorry to hear your wife isn't enjoying her new job. One thing I would say is that as ISFJ's we like to a) put loads of pressure on ourselves b) want to know something inside out before we give it a go, which isn't always the case with a new job.
I hated my last job for some similar reasons - long hours, too much work, crazy pace, disorganised, major emphasis on being extroverted and an amazing presenter (which I'm not). I struggled to progress too as I felt like I didn't fit in/didn't want to sacrifice my life to the company for the sake of getting ahead which seemed to be what you needed to do.
It gave me a major existential crisis where I was basically going to drop out of my career and be a dog walker or something. I hated it from the first week but stuck it out for 2 years as we were planning on moving house.
Within a month of moving house I'd applied for a new job and got the hell out of there. I've never looked back, I've been promoted in my new job within a year and I'm making more money working much less hours. I will say it still took me 6 months or so to really get my bearings and find my footing with my job so maybe your wife is being hard on herself, I always find it takes a while not to feel like a newbie. 
Tell her to take lots of notes, make sure she organises her workload as well as she can, ask clarifying questions as often as she needs to, put stuff in emails if she needs a record, ask other people for help when she needs it. If she needs more training in the computer side of things then she needs to ask for it (even if it's from a colleague rather than a manager) or maybe take the time to learn it in her spare time. ""I can't do it"" isn't always acceptable at work.
You need to be supportive of her decisions. I was totally whiny during the job I hated, and it interfered with life away from work, which annoyed my husband and made him snippy about my job too. This wasn't that helpful but I will say he was very supportive of me taking the time to fill in applications etc which was helpful."
482,isfj,"tl;dr: The pressure is mostly self-made. Be open, honest, show that you care and it will get better. Experiencing positive feedback and achievements will build optimism.
wall of text:
I am in similar position in the sense that I am working at a new company get thrown into many projects on short notice and need to work on things I have no or little experience with. It makes me really uncomfortable to not be good and confident with the tasks that are asked from me.
Being in my third month now I noticed that people are always surprisingly appreciative of my work even if I sometimes have to ask for help, I feel slow and on a few occasions I had to say that I can't do something. I tend to think of me as a liability because I am not perfect but it's just not true and the people know that I can't do everything and are usually happy when I ask for help. The alternative is that somebody finds out that I tried on my own and failed when it is too late.
My company is in tech and I have no idea how supportive line managers are in other companies. Here they are really trying to help me do my job well. I would try to be open about the problems and ask for advice how to deal with it.
On the other side I notice that I like several tasks that more xNxP types (I guess) hate which is usually repetitive or ""tedious"" detail work or desk research and so on. If she can find these things in her company she might be able to get more comfortable tasks for herself while being the favorite colleague for taking over these things.
Some optimism goes a long way. She should try to notice and believe in praise she gets and acknowledge her own achievements. It's easy to brush this off as a one-off or luck or whatever. It is deserved! And if it repeats it will build the experience and predictability that we ISFJs love. You might be able to help her with that. Ask how her day was and ""celebrate"" the good things. Focus on that.
I also tend to be quiet and not chat with everybody every chance I get. I like to do lunches alone to recharge and nobody was questioning that. However, I also try to integrate and be nice. I often join for a beer after work even if I am not the most fun person in the room. My colleagues appreciate it, I get to know what they do and over time casual communication gets a lot easier.
That all being said. I also have my doubts that I am in the right space and often crave for a job that I can cultivate mastery in. Then I would feel prepared for most challenges that come my way. I actually was thinking about making a thread about how other ISFJs deal with it. So this is interesting."
483,isfj,"Thank you for sharing your story and advising. Right now, she is in a very negative cycle to confront her boss or to start positive actions to solve her work related problems. I will her know that changing job is always a option. "
484,isfj,"Thank you for your response. 
She has spoken to her boss today for the first time and realized how helpful and caring the boss is. Earlier, she was just thinking about disappointing the boss and breaking expectations of the people around. 
She will start going to psychotherapy and will try to survive this crisis remaining at this job given the reaction of her boss."
485,isfj,"Good to hear that she is communicating and experiencing similar support. Good managers will be concerned with the well being of their reporting employees. If they notice that somebody tries they will do their best to provide the help that is necessary. Good managers are there to help and not just measure if everybody is performing 100%. I also just learned that not too long ago.
Good luck with everything."
486,isfj,"What's your strategy in getting yourself out of the slump when you KNOW you're being too hard on yourself?
Mine is making sure I distract myself and telling myself that it's all in my head and that what I'm thinking is probably not true.
Example: when I make a mistake which causes someone I care about to get upset, I tend to dwell on it and mope around a bit. But I try to snap out of it by being productive, going to the gym and basically, tell myself that I'm over thinking it (which works like 30% of the time but that's still something).
Please share your stories and tips!
Love,
Another ISFJ"
487,isfj,"I practice learning and changing. So i'd think ""you handled things this way. now you see a better way of doing it. do that next time. you are a different person now. don't feel bad, old you did it wrong, new you will get it right""
and it was hard as heck to do that in order to not wallow in regret while still seeking self improvement. it took a few years but i've turned it into a reflex. mistake! -
gym helped a lot because of having to learn how to get my form down for lifting and slowly getting it better and better. also Meet the Robinsons was a big help."
488,isfj,"Sometimes the only way I can pull myself out of that is with some help from others.
I have 3-4 people in my life who really care about me, and really have my back. Obviously I try to redirect my thinking patterns on my own first, and if I can, I try to distract myself with other stuff in hopes that it'll pass.
But during those times when I'm really down on myself, feel like I'm not worth anything, etc, I usually try to talk to someone I love, and it is reassuring to have them tell me that I'm not a waste of flesh, basically."
489,isfj,"I don't have any tricks that work for me yet, but wanted to say that this thread is extremely helpful to read through. I get in my head way too much and the whole beating myself up thing is really exhausting, so I will be trying out the tips mentioned by other users."
490,isfj,"The one way I learned to forgive myself is acceptance.  Accepting my flaws and imperfections and once I have done that, then I move on to how I can stop myself from doing x y z in the future.
Even if I can't forgive myself I try not to waste too much time basking in misery because time is a luxury and I shouldn't spend my youth in my own head.
much love and best of luck to you <3"
491,isfj,"So.  It's from Dr. Burns' book, The Feeling Good Handbook.
I feel like a lot of people have a self-help book they swear by, and this is mine.  I always want to talk about it on Reddit but never have because I don't want to look like I'm....advertising it, I guess?  But.  It's great.  And daily mood logs really help me get out of a rut. Especially if something has been eating me up for days.
My first recommendation would be for you to just get the book.  I got mine for about $4 off of a used book site.  Abebooks or Betterworldbooks, one of those (geez, advertising all over the place!).
Essentially, you identify an event, very specifically, that's been bothering you.  Then you identify which emotions you're feeling and how strongly you're feeling them.
Then you write down all your automatic, negative thoughts and rate how strongly you believe them.
Then you go back through and identify the cognitive distortions in each thought.
Then write a more positive/realistic thought and rate how strongly you believe it.
Then you go back to the negative thoughts and re-rate them and see how strongly you still believe them.  
I really can't do it justice.  The book does a much better job explaining it and giving rationale, but yeah, that's my best coping strategy. "
492,isfj,"Thank you for this. This is something similar to a coping strategy for anxiety where you describe the event that makes you anxious, write down how you feel about it, rationalize if it is realistic and write down a more positive emotion. Supposedly this helps calm the anxiety down a lot."
493,isfj,"Hey Reddit, my name is jetplane48 (ESTP 7w8 sx/sp) and I am starting up a podcast in relation to MBTI. Fundamentally, the goal of the podcast is to educate the viewers of several Typology systems through a series of one-on-one's with others who are interested in the same topics. I have been conducting interviews for many years (MBTI related) and this is just an extension of that, however, I want to discuss topics that the audience wants me to cover. Naturally, I'll come up with my own material but I would love to explore topics that others have in mind. I am busy with school for the next few months but when I finish, the goal is to eventually be more consistent with these podcast uploads if this turns out to be popular enough. I'm very excited to get this started, and let's see some questions!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAR20eDTSOg"
494,isfj,"I used to think I was an ENFJ, but I’m rethinking and now believe that I am an ISFJ through retaking tests after a year or so and asking people on r/mbti. I’ve been watching a ton of videos about people discussing other ISFJ’s, and one of the huge attributes of ISFJs that always comes up is how amazing they are at remembering things and retaining information. This couldn’t be further from the truth for me. I can’t remember what I had for breakfast in the morning, much less tiny details in conversations I’ve had with people lately. Is this the case for any other ISFJ’s? Do I still have my type wrong? "
495,isfj,"I think people misunderstand Si. people with strong Si (SJs) tend to process information based on what their senses have observed in the past. So, far example, if an Si user had a bad experience with a certain brand in the past, they would be more likely to avoid buying their products in the future. I was watching an interesting video on how different personality types learn math and the biggest takeaway (for me) was that SJs like to learn through repetition and they feel comfortable doing tasks they have experience with in the past. As an INFJ, I get bored really easily and like to move on when I have mastered something, which is common among intuitive doms. However, SJs prefer sticking to what they already know. The difference between Ni and Si is that Ni is more abstract in nature so it is more difficult to explain. As an Ni dom, I just have these random ""aha!"" moments and I can't explain how or where they came from. Si doms, on the other hand, will be able to give you a concrete explanation for their beliefs and decisions...."
496,isfj,"Well, I would absolutely say that my memory is bad on days when I'm tired - I tend to forget small things that I previously remembered, and my memory about, say, what happened yesterday or two days ago can be spotty, even if the event was important.  I do happen to be great at retaining information that I consider important; I am great at remembering orders and directions because I don't want to need to ask again, so I listen well the first time and keep what I was told in mind.  I remember facial expressions very, very, well, particularly if something about a person's facial expression struck me - they looked angry, were they angry with me? Were they just having a bad day? I remember things that were said that hurt my feelings, and I remember them almost word-for-word. I remember things almost as though I'm writing a list from front to back - I can give you a nice summary of what I did in 2018, but I can't tell you everything, and I've forgotten over half of 2018."
497,isfj,That is very interesting and I can confirm all of that based on my behaviour and preferences. I really like repetitive video games that are basically the same every round like Street Fighter and DotA. Practicing the same thing was more interesting to me than exploring.
498,isfj,"If I like someone, I'll remember basically everything they say. It's kind of remarkable. One of my exes would get freaked out because I'd randomly quote something he didn't remember saying or mention something he forgot he told me. Lol."
499,isfj,"I'm this way too, a total completionist in gaming. I've also flip flopped between ISFJ and INFJ, but settled on ISFJ. My memory, for what it is worth, is terrible. But that makes sense to me, Si is about impressions and not about details. I think the type descriptions have ISFJs all wrong. 
That's an interesting find (to the other poster) regarding doing math problems, but I disagree. I would sit down and do math problems... to understand math. My dad, an INTJ is the same way. We both have degrees in math. But even I, as an ISFJ, prefer cracking an interesting new problem than old routine drudge work. 
If a kid isn't doing math problems, I think it's more of a lack of discipline or a poor teacher or some other factor not related to S/N. "
500,isfj,"I keep reading about ISFJ's being boring homebodies that like routine. I'm an ISFJ but in many aspects I can't relate. Yes at times I'm really good at getting shit done around my moderately clean apartment and sometimes I procrastinate or I'm to busy to finish chores (like folding laundry). But I am very social. Most people mistype me, including my family, thinking I'm extroverted. I need socialization and will seek it out. If I need to socialize but my friends are working or busy with family stuff I'll go to bars alone, music festivals alone, traveled internationally solo. I'm not great at getting groups of people motivated to do something with me but I do occasionally. And if I want to try something new or go somewhere I will go alone if I can't get anyone to come. And sometimes I'd rather go alone cause I don't want to go with someone who doesn't enjoy the activity or will complain if they don't like trying something new.
I have a lot of hobbies and interests. I've had a hard time in LA cause people my age just want to go to the bars all the time and I want to go backpacking, or to museums, or scuba diving or talk about books, media, business, stocks, etc. In fact, socially I feel more isolated cause I feel like I have to have multiple groups of friends for my different interests and I wish I could just have a ""go to"" group of friends for all the different things I enjoy. For example I have a ton of friends that will meet me at the bars, a small group that I go backpacking/ hiking with, a few people I scuba dive with, and ONE friend that I can meet at a quiet bar and have business/ stock/ media/ philosophical discussion with (He's an INFJ if your wondering) <wish there was more. 
Some of this social problem is the city I live in. Or at least thats what I gather from some of my close friends I share this with. 
Bu I'm just wondering if other ISFJ's can relate. Is there any other ISFJs who love adventure and feel like we ISFJs falsely get a co-dependence title?"
501,isfj,"I can relate to this very well.
I also have a lot of hobbies and I love to get to do them with a group f friends. Often though I don't find people who like the same stuff with the same intensity as I do. I changed quite a lot in recent years to do more of it on my own. Went to a motocross track on my own, went to a BMX event alone and watched, I go to the cinema alone quite often and I like to go outside to explore city and nature around.
However, for me it always about finding familiarity in the stuff I do that makes me at ease even if each ""adventure"" is different. The first time doing these things was kind of scary but afterwards it became incredibly easy and enjoyable. I only have to do it a few times to proof to me that I can do it and it will be great.
For example I am also at ease with going on dates with girls. Did it a few times, recognised the pleasure in it and that I will be fine no matter the outcome. On the other hand going somewhere to meet new guy friends seems surprisingly scary to me right now.
I also totally agree with your wish of having groups of friends to do all the stuff together. I went mountain biking with a group of friends recently and it was the best. Actually I wished you were in my vicinity and I would totally join you for most of the stuff. :D

In general for ISFJs I think they can enjoy most of the stuff you describe. They just need to break out of the loop to trying something for the first time. I think I read something about some loop between the functions that make us crave the comfort zone (which can be much beyond our couch at home^^) and the rational that it worked for us so far and we should keep doing what we do. They talk about this in this forum. Takes effort to break out of this but it can be done."
502,isfj,"i don't love it, i prefer to stay at home, but i also don't want to live a life where i haven't tried a bunch of stuff. so i end up doing a bunch of stuff like you.
in the last two months i went sky diving for the 2nd time, kayaking, drove on a 5 hour drive to a place where i hiked see the eclipse, went on a week long vacation to orlando, attended a indie game convention, went on another 5 hour drive to a wedding in a forest-y no phone connectivity place, sparred at boxing for the first time, also i help run a role playing game every other week, and i do regular weight training 3-4 days a week, and have a full time job.
just got back from the wedding yesterday. next weekend is a role playing game. the weekend after i'm going to start taking weekly martial arts class (looking into krav maga or defence lab). the weekend after that i'm going to go on another long drive to a lights festival where people light up lanterns and release them into the sky. tonight i'm buying tickets to atlanta georgia for november to visit a friend.
i bring close friends with me on these trips. whoever can make it goes. every friend i have is different and they each and do the thing with me that works for them. in my head i mentally know which one is good for what. which is my philosophical friends, which is my fight friends, adventure friends, outdoor friends, city foodie friends, etc.
also, i'm exhausted."
503,isfj,"That loop is interesting! I definitely see the default function for us ISFJs. Thats why I love the intuition in others. I think mature ISFJs are open to other viewpoints and enjoy discussing them we just aren't as good at brainstorming the other viewpoints. 
I just read a lot about ISFJs anxiety and depression. If more ISFJs just faced their fear I think they would learn what an amazing world it is out there. "
504,isfj,"To have to explain them means I did a bad job.  Memes should be intuitive...  But that was just my first shot at it.  What I meant to poke fun at with each one:
Vampire one: ISFJ doesn't just speak their mind - I often have to guess whats on her mind and then she'll confirm or deny.  
Nurse one:  ISFJ clams up when angry.  I liked the intensity of the nurses face - you can see she's about to hit a boiling point - but those lips are sealed.
Poop one: I wouldn't say smothering - more like having that need for companionship.  The ISFJ I know likes a bit of me time at home, but not much - and really doesn't like going places or starting activities alone.
The hard part is that I don't know what goes on in an ISFJ's head, so I don't know what's relate-able.  To make it worse, my ISFJ is a lot of things ISFJs usually aren't (geeky, atheist, pot smokin, etc.)
What does an ISFJ think is funny about themselves - that they don't see as much of in the other types? "
505,isfj,"Not geeky! Ha! I beg to differ on that! As my wife says I’m full of useful/useless knowledge on a ton of subjects. It’s a passion to know a lot and be the geek in our friends circles.
1: yeah I’m hard to read.
2: I let things eat me alive until I’ve had enough then I let it out in tsunamis. 
3: yeah recharge my batteries. Can’t be my best without inner focus and mindless hobbies to keep me focused."
506,isfj,"I thought the first one was funny, but I misinterpreted! I thought like, “I’ll help you out, but only if you ask the right questions.” Maybe I’m just kind of jaded at this point and it’s not an isfj trait. I do want to be super helpful to people, but only when they ask for exactly what they need help with. Even if I can tell what they want they’re kind of getting at right away. "
507,isfj,"ACCURATE  
Yeah, to a point. But once I get to the right level of angry, I let fly.  
Huh. Is that an ISFJ thing? Because that's not me AT ALL. I prefer being alone usually."
508,isfj,"No that's perfect!  Do you ever notice that you do it elsewhere too, or is it just when people ask you for help?  When asked for your thoughts, opinions, etc. do you tend to stay quiet until it's phrased just right? "
509,isfj,"Female ENTP here, dating a lovely ISFJ man for a bunch of months now. He's a total sweetheart, and I make sure that he knows that I love and appreciate him. I make sure to treat him as well as I can, but I recognize that our types are vastly different, so I thought I'd ask here for tips on keeping my ISFJ happy. Thanks in advance!"
510,isfj,What things does he do for you? People often will tell you how they would liked to be loved by how the express it. I am ISFJ(F) with and INTP(M). I prefer quality time. I want to have quality conversation. I want to feel like my INTP still finds me to.be interesting. Also the 5 live languages is helpful to figure out how he and you both prefer to be loved. 
511,isfj,"Everyone is different but I just like to have a bit of time to myself. With one of my ex girlfriends before I knew it we were hanging out all weekend and most weeknights, it just got a bit too much for me. Also let him help you if he wants to don't just brush him off."
512,isfj,"He does a lot for me, I think we cover all of the love languages tbh. He tells me he loves me every day (words of affirmation), he likes to cook for me (acts of service), he makes sure that we spend quality time together (quality time) and he's very physically affectionate and cuddly (physical touch). Neither one of us is all that into gift giving (I've specifically told him that I'd rather have a nice experience than material things, and he agrees), but he buys me flowers every now and then.
In addition to this, he has shown that he cares about the things that are important to me; my field of work/study, my interests, my group of friends etc. I really appreciate this about him, my last ex didn't care about getting to know my friends and never asked about what I was reading, lectures I went to etc."
513,isfj,"Words of affirmation isn't just I love you. It's positive encouraging words where someone NEEDS to hear things. Like I get CRAZY sad if I don't have any kind of physically affection and  quality time. My INTP is words of affirmation. We need to build them up. We are their biggest cheerleaders. Words of affirmation is more like "" I love that you will do anything for me"" "" thank you for working so diligent to care for us""  or i. Your case "" it really means a lot to me that you care about getting to know my friends and are always interested in what I'm learning. It makes me feel very valuable. And I'm so thankful you are sensitive to notice the small details. You are a good man"". 
https://www.5lovelanguages.com/languages/words-of-affirmation/
Just from reading your post I would say acts of service and quality time are his. "
514,isfj,"ENTP male here who has spent the better part of a year trying to win the affection of an ISFJ female coworker. The fact she's a coworker has kept things kind of slow to develop, however we have a pretty strong friendship at this point. You will learn a new meaning to the concept of ""slowly opening up."" It will be both frustrating and one of the most beautiful things you ever experience. Here are my top pointers from the ENTP perspective:
1) You will probably be very confused/frustrated by her communication style for a while. You will have to initiate almost all conversations, especially over text/IM. Such is the burden of being an extrovert and a male. If you worry about ""bugging her"" you'll never hear from her. She's much more worried about bugging you, but the more you initiate with her, the more comfortable she will be with initiating with you. She will likely end text convos abruptly from your perspective. Unlike NT and NF friends who will banter with me over text continuously, if the conversation isn't serving a practical purpose, she will eventually just stop responding. Don't take it personally unless she doesn't respond the next time you strike up a conversation with her. 
2) Get used to wildly different behavior when it's just the two of you alone and when you're with other people. Things that she's comfortable talking to you about on a one on one basis will make her clam up if other people she doesn't trust are around. Once again, this can cause a lot of confusion/frustration, because as an ENTP, I'm pretty much super open no matter who I'm talking to, in any context. 
3) Similarly...respect her desire for privacy as best as possible and try not to put her on the spot by asking her to do or say something that could cause public embarrassment. 
4) My sense of humor runs both incredibly whimsical/silly and incredibly dark and cynical. Try to hold off from the incredibly dark stuff with her, especially if there are other people around. The more over the top, imaginative stuff always gets the biggest laughs from her. 
5) Things that help speed up the process of getting her to open up: opening up yourself and being honest to a fault, inviting her to do things (even if she'll say no a lot of the time), writing her a heartfelt card/message on special occasions like her birthday/Christmas, good eye contact, remembering details from your conversations, inside jokes..."
515,isfj,I find the best way to tolerate life stress is to listen to whatever song I'm currently into on repeat. Sometimes for a few hours at a time. Anyone else? I guess it's the fact that it's familiar so I know exactly what's coming.
516,isfj,"Repeat on specific songs or albums. Then I tend to go down a rabbit hole finding similar songs with similar sound to build a small list for repeat.
In reference to memory threshold for us ISFJ’s:
I use to get to the point I could call the next song on my 50 disc changer. Would fall asleep with it on shuffle and a timer. Only took a couple weeks and I had the whole thing catalogued in memory. Needed to switch the disc sequence to give myself relief of having to know the song coming up and that I didn’t like it.
Do you find your favourite number within the range typically on a disc is usually your favourite song of the album?"
517,isfj,"Yes, so much so that I have permanently associated songs to stressful times in my life haha
Hide and Seek, Imogen Heap - unemployment 2018 
Come Give Me Love, Tee Gardestaad - Unrequited crush 2017
Yuuri on Ice Free Skate - Thesis 2016
And so on. "
518,isfj,"Yeah. And depending on the level of stress, I’ll sometimes listen to the same Album on repeat for several days.
Music seriously affects my emotional state so if I’m stressed, I will listen to whatever helps reduce that stress and keep it on repeat. "
519,isfj,"Not really. I'll find something to binge or maybe a comedy to laugh at. When i listen to music, i do use it to stress out sometimes, but really i use it to keep me calm. And i cant listen to a song on repeat for very long unless i really like something about it, which doesn't happen to often. I can only name like 10 songs i've ever sone it with. "
520,isfj,"I feel like each website has a somewhat different description of ISFJs. These are some things that I do; does anyone else experience this stuff?
Perfectionism - I used to rewrite entire pages of notes because I thought they weren't neat enough (though I do have neat handwriting). I have OCD and obsess over things to an extreme.
Procrastination - I think I tend to put a lot of things off because I think I won't do it well enough so I postpone it. Like if I can't do if perfectly, I just won't do it at all (but I end up doing it in the end anyway).
Overanalyzing - I think way too much about everything. If someone says hi to me, I analyze how they said it, what face they made, if they seemed happy to see me or if they just said hi out of obligation, etc. I tend to assume that no one likes me.
Oversharing despite being shy - I am a really shy person. I'd rather sit at home every day with just the closest people to me than ever go out in public. I don't even like going to my relatives' houses because I feel so awkward around people. Yet when I am close to people, I seem to never stop talking. I actually get annoyed with myself (or at least feel like the person I'm talking to is annoyed with me), but I can't make myself stop talking.
That's all I can think of right now! Sorry it's such a long post; I'm just curious as to whether or not these are normal behaviors for ISFJs. Feel free to add any other behaviors you've noticed about yourself :) thanks!"
521,isfj,"I fit all but the over sharing, but that's just due to trust issues. I will over analyze the way I want my room to look because I want it to be perfect because I'm procrastinating a paper I should be writing. Life.  "
522,isfj,"Holy. I realise these traits the more I'm growing up. Eventually I realise it even more when I started to work.
And I'm working as a graphic designer. Everything you've typed, will occur every single day of my life.
GG we're all the same."
523,isfj,"Perfectionism: Yes, but only because I want to do it once and be done with it.  This also manifests in a Buy It For Life approach to purchasing.  I will spend extra on something, if I never have to buy another (or for a long time)
Procrastination:  God yes.  Absolutely.  I'm writing this instead of doing dishes.  :-)
Overanalyzing: A lot after the fact, but not much when actually talking to someone.  This happens to me when I'm trying to decide something or choose an option.  Right now, we're thinking of down-sizing our family vehicle and I'm driving my wife crazy with ""What about this?  What about that?  Here's an idea.""
Oversharing:  Also a big yes.  I have to be actively aware when speaking to people that I don't start blathering on and on, or veering off topic.  I over-explain, at length, often.   I am about a thousand times better at communicating by writing than by speech. "
524,isfj,"Hello chwoey! I'm not really good with words of wisdom but I hope I can help you out with my experience.
It's okay to feel sensitive. It's sort of means you're aware of the competitive world of graphic design. Right now I'm struggling with my passion with my work because there's a little competition going on in my office.
The only way to feel less sensitive or enraged with so many people being in the same industry as we're chasing, is to engage and chat with other designers. Maybe in graphic or in other criteria in creative; multimedia, interior. Discuss, debate, any kind of creative materials you feel needed to express. Always open your thoughts. Let your teammates or lecture or  colleagues know that it's important to get things, maybe not at the right perfection, but well done so everybody can be proud of.
I hope those help and inline with your question. It's a hard world, but remember failure is just one step closer to success :) Nobody's perfect."
525,isfj,"according to this scientific study with brain scans isfjs are the most right brained out of all types.they also tend to learn better via visual stimuli...anyways in your experience would you isfjs say yoru right brained?,can you easily tap into intuition.and just know things out the blue..?what right brain things can you do really well?"
526,isfj,"I just did 10 different tests and sometimes the questions they use do not yield the same results.
|Iteration|Left|Right|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Test 1|50|50|
|Test 2|34|66|
|Test 3|63|37|
|Test 4|44|56|
|Test 5|37.5|62.5|
|Test 6|60|40|
|Test 7|-|Preference|
|Test 8|50|50|
|Test 9|10|13|
|Test 10|Preference|-|
So that's 5 out of 10 for right brain, 3 out of 10 for left and 2 out of 10 with balanced. I would assume right brain takes the lead.
I believe the best right brain ""things"" I have are intuition and feelings (I'm an empath).
I do learn better with examples and visual aid too."
527,isfj,"You’d get this result with me!
However I’ve expanded my learning by all aspects as I wanted to learn how others gather information. It has helped me in user experience design and putting things into perspective for everyone I need to instruct or gain input. 
Photographic memory! It’s a little hazy at times but for the most part it’s eerie to my peers and family. Wife says I’m full of useful or useless knowledge... 
Intuition is a negative for me as I’ll usually come up with the worst case scenario and I tend to bury the excitement. I am learning not to dwell and just go with the moment unless I know for a fact the outcome will be bad.
Web and print design, programming (left), play guitar, draw, paint, wood working, cooking and baking, etc. "
528,isfj,"I don't mean to be critical, but do you mind linking the study? Most studies I've seen about the 'left vs right brain' claims have indicated that it's more of a myth and in reality people don't really favor one side of their brain the way they would a hand or eye.

529,isfj,"I'm thinking about switching over to that field from a job that requires quite a bit of abstract thinking. From my past work, I've realized that I enjoy coordinating with people from other teams. Project management seems like a potentially relevant field. What are your experiences like as ISFJ project managers?"
530,isfj,"I am not a project manager but I am a UX designer and I have done some product management.
I talk to a lot of people and have a lot of meetings. Sometimes we have workshops for multiple days. I quickly get drained from the social interaction and that makes me tired and it makes it harder to pay full attention and provide the best input. So I have to take care of planning breaks to recharge. Also my colleagues tend to understand when people get tired and are ok with having breaks or moving productive group work to the next day when the afternoon gets too long.
Leadership in general is not easy and in my opinion is a skill that needs to be developed. I see a lot of people go into management because they have worked in engineering or whatever for a long time and think it is the logical next step. Not everybody should be a manager. Good managers have good empathy (should be fine for ISFJs) but also get comfortable with giving away control. They need to make sure to solve the problems the team has so they can do their job. It is not uncommon that some people start micromanaging. I guess some ISFJs could be a bit on the control freak side..? I know I tend to be like that at least.
Another thing is getting lost in detail work when it is important to keep track of the bigger picture. That can happen and I need to remind myself. Structure and process helps with that usually.
I would not say that an ISFJ is a bad fit for project management. Keep in mind your weaknesses, account for that and develop your leadership skills. I think it is rarely a bad idea to try these things out, gain some experience and figure out how well it works for you. You can always switch to something else again."
531,isfj,"Fellow ISFJ who did a bit of PM!
Disclaimer: my old company was a bit unique in terms of culture so take this with a grain of salt.
Did I enjoy it?
Short answer: no
Long answer: no because of all the skills I lacked that were important to succeeding in the role. Skills which included leadership, diplomacy and comfort with abstract thought.
You have to critically reflect upon your skills and traits as to whether or not you can be a good leader, problem solver, and coordinator.
For me, coordination is my strength but my leadership skills are lacking.
Can you handle having people not be able to meet their deadlines?
Can you handle things not going as planned?
I worked with a large team with multiple projects running at once. What was challenging for me was getting others to do their jobs and meeting their specific deadlines. As an ISFJ, I like things that are in order, organised, and are predictable. To have experienced a lot of roadblocks where issues A, B and C would come up because X, Y, Z didn't meet their deadline or have trouble doing their specific tasks stressed me out.
We tend to have a lot of empathy for others so a lot of their excuses for not finishing their work would normally ""fly by"" which to some, might call it being a pushover.
Ultimately, the job stressed me out because of a lot of ambiguity and the constant knowledge of knowing that there is something that will always go wrong.
But like my disclaimer, take everything I said with a grain of salt because how I feel and what I experienced is not completely reflective of what project management is."
532,isfj,"The project management job was part of the automotive manufacturing side of the industry. 
I quit that job due to poor management and lack of resources and just overall bad fit.
Before the PM gig, I was in social work but due to medical reasons I can't pursue a career in that field which is ironic because that line of work should be ""inclusive"" ^but ^that's ^another ^story
Now I'm pursuing a career in tech (web development) since there seems to be a lot of demand for that now and the career advancement opportunities seems promising. Plus, I can see my organization skills being put to use as well as getting instant tangible results which is nice.
Edit: more detail"
533,isfj,"I use it for thinking about how things work- quite often when I’m not actively talking to people or remembering a moment. It can catalogue experiences, figure out a new system, analyze people from a step back. 
It’s slower and less natural than what my i*tp friends do, but it works pretty okay. "
534,isfj,"I find I use it whenever I’m making a decision that affects only myself. I take a while to make these decisions because I want to analyze all the data and determine what makes sense. In addition, it  helps me study in college as I’m able to analyze the facts with Si and Ti. Also, as I get older I find it easier to analyze my experiences and test them against logical scrutiny. Lastly, I play games like Sudoku or poker to exercise my Ti. In a negative way, it can be used when I over analyze or get stuck in the loop that I forget to consider the needs of others. "
535,isfj,"Good question. My ISFJ wife has this amazing capacity to go through logical patterns like: When this its true then this is true and when this is false then that is false. It is amazing, how she can come to conclusions without using facts and data. Though her thinking process is slower than mine, as I have Te Hero. This creates a different dynamic in coffee talks between her and me as ENTJ.
​"
536,isfj,"So I'm an enfp and I have an isfj friend... I ghosted her cause I was going through depression and wasn't really ready to talk to anyone. Recently got out and we connected again...
Still funny thing is she can NEVER let go the fact that I left her...
Despite me telling her I was going through a lot (from exams to work trouble)
She constantly tell me how during the ghosting period she had her own depression and blamed me cause I wasn't there...
Each time we meet it's good but every time I touch a sensitive topic she brings that up and puts the spotlight back on me..
It's like I'm on thin ice...
So can you guys give me tips on how to handle this or was it even my fault to begin with? "
537,isfj,"Problem is I did tell her (through a third party) that I needed time and our other friend (an intj) also insisted I should be left alone cause after awhile I would slowly come back. Yet after all of this she didn't let go but instead hound me down like some sort of prize (and this is like the second time she did that).
She persist on saying I abandoned her when she tried to reach out (by constantly calling and messaging me (which caused everything to get worse)). So is it still my fault?"
538,isfj,"Uh, yeah, it is your fault! Regardless of your internal state, you abandoned your friend (in a time of need nonetheless), used a third party to tell her off instead of having the wherewithal to do it yourself, and now you want validation that you're in the right? Take some responsibility for your behavior. What you need to do is give your friend a heartfelt apology and reassurance that you will clearly communicate your needs to her in the future. 
However, you should also be aware that your friend should absolutely not be constantly holding this over your head. If she cannot let this go, even after a heartfelt apology, then you should know that you've done all you can and your friend is hung up on the past. Bringing up your mistakes over and over again won't help heal your friendship in any way."
539,isfj,"Editing cause I don't want to be that girl with an issue...
Anyhow thank you for the advice I'll try and give her an apology she deserve. 
I don't know if this would heal everything but at least it's a step right?"
540,isfj,"Well at that point its more on her than on you. You've apologized, and you can't change the past, but she needs to move on. She can't keep punishing you for the mistakes you've made, and if it's that much of a problem, then maybe you need to distance yourself from her? I don't have any words for you to say to her that will make her stop bringing it up, but that's really not fair for her to make you keep carrying this burden.
If it were me, I'd sit her down really casually and ask her to stop bringing up those topics. I wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it, maybe frame it as her doing you a favor. If it were, say, my ENFP bff I would be very blunt about the situation and what I needed from her. But it sounds like you might have to handle it with a little more delicacy than that. "
541,isfj,"I tried to tell her it's an enfp thing and that I'm sorry but she's just said ""you shouldn't use psycology as a reason etc etc"" when all I was doing was trying to explain why I'm like that. 
I don't know what to do but I guess I should write an apology regardless.
Thank you for the advice it made me feel much better. Your the first intj that doesn't scare me (yes you guys scare me cause my best friend is an intj and she's literally a hermit that always tell me about the horrible world. And my last experience on the intj Reddit didn't end up so good ...)"
542,isfj,"Yeah, you definitely shouldn't tell people it's ~an MBTI thing~ because that just looks like you're making excuses. I've learned that the hard way, and people usually have more respect when you just own up to mistakes. And if I'm giving someone a reason why I made a mistake, I will also tell them how I will overcome that in the future so they know that it isn't an excuse (which is why I think you should tell your friend that you will attempt to communicate more clearly with her in the future).
Haha I'm glad you feel better! And the INTJ sub makes me ashamed to be an INTJ and has honestly spurred me to make changes in my own life and how I present myself to others. That's why I stick to the nice boards like r/isfj lol."
543,isfj,"Yeah but I don't know how else to explain why I ghosted. I can't tell her it's her cause it's not, I can't say it's life cause I've been through worst. The only thing I can use to explain why I ghosted was the fact that I can't understand my emotions and I needed time to think.  
Either way I'm trying hard to communicate with her but I don't really have anything to talk about (you got an enfp best friend you know how it is...gossip is not my forte and never will it ever be). Plus I settle my own issues without needing consult which I guess annoys her...
Ohhhhh good on you! Still can I ask you advice on my other friend? She's an intj and I don't know what to do with her too (yes I ghosted both but she just waited rather than hounding me like crazy)"
544,isfj,"Is it normal for ISFJ to suffer from abandonment issues? Personally my mother passed away when I was 7 years,  stepdad, Stepsister, and Stepbrother moved away after my mom died.  I never had the chance to say goodbye in a proper way to my mother and stepslibings. I wish I can make peace with them,  but It's impossible.  How do you guy's deal with this issue if you suffer from abandonment issues.  Sorry for the grammar mistakes. "
545,isfj,"Im really sorry for your lost . Im in lost for words that your stepdad and step siblings decided to just leave right away. They could have taken you also but no.
I havent suffered from abandonment issues yet. If i were to experience that, it would feel as if you are just an option to your close ones or anybody. They dont take you seriously indeed.
It's hard to be in your shoes and i wish i could give the best advice . 
Keep praying to almighty lord and everything will be fine. He listens to our prayers. Do the things you love and meet new people. You might as well connect with your cousins on your mom's side for closure and ask them for help. 
Also, do not base your worth on someone's approval or opinion of you. If they just see you as an option or a convenient friend, then they aint worth your time and you are better than  that honey. It's their problem they dont take you seriously enough. I would rather be alone than to remain friends with ""these"" people.
I know this is not an isfj ( Im an isfj) thing but I learned a lot from my past. I realized that these people are not the only ones occupyinv the planet earth. There are so much worthy people to meet.
Hope you're having the best time of your life right now
My piece of advice
🤗"
546,isfj,"Sorry about your family.. I hope that one day soon you can make peace with it.. 
I  have issues too but maybe like most of us generally do.. My parents are with me, but there were those rare moments when they fight, I had hysterical outbursts and they calm down for my sake. 
And in general, I do fear separation.. IDK how to deal with it, other than preparing myself for acceptance or a stoic resignation to fate. "
547,isfj,I lost my mom too 10 yrs ago. Didn't get a chance to say my farewells too. The pain never really goes away... it just gets better in time. But the pain will always be there. I hope you find it in yourself to not let yourself suffer for too long. Pain is inevitable...suffering is another story. 
548,isfj,"I'm sorry about that :( I definitely have separation and social anxiety which interferes in all my relationships, but I am thankful that my family and closest friends still are around to support me.
I'd say you don't suffer from abandonment ""issues"". You suffer from abandonment, period. I hope you do find support for yourself. Have you considered therapy?"
549,isfj,Sorry about your family btw. 😑 I think one key is to forgive yourself and realize that none of this is your fault. Accept what's happened and do everything in your power to move forward. Idk the whole story but maybe it is still possible to make peace with them. 
550,isfj,"I won't go in full details. But when my mother was dying in the hospital my stepdad was watching me. So one day I got in trouble in school  (elementary) and my stepdad said I will get punished.  The following morning I was about to walk out the front door and my stepdad pushed me on the couch and started choking me. My stepbrother watched in shocked.  Anyway... I ran to my Aunt house and she took me in and raised me to I turned 18. The last time I heard from my stepslibings was when my Stepsister called me and told me we will hang out and she will take me to McDonald's.  She promised . That was the very last time I heard from them.. My aunt told me in my teenage year's my stepdad was doing hard drugs while my mother was dying in the hospital.  To be honest with you guys,  I just wanted make sure my stepslibings are okay.   I already know my stepdad is dead.  My biggest fear is they forgot about me totally.  I think about them everyday! I will always love them. Even if they don't love me anymore. And about my stepdad I try to think about the good times before he started drugs.  He brought me my very first game console and introduce me to the matrix series lol. I try to think about the good times with them.. Even though some people didn't like my stepfamily because they were white, We were still close.  Sorry if my story comes off as self pity.  I honestly don't mean to do that. "
551,isfj,"Completely understandable. It's tough. I'm the same way with therapists in the past; I just felt scared to really open up. From what I read, it does take a bit to shop around for a therapist you'd feel more open with. It also might take a while to really open up, and I'm sure there are other forms of therapy you can find which can allow you to reach into your closet. Those are probably related to tools to help manage emotions and stuff. (Personally, I am eyeing CBT or DBT or something like that)"
552,isfj,"Do you ever feel like you don't belong in your group of friends because you would rather listen than share details about your life? 
As a long time introvert, i kinda find it difficult to speak because the moment i want to voice out something, it drowns very quickly because your other friends are busy talking about something  ( for instance, they have same interest and well, you are out of their line) . Although they dont do that intentionally, i feel as if they are excluding me just because i dont share the same interests with them. Im not saying they are that way but im getting the feeling. It is as if im just the listener. they are more into makeup and k drama while im here , always a plain jane ( no makeup). 
Due to that, it is not surprising that whenever im with them one on one, the conversation is somewhat shallow like "" so how are you?"", ""the weather feels like___"" or we wont say much to one another until it's time to say goodbye. 
Don't get me wrong, i also make an effort whenever they would invite me to their parties or events but still, I think Im born to be a listener ( and give an advice). Im comfortable being this way .Yes, you could say i wanna please them but i just cant help feeling excluded 
Any stories out there?"
553,isfj,"I can relate with this so much. When it’s a large group of people I do fine when smaller groups split off and I can talk with 1 or 2 people but when it’s 12 and we’re all talking about something, my voice gets drowned out really easily even if I am really interested in the topic. I’ve also been told the pitch of my voice is tough to pick out of a crowd to, which doesn’t help with feeling ignored all the time. 
Sometimes I’m actually glad I’m easily ignored or forgotten in a crowd. I don’t always want to talk or share my ideas just yet. Other times though, it really kills my drive to invest in my friends.
It’s concerning to me that you say that even one on one your conversations with friends are superficial. That would be normal if you’ve only been friends a month or two. If you’ve been friends for a lot longer then you might need to find friends you connect with better. "
554,isfj,"i get along with them just fine and two of my friends told me that if need some help , i shouldnt be afraid to ask them anything or what. 
What's ironic about this is that when i was struggling with this stalker problem during my time at university, i told them about it. We were 8 during that time. Most of them just said that the guy was just being friendly and told me not to overeact but this friend of mine, an infp, butted in and said that the behavior of the guy wasnt normal at all. Nope they didnt argue about it at all. 
What's sad about this is that it seems they didnt want to listen to my concern, except this infp friend of mine  . ( Dont worry, this month, i dont see this ""stalker"" much around the campus). Sometimes whenever they wanted to get help in their assignments, they would ask me for answers and i would willingly help them (arent friends are supposed to help one another? maybe in projects only i guess) . However when it comes to personal relations, i only know like maybe 30% - 40% each of them. Dont get me wrong, like what i said,  i also make an effort to go to their parties and listen to one of their banters.
I have like only five people i consider REAL friends : this guy who is an intp, my enfj bff, my two other isxj friends and my distant childhood friend
guess you cant expect much from people you only communicate on a shallow level huh"
555,isfj,"Most of my friends that I've ever known are extroverts and they certainly don't listen to what I have to say and often disregard what I say. That's just how some people are, I don't think it has much to do with personality type. It's also easy to get drowned out by them in a group conversation. It's awful as a guy because when you meet a girl at a bar or party and bring her over to your group of friends I get drowned out and forgotten fairly easily. I also think I have one of those voices that people don't notice or it just blends into background noise 
One on one with my friends can be difficult and easy depending on the person. I often feel like in doing the heavy lifting of the conversation. It just depends how willing they are to share as some are better than others. Some of them I could easily talk to for hours"
556,isfj,"Attention all ISFJ, Typology is in great danger, and it needs YOUR help to wipe out all the other typology mistypes. To do this, it needs amazing typologists and a couple of psychology nerds. To help it, all it needs is your intellect, creativity and acceptance to Tipsy Typology. But you gotta be quick so that Typology can secure and achieve the typing session we all deserve.

557,isfj,"I think about them a lot. I tend to reflect on things that happened in the past and wonder why they happened and why I reacted the way I did, but a lot of the time it ends up with me overthinking. I feel like while overthinking can kind of warp your perception of reasons why, it also helps to unearth your true desires because of how much you think about it again and again. (But also causes way too much stress sometimes because of how messed up things can become in your head haha)
I think talking to a fellow F helps to put emotions into perspective though, and makes it easier to process and come to terms with them.
Writing down your thoughts when you're feeling emotional helps too, since you can run everything through your head and process it before putting the thoughts into words."
558,isfj,"i read on and practice mindful living and watch a lot of youtube videos, particularly from the channel ""school of life"". and i reflect on myself using the collective philosophies i've learned to figure stuff out. and i also read a bunch of buddhist philosophy stuff and apply those too.
this video is a good watch for a western process of self reflection:

559,isfj,"""The ISFJ poorly tolerates monotony. He/she needs alternatives to boring everyday life, a possibility to make a choice, even though finding himself always in it. Greatly enjoys himself if he finds a way out of dead-end, seemingly hopeless situations. Interested in unusual and extraordinary people who have many ideas and make bold proposals. Boring, mundane people strain him; he tries to avoid their company. He is tolerant of eccentrics and inventors, all those people who are ""not of this world"". He views them like children, looks after them graciously forgiving their antics.
The ISFJ receives and understands chaotic information poorly. It makes him confused, throws him off track, may even spoil his mood. The ISFJ likes it when someone makes a connections between specific events and general concepts. His self-esteem improves from becoming aware of his own usefulness, that without him it won't do. Likes to correspond to the place or role allotted to him. Activates when he is given a clear goal and explained the trajectory of action. Ways of achieving it he will find himself. Doesn't need ""bare"" facts, instructions, explanations. The main thing for him is to like the system, that it would evoke a positive response in him. Then he becomes collected and organized."""
560,isfj,"Yep
YEp
Yep
Depends what you mean by mundane/boring
To some extent as long as they arent assholes
God yes
Yep
Yep
Yep
I think"
561,isfj,"A lot of it is relatable, yes. I don't hate monotonous tasks, but I am easily bored and tend to flit from one project to another. I like people who talk and have interesting things to say (partially because it comforts me to be around other people who are sort of off-beat and not necessarily into really mainstream stuff), but if I think that they're being a dick about their eccentricities, I'll hate them way more than the average person. And I don't think of them as children lol, I like people who I have a genuine, equal connection with and who allow me to explore lots of ideas and angles freely without feeling judged or constrained. 
1000% yes on loving to feel useful, know my goals and my path, and having info presented in a clear way. I do like having things explained to me to some extent because it's hard for me to start from scratch with no frame of reference, but you don't have to go through every single little step usually, I'll find the pattern myself after the first few times. I do love the satisfaction of figuring out a way through a tricky situation, and I think the ""specific situations-
So, for the most part yes, with a few caveats, I think this is pretty accurate for me. "
562,isfj,"The stuff about monotony is entirely relatable. While eccentrics and inventors take energy to be around, I think my fellow ISFJ's and I actually seek out these people to add the variety we crave in life and relationship. I'm not so sure ""graciously forgiving their antics,"" is quite the way to put it. We grant that their antics are normal to them and generally appreciate those antics as long as they do not negatively affect us or the people we care about. 
Chaotic information is exhausting because it is tedious to sort through. I love myself a trend. I love being useful/valuable because I desperately want to be accepted and that is how I figure I'll get there. Clear goals and direction are always nice. To me, it is not as important to ""like the system"" as it is to understand it and know how to work within it. Structure is nice, but it should have room to develop as it is more fully understood. The more it is understood, the better I like it."

PS: ISFJ = ISFp because P/J is not the same thing as p/j "
564,isfj,"Hi all, one of my closest friends is ISFJ (F 19 yrs old) and she's going through some really tough times. I'd really appreciate some insight into how ISFJs function.
My question: do you prefer to be given heaps of space to process things yourself or do you secretly want a friend to ""help"" you through it?
Background info: 
She has told me bits and pieces here and there. I've told her that she can always talk to me about anything and that I truly care about her. 
I'm worried that she's internalizing her emotions and feels like a burden to her friends by talking about it. Which as an INFJ, I do ALL the time and I totally get that.
I need to be told explicitly that someone really cares about me for me to open up.
Our conversations are typically around day to day life and I never really ask her about the problems. By doing this I'm scared that I'm being to cold or distant."
565,isfj,"The answer is yes... we need a lot of time and space to process and also we appreciate support and help. I think you’re thinking in the right direction that it’s not good to pressure or try to bring about progress. Feeling pushed can make me panic and shut down. It may take a long time in the process for her to be ready to bring you into it, but if she’s ready she will. 
Basically my advice would be to ignore the issues unless she brings them up, but do as much as possible to let her know you’re present. Maybe some thoughtful gestures that ease the small daily stresses of life. "
566,isfj,"I personally think I'm strong willed but depending on the situation I don't like telling other people because odds are it'll stress me out more.
I usually only tell people who I feel like who can actually help me with the issue directly and not try to 'console' me because I don't want them to act differently.
To me, hanging out with people that are just super fun to hang out with basically any time can help console me or get through hard mental times."
567,isfj,"i often internalize my problems. unless i am very close to you, i will not tell you about it. i also don't want to get too much into details and it's often hard for me to express my problems because i'm afraid that i'll end up sounding confusing or add a burden to someone else's life. it feels good to speak out though. however, i often find people misunderstand me."
568,isfj,"How old is she? I feel this is important context. 
For me, when I was much younger, I did often internalize my feelings as I was processing complicated/tough/heavy times. Ultimately, this was not great, but it wasn’t devastating or dangerous, either; I was only able to learn the importance of sharing my honest inner thoughts and feelings when I had the right language to use, and framework to apply. 
If you are truly very close friends, her inability to share her process or feelings may be due more to immaturity and lack of experience than anything else. She will just need time and experience to figure out how to get through the ups and downs of life in the most healthy way for her. It sucks, but she should be able to figure it out eventually.
If you are not very, very close, her lack of sharing may be due to feelings of discomfort. Maybe she doesn’t feel that you are close enough to hear about her process or point of view on what she is going through. To this day, I let very few people in on that level. A great deal of my feelings of value come from the perception or demonstration to others that I am stable, capable, strong, and “doing just fine, thank you very much - how are you?!”
You mentioned that you internalize your feelings. Maybe lead by example, and share what is troubling you or bringing you incredible joy in your life. It can be so meaningful to feel like I am a safe place, or making a difference in the life of a friend. Give her genuine, organic feedback with specific examples of the value she adds to your life. 
Ultimately, ask her! What can you do to provide her with support through the good and the bad? It might be slightly uncomfortable to broach the subject so directly, but good friends and good people lean into those moments of discomfort, and trust the answers they get in return. If you are good enough friends, she should be able to tell you honestly what she needs. If she is not able to be direct with you, and expects you to be able to “figure it out” without her input - that, in and of itself is a sign that there is some growing up that needs to happen on her part. You should not be expected to read minds, and no one should be bothered by being asked what kind of support would resonate with them best. 
Good luck, kind soul! "
569,isfj,"I need you to be there for me, how i need you to be there. Meaning... be yourself, be willing to hang with me, talk with me, be normal with me. Ask me how I am, and if I say ""good"" then leave it at that. If I say ""okay"" it's alright to say ""just ok?"" But anything like over the top trying to pry into my feelings feels like this. 
I don't like to be touched physically when upset, it makes me hot and itchy but I don't know if that's from being an ISFJ. 
My favorite type of friend lately, when my dad was in the ICU and I was stressed out and exhausted but home felt weird without my dad, he picked me up and let me take a nap with his cat while he just chilled in his house. We didn't have to talk about anything but he was 100% there for me because what I don't need is to talk about things I'm already thinking about 8000x in my head and think about it again and try to think about it in a way I can explain to someone else. I needed a place where I could feel comfortable and get some rest. 
I guess focus on practical things you can help with, not emotional support. ""Wow that sucks"" is always more helpful to me than ""well maybe you should try _____"". Like GEE THANKS I never though of that and then I get bitter and such lol."
570,isfj,"the short answer is yes i (as an isfj) would appreciate a lot of space. i prefer to tackle my problems by myself, because i’m terrified of expressing my deepest emotions and thoughts to other people. 
what i mean by space is not prying into my problems. stay social with me and find me to go out! that way i feel even with all my problems inside i’m still a good friend to somebody. 
as for how anyone else could help, actually i secretly want to talk about my shit at times (it’s been four years since my dad passed away and while my friends know about it , i’ve never talked about it for real before). i would appreciate the natural constructing of the “right” atmosphere to talk about stuff like this. i guess it would require the other party to reveal something first. then i’d feel adequately comfortable with talking about my problems. "
571,isfj,"I think we tend to bottle it up or isolate ourselves. The fact that she's letting pieces of it slip means it's probably really bad.
Directly addressing it or just taking care of her could help, depending on how close you are. I'm sorry to hear about your friend :("
572,isfj,"Wow thank you so much for taking the time to write that :) 
The age thing is a good point, I just edited my post to mention she's 19, we're the same age. She has mentioned that she often doesn't have the right words to explain her feelings or the situation in general. Which I relate to, we both express ourselves best through art/music so I've encouraged her to continue to do that. 
I'm going to continue to lead by example as you mentioned. It's really hard because I'm also not comfortable with being so vulnerable and open about my struggles as I don't want her to feel like if she opens up to me that she'll be adding to my load. 
I've told her a lot of things no one else knows because I want to build her trust and to show that she doesn't need to keep pushing that image of her being strong because I already know she is. Telling her how she positively impacts me is also a great suggestion. 
Thanks again for the insight and advice! "
573,isfj,"HAHA that clip is hilarious, I gotta be honest, I can be like that sometimes. 
Mm yeah I totally understand the whole thing about just not talking about it because you yourself have processed it a billion times, adding another person to that internal conversation adds to the confusion. 
Also the focus on practical things is great advice. 
Thanks for your reply :) "
574,isfj,"thanks for the insight, I can see the general trend is your type prefers to figure it out themselves. I find it interesting that you being a good friend to someone helps you feel more at peace with your problems (correct me if I'm wrong). I usually only text her once a week just to stay connected and talk about more interesting things, we catch up IRL once a month or so. 
​
She's brought it up a few times, I just sorta sit and listen, I never ask her directly because I feel uncomfortable asking, so good to know its best to leave it up to her. "
575,isfj,"From close friends, I don't really expect anything. Not because they're not good friends, because they are. But from my experience I'm the one taking care of myself and repairing myself if I'm feeling down. It's good to have close friends there, but I dont expect them to fix anything. 
What I think about when I say a good mix of both is that it's good to have friends to be with during a tough period; they are helping by being that familiar element. (Because I like familiarity) but I do most of the 'healing' myself.. that could mean thinking nice thoughts, doing activities that I enjoy... and keep doing familiar things and slowly I will heal. "
576,isfj,"Heya! First off I just wanted to say that I find you ISFJs really endearing and pretty cute. I was a sad, lonely and boring person (typical lol) until I met an ISFJ and my world has been a lot brighter ever since. There’s this one ISFJ girl who has helped me through some real rough times and really opened up to me that I’ve inevitably started catching feelings for. I’m just willing to make her as happy as she’s made me. :))
1) Needing ideas for a present. Nothing too fancy but I am a bit of a hopeless romantic (unsurprisingly) so anything that might make your hearts race really. We’re already pretty close if that helps.
2) Are there any traits in an INFP that impress you lot and that I should show more often? Any areas I could potentially improve on? Dos and don’ts?
3) In the chance that I’m seen as nothing more than a friend, will it be ever be possible to change that view? I know it’s case by case but do ISFJs tend to keep an open mind and be willing to give another shot or would moving on be better?
Just asking for uh, a friend.. Seriously though, whatever happens, good or bad, I still really appreciate you lot very much!! <3"
577,isfj,"Being INFP is pretty rare, man. As an ISFJ Male, I can say that don't get too caught up in your daydreaming! Other than that, you should be just fine. Because I personally enjoy INFPs as people anyway. In fact, my father is an ENFP. He can be a handful for sure. "
578,isfj,"Isfj woman here. I adore INFPs, including their day dreaming. (Then again, 80% of my close friends are intuitive types.) Please take everything I say as a  personal opinion rather than an educated analysis of isfjs. 


Something personal and thoughtful! Something she's mentioned before or possibly that you worked hard to make/ get. One of my favorite gifts ever was from an infp english major who wrote me a poem about myself. (1) An ST once noticed my phone was always running out of energy and got me a battery pack, and it was a great feeling to know they were thinking about me :) 


What I love most about infps is how open they are in discussing each other's ideas, pasts, and personalities. I guess the only advice I can give is to be authentic, but in touchy topics aware of how your words might affect her feelings. 


I don't know about other isfjs. I know I've personally warmed up to people and also given people chances. However, I know for sure when something isn't going to work out, and it would take a lot to sway me after that. 


Edit: (1) Not recommended if too forward or you aren't comfortable with writing poetry. "
579,isfj,"Ooh so much I could say about this! Can’t speak for all of us but for me if he’s comfortable around you and pretty open about himself then I’d say you’re on the right path :). Also if he’s really making an effort to talk/hang out with you then thats a good indicator.
But one thing though is that it may take a while to develop those romantic feelings so my biggest piece of advice is not to rush. I really like to get to know the person first cause I tend to take love seriously.
When you get around to telling him how you feel, make sure to give him space to think about it and let him know that you want to make a relationship work.
Tip: Casually compliment him every now and then, youd probs make his heart race a little ;)"
580,isfj,"Comfortable as in he can be himself around you~ If he shows you a hint of weirdness then thats an indicator.
Does he ask a lot about you as well? Cause that’s one thing I always notice when I like someone, I usually ask her a lot of questions even if I’ve known her for a while and that can range from really deep things to really mundane stuff.
If he likes showing you his artwork it’s a good sign! :)
He could also be on the same boat thinking that maybe you’ve friendzoned him too so he doesn’t try anything. XD Honestly though, as long as he feels welcomed to you and the friendship is geniune then I don’t see why he wouldn’t give you a chance.
If he was anything like me, he would have probably already thought of some romantic situations regarding you already, get happy over it then sad cause he’ll think it’ll never happen.
Hmm the way I flirt with someone is I try to make her laugh :P sometimes even to the point where people would find it pretty cheesy haha"
581,isfj,"INFJ here! For the longest time I was mistyped as an ISFJ so because of this I am constantly questioning myself between the two. When I read the INFJ description it made a lot more sense than ISFJ did. I'm not a traditionalist in any sense of the word (I questioned this a lot when I thought I was ISFJ), I question why a lot, I'm a perfectionist, I make up random scenarios in my head that will probably never happen, looking at a situation I can guess the outcome quite accurately, I'm a huge future thinker....
But there's always that sliver of doubt...
I would go to the INFJ sub about this but they seem to think everyone is mistyped (it's a really annoying thing over there). 
What differences have you noticed between the two? "
582,isfj,"If you're in doubt, keep reading about function stacks and see what does apply to you. It might take a while until you can objectively assess what's your dominant function, but you don't need to decide on a type today, do you? Relax and take your time.
Descriptions are very misleading, and people tend to be biased towards the cooler ones. At first I didn't recognize myself in the ISFJ description - it all sounded too ""normal"" and vanilla. And there's a lot of overlap in the description, due to both having Fe-Ti. Don't get worked up on things like ""but I'm a huge future thinker, right?"" - these don't necesarily prove a type. For example, I also make up these random scenarios in my head that will probably never happen. And any ISFJ could look at a situation and guess the outcome, if they draw from their rich experience. And ""tradition"" is often a meaningless word without proper context.
Normally I would say you're not an ISFJ, but a paragraph alone isn't enough for an objective assessment. Nobody knows the real you, the best thing is to have a look yourself at the Si-Ni differences (and not just the simplified stereotypes - ""oh yeah, Si have good memories, Ni are incredibly future oriented"").
You could also read some accounts written by Si dominants, like this one: https://intj-confessions.tumblr.com/post/130602418373/intj-vs-istj . This helped me see why I was not an INFJ after all. 
Please don't take it personally - I'm not trying to convince you that you are ISFJ. However, if you are in doubt, there is a chance to be mistyped and only you can find out and decide what type you are. "
583,isfj,"I don't think you're an ISFJ. INFJs are mistyped a lot, but that alone shouldn't cause you to question it as the must be some people that are actually INFJ.
The things you say sound stereotypically INFJ. Introverted intuition is the big one, and that's future orientated, it usually requires a focus, and works mainly on inventive things. Often that means that you will get all sorts of very good ideas for new problems, but hit something of a wall when required to creatively problem solve situations you've faced before.
The following text is something that I included in a PM explaining some things I'd observed about Si-Dom. This alone may convince you that you're not one, but if you have any further questions, I'm sure we can help.
Process monitoring; as a type three enneagram I'm very task orientated, and with almost anything I'm very focused in the current step of things, and this even goes with quite diffuse things like dating. E.g., weighing the interactions, seeing how to progress to the next level of intimacy etc.
Sensitivity to feedback; I find handling feedback incredibly stressful. Even just having messages on Reddit can be something of an ordeal for me as I expect negative feedback... sometimes deservedly so.
Sensory memory; I can recall sensations like the feel of sand between my toes on the beach easily, and extremely old conversations, or the memory of writing particular things on a piece of paper. I've remembered layouts of documents that were five plus years old that I haven't thought about once in the interim as I could recall the sensations of writing it.
Sensory immersion; I can enter a sensory flow state when immersed in nature. I can watch ripples in a river, just standing there, and I will completely detach and suddenly be aware that substantial time has past. Also there is the speed of sensory details, I have to walk extremely slowly to take in details of leaves and things like that, but when I do I become very peaceful, and start restoring energy.
Specialist skills; there are certain areas that I can speak about like an expert, and when I immerse myself in the topic I gain an aptitude that isn't generally available to me. Like if I'm writing, I can read Shakespeare for a while and adopt his writing style and produce something far beyond my usual abilities.
Memorising tricks; I can and do use the tricks stated in Neuroscience of Personality to memorise lists of things, using the progressive rote technique it talks about."
584,isfj,"This! I'm not at all a traditionalist/conservative, not very sentimental, have a terrible memory, try to use logic as much as possible, tend to have issues with authority, etc etc, so on the surface I probably don't seem much like an ISFJ. But after reading about the ISFJ's function stack, I realized that it fits me way better than INFJ's functions, from the searching for familiarity in new situations to the desire for interpersonal harmony all the way down to the constant wondering and ""what if""ing of inferior Ne. Looking at the function stacks, especially your dominant and inferior functions, is definitely the best way to figure out your type. "
585,isfj,"The Heavy are getting some decent playtime as well as my regular binges of 90's one hit wonders.  I tend to have a very catholic taste in music (catholic with a small ""c"", as in a broad spectrum of styles)."
586,isfj,"Basically, I'm an INTJ and I'm trying to get a promotion so I figured it would be a good idea to appeal to my boss (some workplace politics bullshit or whatever), so I would appreciate it if you all could give me advice and stories about how your coworkers/employees have impressed you. I've been told by my boss that I need to be less abrupt and more into the whole ""small-talk"" thing most people seem to be into, but I would appreciate any other advice you all have about working with and appealing to ISFJ's."
587,isfj,"I have a couple of good friends who are INTJ's. I've noticed they struggle with the small talk and forming friendships in general. Personal relationships are very important to ISFJ's. I appreciate people who make an effort to get to know someone, especially if it is completely out of their comfort zone. 
But I also think work ethic is so critical. ISFJ's tend to have high expectations of the people around them. We are known to be hard workers expect others to do the same. If you do your job well and with a positive attitude, then I think you will do fine. "
588,isfj,"try hard. put forth effort and if we notice that you're struggling and a little stressed out even, it means you're working really hard. remember that isfj read emotions, that's how we'll know how much you're trying. make sure that whatever you accomplish while displaying emotional effort isn't too little or we'll think you're a hard working idiot. keep your work output consistent or increase it.
be supportive of other employees. if we see that you will take time to help other people (give work advice or something), it means you care about them doing well and possibly care about the company doing well. that can appeal to us too.
summarize: 1) show emotion of effort 2) show you care about people and job."
589,isfj,"I've never been a boss per say, but I've worked on a higher seniority level. I dislike conflict very much, and often feel kind of guilty telling new workers they did something wrong or how could do something better. I'm genuinely impressed and relieved when people react understandingly, don't take it personally, and trust my work experience"
590,isfj,"This is a BIG one for me - sincerity is very important to me and fake charm is a huge turn-off. By contrast, I won't think less of you at all if you seem awkward in your first attempts at making more small talk. What I'll see is you listening to the criticism you were given and making an effort to work on that even though it's outside your comfort zone. "
591,isfj,"Often.
Crying is basically my default reaction to any emotional situation, which is frustrating.
Sad? I cry. Stressed? I cry. Frustrated, sleep deprived, angry, happy, overwhelmed, laughing too hard? I cry.
It's not something I'm really able to control, but usually I can at least keep it under wraps until I'm not in public. "
592,isfj,"I can cry very easily. I would say once a month something can make me cry. I also use it as a release/soothing mechanism, I don't see crying as a bad thing. Things that can make me cry: movies, music, injustices, stress, being hungry and sleepy at the same time, having to confront someone (for example my bosses at work, I try not to cry if I have a conflict but my voice trembles..,), being sick and uncomfortable/with pain... Good thing is I also cry easily when I feel very happy, which is the best sensation. "
593,isfj,"I don't cry often at all. I cried at my grandmothers passing a few months ago, but that was just at the shock of it and because the rest of my family was crying. Before that, I probably went about four or five years without crying. "
594,isfj,"A lot. Like just today at least 3 times and it's only lunch time. Anything can trigger it...a thought, a picture, a sad news caption. I cry for every emotion and it's super annoying because Im at my desk at work. Lol. 
I'm sure right now my 9-10 year old daughters think I'm some kind of weak sauce because they've seen me cry way too much. My husband doesn't understand either. 
I recently found out I was an ISFJ and I'm now trying to figure myself out...only took me 34 years to try."
595,isfj,I believe I relate most in this manner. I don't usually cry often or in front of others. Usually its because I feel direly misunderstood or something similar. Recently I've found myself crying more often but I think its situational and a direct consequence of difficult life situations i'm currently faced with. 
596,isfj,"Im not sure of my type . I think I'm either an infj/infp/isfj. I really relate to the si function. I'm not sure what si really is other than that I've heard it's about taking in a sensory feeling based on how it affects you and I feel like I'm really like this .  I really take in physical feelings and am kind of scared to experience new ones . I also sometimes have a hard time describing how sensory things make me feel.
I'm also quite hypersensitive and hypochondriacish .  Can any of you help me out in figuring out more?"
597,isfj,"Si, to the best of my personal understanding, is basically just taking past experiences and knowledge and using that to inform your understanding of situations and create projections for the future. For example, that's where the idea of Si-doms preferring routine comes from; in theory, it's less stressful for us to be in situations that we have a thorough understanding of, so routine is comforting. New situations, on the other hand, are more likely to stress us out, especially if we're in them alone. That's because we don't have a model yet for what the appropriate course of action is, and if we're by ourselves, we don't even have anyone's lead to follow. While it's not always true, in general I think that tends to be uncomfortable for us, as it makes it very difficult for us to use our dominant function. 
Si is also good for comparing data; we can be very good at figuring out what's not working in a system, what the best solution to a similar problem in the past has been and thus what might work in the present, noticing changes in how our environments and bodies feel, etc. For me, it ended up making me very good in school, because it was easy for me to make connections between various topics and subjects based on what I already knew, which helped me both integrate what I was learning as well as pull from my pool of prior data to produce new ideas about a topic from different perspectives. 
There are stereotypes that it means having a great memory/always remembering important details, or always sticking to tradition/following rules, but that's not really true. In some cases it may be, but I'm an ISFJ and I don't have any of those qualities lol. So don't let that kind of description throw you off. 
In general, I think the easiest way to think of it is that Si users take concrete personal experience or learning, and then use that as data to help filter and contextualize new information as it comes in. It comes with upsides and downsides like any other function, but that's the best description I can personally give you. "
598,isfj,"Si is very difficult to describe, since it is an irrational function (just as Ni). If you're a Si dom, you're probably using it so much that you don't even notice it. Sometimes people might even confuse it with Ni based on some descriptions they read. ""Yeah, sometimes I just know things, it must be my intuition"". Those unconscious strong feelings you might have towards some things might as well be rooted in your experience and not your intuition.
Si is stereotypically associated with having a good memory. While this is just a stereotype, if you notice you often remember an event in greater detail than a non-Si dom friend, this might be a hint you use Si. I do this a lot with my friends - they tend to remember just a general outline, while I can remember a lot of vivid, sensorial details. This memory thing is even more noticeable if you're stuck in a Si-Ti loop, like I am (lots of recollecting of painful memories and overthinking things and finding excuses). However, if you don't care enough about certain things, you will forget them, just like everyone else.
When you're explaining stuff, do you often find it easier to resort to examples, personal experiences or anecdotes? If yes, that's another hint you might be using Si.
A general preference for comfortable familiarity, like /u/lemontongues described it, is another hint in this direction.
Emphasis here is on ""hints"" - these don't necessarily prove or disprove you're a Si dom. We're different, after all, and self-perception is often biased. Keep reading on this topic and analyze your daily life. If you really use it, in time you will start to feel Si's presence everywhere.
And of course, this solves just the ISFJ vs INFJ question. INFPs also use Si, but it's easier to determine whether you have Fe or Fi."
599,isfj,"I think I do use si from what all of you explained but I believe that it might not be my dominant function. I'm good with memory and recall even during exams but I kind of also suck at it where I'm like ""okay but wait that happend?"" Like I forget certain life experiences and then am like OMG when will I learn lol but I always tell my self that I should remember such things for the future . 
In a way I noticed using si is kind of painful to me but I also like using it . "
600,isfj,"It might be tricky, yes, but I find it easier to solve than the Si vs Ni dilemma.
At some point I was reading some INFP descriptions and I was like ""hey, that totally sounds like me"". I'm very awkward socially and I hate small talk. I'm a soft-hearted cynic and never felt integrated in society. I can be a real jerk sometimes.
On the other hand, I'm almost always considering the feelings and opinions of the others. I'm always mortified at the thought of being ridiculed in public. I'm constantly avoiding conflicts. Even if I don't consider myself a nurturer either, it makes me happy when I can feel helpful for someone. If I feel hurt by someone, the fact that it hurts me makes it even more painful and I struggle a lot to hide it from the others. I might rationally conclude that it's an insignificant thing and shouldn't be bothered by it, but I'm upset anyway - the emotion is always stronger. "
601,isfj,"Help me /r/ISFJ, you're . . . a resource I haven't ~~exploited~~ mined for ideas yet.   Basically, I got a problem, and I'm hoping you wonderful people can help.
Here's the deal, my wife is an ISFJ (as you may have gathered by now).  I on the other hand, am an INTP.  You know, the emotionally barren, lost in their own thoughts all the time, so not noticing all the little amazing, incredible things their loving, nurturing spouse does for them constantly.
Now, to be fair, I've learned a lot over the years so I'm not (generally) as bad as the end of that previous paragraph might make me sound.  
That said, I want to be better. 
I want tricks and tips.  I want cheat codes.  I want ideas that will take her by surprise and make her feel appreciated more deeply than just words, or hugs, or flowers can.
This type of thing goes against my natural tendencies, but, knowing that she's so wonderfully different (coughbettercough) than I am, makes this particular little puzzle very, very interesting to me.
As you may guess, if you're prone to thinking along such lines, her ""love language"" is ""acts of service.""  I kind of understand this, at least in a theoretical aspect, but as a poster child INTP, I'm borderline irrationally independent, so it's a hard lens for me to view the world through for very long.  What she can view as sweet and helpful, I can see as kind of insulting and intrusive.  Sooooo, there's that.  It's a pretty stark contrast.
What that actually means is that I'm positive that I miss all kinds of little opportunities to help her out with things that she would appreciate, because they just don't occur to me.  If she's doing something, I just sort of assume that she's got it handled and that if she needs/wants help, she'll all for it.  Somehow,I feel like that's not the right perspective to have on this instance though.  So, what kind of signals do I look for to know when to jump in for the assist?
Beyond just trying to ""be helpful"" to her rather than being helped by her . . . what can I do?  Just expand on that same theme?  Declare a ""mom's weekend"" where I do all the cooking, cleaning, shopping, childcare,  petcare, etc.?  I'm up for that, but she's horrible at being bored.  And, since she's such a champ at taking care of other people all the time, she doesn't really have (or even really want?) any real hobbies or fun, time-wasting activities that she enjoys.  As impossible as it sounds (to my kind), helping other people out actually recharges her batteries.  WTH?!  How is that even fair to the rest of us?
I just feel like no little gesture I can make can ever be significant enough to show the gratitude she deserves for being the wife and mother that she is.  But I also find that conclusion unacceptable.
So, if it were you, and someone who loves you (but sometimes is pretty retarded about displaying it) wanted to just absolutely melt you . . . what could that lovable little retard do to sweep you off your feet?
Any ideas or suggestions you folks might have will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks!"
602,isfj,"Well, my mother and I are both ISFJs, so I can tell you about how things are from our perspectives at least. 
Basically how I interact with my mom to express my gratitude and affection is to go out of my way to help with tasks I know she doesn't enjoy (or offer to do them entirely), or go out of my way to thank her and show my appreciation for the effort she puts in. For example, she cooks for the family every night, but she doesn't always enjoy it, so if I'm up to it, I'll offer her help by chopping up ingredients or stirring pots or washing dishes to make the task go faster and easier. If I'm not paying attention while she's cooking or don't want to help, I'll make sure I thank her for the meal, make sure to show I'm excited for it if it's something I really like, and once in a while as I'm rinsing my dishes I might go out of my way to say something like, ""Thank you for always cooking such great meals for us, you're the best."" Similar strategies can be applied to other day to day tasks, and me and my dad always make sure to encourage her not to cook just because she feels obligated on days when she really doesn't feel like it. Basically just showing appreciation for what she does for us and doing little things to make her life easier where we can (my dad often does the vacuuming for her, or cooks a snack supply of hardboiled eggs for the week so she doesn't have to). 
Personally, I'm pretty much the same, but I also like compliments a lot. If someone goes out of their way to do something small for me like bring me tea or get my laundry out of the dryer for me, it makes me extremely happy. Personally, the bigger the task/amount of effort that goes into it, the happier it makes me. Bringing me tea is a really lovely gesture, but going out of your way to run to the store to get something I want/need or taking care of a chore while I'm working on a project will make me feel extremely cared for and warm and fuzzy. Obviously those are larger, more occasional gifts, and I certainly never ever expect them, but for me, someone really going out of their way to show that they care about my needs and want to make my life more pleasant even if it's not super convenient for them is like, a huge deal. 
Compliments are also great, though! My self esteem usually isn't that great, so somebody showing appreciation for something I've created or a quality I have makes me really happy. Telling me I'm smart or cute or have done a good job on something or you're impressed with something about me is a great way to give my mood a little boost and make me feel like you're really paying attention and care about me. 
I have to say though, any gesture is really appreciated. I think it might be a high Fe thing, but I generally feel very protective of people's attempts to be kind or helpful, and I always appreciate the sentiment, even if the thing itself isn't ideal. Anyway sorry this got so long, I hope it's useful to you! And it's really great that you appreciate your wife so much and want to show it, I'm happy for both of you! :) "
603,isfj,"do things before she asks you to eg do the housework before she asks you to. honestly, i love when i come home and my partner has done all the housework WITHOUT me having to ask. just little things to make her life easier and show you're thinking about her. see something in the shop she likes? her favourite chocolate? favourite candle. just pick it up and gift it to her. little things are important too."
604,isfj,"
Hmm how about instead of fully taking over the chores she enjoys doing.. why not split it? Do 'em together.
Even if she seems/gets embarrassed just any random little positive affectionate comments about/to her will make her happy
As far as ""time-wasting"" hobbies go.. have you tried getting her to try getting her into the ones you like doing? I personally love doing a hobby if I can get engaged somehow with someone (even if it's just a simple as talking about how much we like a show).
"
605,isfj,"I am ISFJ, and my boyfriend is INTP, as well, so I can relate a lot with your struggle. Some things that work for us:
When I talk about my feelings, he listens, and if I'm stressed or upset, when he asks me how he can help, that helps me feel loved and safe and cared for.
When he remembers the little things I've talked about wanting to do or buy, like a specific concert or a food that I enjoy, and makes it happen.
I always notice when he does chores, and it helps me feel supported.
When he verbally praises me, thanks me, or acknowledges my hard work.
We have specifically set time to be together. I know he needs his alone time (and I need alone time, too), so we plan together time and we plan alone time. On that note, we'll often be in separate rooms working on our own things. But I absolutely love it when he comes in to give me a quick kiss or a hug. Or if we're in different places, little love texts are great.
When he cooks dinner so I can work on an important task.
When he remembers something I've talked about experimenting with in the bedroom.
One of the biggest things is that I have to make sure that I know my own needs and communicate them with him. So, it's helpful for him to say to me that he is here for me and that he wants to hear what he can do for me. That way, I feel comfortable stating my needs to him. When he follows through, I feel supported and loved.
When he opens up with me and shares personal things, I know it's hard for him because he doesn't always know how to explain. But hearing his personal stories, struggles, and feelings, makes me feel really special. I know he doesn't disclose these sorts of things to pretty much anyone, so I love hearing about it. That may sound counterintuitive because you're trying to help her feel loved and appreciated rather than putting a burden on her, and maybe she is not the same as me, but being confided in makes me feel appreciated.
I hope some of that can help. (:"
606,isfj,"INTJ female here with an ISFJ SO. I feel your pain. You aren't alone, lol. I'd pair her ""mom's day"" with a gift card to a spa or manicure, that way she's out of the house and not bored while you clean. That could also help you in the sense of maybe you just do a few chores and cook dinner that night instead of having to take over EVERYTHING for a whole weekend.
My SOs love language is Acts of Service, too, but he's also very Spending Time, which we have in common. I wonder if they'd have that in common as well since they're both ISFJ?"
607,isfj,"Taking care of shit without being asked and not making it a big deal. Doing small things that show you remembered a small detail she shared with you (paying attention and really tuning in). Surprising her with random gestures that serve no other purpose then to make her happy; nothing flashy, $$, but reminiscent of the old days maybe? Anything sacrificial and out of your own comfort zone really. It can be something you do or refrain from doing too. Something for her family or other people she loves. I can't imagine one grand gesture that would blow my socks off but small things here and there and the effort in making it a regular routine or part of your life together would mean a lot."
608,isfj,"For example, you partied hard last night and slept through 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM today. Now it is 1:00 AM, your supposed bedtime, but you don't feel sleepy because you slept through the day. What do you do?"
609,isfj,"I just try to get back to a regular schedule as soon as possible, because things like that can throw me off for weeks, especially if it's a sleep thing (but I have sleep problems, so that's just personal). 
Anyway, I usually just try to work myself back to my regular schedule, like going to bed a half hour earlier each night if it's a big interruption or just at my usual time if it was a one-off thing that didn't affect me too badly. And I'll try to keep up more with other forms of self-care like eating well and exercising to keep myself from feeling like total crap the whole time. "
610,isfj,"After reading Jung's interpretation of Si im rather confused as it is different from what Ive been reading about it so I decided to make this thread.
Additional questions:
Do Si-doms like daydreaming and how often? If so what would they normally daydream about ( would the daydreams include alternate realities based on real life events with out going over board or could the daydreams include totally fantastical worlds filled with magic and made up creatures etc )?
Do Si-doms take things in face value( I saw someone from a tumblr blog say this and I know i shouldnt take it seriously but i just wanted to make sure )?
Does strength of imagination correlate with someone's type and if so, how?
If the previous question is true then what would be the strength of imagination for an Si-dom and how much would they rely on it?
Are Si-doms conformists ?
How does inferior Ne play a role in the Si-doms life?
Do you normally overthink ,how  and why?"
611,isfj,"These are all just personal answers, I'm not saying this is how all of us are, but for me: 


Somewhat? I tend to catch myself daydreaming possible conversations with people, or if I'm feeling very anxious I can end up caught in a ""what if this terrible thing happens, what would I do"" line of thinking. I used to spend a lot of time thinking about books/shows/etc that I consumed and basically writing fanfic in my head lol but it happens a lot less often these days, maybe just because real life is more pressing. 


I'm not really sure what you mean by this one?? I can find the symbolic meaning in things fairly easily if that's what you're referring to, but I also tend to assume that people are telling me the truth unless I already have a reason to think otherwise?


I doubt it. Different function stacks might make people more inclined to use their imagination in different ways, but imagination is pretty difficult to measure, and I'm pretty sure we all use it constantly anyway. 


For me, Si means I tend to use my imagination to project into the future based on what I've learned and experienced in the past. I might not be as prone to using my imagination for wild flights of fancy as some people, but I use it a lot for visualization and problem solving. I do also like to get into ""what if""s when it comes to media, though. I've spent a ton of time in fandom throughout my life and one of my favorite things is just going ""what would happen if you put these two characters in a room? How would this group react in this situation?"" which is probably a somewhat more traditional application of imagination. But I spend a pretty small percentage of my time just imagining random fantasy worlds or whatever (although that can be a lot of fun, too). I also tend to do more of that type of imaginative work when I have someone else to talk to; it feels more rewarding to have a back and forth exchange of ideas with someone than to just sit and ruminate on my own. 


No. 


Mostly I use it for either stress or fun. It gets my anxiety whirring like nobody's business (""what if Dad gets hit by a car while he's riding his bike? What if that tapping noise is something outside the window? What if this dizzy feeling means I'm dying?"" etc etc etc), but it also comes into play a lot when I'm having fun, like the fandom ""what if""s I mentioned before. 


Yuuuuup. I think the overthinking tends to come more from my Fe, though? Worrying that I might be annoying someone, how it's going to come off if I say a certain thing, if I've hurt someone's feelings by forgetting to answer their text, if someone will be disappointed in me for not accomplishing a task, that kind of thing. I certainly can and do overthink other areas of my life, but I think that's the type I'm most prone to. As for the why, I've had a number of bad friendship experiences and it's made me very anxious about friendship/close relationships in general, so I put a lot more energy into worrying about it than I should.  

"
612,isfj,"Yeah, in regards to number 6, that's definitely a Ti/Ne misfire. Si-doms don't usually get stuck in the ""what if I'm going crazy? what if I'm dying? what if I have cancer?"" portions of anxiety. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder but I rarely have panic attacks because I'm aware that I have GAD, so if my heart starts racing, my brain goes ""Oh, that's just anxiety. Or gas."" I think it's more common for Si-doms to get in health problems because they link a physical sensation that would worry most intuits with something benign they've felt before and don't seek treatment. For example, when I was 22 I pulled a muscle in my chest/back trying to use my inhaler when I had a cold. I shrugged it off and didn't worry about it until a month later when it wasn't going away. I went to urgent care and they did X-rays and found that in fact my left lung had spontaneously collapsed 20% and they sent me to the ER.
For number 7, overthinking in that way is definitely an Si-Ti loop, you should look into Si-Ti loops a little bit more if you're curious about Ti interacts. Unfortunately, the resolution for that sort of loop involves engaging with Fe, so.. talking with your friendships/close relationships about your anxiety and bad experiences, and finding ones you can trust in the present and future, is the way we get over that loop most effectively.
E: thinking about it more, I think I was too general regarding number 6 - Si-doms definitely can have that catastrophic health worry if it's a NEW sensation that they've never experienced before. Several years ago I had an episode of BPPV that freaked me out, I wondered if I was damaged for life, and went immediately to the doctor who said to chill out and that it would probably pass on its own in a few weeks."
613,isfj,"Im an ISFJ with social anxiety. Yesterday, I [28/F] felt a whirlwind of emotions after I found out I wasnt invited to a friends baby shower. I'm not super close to this friend, but I've always been invited to her first kids birthdays and her wedding previously. I occasionally comment on her posts and IG stories but I wasnt invited to this event. Apparently everyone else in our group was invited. Maybe she knew I couldn't make it. I work weekends and it's very hard for me to take those days off. 
After I found that out, my night was horrible. I continued to over think all night long, like what is wrong with me? Maybe I'm not lovable? 
I have another example. In a different group of friends, my boyfriend and I were not invited to he wedding. We hang out in the same group, she even invited me to her bachelorette and bridal shower but I couldn't go because I just opened up a business and I told her that... Because of that, we weren't invited to her wedding. Everyone else in our group was invited. 
I honestly dont know if it's me? I'm pretty friendly, but timid at times. I just feel like this happens to me alot and it makes me feel as if I'm not good enough or maybe not social enough. I'm confused because I have 1 good female friend who invites me to everything and introduced me to all of her groups of friends. Shes very extroverted and has many friends....so I cant be that bad right?
I have many friends but that's the thing. I have many friends, but not many whom I have deep connections with. 
It truly makes me feel lonely and empty inside and to counter this feeling, I reach out to friends and start asking them to get dinner to catch up, just to make myself feel better. I feel like my boyfriend is my true best friend and the only person I can me 110% ME with. I dont hold anything back from him. 
Does anyone else feel this way?"
614,isfj,"Im gonna share with you my experience hoping it could help you in a way.
I have been dealing with alienation for the majority of my life, it had to do with some self esteem issues but it was also due to my extreme views on relationships.
A month ago i decided to go for counseling and talk about what ive been dealing with, through the help of my counselor i was able to reach this conclusion: just because two people you know are listed under the word ""friend"" does not mean you are equally intimate with them, also us ISFJ's tend to go the extra 1000 miles for people we call friends and we subconsciously expect them to do the same for us, which eventually leads us to be very disappointed once we find out that it's not true.
You must understand that its ok to not be close friends with someone, its ok to be friends with someone and not be invited to their events, because you are not in a very intimate friendship(and that does not in any way mean that they dont like you or that you are a bad friend).
We actually have a saying in my language that goes something like ""your fingers aren't all the same length"" which applies here in a way i guess 😅
And most importantly, you are not defined by who invites you to which event or who decides to say hi to you or what people think of you in general, we usually say that people's opinions of us don't matter, but there's another part that we forget about easily, OUR OPINIONS OF OURSELVES ARE STILL VAILD AND MATTER THE MOST.
Side note: you ever notice how a doctor always physically checks the areas where you feel pain or discomfort? But psychologists, psychiatrists and counselors usually ask you to talk in order to give you the correct diagnosis?
thats because its the only way to know whats going on in your head
I suggest you talk openly about what you are going through to someone you trust like your boyfriend, talking helps you vent and saying things out loud helps you think better, also helps others understand and contribute if possible.
Sorry if it's unorganized, i just wrote my thoughts, hope this helps 😁"
615,isfj,"I do feel that way but I generally don't think of it the same way.  
Because I worry about not finishing work, I am kind of grateful when I don't get invited to things because otherwise I have to find the strength to say I can't go when I honestly can't. I end up feeling like a fake friend that keeps flaking. 
You kind of reasoned it out with them knowing you can't make it, but I do agree that it's hurtful to think they've just stopped caring to include you. Maybe when talking you can bring up days that you're free and they (hopefully)  can keep that in mind for future gatherings. "
616,isfj,"Yes, I've always feel lonely since I was 7 years old. After the death of my mother and my stepdad leaving me, things never been the same. However, I'm grateful I'll still have my Aunt who raised me; including my cousins. But in the end of day, I'd still feel lonely. "
617,isfj,"No not really. And I thought this was common among ISFJs. But maybe I'm thinking about 9s (Enneagram)
If anything I would want to spend less time around people.. haha (I have a husband, 4 kids, and a group of friends who meet up once a week). "
618,isfj,"Thank you so much for your response. I constantly forget MY opinion of myself matters most. And you are right about not all friendships are equal. 
I'm going to keep an open mind and count it as a blessing i wasnt invited since I couldn't go anyways. 
My poor boyfriend always listens to me vent and gives the best support and feedback. 
Also, I'm working on not caring what people think of me!"
619,isfj,"Just wondering how other ISFJs feel about pets! So I know we tend to have a rep as caretakers, I think, and that sounds accurate to me because I tend to ""mom"" my friends sometimes... lol.
But what about animals? Like, for example, I don't have a partner and I'm too young to have kids, so when I moved out I kind of gravitated towards having pets. I have a cat (almost had a second, but she didn't get along with my first cat so i just fostered her for a while), as well as five aquariums. I also had a hamster, but I didn't like him very much so I gave him away to some friends (who then got a female hamster who bred with him and now they have a lot of babies xD). I got another hamster, but she was sick so she died. I was thinking of getting another, but I don't really have room in my small apartment for a cage at this time.
I also tend to be kind of strict about taking care of pets properly, which is why I rehomed my hamster (I didn't like him so I knew I couldn't give him a good home), and also why I don't believe dogs should be kept in apartments, or that Bettas and goldfish should be kept in small tanks. I have a huge personal responsibility thing going on. Lol. Which also means I spend way too much money on the pets I do have. 😳
What about you guys? And what are your favourite pets? Personally I'm not really a dog person because they are waaaay too high key for me, and have too much energy (medication makes me always tired), but cats and fish are perfect. I imagine a more active ISFJ would like to have a dog because you can do a lot with them."
620,isfj,"To say I'm obsessed with my cats would be an understatement. 
I love animals in general, but cats are something else entirely. I've always loved them and I've never not had at least one. Right now my husband and I have two, but I've been pushing for a third, and once we move into a bigger place I'm seriously considering fostering kittens.
I think they're the perfect pet for an introvert. They can be very sweet and affectionate, but they also keep to themselves a lot and aren't in your face all the time. Unless they're hungry. Hungry cats will straight up climb your face for attention."
621,isfj,"I've always had some kind of pet throughout my life. Fish, birds, turtles, frogs, hamsters, dogs, and cats. It all just depended on what my mom would permit me to have at the time. I love pets and find it strange to be without one. When I moved out I was petless for a few months(my cat needed to pass some requirements before entering the country). However lo and behold I found a stray kitten in the streets. I'm so grateful to have found the little brat and even happier that now she gets along with my cat. I wish I could have a dog too but believe it wouldn't be happy staying cooped up in an apartment. I'm waiting until I settle down and have kids if that ever happens. I enjoy keeping my pets happy and enjoy the comfort and company they provide. "
622,isfj,"My cat is my world. I say goodbye to him every morning and look forward to seeing him when I get home from work, he chills with me when I watch TV, and he judges me constantly. He's a complete asshole but I'd do anything for him."
623,isfj,"Cats are my absolute life, really can't live without one (well currently, 2). I had pet mice when I was younger and I loved making little mazes and houses and stuff for them and they spent most of their lives doing stuff with me as opposed to just being in the cage. I like dogs but many of them make me uneasy, especially untrained ones. I like spending time with my friends' dogs but could never own one myself. My piano teacher, for example, has the sweetest little sheltie and my mom and I always joke about stealing him, but he does bark a lot when I come to the door and I just can't find it in myself to tell the little guy to be quiet because that's his thing, you know? I'm also very low energy so I wouldn't be able to keep up with one as well. Unless of course I got a big old lazy dog, we'd be perfect together, but most dogs like that tend to smell and smell doesn't do well with my OCD. As for kids, I'm only 20 and everyone keeps telling me I'll change my mind, but I really can't picture my life with kids, let alone a long term partner (rOCD) so I'll probably just stick to cats and little critters. "
624,isfj,"I like dogs better than cats. I think it’d be nice to get a dog once I’m out of school and living on my own. It would be awesome to take care of a dog. I think if ISFJs wanted to have a cat or dog, they would really enjoy it. "
625,isfj,"I've always loved animals my entire life. When I was little (eight or nine), I was extremely fascinated with guinea pigs and rabbits. Eventually, my grandma got two bunnies. I did extensive research on taking care of them. I would make my parents drive an hour just to get 120 pound haybales for my bunnies. I also let them free roam both in my house and outside. They were litterbox trained and lived in my bathroom. I basically spent most of my time at home taking care or them and playing with them. I also convinced my parents to get me other pets such as turtles and fishes. My dad built me a pond in the backyard for my goldfishes. I also did a project where I transformed my tropical fish tank into an aquaponics (self-sustaining) system for a school project. Eventually I had to give away these pets because the fishes became too high maintenance (I returned them to Petco). Sadly, we had to give up our bunnies to the animal shelter because we got a dog (who I absolutely miss and adore today). He would get aggressive around them. So yup, I love all animals. Hopefully when I am done with college and move out, I can get a bunny and a bunny-friendly dog on my own."
626,isfj,"I second everything about this. I love coming home to my cat at the door, and he’s just like “Oh. It’s you.” and he walks away nonchalantly to the couch. Like bro, I saw you waiting for me through the window. "
627,isfj,"I literally agree with everything about this comment as well. My cat acts very sassy and feisty when she wants attention or food, but is so sweet when she finally gets that. I think it in her nature, being a tortie. Her tortitude, lol. "
628,isfj,"Hey, I do the same! :P I call ""bye, Leo"" as I leave and then when I'm coming up the stairs to my apartment in the afternoon, I can hear him meowing on the other side of the door. Currently I'm lying in bed and he's chilling at the other corner in a nest of blankets."
629,isfj,"Seeeee I'm not super attached to the idea of biological kids but I'd like to adopt a teenager some day??? I'm only 22 and I have many items on the list of things I gotta do before then.
I'm also not really seeing myself with a long term partner, so that might have something to do with my choice."
630,isfj,"I'm in the same exact boat there! I've never thought of having biological kids, but I've always loved the idea of adopting an older kid or something. I have a foster brother so that might have something to do with it too."
631,isfj,"Hi I was wondering how some people here deal with death.
For me my aunt passed away a couple days after Thanksgiving. After a long battle with cancer she died in her sleep. I was there to help my mother to close her eyes for the last time.
Since this is the first major death in my life, I'm not quite sure what if I'm going through is grief or not. The funeral is this weekend but I'm continuing life and going to work. The only difference is I have been feeling numb and more alone than usual. A couple of my friends have reached out to me but I don't want them to worry about me. Lately I've been more concerned if I should act normal or not so that nobody is concerned. I've been feeling like I want to talk to someone but I don't' want to bother anyone...
Every time I close my eyes I see her image in my head. I'm not quite sure what to do or if I need to do anything since I'm probably in a grieving period. What are others experiences? "
632,isfj,"I have dealt with death before and what you describe is very similar to my own experiences. I rarely talked about them in fear that bringing them up would make others feel awkward. I just ignored it. It never came up in conversations. I felt so alone with it because I did not want to burden others. 
The numbness will come and go. At some points you will might feel extremely intense emotions but these fade as well.
None of your reactions to this event are wrong. Any way you feel is okay, there is not a ""right"" way to grieve. You do not have to talk, but I found that in times of desperate need every year or so I would call my closest family member (my own aunt) and just cry. Even while you do not want to burden friends, it is sometimes almost easy to forget every one of your family members is potentially dealing with their own private struggle as well (if they are trying not to burden others). "
633,isfj,"My brother passed away just over two years ago. I felt exactly like you, numb, alone, and unmotivated. He passed away the Friday before the first week of my senior year in college. I just bottled all of my emotions up, didn't talk to anyone about it, and went about my business. The weeks after that were the worst of my life, I just felt awful.
In hindsight, I wish I would have opened up to someone and talked with them about how I really felt. I didn't want to bother anyone with my grief, just as you, but looking back I don't think anyone would have seen it as a bother. I'm sure you have people in your life who are more than willing to listen to you, and console you, but you need to let them do that. I strongly suggest not doing what I did. Don't bottle up your emotions, find someone to talk to. If you don't feel comfortable talking to someone in your life, please feel free to PM me. I'm more than happy to talk to you about it."
634,isfj,"My dad passed away earlier this year. At first it was hard, I would cry at least once a week because I missed him. I was very upset at first and I think I cried a few hours the day he passed. After the funeral I was still upset, but it didn't get worse like I thought it would. I think it was because school was still going on and I wanted to finish the semester on a good note like my dad would have wanted. When he first passed, I had no problem talking about him with family but I felt like I was making people feel awkward when I would make a comment about him. I felt like they were uncomfortable and afraid I would start crying, but I would do it anyways. 
It has gotten easier, I cry every once in a while because I miss him or because I am reminded of something I would never get to do with him. I also now I talk about him without feeling awkward. 
I strongly suggest finding someone to talk to about how you are feeling. I had some close friends that I told them everything that was going on and how I was doing. Even now they ask how my mom and I are doing almost every time I see them. "
635,isfj,"Thank you for sharing. I THINK I'm doing OK right now but I have a bad feeling after the funeral it won't be as easy. Sometimes I wish people would seek to help me out instead of me looking for it. I feel very selfish, but luckily I have some people like that in my life. "
636,isfj,"Now, I will sometimes casually mention my brother in conversation. He was murdered five years ago, so it has taken a long time. Just this past week while eating dinner with my boyfriend's parents I told a childhood story about him. The times I do talk about him are always positive stories, describing how happy he was and how happy he'd want me to be.
The times I am overwhelmed by my emotions, I will call my aunt and cry and just say how much I miss him. Or I will bawl and tell my boyfriend I wish it had been me instead of him. But those times are rare now.
So I did get past the awkwardness to some extent but I also continue to mostly avoid talking about him in fear of how others might feel (aka making them feel awkward). Which makes me sad because it is almost like I am erasing his existence which is the last thing I'd want to do.
I'd say in times of sadness if you can, remember a happy moment and share it with your family. It will be bittersweet--sad that your aunt is gone but happy to have such a sweet memory of her. It also creates an opportunity for other family members to talk. "
637,isfj,"Hi there,  
I'm an ENFP and I recently started talking to an ISFJ. She's amazing and really likes me, but is super hesitant to move forward and give more time to me because according to her, I don't know her too well. I'm so used to just divulging everything about myself to everyone I know, that I'm not used to learning other people / figuring other people out for myself. She'd really like it if I get to know her better, but I really don't know where to start.   
I feel like I'm caught in this catch-22 where I have to spend time with her to get to know her, but she'd rather give time to her friends because she trusts her friends more, so as a result I don't really know her too well, so I can't show that I'm trustworthy/reliable/naturally receptive to who she is, and the cycle continues.   
I'm also really poor at figuring people out / predicting their behavior, so I need like a people-101: How do you get to know someone from the ground up? I've literally resorted to brainstorming everything she's told me and writing it down on a sheet of paper because I literally don't know how to organize information in my brain. "
638,isfj,"Well, with the information you’ve said here, it looks like you may need to find a niche for yourself in her life- like a class/hobby she already does that you can join to anchor your schedule to hers without asking her to disrupt her life. 
With that said- that’s a super weird thing to say to a person you are interested in developing a relationship with. It kind of sounds like she might not be interested in cultivating a relationship right now. Like, that’s the kind of shitty af excuse I would be tempted to use to turn someone down. "
639,isfj,"it really takes time for us to warm up as an isfj. If i have a couple of trusted friends well that's enough for me and I dont need to ""go out"" and find another friend. Sometimes, we dont invest much in people ( i mean not all).
Getting to know an isfj really takes a lot of effort and time . Thats because we want to make sure that this person we just met is trusthworthy"
640,isfj,"I agree that's a weird thing to say, but wouldn't go on and conclude she's not interested.
I have an ISFJ roommate that I recently chaperoned into a relationship (with someone else). I think the main obstacle she had to overcome was she'd always imagine how things were going to fail. That's inferior Ne so I'm inclined to think it's common or at least not so rare in ISFJs.
She would pick up anything that happened or was said and turn it into a scenario where the relationship was doomed to failure. As a result, she had cold feet, which could look like avoidant.
It's important that you be vulnerable, do not hesitate to say positive stuff even though she doesn't. As you said, as an ENFP that's not going to be a problem I believe, and it's a good thing. 
But do it so you're not expecting answers or saying stuff about the two of you, just about how you feel towards her, and the relation. I think as an ENFP that's also not a problem (again, only based on the one ENFP)
Now, of she's going to open up, the most important is listening to her, not just in an interview style (you ask, she answers), she has to lead and choose where the conversation goes. Just do what ever you can so the conversation feels like she's driving. 
That's probably going to be the challenge given your types, you probably need to feel like she's doing 75% of the talking. In fact you should only talk to make her feel comfortable about what she said (rephrasing, saying you understand and it's normal, maybe sometimes saying a story saying how you can relate but that's in fact very risky). 
And ask very open questions. The most open questions are not even questions. Sometimes I just make faces and let silence until my interlocutor goes into more detail. Look like your pondering, surprised or confused, and dunt know exactly what it is you want to ask. Let a few silent second, and you'll get answers to the most relevant question (relevant to her). I'm saying this because I do this naturally and it's very effective.
Don't worry, of that doesn't seem natural, if you don't want to always feel like you can't speak. That's important in letting her open up but you won't always need to do that."
641,isfj,"Hi INTP here. Wanted to know some common personality traits that ISFJ women share and how do they act around INTP men. Also,how do you know an ISFJ is into you and how to flirt with her?
​
THANK YOU!!"
642,isfj,"On a serious note :p
I can only speak for myself - I cannot flirt, especially if I like someone. I tend to tense up and clam up in their presence, I just pray that they will make a move. If I know them well, I do take initiative but I need to feel very comfortable and sure about them (which always takes ages). I also tend to take things slow, unless I am so madly in love but so sure that it subdues my fears. In some cases, I am just content to be madly in love from a distance (not really wishing to have a relationship or even talking to them any time soon)
So far, my experience with INTP man didn't really go any deeper than acquaintance level, and to tell the truth, I find him to be intimidating, unless he's in a light mood.. When we're into someone though, we tend to be 'regular' in caring after them - have you done homework, do you need help, remembering some things for you or about you that matter, doing things for you, etc."
643,isfj,"Hey man, INTP here.
I've been dating my ISFJ for 2 years now.
I had to take the lead in order for anything to happen, it was a slow process but i finally understood that she wasn't gonna give me the signs i needed. 
Both types are not very good at communication so my best advice is, ask her for help with literally anything (i asked her for help with math, which i didin't really need help with, just needed an excuse). 
I guess flirting with an ISFJ is not necessary, just entertain her Ti child with your Ti hero (should be simple enough), keep in mind that they aren't very responsive so go nuts with your unrelenting mental fantasies. They also are much more comfortable with silence than we are so don't take silence as an Fe fuckup, it's probably just an Se trick (although im not too sure because idk wtf the world is and she dont talk so it dont help me).
So recap, flirting is overrated. Be yourself, don't expect much feedback and take the lead however uncomfortable that make you. (Nature dates are a plus)
Quick edit: because Ti is first in our stack, ISFJs might feel a little lacking in thinking capability (like everyone else exept intjs), this is not real. They are quite smart, they just take much more time than we to make sure their thoughts are correct and well grounded in reality. Don't let that be a turnoff"
644,isfj,"Idk whether or not ISFJ females are different from ISFJ males in this regard, but my experience is that they don't really flirt, they more... befriend you. They talk to you, try to entertain you, share their past and memories with you, try to get to know you etc. Even when they initiate hanging out, it may appear as if they're just being friendly. My advice is that you make a move because they might not, even if they're interested."
645,isfj,"I always expect that if a guy likes me, he will clearly show it and do something about it (like approaching me) and if he doesn't I always think that it's because I wasn't as interesting enough. Even if I like the guy back, I will most likely do nothing about it because I think it's the man's role to take the first step lol... I know this sounds stupid, I'm very openminded on other things but not this lol"
646,isfj,"Hey! Hope not to bother you
Any experience with ENTJ men? I am in love of this ISFJ girl, and she is taking things really slowly, still building confidence after a year knowing each other. Any advice or opinion you could give me? Thank you so much!"
647,isfj,"Hello!:)
I don't have a romantic experience with an ENTJ man, but my bestfriend's an ENTJ! :)
I can't really say about your ISFJ.. but, we do tend to go very slow.. What does she tell you, is she in love with you, but has some concerns about her life in general?
​
As for advice or opinion, hmm.. generally speaking and based on my long friendship with my ENTJ (a girl), I'd say, be little gentle with your ISFJ :) ..My friend at times especially when pursuing her plans or ideas can sometimes get rough and aggressive to the point where she can ignore my feelings, or be insensitive. This I would take to heart. But she is quick to come back and make up for it though. It took a while for me to realize, she has a sensitivity beneath all that tough dominant insensitive exterior she puts on. And, your ISFJ may be a little too moody for you, so just give her some time. My friend used to feel helpless and confused with my moodiness, but she voiced it gently or made jokes, and I would try to communicate back to her... A little gentleness and patience from your side (we do need a push but don't push us too far), and on behalf of ISFJ -an understanding to not take things to heart and understand the ENTJ's nature will take this companionship far and make it colorful! :) We need someone stable, stronger and leader-type with a soft inner core. Other than that, a great team.. emotionally, mentally, all ways.. there were many times where we had deep heart-to-heart conversations and I realized her hidden philosophical side, a rich inner world that remains hidden only to come out when she is able to relax and in the company of her loved ones.. and then I fell in love with her hehee.. The huge variation in her dynamic personality really is so appealing.. <3
​
^This is the summary of my friendship/experience with ENTJ, would you like to ask more? :)"
648,isfj,"Well i like to ramble, like all the time. I just start up with a though and then branch off and come back and explain some side things and come back. Naturally hard to follow for anyone.
By that i mean go on with ramblings but keep them straight, efficient and to the point. They really appreciate the thinking, just not the structure and basis for the thinking. Basically, you can have any kind of smart conversation but you have to keep it straight (not branching off into side thoughts) and half complicated. They'll take a little bit to process and get back to you with insightful comments.
Example; I look at a light in the dark and ask her why the light flares around the source. (I know that it's a combination of photons lagging through the atmosphere and the angle with which they hit your eye.) The answers she comes up with is half correct so i steer her in the right direction. She figures it out and adds some more information, maybe steers the discussion to another topic with more questions.
By entertaining her Ti child with you Ti hero, i mean get her to think and figure out ""important"" answers. Especially when it come to anything non linear/scientific topics, she might have bits of information you never thought of because of a different style of thinking.
I'm honestly not too sure if this answered your question or stayed on my original track. "
649,isfj,"I found mine in a student corridor, but apart from that I'd guess that cooking classes or dancing classes might be good places to find them.
I find them hard to recognize because of their tendency to be easygoing and stay in the background. I had my boyfriend take a test, because I was getting frustrated with being unable to type him. I had some hunches that he was an Si type - he's always well groomed, an excellent cook, much more attached to his past, memories, traditions etc than I am. He also has an amazing work ethic, which might be attributed to Si as well. It took me THE LONGEST time to recognize how deeply he feels, so I don't have any advice on how to recognize that quickly."
650,isfj,"""You try and act so tough, you think you’re so damn hopeless and godless and faithless, but you don’t fool me. People without hope aren’t tormented by the world the way you are. People without hope don’t give a shit. But I see it in you, in the way you look at things, even in the way you look at me sometimes, like I’m the coolest fucking guy in the universe, and I know it’s in there. Reverence. Belief. Something. You have a lot more faith than you own up to. You just don’t want to be let down.""
— Tiffanie DeBartolo, God-Shaped Hole.
Just something I wanted to share with ya'll."
651,isfj,"Hehe why thank you :D  I read it 7 or 8 years ago as a freshman in high school, and it was one of the first books that ever made me cry (the ending!!).  Glad I've found a fellow fan!
Random idea: we should compile a reading list!  Books ISFJs have enjoyed, or something like that?  :D"
652,isfj,"I assume you mean what it is like to be Si dominant. ISFJs also use Ti, just in the tertiary.
Since it is only the third in order of preference, we use Ti mostly to process our feelings and past events. As I understand from what I've read, a Ti dom will process more than this - they will catalogue and analyze everything, looking for logical inconsistencies. 
Si on the other hand is an irrational function, it just takes everything in and does some unconscious cataloguing, based on feelings and previous experiences. Over time, personal traditions and a preference for familiarity are developed. There's no inherent logical system built in (except in a lower degree, when the tertiary Ti kicks in), it's mostly instinctual/unconscious."
653,isfj,"i can relate to the random categorization based on feelings and previous experiences A LOT. 
also i feel more comfortable with things i already know than the ones that are new to me.
I won't add to much from myself as I am new to cognitive functions :)"
654,isfj,"Ill start
After taking many tests over a span of a year and 4 answers. each of them having things i believe in and want to be real. My personality is after doing alot more research then id like to get at a know it all i cant stand. The other 3 i got before were 1st: istp which only had a small thing i could relate to. 2nd: isfp which has alot of things i could get behind. 3rd was infp only one reason for it and it was kinda a small reason so meh. I got isfj last and honestly it fits alot better then the others. My honest opinion of these personality things are dumb and i could of gone on in life without knowing what these were.
Sorry my punctuation is bad"
655,isfj,"The first test I ever took was 16personalities, which scored me ISFJ.  When I started reading through different MBTI communities, I was advised to take different tests, or learn the functions because 16personalities isn't always accurate - so I did both.  I took a number of different tests (my favorites being personalitymax.com and John's Personality Test,) and scored ISFJ on most, scoring INFJ on about four and ESTJ on one odd test.  I read the cognitive functions, and found that their descriptions of Si and Fe explained my life to me.  To confirm, I started looking at characters who are commonly accepted as ISFJ's or ESFJ's - Marge Simpson, Lacey from Nosedive, Phoebe Heyerdahl, Kitty Forman, Betty Draper - and I could see the similarities popping out.  When I compared to NFJ's (INFJ was the only type I'd consider as closely as ISFJ,) I finally found what had separated me so much from my childhood role model, Lisa Simpson - the Ni-Si difference!  Lisa's metaphors and anger about wanting to change the world had never been something that I understood.  She never seemed to look back, which I didn't quite get, either.  When I learned the difference between NFJ's and SFJ's, everything made a world of sense."
656,isfj,"I'm still not sure to be honest. Years ago I did a DISC test (result: SC), which 100% described me. A couple of years ago I did a Enneagram test (result 9w1) which 100% describes me. And then we have MBTI, where I get different result every time. ISFJ is the closest, but still not 100% me. And looking at ISFJ-A vs ISFJ-T doesn't help, as I'm a bit of both. 
So to summarize - DISC describes the relationships between the different personalities very well, and has helped me a lot in life. Enneagream describes the different levels of healthiness in your personality very well, which I also have found helpful. But the only thing about MBTI I've really found to help me is how they describe introvert / extrovert. It's the only one where I'm distinctive something (on the other ""measurements"" I'm more in the middle..). And learning about the differences between being introvert/extrovert has been very helpful. Other than that I don't really get that much from the MBTI system."
657,isfj,"It took me about three years to figure out my type. I didn’t do an intense study of MBTI the whole time, but I did quite a bit in off and on stretches. I considered my life every day in terms of fitting one type’s functions or another. In the end, this paid off because I consider the personality type framework to be EXTREMELY useful in my day to day. 
You get what you put into it. If you don’t want to do the research and just have a test tell you what you are- you’re going to get an answer that feels superficial and not worth the time. Like an answer that only took into account 20 vaguely worded dichotomies. That can still be fun though! I get stopping there."
658,isfj,"Do meme tests, read functions and got typed once or twice. Problem is I am broken person but you cannot fucking lie on Si/SJ. This shit is too easy to detect. SJ temperament is very easy to spot. 
Also I wish to never find my type again.  I have more reasons to hate myself."
659,isfj,First test i took was socionics last test i took was on keys2cognition ill try the ones you suggested to fine tune mine but i think isfj will be the closet to what i get tbh but trying out them all is fun in its own way
660,isfj,My friend did a heck amount of research and found mine out in a year. im a isfj fe subtype not only did he make me do tests i did alot probably 5 different ones. we got along really well which helped a bit him being a entp. we got into a bit of a fight and found out my hidden agenda which is to understand. If you cant guess what we fought about i didnt understand the personality stuff at all. Also im wondering what you are i wanna say entp but it wouldnt be right cause your really passive aggressive.
661,isfj,"Im a isfj my subtype is fe
""Seems lively, friendly, and unrestrained in conversation; emotionally responsive, easily gives compliments and closes the distance, may even take his conversation partner by his hand; his lack of restraint carries a shade of familiarity. Shyness can alternate with joking remarks; ironic quips easily turn into respectful and serious tone. Often jokes and tells even unpleasant things with a smile as to not offend the other person. Precautionary and careful.""
Most isfjs are si subtype"
662,isfj,"edit: I didn’t think there would be so many responses! thank you all for this. And it’s surprising how many of you have experienced depression. Your ways of dealing with it are very nice to hear, and I’ll take all your advice to heart, and even keep it in mind for others. "
663,isfj,"Yes absolutely—particularly in social situations or amidst conflict among family or friends. 
If it’s severe or chronic...therapy and meds. I can’t really comment on mild depression except to say find the things that make you feel happy and free and make sure to do those things on a regular basis. "
664,isfj,"I am severely prone to depression, I think as a result of my personality type. I waver between stable and unstable mental health a few times a year with seasonal depression hitting me hard on top of my regular depression. If you struggle as much as me and nothing seems to pull you out of it, I recommend getting medicated."
665,isfj,"I have depression right now.  I cry a lot more than the average person does, I'm pretty sure.  I deal with it by trying to rationalize my problems; if I'm becoming caught up in how happy I used to be, I just tell myself that most people aren't as happy as they were when they were seven.  I've had suicidal thoughts, but my hope in the world and belief in people is part of what's keeping me alive - I do want to live to see the world progress, even though the thought of the future scares me.  I try my best to support other people because I feel that I am not being entirely supported; I send people compliments simply because I feel that they aren't being appreciated often enough, I give people things such as my food because I feel like I'm not worthy enough, etc.  I do want to see a therapist and get better, but I've been too afraid to bring it up to my parents, so for now I just deal with it."
666,isfj,"Since I was 12 (am 30 now). I've been on antidepressants for the majority of the time, and I go to therapy every 2-4 weeks. The rest of the time, I just try not to judge myself for what I need to do for self-care. Do I need to work extra shifts to avoid having too much time to think? I do it. Do I need to stay home under a blanket and watch The Office for the fifth time? Do it."
667,isfj,"yes, absolutely. i have found that prayer and just sharing how i feel with people who understand to be helpful. it may sound great to have people who understand but the truth is that it took a lot of trial and error and vulnerability to find people who could come close to understanding how i feel."
668,isfj,"I'm such a positive, optimistic person but I def get seasonal winter depression. I live in WI and by January/February I'm usually always in a slump. I feel like as I get older I'm getting better abt recognizing it and dealing with it. When I was in Jr High I was really depressed to and ended up going to therapy but I was never prescribed anything, my therapist said that if anything I could have situational depression. I've developed a lot of coping methods as well that really help me so it's not something I deal with often. "
669,isfj,"First: See a doctor and a therapist.
After that: I use an app called Youper to help me track my mood and symptoms. It also has cognitive behavior therapy and meditation features.
Also important: Prayer, Bible study, and a few friends/family I can turn to."
670,isfj,"I feel the almost exactly the same way... Same thing of supporting people, compliments, etc. I try beating around the bush about it  when getting to know someone I feel will be a good friend that makes me so happy to have them say that care about me, enjoy my company, appreciate me, be it by saying so, or by little actions here or there. It's a shame; most of my friends don't say a word and take my compliments and support I try to give them for granted and it makes me feel empty more often than not.
It takes a whole lot for me to truly open up to other people, and it seems like every single time when I finally feel comfortable to be vulnerable and dump my shit all over the floor for them to see, it feels like they don't care on the same level I care about their problems if they talk to me about their junk; I tend to absorb what they are saying, I ask a lot of questions about how they felt when X happened or Y, what would you have done differently in hindsight etc... However I'll be talking to them and I'll notice that all they do is just... sit there. Due to my ISFJ nature and picking up subtle cues, I get this vibe that they aren't really listening, or just brush me off, or even worst of all, flat out ignoring me. I can tell when someone doesn't give a fuck, so I withdraw completely because now I know how they truly feel because body language and actions speak louder than words. I feel like I know so many people deep down and personally, yet maybe only one person really knows me. Life as an ISFJ I guess... I like to think I get by, even though some days are tougher than others. 
My project car helps me cope with my loneliness and depression the most. My baby is always there when I need it, be it throwing some tunes on and taking a cruise to nowhere in particular, or spending quality time with it fixing whatever may be broken or needs addressing. It's a perfect give and take relationship for me; I make a point to do everything to this car myself that it needs to run and drive, and in return it repays and thanks me every time I hear that engine fire up and sing to me; thanking me for getting it road worthy and drivable again and keeping it that way. (30+ year old cars are a handful sometimes lol) As an ISFJ I value alone time with those I treasure the most, and quite honestly nothing in the world is better than just me and this machine that I love with all my heart going out and just... spending time together. 
I just re-read what I wrote and I may be a weirdo lol. Now that I think about it, however I feel good to have these thoughts written out and organised... I have been thinking about this and it's bothering me for a long time now. Heh
Hope you're having a nice day/night dude, and whoever else may be reading this. :)"
671,isfj,"I figure a reason people say that it Fe is high up on our stack so importance on external values/people/appearances would matter more to where we would be more willing to want to interact with others.
While Im a generally quiet person, I genuinely enjoy talking to people often and I do like being in communities. Ill just get to the usual introvert point of wanting to keep  to myself or stick to online stuff."
672,isfj,"When I compare myself to other introverts, I'd say yes, that's true.
I can be extremely bubbly, friendly and warm with strangers, moreso than my other introvert friends/family members. I can come across as quite extroverted, and I'm a pretty social person. I enjoy social occasions. 
I get drained pretty fast, which is when I tend to come across as quiet and shy, and I'm not as good with big groups of people, but for the most part, I would agree with this."
673,isfj,"I'm sure as hell not lol. My daily quota for people time is incredibly low, honestly.... I do my best to be friendly even though I lean quiet/awkward, and I always try to be helpful and do what I can for people, but I'm not remotely extroverted. Even talking to people I genuinely adore makes me ridiculously tired. "
674,isfj,"I'd agree with that. When I'm PUT in a social situation, I do quite well and and am usually in no hurry to end it but I have zero motivation to seek out a social situation. 
However, I'm a sucker for situations that require my help or support. If I have a job to do, I'm ON it. "
675,isfj,Yeah! I think mostly it's my desire to help others and be of service to others that causes this. I have noticed that it's easier when the other person is an extrovert; I'm really not the best at bringing social energy out of introverts. But I really do like the company of others.
676,isfj,"I like talking to people and love to spend time with friends, but I also need time alone every day or so. And I basically never start the conversation if I don't know you very well. I'm happy to talk; I just don't know if you want to talk to me so you have to start taking first. "
677,isfj,"There's a misunderstanding about telling ISFJs are the most outgoing introverts, depicting us sometimes as ambiverts.
As far as I've observed (myself plus a bunch of other ISFJs than my own self), and documented through the Internet, we're just committed to be kind and empathetic most of time, which can turn some persons into thinking we're outgoing. We're just opened to them for a while, and when we reach our social quota, we're tired and need to be on our own...
We love talking and interacting because, out of recharging while being on our own, we're energized by emotional interaction (Fe).
That does not necessarily make most of us really outgoing.
I would recommend you to carry on your researches on MBTI cognitive functions to provide you a better view about all that.
Kind regards, 
PY"
678,isfj,"And, as I've previously posted on a similar thread: 
I found a few months ago an interesting picture on the Internet about extroverted introverts, telling that:
IxFJ are extroverted with emotional interactions
IxTJ are extroverted with intellectual interactions
INxP are extroverted with exploring possibilities
ISxP are extroverted with doing.
I've experienced that (as an ISFJ, and with such other types).
And it really makes sense with MBTI in general, understanding the cognitive functions. Do I feel.
Depends on what we're talking about, as says the picture :-)"
679,isfj,"Yes, actually. I've brought it up on here before, but it seems I actually am an introvert, but I can come off as an extrovert if I really need to. Not that I like acting all bubbly, but when it's necessary I can pull it off. "
680,isfj,"Hey you :)
I'm a male ENFP, met this reaaaal cute looking ISFJ at a dance showcase. Walked up to her and straight up told her how she was the cutest looking at the whole event and how I'd love to add her on facebook (I noticed she got real shy and red, so I wanted to take it slow and not ask for her number yet).
Thing is, I would really love to get to know her better, (and admittedly get her to like me) and I would love your advice on this :)
I chat her up often and we always have long conversations, not really about deep stuff but just exchanging interests etc. and she seems like she kinda enjoys chatting.
My worry: I'm always the person to initiate. Is this an ISFJ thing or is this simply a sign she doesn't like me?
We met a 2nd time at a New Year's Event (1-2 weeks later) where she was dancing with her group. Instead of sitting with her dance members, she sat down next to me. I really fucked up hardcore and only cringed a few awkward conversations in there (REAL BAD. She felt awkward af tol and eventually sat somewhere else).
She DID say sorry afterwards and say she always need some time building trust with people, but I wonder:
Is just being nice and chatting with me out of courtesy or does she actuall enjoy the time chatting with me?
Uuuhm that was basically my question. I have a bad urge of wanting to know her better, open her up and making her laugh.
Am I just wasting my time to someone who's just polite? "
681,isfj,"In my experience, if I don't like someone, I'll just avoid them. I definitely wouldn't make an effort to sit next to them or chat with them or anything.
As a general rule, it does take me a long time to trust someone, and I'm not likely to make the first move, even if I like someone a LOT.
Don't be afraid to keep pursuing her, but do be observant of her signals. If she seems uncomfortable around you, or seems like she's trying to end conversations quickly and/or get away from you, maybe back off a little.
I really appreciated that my ESFJ boyfriend made most of the first moves and wasn't afraid to initiate nearly everything when we first started dating. Because if it was left up to me, it probably would've taken me 6 months just to hold his hand, despite the fact that I was crazy about him. I was also quite shy around him in the beginning, and he carried most of the conversation until I started getting more comfortable."
682,isfj,"ENxP, here.
What did you told her ? Isn't your Fi's main purpose is precisely to put order in you Ne mental chaos ?
Ne's favorite approach is the yolo strat. 
Most easy and reliable topics to know someone quiclky are :


Occupation (Ask her about her work (As a dancer ?).)


Family (Most of us have parents. Most of those who do have one love them. That's a rather safe bet.)


Hobbies (What she does for fun. You know fun pretty well. That shouldn't be too hard to get why and how makes her tick.)


Dreams (It ranges from the ol' ""what did you dreamed to become when you were little"" to ""I wished I had telekinesis. It would be so awesome !"" with ""Can you remember what you dream about ?"" in the middle. Safe, large range of topics and highly symbolic and meaningful. I love that one but I've been told one should be more cautious about that one than the others. Don't know why yet.)

"
683,isfj,"Female ENFP (I hope this is ok to reply here!)
Essentially the genders are switched in my relationship and the one thing that I noticed with my partner is that when they do something out of character (sitting with you vs friends), it's a conscious thought. She decided to sit with you for a conscious reason. She's going out of her comfort zone...for you. 
If she brings up any past conversations or remember an obscure detail, it's a very good sign! 
I feel your struggle but let me reassure you that it's completely worth it. :) 
Edit: words"
684,isfj,"Hi there, 
I agree with some fellows here: if she's not interested, she would simply avoid you.
You'll find plenty of guidance on the Internet, articles about trying to woo/date an introvert, and an ISFJ more specifically.
We ISFJs do have trust issues after having been hurt and used several times, it comes on top of simply being introverts. So she's honest telling you she needs some time to build trust, and the fact she told you that is another thing that makes me think she could be opened to you. 
Be observant, don't be too pushy, AND please don't try to woo her for your own pleasure, we ISFJs usually commit hard to relationships and are used to have our heart deeply broken, and it often affects us very much more than many other MBTI types.
Hoping that helps ?"
685,isfj,"I think you said it best with the effort it takes ISFJ's to sit next to someone we aren't completely comfortable with. 
My advice to the OP, from a mans perspective especially to an ""Inspirer"" ENFP, is to keep it calm  cool and non-intrusive unless you have a well thought out plan. We are thinkers and really dive deep into thought reviewing social interactions, so a quick interesting conversation often means more than someone that cannot stop talking -- especially if the subject is yourself. Once you have her trust you can have some of the best deep talks but even then our defense is up and you will have to tread lightly. Eye contact, little touches, and the well thought out plan would be a small gift/kind act that requires nothing from her but shows who you are, something that shows depth of character. A woman that you highly value and values herself with appreciate ""the dance"" of courtship, two steps forward and one back to give her space to process your ""moves"". 
Keep us updated and good luck! "
686,isfj,"Thanks for sharung your viewpoint :) 
Looks like the others here agree! A question: Do you not initiate chats, too? Or does this refer to generally everything?
Again thanks so much, now I'm not freaking out as much anymore lol. If anyone else has other viewpoints or would like to agree, please don't hesitate to post here, too. Your opinions really matter to
me =)"
687,isfj,"If I really like someone, I might try to initiate conversations with them. Depends, though. If they make me really nervous, I might be too intimidated.
How does she act when you hang out with her? Is she super quiet and shy, does she laugh a lot...?"
688,isfj,"I don't ever see her in person :/
1st time was just approaching her, no talk. 2nd time I met her she was really shy and quiet, only gave 1 to 3 word answers. And the biggest problem was for some reason I got very fucking awkward whenever I talked to her.
Made her laugh a few times, but those weren't a big deal I think.
As a result, her body language was droopy and she often looked at her cell phone. The whole event was a disaster lol
I've been debating if I should just ask her out on a coffee, yet again, that might be too intimidating for her just yet so I haven't done that yet."

690,isfj,"I'm in love with an ISFJ. 
I have never felt this way about anyone else before. Currently she is truly the love of my life. 
So I'm asking y'all who share her personality type on this fine subreddit, 
what is the key to your heart? "
691,isfj,"ISFJs tend to overextend themselves to help others however they can, especially at the cost of their own happiness, health and energy. Try to notice all these little things that your ISFJ love does for both you and others, and tell her that you appreciate how much she cares for others. Even the strong and giving need validation as well. Stay in tune with her emotions, and acknowledge them - ISFJs have so many feelings that are oftentimes waiting to burst. 
Good luck!"
692,isfj,"Humor. Be loving and logical. Don’t be overly romantic in a traditional sense. Ooy gooy things like flowers and chocolate that don’t serve practical purpose make me uncomfortable, unless it’s a hobby/interest (ie put some thought into your love expression). Be sweet but not a pushover. Be bold and witty, but not pushy. Alternatively, gently nudge me to do things out of my comfort zone because my growth = your growth. Obviously this is particular to this isfj. Be curious. Ask about our day. Out of curiosity, what’s your type?"
693,isfj,"For me personally I enjoy it when people point out the positive little things I do for others. Like if I were to make you coffee because I knew you were running late for work and can't stop by a Starbucks, I would appreciate some appreciation like ""the coffee you made for me this morning really helped me out today!"".
Another thing that I personally like is when people think about me randomly and tell me. When I am going to Walmart, I always text or call my SO to ask if they need anything. It's a small thing but it tells me that you were thinking of me out of the blue and that makes my heart HAPPY. 
One tip is that how your ISFJ love displays love and affection to you. If they spend a lot of time with you giving you compliments, buying you gifts, or helping you out with tasks then you should exhibit the same type of affection and attention  because that's how we would like to be loved. 
Also, we LOVE traditions. If we normally go eat pizza on our anniversary, for each anniversary, keep that tradition but Amp it up a little here and there to make it special each anniversary. Such as instead of pizza at your place last anniversary, why not take a small road trip to a scenic area and having pizza there. You can probably see where i am going with this. 
We are very sentimental and for me, the easiest thing to make my heart melt are handwritten cards. And cake.
So to summarize:

Make me feel appreciated 
Surprise me by thinking about me randomly and letting me know about it 
Make some traditions and play it off like it's exclusively a thing ""just between the two of you"" 
Sentimental acts of love
Food. 

Edit: formatting and typos and added a summary for convenience."
694,isfj,"IDK the key to my heart.. but I can say it takes time for us to really get close to you.. Be gentle, patient, steady, offer stability, be compassionate, loving, caring, acknowledge the care/concern she shows, be direct - ask what you want, tell what you want.. 
Being supportive of her hobbies or interests, showing her better way to find a creative outlet.. Like someone said here, we have so many feelings and are on the verge of bursting :) It would be excellent if you both have shared interest.. most usually, an ISFJ tries to adopt hobbies of their loved one, but if you have different one - be supportive.. Indulge in her imaginative side (we have a rich inner world that we like to escape to from time to time - not at the cost of our duty/responsibility tho). Show your imaginative world. And yes, no melodrama or overly dramatic emotions..
I like people that don't take themselves overly seriously or have a good sense of humor, especially in the face of problems. PRACTICALITY, really - people who have a simplistic approach towards life can reduce our own stress, and I personally find that quality very appealing - simplicity.. But more than anything, be her rock, a silent warm presence of stability.
Best wishes to you and your ISFJ :D "
695,isfj,I would say just be nice and considerate towards us. But also flirt with us and tease us a little bit. I don’t know about other ISFJs but I have a offbeat and sometimes dark sense of humor. Also do things to help us because we often help other people that we might not pay attention to our own needs. When we do help you showing appreciation is great too. We might not ask for it but we do like to be thanked. Another way you could is just to be direct and ask her out which you ENTJs should be good at.
696,isfj,"Look me directly in the eyes when you speak to me. Touch me (not in an over the top way, but a subtle way). Engage my mind. Be open with your body language so I feel more comfortable. Compliment me on something you like about me. "
697,isfj,"What? That sounds like something I'd say as an INTP, and not at all like what my ISFJ wife likes..."
698,isfj,"ISFJ- I never know what to do when anyone gets me flowers!! They get ‘put away’ then left alone; I’d rather just see them in nature where they belong!! However, chocolate is good and I will always accept that (but I love, love candy!)"
699,isfj,"I agree that I don't like mushy stuff. Maybe in your case you rarely show your love in any way, so your ISFJ wife appreciates the thought/effort that goes into the ooey gooey stuff more than the stuff itself. "
700,isfj,"Tinder tbh, we talked for about 3 weeks and then met in person. He’s an ESTP. At first I wasn’t sure how I felt about him, but his personality really sold me and after about a week, I didn’t look back. "
701,isfj,Sorry I'm not an ISFJ but my fiance is. I'm an enfp..he approached me in college after math class one day. I fluttered and went back with my ex which ended. My fiance dependably remained my friend while I was still trying to make it work with my ex. Didn't fathom all I could ever want or need was an ISFJ though but we're peas in a forever pod.
702,isfj,"OkCupid. :P Interestingly, we only lived like 2 miles away from each other, on opposite sides of the city's river. A lot of guys messaged me first, but he's the only one that I made the first contact with. 
I just liked a lot of things in his profile, which he clearly put time and thought into. We were a super high ""match"" percentage, we aligned on core things (e.g., both agnostic, neither are vegetarian/vegan, both liberal). And he listed Willy Wonka and Big Fish as his favorite movies, which are soft spots for me.
He is INTJ, which apparently is not supposed to be a good match for us ISFJs, but I think what helps is that we communicate well. We're opposites in many ways, but we share a lot of the same interests. He's super logical, things don't bother him easily, and my neurotic/anxious tendencies don't stress him out. He puts me at ease. "
703,isfj,"We were introduced by a sneaky pair of mutual friends. He initiated the flirting and conversation the night we met and he's the one who asked for my number at the end of the night. Our connection was immediate and intense, but for a variety of reasons (including the fact that we're both terrified of our own feelings) we didn't actually end up getting together until months later.
I'm ISFJ, he's ISTP. Not exactly the most compatible pair. We're both prone to conflict avoidance and passive-aggression which leads to tensions bubbling under the surface far longer than they should. I'd say that's the primary issue in our relationship; other incompatibilities are minor and easily overcome. In general though we understand, support and  complement each other really well."
704,isfj,He’s ISTP and we met in Uni. We first started hanging out as a friends in a group of 5. I started to develop an interest for bf so I started texting him outside of our group chat. Bf is super shy and usually doesn’t talk much but then we started to text and talk for hours on end and finally went on a date. We’ve been together for 3 years now and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. 
705,isfj,"Her family and my family were friends. We each had different relatives wanting to set us up with each other but neither of us wanted to be set up with anyone. We weren't looking for a relationship.
Her family came to visit my cousin who I was taking care of and I drove everyone around town to sight-see. 
She was attracted to my voice, that I was nice and caring. She liked how I gave life advice to my cousin but did so in a soft way. 
I was attracted to her healthy boundaries with her family and her dedication to getting better at things and her thirst for new experiences. Though we immediately clicked we didn't let on that we liked each other.
She was only in town for a week and I didn't want to make things awkward between us by saying I was attracted to her right away. On the chance that she doesn't feel the same way or doesn't want to pursue anything with me, it would be very uncomfortable for her with me driving everyone around. She was looking for hints that I liked her but I hid them very well.
3 days before she had to return, I asked her to see a movie with a friend of mine and her cousin. I felt like she was going to leave soon and I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see where this could go. Even though I knew she lived far away and a long distance relationship is difficult. 
My friend separated her cousin from us. I put my arm around her and whispered jokes in her ear. She whispered jokes back. we made bets on the plot. and it was great.
The next day we played board games together, watched some netflix together, then we celebrated new years together by watching fireworks. All of this with family around so we weren't very open about our feelings still. And we didn't want to give the satisfaction to our respective families that they were right to set us up.
After she left, we texted a lot. Then we called each other under the premise that she's going to help me get better at speaking Vietnamese but all we did was talk. We found that it was easy for us to share with each other openly and honestly.
A few days after she left, she expressed doubts with her mom that someone would be interested in her enough to fly to see her. Coincidentally right after that conversation I called her to see if she would feel comfortable with me flying to see her.
A week and a half after she flew away, we said we loved each other. A week and a half after that I flew to visit her.
I don't actually know what type she is. I know she is IN but the other two is hard to figure out."
706,isfj,"He's an ESTJ and it's a bit of an odd story.
We met at a mutual friend's party. At the time I was pretty shy around strangers, so when he kept trying to talk to me I brushed it off as him just being friendly/polite and apparently effectively shut him down; the idea that he was flirting didn't even hit until later lol
Later on, another girl started talking to him and they hit it off really well. At the time I thought it was cute and pointed it out to our mutual friend, who told me that the girl had a boyfriend. I kept trying to get her to tell him (because clearly he had no idea??) and she kept saying it wasn't her business. Finally I decided to do it myself and got him alone. It was extremely uncomfortable, but it had to be done.
As it turned out, the awkwardness of telling him was enough for me to overcome my natural tendency to avoid people and we started talking. Everything clicked really well and he asked me on a date not long after. My dumb ass wasn't even sure if it was a date until he said ""it's a date!""
The rest is history :D"
707,isfj,"I met my partner on POF I’m ISFJ he’s ENFJ , I read his profile and it seemed like he was a good person , little did I know the day I messaged him he was going to completely delete POF , his grandmother at the time was not doing well and was at the hospital a lot . Because of that we didn’t get to officially meet till weeks of talking every night . We had a movie date at my house and I was so scared he wasn’t going to text me after he left  I always would get the it was nice meeting you BUT . On the way home he was texting me and it felt amazing . We kept talking and seeing each other when we both could , I met his grandmother before she passed which was very nice . Moved in with him and we are still living together , about to get married very soon hopefully next month . "
708,isfj,"I (isfj) met my partner (isfp) through a mutual friend. I really think we instantly clicked. we spent a couple hours together the afternoon we met in the company of the mutual friend we had both known for years so it was really easy to just be ourselves and comfortable in the small, partially familiar group. "
709,isfj,"INTP (me)/Seattle/yes instant click. 
ISFJ partner/NYC/yes instant click. 
Introduced through our mutual friend in Seattle who played WoW with my partner for some years (I personally am not a gamer). Mutual friend waited until I wasn’t seeing anyone serious and gave ISFJ my number. He was very assertive and traditional with calling/planning (still is). Dated long distance for a year, he moved here. 
Honestly? He’s a classic turbulent ISFJ, which as a concept sounds stressful to me. But ISFJ’s are so beyond fun to laugh with and purely warm and kind that there is no way he could’ve screwed it up. "
710,isfj,"Met him (XNTP) at work. He was instantly my best friend and made me laugh a ton. He liked my smile and my kindness. We hung out for months as friends with a group. Slowly we hung out more and more just the two of us, but still as friends. Eventually, when the timing was right, one thing led to another. :) "
711,isfj,"Nothing yet. I dont even know if i understand the feeling, but i'm only 18 and still have a future to learn with it. I feel i may have tangled with that feeling a few times with a few friends due to intimate moments, but i know they dont feel the same anyway. I dont want to rush things, but i dont want to wait really either. "
712,isfj,"I met my partner on OkCupid in 2017. She's an ENFJ and I feel like we really click now. For her it was instantaneous. For me it was a struggle at first, but I feel like as our relationship grows our connections gets stronger and now we are extremely bonded. She messaged me first. "

714,isfj,"For sure! No matter what type you end up with it's going to take work. Before I met my husband I dated an ENFP and an ISFP. All those relationships had their own problems, they were just different problems. If anything I think MBTI can help us learn why people act the way they do, and that lends itself to compassion and compromise.
And thank you! 😊"
715,isfj,"Cats for me.  Haven't really been fond of dogs since one bit me as a kid.  I'm a really low-key introvert so I also don't like how excitable some dogs are, barking and jumping on me.  Cats are generally calmer.  We both like to snuggle and be affectionate and also have some alone time.  "
716,isfj,"I agree. I also can’t deal with how needy dogs are. My cat appreciates being fed, hanging out in the same room doing our own thing, and a like a minute of petting. 
Also ... sometimes dogs smell really bad..."
717,isfj,I like the smart/witty/dark humored guys. But honestly find out whatever she likes and show interest in it. It's the little things that matter the most. Just because we have the same personality doesn't mean we all are the same when it comes to how someone approaches us.
718,isfj,"I like to connect talking about personal stuff and getting to know the other person instead of empty small talk. I enjoy talking about experiences, travelling, family, and knowing the other person point of view about a variety of issues. "
719,isfj,"as an ISFJ girl I would say that it's important to show interest in her interests, my boyfriend doesn't care about anything I like and it's very distressing sometimes. I also swoon like a Victorian era Lady over someone who can really lay on the charm. "
720,isfj,"ask genuine questions to get to know them on a deeper level than the surface. its great to talk about school, work, etc. but that's not what attracts isfj's. and pay attention. like really look at them and be present. but like some people already said, everyone is different. this can go for anyone really. "
721,isfj,"How do you guys deal with frustration? i'm currently feeling it build up in me and don't really see a way to release it and i'm unsure how to address it within my schedule. not until sunday i think. but it got me wondering what is frustration like for other isfj's.
does it build up? does it come in small waves between build up and release? does it build up real big and crashes down on everyone around you? do you actively manage it or kind of let it come and go on it's own?"
722,isfj,"My brother and I are both ISFJ and we get our frustration out by venting. My brother is more likely to talk about the events/people leading up to his frustration whereas I talk about how i feel and why.
When I'm really frustrated about personal stuff, I write/journal and listen to music. When I'm angry-frustrated, I walk. When I'm sad-frustrated, I go to my room and just lay in my bed for a bit till I want to face people again. 
It depends on the circumstances for me though. Ive had spurts of sudden vent sessions with my friends and/of daily little vents with my family. It depends on who's listening. Sometimes i just get suddenly super overwhelmed and I need to get away from people fast once I hit that tipping point. "
723,isfj,"This is timely, as I'm currently extremely frustrated lol. I find that I'm not very good at dealing with it, kind of like I'm not very good at being sick :/ Fairly minor but drawn-out discomforts are really hard for me to cope with, I guess I prefer for things to just be really bad once and then be over with quickly. 
Anyway, I'm a whiny person by nature so I find that mostly I just complain even more aggressively than usual and get more short-tempered. It's also tiring for me to maintain that level of pissiness though, so eventually it'll just kind of fade out and I'll stop caring. "
724,isfj,"I vent to my friends about my problems a majority of the time(bless them for listening to me all the time), but if I don't, sometimes it'll build up and I'll explode if a certain event triggers me. I'm terrible with stress overall though honestly, but going to the gym helps me to destress as well"
725,isfj,"What does your schedule have to do with releasing frustration? 
Everybody gets frustrated, and everyone has different ways of releasing it. Binding yourself to things like a schedule don't really help as they just restrict you further. I have found that when I'm frustrated I often still want to maintain a positive outward composure towards people, and this just exacerbates the problem. You're not doing ok, and that's alright. You don't have to seem like you are all the time. 
I think that it can depend on what the frustration is as well. If it's specifically with another person then one of the best ways to deal with it is probably going to be to confront that person about it. And while the initial confrontation can be hell to go through, it will ultimately result in a better outcome because you've gone to the root of the problem. 
You've got control over your own life, and if things aren't going the way you want them to then the best thing you can do is change them. It can be scary and difficult, but the end result will almost surely be more pleasing that had you never taken the chance in the first place. "
726,isfj,"my frustration is with coming back from a trip last weekend to find my boiler is broken and my house is cold and dealing with the repair company. first night i came back at midnight and stayed up to 2 to try to fix it myself. 
2nd night they came over in the evening to find that they don't have the part to fix it. i cancelled gym with my trainer to do that. 
3rd night they came with the part to find that something is wrong with plumbing which is caused by part being broken so i have to get a plumber to come over.  I cancelled a boxing class to be there, they gave me a 5 hour window but came an hour after that at 11pm, turns out i missed the class for nothing. 
4th night the plumber came while i was away and had someone open the door for them. i came back to a basement with a leaking boiler and stayed up to 2am mopping. 
5th night the the repair person came an hour after the 5 hour window again and fixed the boiler around midnight. i missed out spending time with a friend that was going through a rough time and needed someone to talk to.
but throughout the day i have to work and i can't be overly frustrated there with employees. i am their employer, gotta be professional. i haven't been working out where i can safely release my pent up frustration in my lifts. and the repair people have no control over how their company's dispatch does things. not their fault they're late. their company's system of assigning repair people is trash.
and i'm doing what i can which is getting them to fix the thing and making sure it gets fixed. but it just sucks a lot."
727,isfj,"I have friend relationship not intimate one. We are friends longer than 5 years. Once I broke up with him when he borrow from me big money and he won't bother to pay. I got mad and quit any contact by for some reason he actually paid that. I am no longer borrow him any money. Also he sometimes trigger my shit with appointments because faggot knows that he won't be able to go but he still can say he will. 
As I see my friend I could probably date a ISFP girl but they fucking really sucks with emotions. They can only relate to your Fe if they actually ever had similar feelings. If not, too bad for you because they just go full meme Te answer that might trigger even more havoc.
Edit: because I only vent about negatives. He actually made me to care more about my appearance and often he brings some weird shit to do like horror house. So I recommend after all."
728,isfj,"I did, about 8 years. It was meh. Too much introversion on both ends. Now entps, that’s where the action is!
In all seriousness, we ended on good terms. The relationship got really boring. He just wanted to play guitar in his room all day ... and I wanted to do Si stuff. Kinda just felt like roommates after a while. It was a really peaceful relationship though .... too peaceful."
729,isfj,"Mostly being silly. Si is our (isfjs) first function. Really it’s the Si/Fe/Ti. Reading, hanging out with small groups, working out. That could be anyone really. Anyway- he took his feelings very very seriously and kinda creeped me out with his romantic side sometimes. I’m not a flowers kinda girl. I’m practical. He was very much into art, which I appreciated.... but it consumed his world into isolation. Which is fine, I do this but in different ways as an introvert. I think my biggest point is that, IMO, I need an extrovert as an SO. Someone who brings life, excitement, and growth. This relationship was peaceful and loving. Which sounds great, and we really had some great moments. But it was very stagnant and boring."
730,isfj,"I also was with an ISFJ and Im an ISFP. It is so true that this relationship was stagnant and boring. No growth. I wanted to be out more but with the stress of feeling boxed in, I delved in phone video games. She was always studying and it was hard for me to get out and do new things with her."
731,isfj,"I think most people really underestimate how beautiful ISFJs Musicians can be. Moby is an ISFJ and I sure love his bits.
It's easy to confuse ISFJs and ISFPs. The way to tell them apart is that ISFPs are improvisers to a large degree. ISFJs are more properly skilled IMO. You lot portray tragedy really well. I would wager that the Coldplay dude is an ISFJ. And this ???

732,isfj,"My psych homework got me thinking about this, and I'd be interested to see if there's a possible correlation between our personality type and preferred learning styles. I'd say I'm a mix of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. "
733,isfj,"I consider myself a multimodal learner, but I prefer kinesthetic learning. When it comes to studying I rewrite all of my notes over and over. There's no organization to it at all. I just rewrite because I find that it sticks better to memory. I go through so many notebooks though."
734,isfj,"I really prefer a mixture of all.  I feel like learning in only one style doesn't provide me with the desired amount of understanding.
For example, if I am practicing coding I will try to find a video about the subject.  Then, try it on my own while reading some form of reference."
735,isfj,"I think males in our society our taught more to repress their emotions and be more logical thinkers.  As a result, I think ISFJ girls tend to have a much easier time developing Fe. I know as a male ISFJ I don’t get to exercise and use my auxiliary Fe as much as I want too. While I still use Fe to be polite and compassionate when possible, I know it’s been hard in my life to relate to other guys on an deeper level that I think we ISFJs need to feel like we have a connection with that person. I feel like I have to tailor my Fe strong emotions down when I hangout with thinkers so they don’t judge me as overly emotional or illogical. I know a lot of them consider me to be their friend because I listen to them and validate their opinion (even if I don’t agree with it). It’s always great having male friends that are feelers that I can be more of myself around feeling judged. Now that I’m developing Ti, I do sometimes wish I was a Ti Dom so I can be more detached and think logically without being conflicted with Fe. As an ISFJ, I think Fe just gets in the way of Ti natural nature of independence and impersonal logic. It’d be hella nice to be a Ti Dom. What do you male ISFJs think?"
736,isfj,"(Even though I'm not a male nor an ISFJ)
After studying MBTI daily for the past few months, I think that some negative characteristics that are supposedly ""linked"" to a type can be changed, instead of giving yourself an excuse not to, which in your case means being overly sensitive and emotional just because you're an ISFJ. Not everything is linked to MBTI and being overly sensitive is a trait that any type can have. For example, I'm probably an ISTP and I get emotional at times. MBTI is just a system to see your thought processes, and extraverted feeling is actually unrelated to how sensitive a person is (According to Google, it helps us to understand and empathize with the moods and emotions of others) 
Similarly, Ti doms have their own kind of trouble, and in our case it's most probably being insensitive and socially inept. But of course it is not for every one of us since MBTI is just a general system, after all ;)"
737,isfj,"I would be going around hugging everyone I know if I could but, like you mentioned, I feel like I have to have some kind of strong connection with them not to come out as weird. Feeling so empathetic but being unable to show it and being supportive really eats me inside everytime."
738,isfj,"Inferior Fe can be pretty ugly. It doesn’t mean you’re not emotional or don’t want connection. Those are very real things that feel overwhelming and energy sucking and so you resent it and block it out. 
I understand how socially that’s more acceptable for men to ignore though... but some of that means ignoring social expectations that directly connect to being liked and respected which is stuff most humans need on some level. 
But personal experience shows me that INTP men are still largely regarded as odd (in the bad way) whereas ISFJ men are seen as rather normal. Perhaps it’s because the INTPs aren’t playing the social game, but again, that has its own drawbacks. "
739,isfj,"There’s no point wishing to be someone else. It’s irrelevant. 
Take your personality as ISFJ and take advantage of your Si and Fe (your important cognitive functions).
This comes from a Ti dom INTP, who should stop being depressed and not be a hypocrite and take advantage of my Ti/Ne."
740,isfj,"As a Ti dom, I think it’s really important to make sure your ideas make sense and aren’t influenced by emotions. However, being emotional is not a bad thing. Desiring to connect with others is a great thing to want, and it’s wonderful to be sensitive to others needs. "
741,isfj,Yeah I totally relate to you on the being empathetic but being unable to show it. I have few people I know that I can be myself around. I think when we find those people it’s really an awesome feeling. 
742,isfj,"I usually tend to interact more freely with my Thinking friends, but it's real hard to find one that is not loud and brash. With the more Feeler-ly acquaintances I tend to be more formal and polite I guess. It has its ups and downs, and I don't know what to say here other than that. It also involves lots of thoughts that doesn't make sense to others. And awkward eye contact when you look at someone doing something that you shouldn't see. "
743,isfj,"Yeah it definitely is portrayed as a female stereotype. IME male ISFJs don’t really come across that way though and don’t particularly strike me as “feminine”. 
Being a female INTP is similar in that way; it’s described as a quite masculine personality, but I’m not particularly masculine. 
Those are the type of stereotyping traps personality systems fall prey to though, unfortunately. "
744,isfj,"Well I do notice that I tend to have a more developed Thinking function than ISFJ females I know. I even thought I was an ISTJ until I learned the functions. Plus, with Si/Fe I’m pretty aware of what’s apporiate. "
745,isfj,"I've seen a hypothesis that SJs, more than any other type, is prone to take conservative/right-wing views in various degrees of intensity more than any other political world view, and I want to test it out in the real world of ISFJs (i.e. all of you). What do all of you think about  the usefulness/validity/desirability of any of the varieties of conservative thought out there? "
746,isfj,"So I'm pretty sure I just realized we don't have a set of rules in this sub, but just in case, I think it goes without saying that any attacking of others for their political views, or similar behaviour, will not be tolerated.
I don't expect problems in a sub full of ISFJs, but you never know who's lurking!"
747,isfj,"Personally I'm very left wing. I don't believe that conservatism and other such right wing values tend to be in the best interest of a lot of people, although I certainly do see where they would have their applications."
748,isfj,"23 F, definitely more conservative than my friends. I’d say mod-right on a lot of social aspects (except LGBTQ bc I’m not an angry old person). Also very fiscally conservative when it comes to economics, taxation, and things of that nature. My fields of study are Econ and politics, so my bias has not be influenced by my upbringing. I was raised in a modest, apolitical household. I find myself more inclined to support conservative views bc they just appeal to my own moral code I have created thus far. Can’t explain it. Since I was a kid I have always found myself appalled at some things people do in public or perhaps how liberal they can be about their bodies. I tend to be “sexy” but still conservative, if that makes sense. I’m very self-aware of those watching, so perhaps that’s why"
749,isfj,"My parents are very conservative and I didn't really question their views as a child.  I became moderate as a teen, then liberal as an adult.  While I might be considered conservative in my personal choices (traditional gender role, would not want an abortion, respects the law, don't drink/use drugs, religious), I don't feel like others have to make the same choices to be good or moral people.  Also the ""caring for others"" aspect of ISFJs is another big reason liberalism appeals to me.  "
750,isfj,"I tend to think of myself as fairly conservative, though where I live is so ragingly right-wing most people would consider me a liberal. I think the conservative ideals of fiscal responsibility, smaller government, and personal liberty are spot-on. I left the Republican party several years ago as I don't think it represents those values any more. Personally, I think the majority of the right has pretty much jumped the shark at this point. I love the leftist values of compassion and community, I just tend to think those things are better left to the people than to the government."
751,isfj,"I'm liberal. I think something like this could be more influenced by how you grew up than what type you are. However, as you get older if you are interested in politics you can like look into politics more and decide for yourself what side fits more with your beliefs or worldview. "
752,isfj,"Honestly, I know that there's this whole stereotype of SJ's being the conservative ones, but I genuinely think a person's political views are influenced partly by what they grew up around, and partly by what they of course personally believe. Most of my fellow xSFJ friends are liberals, but I'm sure I could find just as many who are conservatives.  Haven't interacted with enough xSTJ's to really say anything about them. I have Fi-using friends who have more conservative views simply because they have conservative parents - half my ISFP friends are ""rebellious liberals,"" and the other half have picked up the views of their parents without truly realizing it.  I do disagree with my INFJ mother sometimes on politics, but that has more to do with me feeling like she brings her theories into the conversation of politics - in general, both of my parents lean toward the liberal side, and I'm absolutely liberal. "
753,isfj,"I was always socially liberal but I became fiscally conservative in high school and even more so in college. It had to do with learning about economics mostly. My parents are conservative but they didn't teach me their views until after I had already formed my own.  Learning sociology is what shifted me to full on liberal.
Though there is a emotional struggle I dealt with regarding my left and right leaning beliefs. I remember a while back there was an infographic comparing left and right beliefs. A section of it was about parenting styles. 
It showed the left wanted self nurturing kids who are open, empathetic, and examines themselves. And parents on the right were shown to want self reliant, disciplined kids with strong morals. It's generalizing but it still hit me. 
Let me find it: https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/left-vs-right-us/
Anyways, so I realized I had started life learning all the parts on the right part of the family structure. I had strict, hard working parents,  who weren't nurturing but pushed me to achieve. But I had to teach myself all the stuff on the left side family structure to build friendships and toward my goals for how I want to parent. Which is a combination of self reliance and also self nurturing. 
And I've found that what I learned is that my ethics, my politics, and my philosophy is all emotionally driven. I wasn't completely convinced by the studies and statistics alone. It's all about how I view myself and my choices in the world and how I feel about the world that allows the studies and statistics to sink in."
754,isfj,Conservatives tend to give more to charity than their liberal counterparts. It’s just that conservatives generally don’t believe it is the role of the government to give charity but rather the individuals’ responsibility. 
755,isfj,There is only 25% ISFJ males. It doesnt make sense at all. If you have 75% isfj females there must be more isfj males. Also there is like lessthan 50% male feelers. It seems like statistics are really not accurate.
756,isfj,"You probably are using Si knowledge right now. How men suppose to talk and how female suppose to talk which might make conclusion that some Si or Sp dudes will believe that they are thinkers and thinker females will believe they are feelers. Si and Sp will lie about it to prevent damage to himself and that's why statistics are often flawed.
Also nobody ever did who actually MBTI pass to other generations. You heard weird stories of SJ parents and NT/NF child."
757,isfj,I’m an ISFJ and I have 2 other ISFJ friends. So far we’re getting along really great. It’s easy to understand and support each other. I don’t feel jealous when my friends help others. But other people might have different experiences.
758,isfj,"Some people says no some people says yes. I think you might really fast progress in this relantionship but It wont be love relantionship. Also some people say same types will heavily compete each other and someone will often be on unconscious or subsonconsius side of his type to actually make thinks running which is tiresome. 
I think I tried dating with ISFJ girl before and It doesnt end well but I heard stories of ISFJs couples."
759,isfj,Just knocking the table to get answers. Numbers are just weird and seems off. There is no any science about how do you pass your mbti type to other generations. Also my inner victim circle that I have love&hate relationship being gay ISFJ male
760,isfj,"The numbers I've seen elsewhere were different. I'm sure it depends on the survey, I don't know truity's standards.

761,isfj,"Well, the past couple of years I've done some serious self-improvement work (mindfulness, self-exposure) and I went from INTJ to ISFx. Pretty sure I've suffered from mild depression and anxiety most of my life but now it's almost gone."
762,isfj,"I may have gone through a depressive (to this day I'm not quite sure what to call it) period where I ended up changing from ESFJ to ISFJ. Not a huge change, I know, but I went from being outgoing and bouncy to everyone to being pretty shy and quiet unless I was with my friends. "
763,isfj,"I know I'm late to this post but I'll be honest - I don't think this is actually possible. The types are supposed to be consistent throughout your life, they're just expressed differently as you get older. Mental illness of course also plays an effect on how your type gets expressed - likely in ways that seem to run counter to what your type actually is. So if you really believe that you've somehow changed types, chances are, you have just always been wrong about your type. The cognitive functions you use and the order you use them in don't just spontaneously change. I've had anxiety and depression for a long time and I never thought I was an ISFJ before, but after understanding how function theory works, I realized that I was in a deep Si-Ti loop the entire time; I was ALWAYS an ISFJ. So I'd advise actually trying to understand the functions and see if there's a combination of them that would work to describe you at both points in your life. "
764,isfj,"This is from the mbti-notes.tumblr.com website in the Function Theory Guide section (I always recommend it because I think it's great, ha ha):
I'm an ESTP (on mobile & haven't flaired yet) and used to type as INTJ all the time because I was in the grip of my inferior Ni a lot."
765,isfj,"I’m 23 & don’t have my shit together.
I’m in my last year of my undergrad & as I’m getting older I can’t keep track like I used to. It’s become very frustrating & clearly I need to try something new. 
I can never stick to a planner & honestly I just end up wasting my money. Recently, I tried an app on my laptop but again never kept up with it.
I’m curious as to how y’all keep your life organized, so I’d appreciate the suggestions 🥰
Thank yoooou"
766,isfj,"At the beginning of each semester, I get a planner and write out all due dates and test dates in my planner to remember. I also put in big events during the semester. Do you have an iPhone you can put reminders in your iPhone to complete tasks? "
767,isfj,"So I put appointment reminders and stuff in my phone so I don't forget. I also have a planner, but don't use it much. I also have a spreadsheet in Google Sheets that details when all my bills are due so that I can keep track of my money."
768,isfj,"I use 4 different things. I say this in my interviews when employers ask about my strengths. I say my “organizational skill”. I use a physical calendar, google calendar on my phone and on my computer, notepad on my computer, and reminders on my iPhone. When something comes up I put it in my google calendar and it gives me notifications. Good luck!"
769,isfj,"I'm an obsessive list maker and I HAVE to write down dates and stuff as soon as they crop up so they can go in my diary, otherwise I totally doublebook.
I just sync everything across devices too - I've lost and broken too many phones to just rely on a lost saved in there that's not backed up."
770,isfj,"Ignore what the descriptions of temperaments say and instead read up on introverted sensing and introverted intuition to reflect on which is what you have. Truth is that we all have both sensing and intuition (the introverted/extraverted attitudes of the two vary, of course), so it's not like being ISFJ automatically means NO FUTURE FOR YOU, and vice-versa for INFJ (damn stereotypes). The functions are more about what energizes you, and it is with that energy that your way of thinking grows and is strengthened toward the different perspectives each cognitive function gives."
771,isfj,"i've 'scored' as an isfj for years and just took the test and it said infj...so i can totally relate...i still feel i'm more of an s than an n most deeply at heart, but i have no qualms with being either, really.  "
772,isfj,"There's a pretty clear difference between INFJ and ISFJ.  Do you feel that you have a personal intuitive framework that you couldn't possibly depict to other people?  Ni is arguably the most difficult to understand function.  
Read here."
773,isfj,"Since no one has explained, I figured I'd try to help (assuming you still haven't decided). The ""personal intuitive framework"" is the system-building aspect of the Ni. You look at a particular thing (be it a decision, a problem, new information) and take it in either as part of a larger structure or by understanding it as a cohesive system in its own right. Si, on the other hand (an ISFJ strength), deals with taking in raw information as data. I tend to relate it to a file cabinet. The reason Si's are stereotypically traditional is that they take in all information like this, often times accepting it as fact or the way it should be. Ni's (especially when paired with a strong Fe function as with INFJs) are stereotypically devoted to some kind of cause.  This is because they are always asking ""how does this fit with a system (Ni framework) that will meet the emotional needs of others (Fe)"". This is not to say that Si's aren't devoted to a cause, but generally not as intensely and not for the same reasons.
Hope this helps!"
774,isfj,"Also, don't ask ""am I an S or an N?"". The answer is ""yes"". The question is ""what kind of S/N do I use?"". ISFJs have Si and Ne, while INFJs have Ni and Se.  Now, both functions may be well developed enough that they are both present relatively equally, or the extroverted function (even though its inferior) may show up more obviously than the introverted one (Which is actually stronger), simply by virtue of its being extroverted. Look over sites that explain the functions and do some good introspection. Happy typing :)"
775,isfj,"I really love ISFJs and think they're wonderful. I would like to have more ISFJs in my life and as my friends. What's the best way to make friends with you guys & are there any specific places that the majority of ISFJs like to go? (Coffee shop, music store, comic store, etc?)"
776,isfj,"I don't know if this has to do with the fact that I am an ISFJ or that I am an English major, but I am almost always in a coffee shop or library. Usually with a book or laptop because I am reading or writing (or on reddit when i should be doing something else). If I'm not alone, I am with one or two other people at most. I don't mind when people talk to me, but I will probably never talk to anyone first. If someone wants to be friends with me it usually helps if they make a definite plan, such as meeting somewhere at a specific time. I don't like when people say ""let's hang out"" because I never know if it is genuine and I don't want to bug anyone. I hope that kind of helps!"
777,isfj,"All of the places you mentioned are places I like to go, but never hang out for long. I usually don't shop unless I'm looking for something specific, so I won't be at a shop for long. I like hanging out at coffee shops but for some reason I often feel out of place staying there for long. Probably just haven't found the right place. You can also add the library to your list. If I lived closer to one I'd probably visit pretty often.
I need to develop a social hobby; most of my time is just spent at work or home. So I never meet new people and people never have a chance to meet me."
778,isfj,"Hmmm the best place to find me when I’m not home 🤔. Most of the time at the grocery store I don’t really go out to coffee shops. Or if not there then out with a few friends at the beach, movies or maybe at the bar. Personally, I like INFPs I have had a sister and friends that are INFPs. I love how deep and empathetic you guys are, I feel like I can be my true self around you guys. "
779,isfj,"as an isfj, i’m pretty easy to pinpoint because I like to be in a public place (definitely a cafe or bookstore or even the mall) just chilling, almost always alone because I hate the idea of wasting someone else’s time with my idea of relaxation. I would love it if someone made it clear they wanted to be my friend. I like easy plans and being asked questions!"
780,isfj,"To make friends with an ISFJ: be someone that I can talk to about anything. Be there for me when I'm burnt out helping everyone else. Text me out of the blue sometime just to see how I'm doing! 
Basically, show me that you genuinely care about my well-being. It might take a little while to reach this point in a friendship; but don't waver, and I'll know that I can trust you with anything."
781,isfj,"I'm exactly the same way. ""We should hang out sometime!"" just seems like a stock pleasantry to me. If you don't make concrete plans with me, I assume you're just being nice. 
My favorite places are libraries, dive bars, and parks (especially dog parks)."
782,isfj,"I think ISFJ's are pretty good on gift-giving (prove that I'm not wrong! ) and I would like to know about what are you planning to give, and to whom! Yes, you are right.. I also want to steal some ideas from you :P"
783,isfj,"Ohh I'm so bad at gift giving haha, I hate it and it scares me... Fortunately my family doesn't care much about gifts, so the only ones I'm giving are stockings I'm gonna crochet for my best friend and her boyfriend. I'm going to buy the yarn today and they're gonna be hideous, it'll be amazing. "
784,isfj,"when i give gifts i cater them to the person i'm giving them to based on their interests and hobbies and whatever. for an artist friend that has a clean and neat home filled with pretty things, i got her a cute metal bird sculpture. for a friend that loves old stuff with history i got him a heavy old school lock and key. iono, stuff like that. give to people based on what they love.
but i stopped giving gifts. those examples are from before. now i give favors and help."
785,isfj,"I have just a couple people I’m shopping for this year , my cousin is really into science and books so I’m going to get him an aquatic eco system from amazon and he’s been talking about ready player one book so I will also be getting him that . I have a co worker who she love sanitizers so I get her a set from bath and body works when they have he annual sale . "
786,isfj,"I keep lists on my phone. Whenever I hear a friend, family, or my SO mention something I put a note in. For instance, every time my SO watched Narcos he mentioned how much he loved Peña’s jackets. So for Christmas I hunted high and low in vintage shops to find a replica leather jacket. Now I just hope it fits! "
787,isfj,"I won't claim that I'm a great gift giver myself. But one of my friends is studying abroad next semester, and I got her for our secret santa thing, so I gave her a scratch off map of the world (where you scratch off every country you've been to) as well as a neck pillow for the long flight ahead of her!"
788,isfj,"Cool! I know how to crochet but only those amigurumi dolls, you know? For that you only need to know how to do a couple of types if stitches. But I never did any clothing item, I don't know if it's more complicated. At least I imagine it takes longer. "
789,isfj,"Ahh yeah it depends on what specifically you're making I guess. For the stockings I just have to plan out the colors I'm gonna use and then it should be fairly straightforward, but I've been crocheting for like a year and I still haven't tried a sweater or anything like that haha. Amigurumi are cool and would probably make great presents, tho! One of my very first projects was an adorable stuffed whale :) "
790,isfj,"friends moved away, parents want my sister to save money so they said that we should all as a family stop giving gifts, and i realize i give a lot to people who depend on me already so there is no need to do anything specific for christmas since i don't celebrate it anyways."
791,isfj,"I've never kept a todo list. I usually keep in mind the things I have to do through the day, although sometimes I get a bit anxious of forgetting about important things if I have to do any and so I start thinking about those all the time to make sure I don't forget.
I often think that having one would help me a lot, for example, apart from the everyday list, I could schedule those things I always say that I want to do but never actually get myself to do because I end up doing the same things every time out of laziness or because I don't want to escape my comfort zone.
Writing down something like a mind map would help me figure out what I want to do by indicating step by step how and when to do what.
I'd like to know, do you keep a To-Do list? If you do, what is it like? Also do you write it down on a paper/notepad or do you use something like a computer/smartphone program?"
792,isfj,"I have... way too many.

One for Games I want to play
One for anime I want to watch
One for Tasks I need to do ASAP
Scheduled weekly/daily Tasks that send me reminders so I dont forget

then a lot of stuff in my head"
793,isfj,"Oh yes! I make to-do lists for even the smallest things.
I keep a physical planner since I'm in school full time and work part time (although it creeps up to full time every once in a while) and need to keep everything organized. I like the one I linked to because on one side I can see my week laid out and on the other I can literally make one huge to-do list for the week.
I like making to-do lists because they help me plan out what I'm going to do and keep me from feeling lost. It also eases my anxiety about forgetting/missing something because everything's in one place that I can reference back to at any time. I like having a physical record so if I get behind I can see all the stuff I haven't crossed off and it's kinda like a kick in the butt to get going.
There's also something to be said about the satisfaction of crossing everything out and knowing that you can relax on your day(s) off."
794,isfj,"Well, I have ADHD (the inattentive type, which used to be called ADD), so my use of to-do lists is definitely on and off. I try to make them when I can remember to, but the thought often just doesn't occur, or I make one and then stop remembering to check it halfway through.
But when I do use them I'll literally just put anything I need to do on them. Need to do my taxes? On the to-do list. Update my resume? On the to-do list. Need to brush my teeth? On the to-do list. Shower? On the to-do list. Having ADHD means I really have a hard time trusting myself to remember to do anything, so even tasks that are habit for most people will end up on my lists. 
I rarely ever get to cross every item off, but having them in writing at least helps keep me on task and will keep an item in my memory for a bit longer than if I let it just bounce around my brain, in which case it would last about 3 seconds :P Also, I usually write them down on paper, because having a physical object is easier for me to remember than having to check an app or something. "
795,isfj,"I usually don't write them out... I have a lot of thoughts in my head about things that need to get done though.
I had to train myself to start making lists & keeping track of everything. I try to put all important events in google calendar and general to-do things on a white board by my front door."
796,isfj,"I used to never keep to-do lists, but then I had a kid. I became so stressed when trying to remember all the things that I needed to do or remember, and being sleep deprived and pre-occupied with an infant made it impossible to remember. Now I have lists upon lists, haha! I have my Wunderlist categorized and sub-categorized with short-term goals, long-term goals, grocery lists, and things to watch, read, buy, or remember. I have a physical planner for my daily tasks (whose laundry to run, what's for dinner each night, appointments, errands, etc.). Then I also have a whiteboard on the fridge with food items I need to buy either at Costco or the grocery store, and I update that as we run out of things in the kitchen.
Essentially, my lists are my life, and without them I'd fall apart. :D"
797,isfj,"i write down a list but i never need to look back at it - i just remember what it is. i just write it down to get it out my brain and focus on something else :D. my lists tend to just be what i want done, never in the order i want them done, so it's just an orderly mess :D but like i say, i never actually look back at it."
798,isfj,"I only do it if I have a lot to keep up with, say a lot of errands to do. I'll make a list and order it by location of the stop to make it as efficient as possible. I prefer pen and paper, but I've used the memo on my phone in a pinch."
799,isfj,"I’d like to think I’m pretty athletic. I’m the best at sports that require hand eye coordination like ping pong, tennis, spikeball and golf. Just wondering if Hand eye coordination or athleticism is common among isfj’s"
800,isfj,"I am 0% athletic lol. I try to be more active, but in my heart I'm a total couch potato, and I'm generally terrible at sports. I played some when I was a kid, but I have no team spirit and prefer to do my own thing and make my own schedule, so I didn't stick with them for long. :P "
801,isfj,"Absolutely not at all hahaha. My build naturally lends itself well to things like hiking and aerobics (somehow I'm better at hiking naturally than a lot of people I've biked with who've been training), but I have garbage stamina for pretty much anything. I have practically no muscle mass (or any mass for that matter), don't play sports, and never exercise for the sake of exercise. I bike for my commute and hike s couple times a year, and that's it. Exercise is hard hahaha :P "
802,isfj,"i try to be active. i do weightlifting with cardio 3-4 times a week and just started taking boxing classes once a week.
in the past i practiced nunchucks regularly, did some kung fu, and also played a lot dance dance revolution.
but i wouldn't say i'm naturally athletic or have good hand eye coordination. i'd say i have really slow reflexes and poor understanding of what my body is doing. i'm just willing to try really hard to improve them in different ways.
though maybe my perspective on this topic is skewed? maybe my hand eye coordination is good and i just see everything as earned and worked for from nothing?"
803,isfj,"I consider myself pretty good at sports. When I was little I played a lot of football, then I did also some swimming and athletics too. The worst part about sports for me was having to compete, it made me super nervous each time and hated it. 
Now I only do yoga once or twice a week and it's a lot more rewarding in terms of mental sanity haha"
804,isfj,"I'd say that I'm fairly active. I try to go hiking every week (I average about 6 miles), and I like to go kayaking as well. Sometimes I play beach volleyball with friends, but I've never really been one for competitive sports."
805,isfj,"My isfj  husband loves basketball, hockey, baseball, badminton, and excelled in volleyball. He kind of thrived on the competition, but only when it wasn't taken too seriously. 
Me on the other hand, I clam up when it comes to competition. But I do love taking our ball and gloves to the park or having a good rally, and I found when I was younger I've got good footwork so we enjoy taking my nieces and nephews out to play soccer. If I applied myself, I'd probably be a lot better. I mostly avoided team sports because of the competition aspect, but now regret it."
806,isfj,"I got into crossfit and weightlifting this past year and I absolutely love it. Going to the gym is my favorite part of the day, and I love researching different techniques and ways I can improve. Before this year, I considered myself a non-athletic type, but something about weightlifting just clicks with me"

808,isfj,"Hello everyone! I do hope I am not being redundant with this post. Since this is my first time on this subreddit, I wouldn't know haha.
I am an ENFP writer and I am hoping to have some assistance with a project that I may end up writing about, depending on my results. Recently, I was pondering whether or not individuals would have similar movie preferences as those who identify with the same Myers-Briggs personality type, and I decided to look into it further. If you all are interested in contributing, please list your top 3-5 favorite films, and you can even add a short description elaborating on your decision (this is not required). There are no wrong answers to this, just have fun with it!
Thank you in advance. I look forward to reading everyone's comments :) "
809,isfj,"Hi, I am sort of a lurker on this subreddit. Had an interest in mbti for years, but had trouble identifying correct type but I feel ISFJ clicks. Haha anyway here are some movies I enjoy:
The Grand Budapest Hotel
Howl's Moving Castle
Silver Linings Playbook
The Big Lebowski
Forrest Gump"
810,isfj,"1: American History X
2: The Shawshank Redemption
3: Requiem for a Dream
4: Schindlers List
5: Undisputed 2/3
Number 1-4 are movies which really changed my view on some topics and left me speechless on the credits
Number 5 are just really good fighting movies"
811,isfj,"pan's labyrinth: beautiful and haunting film about rebellion and disobedience. i cried at the end.
spanglish: movie where i get to see a bunch of characters feel authentic and like real people and how their conflicts build up. also i have a soft spot for cooking and movies about what it means to be a parent.
dark knight: blew my mind on what a movie could be like.  it was intense. and i love how strongly you can get the characters' motivations and how they conflict. movie left me breathless.
chef: movie about cooking, father/son relationship, trying to find passion and direction. it's everything i love in a movie.
catch me if you can: kid growing up dealing with problems in relationship with parents. love the characters and their interesting way their motivations conflict."
812,isfj,"
Powder
The Dark Knight
Wonder Woman 
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story
V for Vendetta

Was somewhat difficult to come up with five. I have a lot of famous movies that I've not seen. There's a lot of movies I love. To me though, I would describe all of these as perfect movies. Rogue One is the only Star Wars universe movie that I've really loved. It also happens to be the first movie I saw in theaters with my fiance, but it would make this last even with that aspect aside.
Edit: Changed #5 and updated description"
813,isfj,"Looking at my top 3, it seems I have a thing for the Heroic archetype movies. In no particular order:
Pacific Rim
Kingdom of Heaven
Serenity 
I don't watch a whole lot of movies, but when people ask those are the three I usually default to"
814,isfj,"1.Star Wars Ep 3 Revenge of the Sith
2.Star Wars Ep 1 Phantom MEnace
3.Dragon Ball Z Resurrection of F
4.Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods
5.Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone
As you can tell I'm very attached to a few series and have odd taste"
815,isfj,"Hello there. I must say I'm a skeptic when it comes to this. I think there's no consistent correlation between MBTI and taste in movies. You must also keep in mind you are on reddit, so what you'll get on this survey is the taste of several ISFJ redditors (not indicative of ISFJ population in general). 
My prediction is that you won't get significantly different movies than the ones reddit posts in ""what's the best movie ever"" threads. I can already see that pattern in the few replies you've got so far (nothing wrong with those movies, just pointing it out). To throw this off a bit, here's my list:

The White Ribbon (Haneke)
Ordet (Dreyer)
Inherent Vice (Anderson)
Werckmeister Harmonies (Tarr)
Amarcord (Fellini)

This is rather random, I can't precisely say which are my absolute top five - if you ask me in a month, I'd probably say other movies (while not feeling less enthusiastic about this list here). You could probably relate some of these to ISFJ stereotypes: Amarcord deals with recalling childhood memories, Inherent Vice has undertones of nostalgia and difficulty to let go and move on, Ordet is about faith and love of the others (not a believer myself, but it's such an emotionally powerful film), and all of them have beautiful cinematography. But I feel this would be a wrong approach."
816,isfj,"My top two favorite films are My Neighbor Totoro and the Nightmare before Christmas - the first because it's artistic, peaceful, and calming (I find most of Studio Ghibli's films to be like this), and the Nightmare Before Christmas because it's strange and charming. 
I'm not sure if listing shows counts or not, but I'll go ahead and cite Zankyou no Terror/Terror in Resonance, because the plot moves along well, it's dark, and it's emotional. I also love Durarara!! because you get to know the characters and their situations, and see how everything and everyone connects. "
817,isfj,"It's difficult to choose but let's see (no specific order of preference):

the hateful eight. 

I like everything that tarantino does, usually because his plots are really intricate to the point of absurd. Love the dialogues and the detail he has photographically speaking. I enjoyed this movie a lot because almost all the film takes place in a little cabin, where all the actors appears frequently in scene and therefore they seem to be acting continuously, like it happens in a theater play. 

The handmaiden

Korean film from park chan wook director. I enjoyed everything, the plot, the acting, the photography. It's a story of love and revenge with an unexpected development. Sometimes subtle, sometimes transgressive. I also enjoyed the symbolism. 

La vita e bella

Wonderful movie of a (hilarious) father that protects his son from the reality of world war II. Sad/tender/warm. Impossible not to cry :'(

Wild tales 

A compilation of stories where people show the worst of them out of frustration and anger. I like that I can empathize with their feelings in that situation, but the ways they decide to act is priceless. 

Mad max (new one) 

Two words: Tom Hardy."
818,isfj,"I've started to get into MBTI recently, and I posted on the MBTI subreddit asking for help with typing, and the people there typed me as ISFJ. link to that thread. 
Note: I'm only 16 and male so that probably doesn't help the case.
But thinking about it more, I'm not so sure if I am. I'm not very organized at all, and tend to lose things fairly often. I enjoy interacting with new people all the time, even though I'm not very good at it. Also, when I think about it, I hate being completely alone, and I definitely don't fit the description of an introvert where you would need to ""recharge"" after interaction. Many of my friends describe me as more extroverted as well so IDK. I tend to talk about myself alot, so I have to remind myself to include others in conversation as well. I have no clue about how I feel about conflict tho, i seem to cause alot of it :/. I'm kind of impatient as well when to comes to more selfish things, but if I'm helping others I can wait forever. 
Despite all of this, I can definitely relate to alot of the top posts on this subreddit and can see the sides of me that are ISFJ. I do feel left out sometimes among a group of friends, where I feel as if I just don't fit in. I definitely feel more comfortable with friends than I am at home with family. Positive reinforcement is super important to me, and I can get pretty down if I don't get any for a while. Lastly, I tend to feel like I'm always bothering people, so I tend to use ""sorry to bother you but..."" and if they're doing something ""oh, sorry I won't bother you then."" Oh yea, and I'm the biggest procrastinator ever(definitely not procrastinating math homework rn).
If there are any questions that I can answer to help to type myself, please ask them. 
Thanks for reading, and sorry for the long post.
Edit: Taking tests on websites I've gotten ISFJ on keys2cognition, ENFJ on typeinmind, and INTP and INFP on 16personalities, which I don't really like. The questions feel like they can be influenced by your mood so easily."
819,isfj,"Are you mentally organized? Can you recall specific memories easily? That's the kind of organized I am, but god forbid you ask me to keep a room clean.
When I ""recharge"" it's not always completely alone. Sometimes, for me, being completely alone is still with my boyfriend or my best friend. "
820,isfj,"I wouldn’t worry about it too much. I think that the 16 types are just basic outlines, the same goes for any other personality profile. We’re just more complex than that. I think there can definitely be people who are combinations both. If you’re trying to discover who you really are, pay attention to how you act think and feel. Add the parts of the personality profiles that apply to you to make your own new description of...well you.  Feel free to add in some of your own insights.  Self discovery is a journey, not a destination. So, again, my advice, don’t worry about fitting into a single group. Just be yourself! Hope this helps! :)"
821,isfj,"I can recall specific memories pretty easily, especially if they're pleasant/intriguing/terrifying. And i feel exactly the same with my room and binders. And again, I've never really felt that I've had to ""recharge"" ever, maybe that's cause I'm generally energetic if i get a good amount of sleep but idk"
822,isfj,"I am an ENFP teen who is close online friends with an ISFJ woman. She struggles with depression and anxiety, and it affects every area of her life. When an issue comes up, she shuts everyone out and insists on being alone. Sometimes she will allow me to talk to her and try to help her out, but usually I can't do much to help. A few days ago she suddenly posted, ""I can't deal with anything right now... I'm sorry."" and shut everyone out with no other explanation. She means a lot to me, and it hurts to see her so broken. I don't know what to do; no matter what I say she holds on to such a pessimistic view of life. How can I reach my ISFJ friend?"
823,isfj,"Just remind her you are there if she wants to talk. And remind her you care about her and want to help.
There have been a few posts on how best to help/connect to ISFJs and it often just comes down to letting us know you are there no matter. A lot of times I think I am too crazy for most people to handle, but I still wish someone could handle me haha."
824,isfj,"I was able to talk to her, and she was willing to open up to me. I'm not always sure how to comfort her, though, especially if it's a relationship problem that I can't help fix. Will letting her know I'm there for her be enough?"
825,isfj,"I've been talking to an ISFJ. We never started officially dating, but we were really into each other and had a great connection. 
During a conversation it came out that I had cheated on a former partner. This happened 10 years ago. However, he (ISFJ), was cheated on and my confession raised a red flag. We've been back and forth the past few days. I could tell he was bothered by it, he was barely talking to me, and twice cancelled plans we'd made to see each other. 
Today he told he doesn't want to continue talking. I tried to make him see that the past me isn't the same as the current me, but he couldn't be swayed. 
Is there anything I can do to help him realize that I'm not a cheater and that he can trust me? "
826,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I don't think I would be comfortable dating somebody who cheated in the past. Especially if I had been cheated on in the past.
I understand that people can sometimes change, but in my experience, it's more likely that people will repeat their old behaviors and mistakes. I'm not saying that's the case for you, but it is the case for most people. 
I'm a very firm believer in the quote ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.""
For most ISFJs, cheating is one of the worst things you can do in a relationship, and most of us tend to really value fidelity. We're also usually pretty cautious people. I personally am not likely to pursue a relationship with a person unless I feel that they're ""safe"", and that I can trust them to be loyal and not hurt me.
I applaud you for being honest about your past, but I don't think you should count on a relationship with him. Maybe he'll make an exception and give you a chance, but even then, it's likely he would have quite a wall up until you earned his trust, which might be difficult. "
827,isfj,"It's likely over. Since an ISFJ's trust is so tough to earn, if it's broken they can take it very, very hard and internalize it for years if not decades. Sounds like you opened an old wound, and it sounds like he's not willing to take another chance on being hurt again."
828,isfj,"Tbh, I don't even like the idea of people cheating on tests much less their significant others. So I can see the conundrum he is in. If I knew the person well enough, I might be biased enough in their favor.
I think honestly it's just best to praise yourself for being honest, and move on. If you want, maybe reach out to him again in a week and see how he feels but other than that I think it would be best not to badger him. Everyone is allowed to have their own deal-breakers."
829,isfj,"sounds like the scar and pain of his past never fully healed. i don't know what you can do about it if he makes up his mind though. you can only do something if he's willing to try. but the fear of hurt could be suuper strong.
best i got is if you can convince him via explaining what changed, what you learned, what you regret, etc. and if it vibes well in a way that dulls his specific fears, maybe you got a chance, maybe."
830,isfj,"Personally, when I go into a relationship, I'm really serious about it and if I hear that the other person has cheated on the past, I'm gonna feel like that person isn't worth committing to and would be a waste of my time. Try lying next time :P"
831,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I'd like to add the following.
We ISFJs are (dominant) sensors, we use the past as a giant database. Plus as extraverted feelers, we :
_collect information about others' feelings and about their ways to handle them
_but are not very real-time conscious of our own feelings, and not very good at channeling them.
Plus most of us ISFJs seem to take love, and constancy & honesty, veeery deeply and veeery seriously.
So, having experienced to be cheated on (personally, or seing that on relatives) for an ISFJ, makes the fact that a person has ever cheated, a VERY VERY STRONG turn-off , we sort of can't help feel that at heart as a burning red flag alert, you see.
I've been cheated on several times, and this is the hardest thing most ISFJs seem to be able to deal with. Which we probably are liable to face more than some other types (because of our special ability to be used as doormats, you'll be able to find an abundant literature about that and about the reasons for that). That's what makes us very cautious about ability to cheat in potential partners (and not only for me-ISFJ).
So I understand anyone, specially ISFJ, who (maybe despite any try to avoid judging others on their past) would not fully trust ability of forming a lifetime relationship (which is quite a criteria for romantic relationship for a high amount of us ISFJs...) from a person who has cheated in the past. Yes it may be foolish, but yes it contravenes a major root of ISFJ personality system. So even once, and even 10 years ago...
I fully understand what grylliade says : ""Since an ISFJ's trust is so tough to earn, if it's broken they can take it very, very hard and internalize it for years if not decades. Sounds like you opened an old wound, and it sounds like he's not willing to take another chance on being hurt again"", and what icanteatoxtailsoup says there: ""he's also allowed to decide that this territory is too painful for him"".
Yes, I firmly believe that what you did 10 years ago does not necessarily make the essential of who you are today - fortunately for all of us   :-) -, and at the same time I'd have a hard time ignoring this, this is just about the core of who I am. I guess I could ignore it, but it would take time and patience (from me and from a potential having-cheated-in-the-past partner) to build, eer... ""extra trust"" ?  :-)
I truly applause you for being that  honest, and if this man sincerely deserves your interest, yes I believe he should overcome your 10-years-ago-cheating and at least give you a chance, if you sincerely regret it and could not imagine yourself doing that again. Otherwise I agree this could be immaturity from him. 
Or firm prudence, which I also, sadly, understand. 
So I kind of understand both of you, even if I don't even imagine me cheating. Ever. In any situation.
Finally I share with I_prefer_chartreuse not everything about their post but, the fact that the decision is now his call, and if he does not give you a chance, you have to move on, with some kindness on yourself.
I'd suggest you to write him a kind and thoughtful letter/e-mail, if you feel he's worth that try, and that it could be of some use on the right path.
Wishing you the best,
PY"
832,isfj,"This happened ten years ago and he's flipping out? And nothing cheating wise is going on in the present, with this current relationship?  Honey, this isn't a trait of a personality type, this is immaturity and assholery. We all make mistakes, and yes, the past is the past. Sounds like he needs more relationship experience. And needs to grow up."
833,isfj,"ISxJs have extremely low risk tolerance (at least when it comes to matters in their focus; they can be surprisingly careless about other things they don't think much of).
At any rate, I should mention that ISFJ/INFJ is a horrible romantic pairing (why would they even be attracted??) - each has the other's dominant function as their ""demon"" (8th), leading to profound, infuriating friction when together too much.
But of course, it's unlikely that you've typed yourselves correctly anyhow; so the point is moot."
834,isfj,"This. You're allowed to forgive yourself for the cheating, you're allowed to be kind to yourself about the fact that you were honest and it ended badly, and you're allowed to want a relationship where your past mistakes won't be held over you, but he's also allowed to decide that this territory is too painful for him. "
835,isfj,Exactly. I've had 2 healthy long term relationships (3 yrs and 4 yrs) since then and there was no infidelity. But that didn't matter to him. I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks that the present should outweigh the past! 
836,isfj,"Having been in this position as well, I would advise you to give him his space rather than try to convince him you're not a cheater. You should never ever grovel in a good relationship, or feel like you have to grovel. You've done nothing wrong, and there is nothing for which you need to apologize.
He is going to have to come to the conclusion that either you are worth it and that the past is done, or that he can't deal and will leave you. But he needs to be responsible for his own feelings and make his own decision. The onus is on him. 
Lastly, if any man can't deal with the past, and makes you feel like this, then honestly I doubt that they will make a solid partner for you. You never have to explain your past decisions or past partners. A mature, secure man will not throw a hissy fit about this stuff. (Most of reddit is not mature men.)
Internet hugs, stranger! "
837,isfj,"It helps to understand the theory in depth, rather than simply taking the unreliable self-tests and reading vaguely written profiles (there's better, if you know where to look).
I suspect the disinclination would be disproportionate, actually. INFJs are all about growth, depth, nuance (Ni). They are thoroughly disgusted when they see people become complacent, clinging to the past, unwilling to grow; whereas ISxJs are all about maintaining and perpetuating the past. I also imagine they'd also find an ISFJ's lack of inclination or capacity for nuance very annoying; SJs prefer the discrete and explicit; whereas...

Lenore Thomson, Personality Type: An Owner's Manual

This would be a source of great frustration to the ISxJ, who has great difficulty with inference - and of course the INFJ. ISFJs love kitsch; INFJs hate it. ISFJs love revisiting the past again and again; INFJs would get sick of that. INFJs love getting abstract and metaphysical; ISFJs can't (though they might want to).
INFJs need a partner they can respect; and they wouldn't get that from an ISFJ.
~
What seems to be a good rule of thumb, is to match the first two ""letters"" (vital), and ideally also differ on the latter. ISFPs love ISTJs; INFJs collect INTPs, etc. The (a)symmetries are complementary.
Of course, you can make any relationship work. Type compatibility (and maturity!) just appears to be the most important factor."
838,isfj,"You're welcome. And I don't mean to be all DTMFA. Just know that you deserve better treatment. And who knows, he might come around and realize that you are an awesome person and all this is just silly."
839,isfj,"Hi I have a really awesome ISFJ friend who I feel a strong connection to...as friends but potentially more?
He has moments where he'll come to talk to me about certain important things in his life - but only if I've already been talking to him.  He rarely initiates the conversation. As an ENFP it's quite frustrating because all I want is to talk about everything all the time, but I understand he's not always in the mood to talk or on his phone.
Should I give him space to allow him to talk to me first sometimes or just continue initiating because that's who I am (and he should maybe accept that)?
And one more question - why so mysterious? Do you guys need complete trust to be who are with a person?"
840,isfj,"yeah we are really private, and I only give out personal stuff to people I trust completely. and if it were me, I would like you to continue initiating with me. if you find this annoying(us not taking initative) then tell them. if they care about you they will listen to what you say, and try to to take it into consideration. give them time. 
I think you need to be somewhere in between, tell them that it would be good if they also took initative to talk to you sometimes, and that you would really appericate it. but also continue taking initative. Be open about it!:) 
I hope it will go your way!  "
841,isfj,"A lot of my friends have to be the ones to initiate conversation, and they understand that I'll reply when I feel up to it. Sometimes that's a few seconds, sometimes it's three days. I don't see any harm in continuing to initiate conversation!
(Also yes, we're private about a lot of things, but most ISFJs are easy to talk to about non-personal matters!)"
842,isfj,"My friends have to initiate conversation with me too. 9 times out of 10 I appreciate this, but I am easily overwhelmed by daily conversation; if I don’t have anything to say, I won’t force it. Be sure to leave him time for himself. We introverts really appreciate that. ;)"
843,isfj,"ask him about it. if my friend asked me why i don’t initiate conversations, i would try to text him more often. 
i personally like it when my friends are the first ones to text or call me, so you should continue being yourself and initiating the conversation. don’t worry if he doesn’t initiate the conversation, because he still cares about you. he just might be doing something else or might not be in the mood. 
and i trust my friends, it’s just that i am not always comfortable sharing my strong opinions or feelings with them. but i’ve told some of my friends A LOT about myself because i know they will not judge me and because they’re genuinely interested."
844,isfj,We normally talk about pretty casual things with no context to any deeper meaning but he’s been sort of opening up which is nice. But being an ENFP I’m just always curious and wanting to know more. I will give some space for him though :)
845,isfj,"I'm supposed to be sitting with some new people at lunch tomorrow.  I can't think of any topics to discuss - tomorrow is Monday, so we'll all be returning from spring break.  People say to ask others about themselves, but I don't specifically know what I should say.  I'm supposed to be switching from group to group for the rest of the week, and I'm hoping that the people I sit with won't start to find me annoying."
846,isfj,"oooo i know the struggle
for now you gotta settle for small talk but from now on try to notice more things around you that you think could make a funny story (haha kinda like a reporter)
i swear having those archived at the back of my mind saved me so many awkward moments. it even made me more talkative because i have like this array of topics to talk about. "
847,isfj,"Hope im not too late. Just ask them about themselves and actively listen. Dont talk unless they ask. Just keep asking. If they dont talk, talk about your dog or your cat or whatever until they pipe up. From there, begin asking."
848,isfj,"I usually talk to him about the usual - how things are going for him, what he's been up to, how has he been, etc. not much else happens in terms of conversation unless he has something to say or tell me, or if we're doing something together."
849,isfj,"With my best friend ISFP we often talk about fitness because me and him tries to lose weight. We talk mostly food,fitness, music because we both like it, girls, old classmates from highschool. He often talks about cars. We sometimes watch tv together or play video games. We like travel. I engage him to visit other cities with him. I couple of times hit him with my inferior Fi/dominant Fe function and I was always scared of results. I am not sure if he can understand my feels. He just went full SP answer with that. 
Yeah ISFJ male and ISFP male. Two feeler men together. Full homo case."
850,isfj,"Make them speak up, ask questions about them or something about them, be interested in them and listen actively.. but I'd also say ..go with the flow, OP :) Try to relax in the moment and feel comfortable by yourself, and remember that it's okay if you stay silent and run out of words too.. and let yourself go with the flow.. Don't worry, and have a nice time!"
851,isfj,"As an ISFJ myself, I have certainly had a tough time acclimating to any one job as a result of being so particular about things. I'm starting to think there's no end to my need to have things done a certain way which seems to me to be the logical way, but not always the way others want done. 
There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of good careees for us besides psychologists and radio announcers - both of which are very freelance and independant type jobs, with minimal tangible evidence of the hard work and a lot of verbal evidence. 
What are some jobs that are best-suited for ISFJs in contrast to jobs for others? 
(Also, I've been giving podcasting some thought, but I'm afraid that might just be setting myself up for failure?) "
852,isfj,"I like having projects and being able to become an expert in matter that has specific rules. I always read about ISFJ doing work that requires compassion but that sounds absolutely draining to me. I already take care of my family. I need some time where I’m not having to mother the world. 
I’m an HRIS Specialist. (Human Resources Information System.). It deals with maintaining data, configuring the system, working on integrations. It’s fantastic. I get assigned puzzles like... create a security policy that that captures this group of people and give them access to view x on this group of people but not on y group. "
853,isfj,"Way late to answer here, but I’ve been in auto repair for almost 20 years. It tends to be detail oriented for the most part, helpful and validating because at a base level because as long as it’s a business that deals with the general public? Odds are fair that you are helping someone and they actually do usually appreciate it. 
Also you are theoretically left on your own for a good deal of the work day. The money isn’t bad if you’re good at it, either, that’s always a career positive. Maybe not the answer you were looking for, but I hope it added a different perspective. :)"
854,isfj,"I fond that (as an ISFJ), I work best in restaurants. “Fast-casual” is my favorite. Management is great because you get your alone time for paperwork, inventory, etc., and the teams are usually smaller/more intimate, so you get to form those close-ish relationships. You still have to put on your best face for the guests but the balance is good!! 
Also, logistics is good. I’m currently working on a team and since we’re great workers, I get a mix of being a stocker, backroom team member, and cashier when necessary. These are good bc you have an assigned task to do- something to complete, you know, and get to take breaks in that (we can get caught up) by helping guests! 
-I really like making someone’s day!
(I always wanted to be a teacher for young children !) 
Hope this helps!! "
855,isfj,"Becoming an expert in your role would do wonders for your confidence. ISFJs tend to be hard workers. I get plenty of acknowledgment about my efforts and that drives me to become more knowledgeable so that I can be relied on.
It’s going to take time but as you leave the bad people behind and start making goals for yourself and accomplishing them you get to the point that you look back and see you’ve overcome and grown. And that YOU did it and you’ll stop believing you should feel shame. "
856,isfj,"These days it seems like if you're not an expert right off the bat in most jobs, you are let go even after being trained if possible. It seems to me I can't show very much vulnerability or weakness by not knowing something. 
I don't have any friends but 1 person at the moment. "
857,isfj,"I've been thinking about this more lately because I'm getting increasingly more bothered by it. I love to listen and learn more about people but lately I've been too far on the listening side. I enjoy listening but when the person continuously interrupts or never gives me a chance to talk I lose interest pretty fast. It hurts my feelings because I can listen for a long time but I want to be heard as well. I think of talking as a give and take, I expect to be given the same respect and attention I gave them. When I talk about something I want to be acknowledged because it's not often that I have a lot to say.  Just because I enjoy listening doesn't mean I enjoy being talked over, interrupted or told the same story repeatedly. 
I've only just started saying when I've been interrupted and that I'd like to finish what I was saying. I was wondering if other ISFJ's can relate to what I'm saying. I encounter this issue most often with my INFP boyfriend (or other males). Men do typically talk more that women so if there are other ISFJ females with similar situations I'd like to know how you cope or assert yourself better."
858,isfj,"I'm engaged to an INFJ and he is great about making me feel heard. He feels the same way I do about wanting to listen and be heard in return. I don't think the trick is learning to assert yourself, but to surround yourself with polite people who want to listen to you and be heard in return. Those people can make you feel better about yourself and make you feel like you matter so you can have the confidence to assert yourself in other situations. Good luck!"
859,isfj,"INTP here, SO is ISFJ. I have the total opposite experience, where ISFJ talks on and on, and can't hear me because any lull in conversation (which I need for thinking) means that mentally my SO has moved on to thinking about the list of tasks to be done."
860,isfj,"I have been in your same position -- the whole ""When I talk about something I want to be acknowledged because it's not often that I have a lot to say"" is a big deal to me. I hardly ever try to speak up, so when I do -- I really want to be heard. All I can say is try explaining it to the people around you. Well, I'm definitely not forward enough to share that with a random person. But after being hurt a few times in conversations with my boyfriend (INTJ), I explained to him how I felt and why and he understood and has gotten a lot better at listening to me when I start to say something.
In other cases, all I really do is smile and nod politely. It's too much work to try to get people to listen sometimes, so I will put on a very polite face while thinking of everything I want to say and then I will rant about it to my boyfriend later while he nods understandingly and affirms my side haha."
861,isfj,":-)
Thread makes me smile because it seems to be often the case with ISFJ (but more generally speaking, with most low-assertivity introverts).
Probably happens worse when being a woman (which is not my case), because of sexist major trend throughout the world.
I guess we ISFJ, happen to often interrupt persons once we're launched on a topic we're passionate about.
I suggest you would go on thinking about tools (and looking on the Internet for e.g. introvert tricks to work on that, or more generally topics on ""being more assertive"") to help you being more balanced with that issue.
Working on being less passive-aggressive, which is a classical trait in ISFJ personalities, may also help.
Training yourself to talk louder, to have more assertive gestures/postures/attitudes (apart from having ""in mind"" the intention to be more assertive) could be of some help as well.
Don't know if that helps, even if I'm a man ?   :-)
I wish you the best."
862,isfj,"My housemate is INFP, I find that she's way more quiet that I am. When I'm comfortable, I love talking, but I also love hearing other people's stories and listening to them talk. I find listening more relaxing, and I tend to talk more when I'm excited. 
When I think someone is talking a lot I tend to relate the topic back to something that has happened to me or someone I know in the past (typical ISFJ haha). Alternatively, I may try to change the conversation into a topic that I am able to converse a bit more about (Ne). "
863,isfj,The only known interaction I have with an INFJ is my dad and it's some of the most enjoyable discussion and probably my best and closest relationship to date.  But I do think you're right about surrounding myself with those kinds of people. I shouldn't have to ask to be properly listened to. I'm just in a situation where I need to talk to the person about the issue and see if they understand and can make an effort to change.
864,isfj,"It's often a case indeed ha. These are all great tips though, definitely plenty for me to work on doing so I don't feel like I'm being walked over. Talking louder and being assertive are going to be my main focuses, and the passive-aggression I can build up without even thinking about it. Thank you, it helps when you're understanding and offer good advice. I appreciate it c:"
865,isfj,"Very much so. I dislike puns and slapstick, so my humor is mostly running with absurd premises. 
I play DnD with a bunch of NTs and it can often be a problem. I love to suggest patently ridiculous/disturbing solutions to problems and I get shouted down with considerable frequency. I don’t care I love it
E: Function-wise, I’ve read this is inferior Ne. :)"
866,isfj,"I love morbid humor and pushing the boundaries of someone's comfort with me. I guess ""off-the-wall"" might need to be a bit more defined but I find that I offer the most relaxed, off-the-wall comments when high. Otherwise I tend to overthink what I'm saying and if they'll appreciate the humor or not. "
867,isfj,"Took me a moment from what you meant by ""off the wall"" humor, but the humor of the absurd is my absolute favorite. Dark humor's good too.
another thing I'd like to add is unlike the top commentor, i love slapstick humor. I can't get enough of cartoons, especially tom and jerry, that involve slapstick humor. Good stuff. "
868,isfj,"I love all sorts of humoooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.
​
But my funny nature comes out at odd times.. like when I'm deflecting, or when I'm sad, when I'm unwell, the ""rueful"" wry humor.. and mostly at home.. I'm really funny at home.. :)
​
Also, do you guys use humor and make jokes when pissed with loved ones? I do that a lot!
​
EDIT - I do that thing too, willingly making silly or ridiculous suggestions to problems or questions :p "
869,isfj,"When I said off the wall comments I mean saying silly comments to get a reaction out of the person. Usually when this happened, the other person start saying off the wall shit. Majority of the time it becomes a clusterfuck of goofness. Lol."
870,isfj,"He will never admit this, but I don't think he can feed himself without me around:3 
I'm married to my best friend, and what I would consider the complete opposite of me. I'm very,very proud of my husband and he does things (runs a business), and it's something I don't know if I will ever be able to do. 
I'd just like to say ""hello""! You guys are amazing, and it's astounding how similar I find that we are. 
It took me a long time to really love my personality type ""out loud"". I found it strange to be so different from my husband, who I always felt we were so similar in ways. Now I embrace it:) It's a wonderful personality to have, and those that have received gifts from me might say the same;) jkjk
Anyway, I thought I should say ""hello"", sorry for the rambling. :) "
871,isfj,"Hey! I have a big crush on a ISFJ girl!
I love you guys! I’m just wayy too shy to make any moves, I need help!
She’s at my university and I need help!
I know her decent, I talk to her sometimes, I helped her with a subject. She is just so nice.
You are all just really loving people.
She removed her insta photo’s and I told her that they looked beautiful and why’d she remove them? And said “I couldn’t stand my own face”. She removed her account 2 times and then she made a new one again after some time haha
She’s weird but so cool.
She has a lot of stress with study and in general. She told me I looked pretty. I read somewhere that ISFJ’s repress their feelings and that way won’t ever tell someone the truth.
However she told me some time ago about her anxiety and that it goes better now, and about that she has some small form of depression. She told me that she only told this to her best friend and no one else except you (so me) now.
I’m flattered and I have no clue if she likes me or not and I’m just scared that when I do something she will just be like no sorry and I would feel so shit afterwards.
If you want a more fuller story I could give you that! :)"
872,isfj,"I'm an INFP guy and have an ISFJ girlfriend so I may be able to help a little. Relationships take a lot of trust. I would say that I would go on with the relationship for awhile and then stop every two or three weeks and question whether or not I wanted to keep going. She had a much higher bar than me at the beginning but once she committed she stayed committed.
If she is sharing things with you that she has only shared with one other person, then there must be some level of trust on her end. If you see a possibility of a good relationship with her, I would recommend asking her about it. It's scary and takes some vulnerability but if it ends in a good relationship then it's 100% worth it!
I know INFP and ISFJ aren't usually a recommended match but I've found it to work very well for me. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them."
873,isfj,"I have a couple of INFP friends and my ex is an INFP!
I'd say, just be yourself.. we can be a little messy, worried, have a low confidence, be too sensitive.. just make sure you  are a comfortable presence, are emotionally availabl - which I don't think I must tell an INFP! :) ..and take things slow, but steady :)
What else would you like to know?"
874,isfj,Are you sure she is an ISFJ? How to make ISFJ like you is make them comfortable and give information or good experience as you can. I am an ISFJ girl and have INFP best friend. The problem is sometimes INFP can't tell what is on their mind cuz FI hero is very lowkey to tell what they feel and don't want anybody to feel bad. Just be open to her and tell or initiate that you like her :)
875,isfj,"Information can be anything. Is like telling what you like, what you experience, what you see, what you feel or ask what she likes. This would make an ISFJ comfortable cuz SI hero always thought about past experience.
Yeah i know it is hard for INFP cuz Fi hero is not an open person. But that's the challenge. As an isfj, sometimes i got sad and disappointed to my best friend INFP cuz she didn't gave many of her stories. Communication is the key.
Do you know 5 love languages? ISFJ most likely to have words of affirmation primary love languages. 
But infp most likely to have act of service love language. But for me, i really don't need help. I just feel comfortable with deep conversation rather than got help by someone else.
But idk about her primary love language. Maybe she have different love lang. But isfj is mostly have words of affirmation love language rather than act of service."
876,isfj,"It’s hard to for me to tell her that I like her, I have no idea how!! And yea I got her to do the test and she got ISFJ. Could it work out ISFJ and INFP?
If you could give me some tips :)
I helped her with a subject at her study, she told me that she needed help. Is that what you mean with giving information? We had a great time"
877,isfj,"You don't have outright tell her that you like her; just ask if she would like to spend time with you the next time you talk (or text her if you get too nervous), i.e. ask her if she wants to have dinner with you sometime or get coffee."
878,isfj,"ISFJs are Si Doms. That means we are constantly doing mental comparisons between present and past to see if anything has changed. This makes us great at remembering important facts and putting them to practical use. We also tend to be great at noticing discrepancies in our environment. We tend to find comfort in routine and structure because the past is meaningful to us. One of the misconceptions about Si is that it lives completely in the past. On the contray, Si Doms use their past experiences to form future forecasts about what might happen and plan accordingly. We have more difficulty dealing with sudden changes because we can't compare this to past data (Inferior Ne).
​
INFJs are Ni Doms. This means they are taking in conscious and unconscious information tinkering with it in their minds and creating a vision about what could happen. They are more attracted to philosophy (ISFJs can enjoy philosophy too but we would need to see the application of it, INFJs don't require this) and purely theoretical avenues. They distrust the past and pretty much live in the future. This is why they have difficulty living in the current moment and taking action in the immediate environment (Inferior Se). 
​
Both types use Auxilary Fe so both types will be polite and compassionate and focused on maintaining harmony in their environment. Both types will absorb outer emotions like a sponge. Both types enjoy having good relationships with friends and family. Both types when healthy will try to make decisions about what will maintaining harmony and try to produce positive results for the people involved. 
​
Both types will develop and enjoy using Teritary Ti later in life. This mainfests in wanting to have a logical basis for personal decisions. Also, in analyzing and researching information about our interests.

879,isfj,"Here is my go-to comparison of Si vs Ni with bonus analysis of how/why the mbti community mischaracterizes both. [deleted] did their homework and uses Jung as their primary source. I personally think it’s the best Si vs. Ni description you can find on reddit. 
“As other users have noted, there are quite a few ISFJ's (and INFP's) mistyped as INFJ's. I've been asked in a few comments / messages to describe the differences, so I wanted to create a post.
Si & Ni Similarities:
Both can be ""in their heads"" (and often are! It's core to both functions)
Both can operate in the unconscious (and do! Again, this is core to the definition of both)
Both can read between the lines and derive insights (including ""a ha"" moments)
Both can have ""gut feelings,"" and develop subjective understanding
Both can think abstractly on occasion
Both can go against tradition, convention on occasion
Both can have imperfect memories or miss details on occasion
Both can plan for the future (and in fact, many SJ's highly enjoy doing so!)
Si & Ni Differences:
Si pertains to ""the real world"" (even when they're making insights or thinking)
Ni is directly at odds with it
""What does that mean??""
Well, it doesn't just mean being ""in our head"" or ""drawing conclusions"" - that's VERY fundamental to both types
The real question is what it's regarding / a result of / in relation, and what their core drive / value / focus is
Si prefers concrete and familiar - even though they can absolutely draw insights, abstract, and think, the core drive of ""concrete,"" ""familiar,"" and/or ""stable,"" etc. is fundamental to their life (some Si's identify with different words)
Ni doesn't. They don't care. Rather, they need and want abstract (not just ""thinking"" or ""insights"") as a core value
What Si isn't:
Always traditional or conventional - they often are, but don't have to be!
Always past-oriented or have great memories - often, but not always!
Always literal, or unable to abstract, be insightful, creative, etc. - they absolutely can!
Always detailed - they're humans too, and can miss things
What Ni isn't:
Just being ""in our head,"" ""thinking,"" or ""detached"" - this describes most introverted types
""Si 2.0"" or ""the best of both worlds"" - Ni-doms fundamentally don't care about the core Si values and strengths
Something we ""back into"" simply because we ""don't identify fully with Si"" (Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)
Something defined by occasionally thinking abstractly or having insights (see above: Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)
According to Jung:
Si perceives something with ""all its qualities, its intensity, its transient course, the nature of its origin and disappearance in their every detail""
Ni, on the other hand, ""obtains either no knowledge at all or at the best a very inadequate awareness"" of the thing at hand; in fact, their ""chief repression"" is ""sensation of the object"" (note: this goes further than ""being unaware of our surroundings"")
Si: absolutely perceives unconsciously, but still regards ""the object"" or ""image"" (comes from and/or ties back to real life or things they've experienced/read/seen/etc, even if not in front of them at the time)
Ni: has a ""remarkable indifference"" to “anything outside their unconscious pursuit” (note: this isn't just ""being in our head;"" this is an overarching abstraction or vision for life or consciousness) including the real world, and live in the unconscious ""without establishing any connection between the phenomenon and himself"" (which is not just being ""in our head,"" ""thinking,"" or introversion)
Si is often characterized by ""calmness,"" ""rational self-control,"" and ""well-intentioned neutrality... striving to soothe and adjust.""
Ni on the other hand, doesn't care about ""tangible reality"" and makes no such adjustments, rendering his himself ""unadapted to the actual present-day reality."" (and again: this is not just ""being introverted"")
""I still don't get it...""
Leave a comment or PM me
Why do we mistype?
The #1 reason: we're not good at self-perception. We all see ourselves a bit inaccurately, and skew perception
The tests are almost always wrong
The type and function language and definitions are confusing
We all see a little bit of ourselves in all of the functions / types
We may extrapolate a few examples of a function (i.e., insights, abstract) into meaning we're that type
We don't identify with everything about a function/type description (especially stereotypes, many of which are wrong)
We compare ourselves to the ""stereotype"" rather than users/types in real life
We unknowingly comparing ourselves to real-life Si's rather than Ni's (i.e., ""I'm not like A, so I must be B"" or ""I'm more X than A, so I must be B"" rather than ""I am B."") Ni-dom's are ~3% ofpeople whereas Si users are ~46% (Si-dom's, ISxJ, specifically are 25%; S's overall are 75%.) So we're often finding comparing and small differentiations against S's rather than N's
On a cursory read, we may simply like the idea of N over S (without understanding the downsides of N, or the fact that it directly contradicts some S drives/values/needs)
What can we do?
The opposite of everything above.
Be self-aware, open, honesty about what we value / do most - avoid confirmation bias and really explore other types
Don't go off of test results
Learn about the functions, how they work together, what each values and what each doesn't
Understand we can all exhibit something from each type on occasion
Avoid cherry-picking examples as proof of a function; we live and breathe our dominant function
Understand that we don't have to identify 100% with the description (especially bad stereotypes!)
Understand Si's in real life, rather than the Si stereotype / archetype
Understand (actual) Ni's in real life (but be aware: many people are mistyped)
Understand the weaknesses, blind spots, values for each type (incl Ni) and be honest about your real values/needs
I have explored whether I am an Si-dom with seriousness - I hired a certified MBTI coach to help me filter this, explicitly telling her I could be Si-dom
The best resource is a very well-read MBTI coach. I hired two different ones, one of whom was ""certified,"" to help me confirm my type. There was no test - it was all conversational. Both walked me through typing as Ni-dom.
That aside? Well-read MBTI nerds who aren't basing understandings off of stereotypes, mistypes, and bad information”

880,isfj,"ISFJs are very practical, organized, caring, and help out with a lot of things for their love ones
INFJs are also organized, caring, and organized, but they are extremely future-oriented, and has high intuition
Both are perfectionist, sensitive, and likes to hang out with their friends and family(ambrivert). "
881,isfj,"I was going to be a little annoyed about your mention of how ISFJs would need a practical application to enjoy philosophy but actually you’re totally right lol, I love ethics but despise the “what if it’s all a dream??” type of philosophy. I definitely have an “it doesn’t change anything, so who cares?” attitude towards that kind of thing. 
Anyway, I like this explanation! It helps me make sense of Ni a bit more, and I think it’s a pretty good explanation of Si, too. "
882,isfj,"You hit the nail on the head. I am an INFJ with only one friend which is an ISFJ. I know that he is a really good friend and I truly know he will be there if i needed him. But the Si dom sometimes grinds my gears. Maybe he is an unhealthy ISFJ, always worrying about the future and it seems like he is always stressed. "
883,isfj,"Hello fellow ISFJ person!
I just wanted to point out that i really like your account name, Verndari. I am Icelandic and Verndari means protector in our language! Very appropriate name for our type! Are you Icelandic? "
884,isfj,"Yep, ISxJs can definitely worry too much about the future. I speak from experience being an ISFJ myself. However, as a Enneagram 9w1 I do worry sometimes but have a good faith that things will workout. I wonder if he could be a 6 cause I know Enneagram 6s have a high levels of stress. I imagine an ISFJ 6 could behave like your friend. "
885,isfj,"ESTJ's and I always mesh well.  We don't often end up being close friends, but that's primarily because my ""close friends' (as in my friend group,) have always consisted, mostly, of xSxP's.  I know a lot of people in the MBTI community dislike ESTJ's, but I always work well with them - I understand their intentions and what they want to happen, so I try to follow-through as best as I can.  ESTJ's never really intimidate me, they seem to understand how to deal with me and I appreciate that."
886,isfj,"Not a romantic relationship, but one of my friends is an ESTJ! He is really light-hearted and funny. I have a great time with him. I am really open with him because he doesn't take advice or criticism the wrong way. I appreciate how direct and honest he is. He has taught me a lot about football, shaped the music I listen to, and helped me expand my social circle. He's changed a lot since I first met him. At first he was awkward, but now he is popular and has tons of friends. He is constantly up-to-date with what his friends are doing and often talks to me about them. He has done many kind things for me, like reminding me when homework is due, inviting me to parties, helping me plan out projects, helping me carry stuff, helping me be healthier, sending me memes, and keeping me up with the tea. He is super aware of everyone's physical location. It's mind-blowing and I don't understand how he does it. We can be talking on the bus when he suddenly blurts out, ""Hey, look inside of that car! It's Bob from my English class."" He points out random stuff all of the time and has a really good eye for what's going on. When we are walking down the halls and he remembers everybody's name and says hi to them. He is also good at remembering time and wears a smartwatch everyday. He'll say, ""The bus came to school two minutes earlier today"" or ""I saw your Snapchat streak and we went to sleep at the exact same time, 11:24!"" He has a really bad memory for conversations, forgetting what we talked about a couple of hours ago and constantly telling me the same story twice. I don't mind though because I'm really interested in his stories. I wish he would talk to me more about his feelings. He doesn't comprehend when I get a mood swing and go from being happy to sad. He mostly stays in a single mood throughout the entire day. It'd also be cool if he knew what he wanted. The stereotypical ESTJ is a leader and knows exactly what they want. But whenever I ask him, ""What do you want to do right now?"" or ""Where do you want to go?"" he has no clue, so it's up to me to come up with something. Other than that, we're good friends and I really appreciate him and everything he has done for me. "
887,isfj,"We're all human so at heart we're naturally selfish beings.
However, when we do (or think of doing) something we want to do that would be at the expense of someone else in some way (even if it's minor as wanting to eat something when other people want to eat something else) does anyone else here feel bad?"
888,isfj,"Yes, but in a slightly different way. My kids are college graduate ages (adults but in age only, lol). They're still dependents but they're working. But, for example, whenever I go out to dinner with friends or my SO my kids always end up popping into my head making me feel guilty for eating a nice meal. It's not that they wouldn't want me to, that's just the way I think. It's even harder to order dessert. But oftentimes I do anyway but I still feel guilty for having something and not sharing it with them. Same with buying things like new clothes or shoes. Besides the fact I absolutely detest shopping, I find it even harder to buying something like a new pair of jeans when I know they could use new clothes, too. I don't know. I'm just weird."
889,isfj,"Yes. 
I have started going to therapy and I like to ask her if my feelings were justified -- because I pretty much never feel that my negative feelings towards others are justified and instead feel like I should be angry at myself instead of x.
Best of luck to you. We are allowed to be selfish. We just need to allow ourselves to not feel bad... something I still haven't mastered."
890,isfj,"I don't, but if someone else talks about it, I start feeling guilty that I didn't think of that too. I have to stay away from a lot of posts and threads about customer behaviour, for example, because people there feel guilty about things that I never thought twice about when I actually worked customer service (speaking up about problems, choosing not to chat with an employee when tired, even taking ""too long"" to put their change away), and after a while their anxiety and guilt starts to overwrite my own experience. I start feeling like a hard bitch for doing things that I never, ever expected my own customers to feel bad about."
891,isfj,"I used to feel guilty a lot more than I do now that I'm older. I mostly give others first choice in choosing what to eat but if they want me to choose then I will with no guilt. Then they'll complain about their food and still no guilt. I'm grateful, guilt is exhausting."
892,isfj,"Inspired by the thread asking if you listen to music that fits your mood, I thought, what music do you guys even listen to? To get the ball rolling, I'll go first:
I listen to a lot of EDM, specifically the Future Bass category. It is fairly hard to describe, but if you join us over at /r/futurebass you would get a better sense of the kind of music that I listen to. Currently, I'm listening to one of the sets they posted.
I also like alternative music, like Neutral Milk Hotel
/ramble
So what music do you all like?"
893,isfj,"Like superange128, I go for instrumental. But I'm into a lot to be honest. My music taste is picky, and often when I find a song I like, I try to find others EXACCTTLLLYYY like it. Video game music, movie soundtracks and relaxing music.
My boyfriend describes my taste as meditative. Or like intuitive to how I feel. Reflects my mood."
894,isfj,"Honestly I listen to a bit of everything, I don't like to get bored and I need lots of music to suit my mood and it's also nice to relate to it as well. Can't say a certain genre takes the lead but I'll give a variety of examples. 80's, punk, folk punk, metal, old school hip hop, some classic blues (patsy cline, anne murray), alternative, gothic, industrial, techno, etc. So many sub-genres too. As some others have said, I'm really not too picky and will give most music a chance."
895,isfj,"I tend to focus on certain songs I hear that I really enjoy, rather than a certain type, if that makes sense.
Some of my favorites, listed with the song that made me love them.

Genesis by Grimes
Wild World by Cat Stevens
Special Place by Infected Mushroom
The Girl and the Robot by Royksopp
Violet by Hole
Heart Cooks Brain (and many others) by Modest Mouse [I almost never listen to them now, but a few years ago they were all I listened to almost... I was depressed back then I think, wish I would have gone to a therapist.]
Sensual Seduction by Snoop
Empty by the Cranberries
I'm God by Clam Casino
I Will Buy You A New Life by Everclear
Jumper by Third Eye Blind
Fashion! by Lady Gaga [basically her whole Artpop album, but I've never listened to her other albums]
Got You (Where I Want You) by The Flys
Get Low by Dillon Francis/DJ Snake [one of the first trap songs I heard, and what got me really into it. I've also started raving haha.]

I'm sure there are some I'm forgetting, but these are a lot already haha."
896,isfj,"I used to listen to a lot more music that was without vocals, but I notice now that a majority of music has vocals now. Times change your tastes I guess.
What's your favorite video game track? I don't listen to it at all to be honest, but I know a lot of games are often applauded for their soundtrack, so it sounds interesting!"
897,isfj,"I know this feeling completely. I used to look for songs by song names on Pandora, and would cycle through the same 10 songs incessantly.
I used to listen to more meditative music too, but I transitioned away from that, now I love more pumped up tracks. Still love movie soundtrack though. Enough about me though, what song reflects your current mood now?"
898,isfj,"Not familiar with any of those categories except hip hop, and even then my experience with HH is limited, sorry :P
You can never listen to too much music! What is a category you listen to that you think no one else knows of?"
899,isfj,"Hey!
I'm same as you mostly. I think I have one or two particular songs I get an urge to listen to for each emotion/feeling I have currently. And it's a huge variety, because it depends on how I feel emotionally connected to the song. And I'm constantly adding different songs to each list, if it fits the mood correctly. It sounds kinda weird when I type it out like that haha."
900,isfj,"Hmm.. Current mood right now..
I'm gunna have to go with this right now. Don't know why, but I'm in a mellow, content and happy kind of mood, ya know? xD What about you, got a song that reflects your mood?"
901,isfj,"My mood? Uh.... tired? It's 1 AM right now XD
I have been listening to this remix of Drunk in Love by The Weeknd. It's very calm and restrained, although I will say I am not drunk in love right now, unfortunately."
902,isfj,"Hello! Please solve me, the human riddle These are my facts, who am i? (You tell me because i have no idea except for the facts that im probably a Fe user and a introvert)
A couple weeks ago i smelt a specific smell and i imidiately remembered that it was the exact same smell as the one in a playhouse i played in once when i was 10.
When doing things i sometimes get what i can only describe as flashbacks to how i did it the last time or a memory of me doing something similiar
I can sometimes remember completely random things from years back but overall have pretty bad memory
I sometimes just know what my family members or close friends will say before they say it. Example: My mother: didn't you want to do a... Me: moodboard We hadn't talked about it in over 6 months and our conversation beforehand had nothing to do with the topic And once when my mother told me a story about when she went to visit a friend and i just knew that the story would end with her friends dog jumping into my mothers car (That sort of things does not happen that often) but i can often finish peoples sentences or know what people will say next without knowing the exact words they'll use
I have a big tendency to forget to eat when im in the middle of some intresting project, and am not really in touch with my bodily needs and rarely feel sensations such as hunger, sleepiness, thirst etc.
When i am bored i have a big tendency to over eat
It was only at the age of 16 that i started noticing smells often, when i was younger i always thought that i just had a really poor sense of smell, but apparently not. I also never consider other peoples bodily needs because of it (them being cold, hungry, thirsty etc)
i am very absentminded. I often walk into a room and forgot why i went there in the first place, put toast in the toaster and forget that i did, the same with tea. It can also be music playing  without me noticing.All because im always in my head thinking about something else.
I often get annoyed when people never get to the point in conversation but just give loads of useless details
I've always been very curious and asked loads of questions as a child Why does your nails get blue when your cold? If jesus died for our sins can we just sin as much as we want? How does rice grow? On bushes? Individualy?
Im fairly good at noticing change. Like if someine has gotten a new haircut, if some trees has been cut down since last time i visited a place etc
When laying in bed at night i tend to have a thousand ideas and other things pop into my head
I am a big procrastinator and work in bursts on energy instead of a consistent planned flow
I am not at all a creature of habit and is very inconsistent in my routines. I can decide that I'll start doing something everyday and two days later ill abandon it. Another example is deciding a theme for home decor and then changing my mind because suddenly having loads of palm trees inside seems so much better than strict minimalism! (lol)
I am very messy
I also do not enjoy following a strict sceduale but instead tend to plan roughly improvise as i go I often get accused of trying to reinvent the wheel because im coming up with new and better ways to do things
My way of making desicions (for example if im going to buy a shirt or not) read all the facts, think about do i have enough money for this? Will i use it? Can i use it often? What other things will i have to sacrifice by spending money on this? How much do i like it? And then i just go with the gut. Though i pretty often make irrational decisitions based on emotions
I have a wierd relationship with feelings. Sometimes im super emotional and can really empathise with anyone, the next i can't sympathise with anyone and consider the feeling of myself and others lame and overly dramatic. I also tend to feel a bit disconnected from my feelings sometimes, like my body is crying but on the inside im just wondering what the heck im doing
I am very good at being Fe style appropriate as i don't like fighting with people, i also sometimes tend to cry during harsh discussions (that's emberassing for me to admit)
I enjoy discussing topics such as philosophy and politics, things you really have to discuss and think about unlike talking about that camping trip your friend took last weekend or your new hairstyle. Though i am fully capable of talking about such things
I will always step into the leader position if it's available, and can be quite dominating at times. I am also very competitive, but only compete if i think i can win.
I hate smalltalk
Sorry for the messy post!
Thanks for trying to help me out!"
903,isfj,"This is a perfect example of the function Si, or Introverted Sensing, which involves personal memories and feelings towards one's own history. Reading over your post, you provide a few definite examples of using Si, and consequently of definitely NOT using Se which would be being active and engaged in the present moment. I also agree that you are definitely an Fe user based on feeling disconnect with your own feelings more so than disconnect with others. Si and Fe are the two dominant functions of ISFJs, so that's probably your type! (I'm a semi-lurker INFP myself haha but welcome!)
INFJs would also use Fe but are dominated by a function called Ni, which I'm honestly terrible at describing because I don't have it myself, but it involves synthesizing knowledge/observations into one conclusion, or starting with many ideas and ending up with one idea. It is the opposite of Ne, which would be used by an ISFJ, to start with one idea and explore all the possibilities related to that idea, or starting with one idea and ending up with many. So your identification, or lack thereof, with either of those functions (Ni vs. Ne) could be a hint as well as to what type you are.
I recommend you look up some good descriptions of the Si function to clarify/confirm, but I think you will relate to it based on your post :) Hope this helps!"
904,isfj,"You have just described me better than I have ever described myself. But to add to it, often i'm slow at doing a task. As it has to be done right but if it's boring I go off into my own little world for a minute or two without even realising. Does this happen to you?
I did the test and was laughing at the description it gave of ISFJ as it was so much like me."
905,isfj,"Right, Ni at it's simplest is advanced pattern matching - we're constantly taking inputs from the world, from what people write and what people say, and as /u/eyes_on_the_sky mentioned, matching it with other things and arriving at a reason or conclusion. It's one of the reasons we're good at being a counsellor type and I often hear either ""I never thought of it that way"" or ""that totally makes sense now"" when talking with people in that manner. 
The trick is, for us it happens somewhat automatically, which means that we might not be able to easily walk someone down the rabbit trail of the logic path to get there, but it feels just as concrete (and it's probably right when examined closely). 
Know that this especially comes into play in truth detection - if what is said or written doesn't match the Official Record(tm), we may be marking anything else you say or do as tainted when it matters or in that area until cleared up."
906,isfj,"So just like the title, what's your SO's type?
What is the biggest weakness and biggest strength?
I am dating an INTJ and our biggest weakness seems to be miscommunication (not understanding each other immediately but having to describe things multiple times before the other understands) while our biggest benefit seems to come from us being ""enigmas"" to each other and thus being able to give each other a totally different perspective on different issues + just generally teach each other different ways of seeing the same issue. I am always amazed by how much my boyfriend will delve into a problem/question he is interested in whereas I just would've left it to be and not have ever looked into it.
I will ask him in a bit for his input on what he thinks is our biggest strength/weakness. 

Boyfriend response:"
907,isfj,"A bit late to the game but here goes:
I'm an ISFJ and SO is a INFP
Been together for over a year and have lived together almost as long.
In my eyes we go together very well, we are the same level of lazy and talk things out calmly even if we don't agree with each other. We also share some of the same hobbies and don't mind going along with the hobbies that we don't share.
-- Funny thing just happened: I just asked my SO this question and his first answer was lazy :D
We do the best we can to show our feelings for one another and we both accept that what I see as affection may not represent affection for him and vice-versa so we try to adapt.
At this moment I don't see much weakness in our relationship but I do imagine that if we aren't careful we could concentrate too much on what the other wants and kind put our own needs aside."
908,isfj,"My husband is an ENTJ, life is interesting to say the least. We just celebrated 9 years, so we have made it work, but it is not easy. We are both motivated people, just in different ways. We do balance each other. "
909,isfj,"Hubby is an INTJ as well. Miscommunication is definitely our biggest problem. Just today, I made a comment that I thought hurt his feelings. I dwelt on it all day, asking multiple times if he was ok, and apologizing again. He said he was fine, which as an INTJ, meant that he was fine.
Biggest strength? We have opposing viewpoints on just about everything,  so hopefully our kids will turn out well rounded individuals! "
910,isfj,"My boyfriend's the ISFJ. I'm an EN/SFP :) 
Strength-wise, it's probably that I'm good at coaxing him out of his shell in a gentle, non-aggressive way. I bring him out without being pushy. Also, as one of the more introverted types of extroverts, I appreciate his need for alone time. We balance each other well!
Negatives? Sometimes I need too much attention. :p Also, I love to socialize, which is sometimes too much for him. Also also, I don't always openly express my feelings, so it can be hard to tell if I'm genuinely happy."
911,isfj,"My SO is an ENTP... we are complete opposites :') we make a great team though, our friends are always telling us we're the best couple around. We do misunderstand each other sometimes and when we get into arguments they seem to last forever. But we always reach a compromise eventually ;) "
912,isfj,"I'm an INTJ just passing through trying to learn about my ISFJ girlfriend. I don't think we have any substantial issues - especially not around communication. We’re very honest with eachother.
My biggest “problem” with her is that she’s very wishy washy about her future. She works in a cupcake spot making just above minimum wage, where I’m an upper-income earner and have long plans into the future. I’m trying to convince her to find better work that offers a career, but she’s having a hard time envisioning a career or field she wants to pursue. Her degree is in psychology, she’s a hobby artist, and she just otherwise prefers to spend social time with her friends and family. She has no particular interest in owning a business or anything income-wise really. She applied recently to be a side-walk ambassador, which is another low income job with no future. It’s sort of frustrating, but I’m also being patient – I think she’ll figure it out, she’s just taking time to do so. 
It also helps that she’s not into contemporary affairs, politics or philosophy at all, where I’m steeped into those topics. She told me recently that she was worried that she’s not enough of an intellectual for me, but I really enjoy not having to defend my well-researched ideas. There’s nothing more annoying than dating someone who is both stubborn and ignorant – she’s open minded and carefree – that’s why I like her. "
913,isfj,"Well looks like I'm a good bit later, but I suppose I'll respond anyway. I'm actually an INTP dating one of you guys. It's been going great though I'm not sure how to put it into terms of positives and negatives. We've never argued about anything. We legitimately agree on any important issue so it's not really a problem. The VERY few disagreements we have had are on subjects that don't matter at all or are just a matter of opinion and so I just don't argue. Figure doesn't matter to me so may as well do things her way and make her happy :) anyway, all I can say is it's definitely the best and most serious relationship I've been in."
914,isfj,"My to be husband is an ENTJ. Or types are ""novelties"" to each other. We are both very happy in our relationship and hope to have many happy years together. 
Our biggest strength is being able to adjust for each other's types. For example him being extroverted he loves to be around people a lot more then I do being an ISFJ. So I can adjust to going out more often for him and he in return lets me have a quite evening at home with just him and me. Our biggest weakness is miscommunication with me sometimes thinking what he says has a second meaning, but of course for an ENTJ when they say something that is really what they mean. "
915,isfj,"A lot more ISFJs (in this subreddit at least) date INTJs than I would've imagined. I think it's pretty interesting since we are supposedly ""enigmas"" to each other (because of our totally different cognitive functions/order).
I guess opposites do attract, haha."
916,isfj,"How long have you been dating? My honesty with my boyfriend has skyrocketed now that I am more comfortable with him. In the beginning I would keep a lot of stuff to myself just because I was not ready to share it yet. Now our big issues are miscommunications -- not that we do not talk but that we just interpret what each person says differently... so we think we are on the same page but find out down the road we both thought the other meant something different.
As for her future... Well, this is how I feel about the future: Scared. It's a huge uncertainty that I cannot pre-plan for, so I try not to think about it all too much because it just increases my anxiety. I know I should just take things into my hands and make the future I want happen, but I don't even know what I want yet! And I'm graduating college this June and just thinking about staying at the job I work now because I don't know what else I want to do with my life.
I can relate to her lack of interest in owning a business/income-wise... As it is, I don't want to be amazing -- I just want to be normal, an average Jane. I don't actually want to do great things (which, my mom being an INTJ + a doctor is finally accepting... there was lots of pressure on me to be a scientist or lawyer, and still is -- but I'm just not interested). Someone has to be the small man and do the less prestigious jobs... why can't I want to be someone like that? We don't need to have big plans for the future, just the security of doing something to keep us afloat, I guess.
Also, my boyfriend is a bit like you. I have expressed a few times my fears that I am not intellectually satisfying enough for him but he told me not to worry and that it's nice not having to argue with me but that I just listen to what he says (because I know he knows more). However, he does encourage ""debates"" every now and then, where a question is asked and we both hash out our reasoning for thinking what we do... (ex: I think professional sports players are paid too much, we had a debate on our viewpoints of it). However, when we do have these debates, I have to keep in mind he is not attacking my views but rather just trying to figure out my reasoning. I also will let him know when I just need a break from it because it's becoming too mentally exhausting for me. It's very against my ""no confrontations"" ideal, because it almost feels like a confrontation... But I'm working on it.
It's interesting to hear another perspective of an INTJ-ISFJ relationship. Have you both looked into cognitive functions and how each of you have opposite functions and opposite order? My boyfriend and I have done so extensively which has helped us to understand each other a lot more."
917,isfj,"We've been dating for 4 months. Our conversations stay pretty light hearted, if I wanted to debate someone I'd go to one of my ISTJ on INTP friends for a really good argument. I go to my girlfriend to relax, be at ease, and fuck a lot. I would recommend you throw your boyfriend a bone and kick his ass out to a philosophy meetup group or whatever he's into (I go to computer security meetups). He'll be hesitant to go at first, but incredibly happy like a puppy once he's been because he'll exercise his intellectual might with other (no offense) worthy debate gladiators. 
My GF and I have never really ""debated"" anything, we both compromise too easy on small things in life, and she goes with the flow (without me being pushy) on big things. Sometimes I'll ask her why she feels the way she does about something, and I just accept if she doesn't have a profound explanation. She'll often ask me to explain complex political/economic things or current events. 
Our very first date we established that we wanted to be completely honest with each other, and this has helped our communication a lot. I don't hide anything from her, which has led to some complications because I'm polyamorous and only the second dude she's ever dated (and she's 27, I'm 30 and a playboy who loves chasing women). So, being a polyamorous person, crystal clear communication is critical - it's fundamental to communicate well. A couple weeks ago I slipped up and slept with another women, I told my GF about it right away, she was pissed at first, but we worked through it in less than 24 hours.
We haven't needed to review or talk about cognitive functions because our communication is so strong. She's only loosely interested in this whole MBTI thing that I'm fascinated by. "
918,isfj,Alright no idea whats the best way to explain my situation but i will try my best. I am 20 years old and until like 6 month ago i exactly knew what i was going to work. It was all planed and i was ok with to go this way. But then in the last months or year its hard to tell I fell like I have overcome my puperty and can finally think straight. And with this clear mind my behaivor and my goals changed and I have no idea what i want to work. The only thing i know is that i want to work/help people. I would thankfull if you people could tell if you have experienced something familiar. And what helped you in this situation.
919,isfj,"Don't worry, you are still young! Also you can join your interests with previous thoughts maybe? For example at the very moment (I am 22 for a couple of days) I would like to code mobile apps that could help people in various ways. :) 
Try out different things, don't attach too much to any, and see what fits best for you. Being 20 years old you still have many possibilities waiting to be discovered. You may change your profession at 30s, who knows what the life brings for you :D 
I keep my fingers crossed for finding something that makes you happy and fulfilled!"
920,isfj,"I'm 22 and a college dropout and only just now figured out that I think I wanna be an editor lol. It's pretty normal to take a while into your 20s or 30s to figure out what you really wanna do as a career I think, or even to never figure it out at all. But I realized that's what I think I wanna do by doing it for free, helping out friends with their writing and whatnot. "
921,isfj,"No way, I've also been learning to build mobile iPhone apps! Just recently, I realized that since I'm an isfj, maybe I could build apps to help others somehow.  Been trying to come up with some good ideas for the past couple days"
922,isfj,"Let's not do any lying here. 20s - sure. 30s - you failed really bad and don't have much time or even much choices at this point.
edit: Ehmm... I really did not want to upset anybody. Of course some people find their calling later in life, but... why encourage it for young people? Young people should make decisions now, not postpone them until they are less capable in all respects (that is the definition of age, unless we are speaking about money or status - all else wanes fast)."
923,isfj,"When I was in college studying veterinary medicine we had a couple of people in class that were above 30, one of them was 42! He had previously studied tourism but it seems his real dream job was to be a vet. He achieved it with better grades than a lot of us. I am just saying that  is possible to restructure your life even if you are older to do what you truly want. I don't think not knowing what to do exactly with your life is ""failing really bad"", it's a bit extreme.
I agree is not the usual thing and also think that given the case, you have to work in something else to sustain yourself while you figure it out. "
924,isfj,"You must be aware that people have different definitions of success. Sure, if you want to get rich or be really good in a demanding field, starting in your 30s diminishes your chances at success. For most people though (and I would say most ISFJs), having a job with decent pay and dedicating your time to your family is good enough. This is entirely achievable in your 30s."
925,isfj,"Seriously lol.....? A huge number of people live 40, 50, 60+ more years beyond their 30s. Sure you need some type of job by then to keep yourself afloat, but you don't have to have your dream career figured out, which is what I was speaking to. A job and a career are different things. "
926,isfj,"I disagree. If you don't know what to do with your life 20 years after school at 37 or something... how are you not a failure? I am not talking about women having career outside family. Family is a reasonable and admirable ""thing you want to do with your life"".
Stop this mollycoddling, our lewd culture encourages too much self-love and infantilism way past the point of reasonable concerns. Are people who fuck it all up and then bring it back together at 50? SURE THERE IS! But we don't need to encourage more of these people.
You don't think this is empathetic? How about letting people ruin lives? Is that more empathetic or just makes you feel better?"
927,isfj,"Okay, so you think that I'm unkind for suggesting that it's okay not to know yet, and that it's ""lewd mollycoddling"" to not judge and shame people for not knowing their dream career at 25. I think it's narrow minded and borderline irrational to hold people to such an arbitrary standard that's based entirely on your own opinion and probably a lot of unevaluated biases from your culture and environment growing up. I'm content to agree to disagree if you are. "
928,isfj,"I've been getting into the functional side of MBTI to get a better understanding, because I think people are really biased about themselves so I don't trust my own judgment. I checked out the mbtitypeme subreddit and they think I might actually be an ISFJ or ISFP. In the past, I have only typed INFJ and INFP. I took an MBTI test in school and got INFP, but sometimes I think its really easy to assign yourself the wrong type.
I will say, I think ISFP is less likely because they sounds more ""graceful"" and aware of their surrounding than I am. They sound really great and interesting, but I think I wish I had their qualities more so than actually having them. I really like creative types and artists.
I thought it might be easiest to come here to have a chat with you all about ISFJ-ness, because it never occurred to me that I might be this type. I've always felt out of place/sorts in American society, and that doesn't seem very ISFJ at all based on the surface description. If anything, I would think ISFJs would feel more at ease fitting in in social situations in society than I do. My impression of the states is that its a very SJ culture, and I've always felt and intense sense of not being a part of it. Almost like being in the wrong plane of existence, if that makes sense. Not trying to make assumptions so much as give my general impression.
I'm going to say that I am more than likely not an INFJ or and ISFP, because I see a lot of Si in myself. I would love to be either, but I don't think I am.
Have any of you mistyped INFP before? What would you say differentiates you from an INFP?
I admittedly don't know a lot about what it means to be ISFJ, so I apologize if I said anything that plays into annoying stereotypes/etc.
Better yet: If any of you would like to message back and forth, I've been collecting MBTI pen pals. I'm not always the best at messaging back immediately, but I've really enjoyed getting to know everyone and learn about other countries/cultures through them."
929,isfj,"I used to mistype as INFP constantly when doing the 16personalities test, and I've had numerous friends do the same. I only learned my true type when I started researching functions. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but I think the test might put too much weight on regular human things (daydreaming, creativity etc) being INFP."
930,isfj,"You might want to look at the so-called ""romance styles"" of the types. 
ISFJs (along with all SJs) are representatives of the ""caring"" group:
SP types make up the ""aggressors"":
And NPs are from the ""childlike"" group:"
931,isfj,"I mistyped as infj because the most common isfj descriptions make us sound dumb, shallow, and completely dull. Who would want to identify with that? 
I found better descriptions, and explanations of the functions and I recognized myself as an isfj. Still don’t like to interact with much of the mbti community because of the misunderstanding. "
932,isfj,"So I took the test when I was 23 and I got INFP. Recently I read an article of INFP traits and was like ""this aint me."" I am 28 now and I retook the test a few times this morning and I got ISFJ-T so looks like I am switching over here. "
933,isfj,"Thanks for the reply!
As a follow up question: Was there anything that was a dead give-away to you that you tested wrong? I always thought going form intuitive to sensing seemed like a really big jump, but maybe its not as big as I thought. "
934,isfj,"I notice that, too. I would also hate to be classified as shallow or dumb, because I love to learn new things and come up with new ideas. I always have a lot going on internally. I'd also hate to be classified as naïve or easily taken advantage of, because I feel like I do have a good gauge for other people's intentions and can spot phoniness or insincere behavior. 
I've heard ESFPs say they also can get annoyed with MBTI because it makes them sound like vapid party animals. "
935,isfj,"Yo same though. Us ISFJs tend to be like that though. I am pretty good at acting these days and pretending to be comfortable, but I can't keep up the act for too long. I need to get to know people to really become comfortable around them. I felt like an outsider in my team at work for months before I got to know everyone sitting around me (and considering we sit only a few feet apart, that's something!)."
936,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply; I was at work.
​
Well, I didn't quite figure it out until a friend suggested I might be ISFJ (she is also ISFJ, with ADHD, which I may or may not have... hence why maybe I was testing as INFP?). Then I looked it up and realized, hey, yeah. If you look at 16personalities, INFPs and ISFJs honestly have a LOT in common - want to help others, hypersensitive to criticism, values-oriented, dedicated (must be the Fi/Fe influence).
​
But, a big thing that INFPs generally aren't (not saying they can't be, just not as a rule) is practical. I am hopelessly practical, and I have an eye for detail. I looove data and figuring out what one thing has to do with another. INFPs just don't have quite that same drive. I am just also very responsible and meticulous, typing as Enneagram 6w5, which is quite a rare type for INFPs - as far as I know, they tend to be more 9 or 1.
​
There might be something else I'm forgetting, but this is basically the gist of it. :)"
937,isfj,"mmm maple yogurt 🍁
NJs:"
938,isfj,"I also tested 6w5 when I took an enneagram, but it was an online test and those (I have heard) aren't the best. Admittedly, I have also made a lot of really impractical decisions in my life haha. Spontaneous moves, bad choices in friends, etc. That being said, I enjoy working in finance at work because I also like patterns and seeing where the numbers are going. It also keeps me independent from inter-office drama and dynamics. Its one of the few parts of what I do that I like. 
Well, its something to think about for me then I guess."
939,isfj,"I took a test but then I ended up looking into the Enneagrams for myself to type myself. That's how I figured out my MBTI type, too. I don't put too much stock in tests. But granted, last time I figured out my Enneagram type was when I thought I was INFP... It might be time to revisit it. I too work in a financial setting, so I feel much the same way as you do."
940,isfj,"I was talking to an ISFJ friend of mine about what his internal thought processes and organizations look like. I'm trying to find out a bit more about how different or similar S and N types actually are. What do your thoughts look like? Do you think in pictures/words/etc.? Through what lens do you see the world? 
Thanks, 
Curious INTP "
941,isfj,"When casually perceiving things, I tend to use si and fe to gather information and then a little ti to break down the information for entertainment and utility. Can any isfjs corroborate? 
For example, when I sense anything I usually match it to a flurry of small memories and systems and then understand something from it that's interesting. For example, when I pass a well dressed stranger, I think of what kinds of people they look like from my past or in paintings and photographs, and then determine if they are following their seasonal color palette and style guidelines. I synthesize what works and what doesn't for the future. I then try to guess what they must have been thinking when they planned their outfit and combine this with the impression I get from their expression and the way they walk to guess at what kind of person they are. This probably takes about three seconds in nonverbal form. If I have more time, I try to say a phrase that summarizes what I learned from looking at that person aloud in my head to solidify my findings.
Other times, a person or landscape will have such a correspondence to something my past that I latch onto that memory and spiral inward, replaying all the salient memories from that time. I think that's standard for a lot of sentimental types though. "
942,isfj,"Since I have aphantasia, there's no visual or other sensory component aside from some sound. I suppose I think in a mix of words and just...impressions and feelings. It can be difficult to get from the latter to the former. :| But, I don't think my answer would be the typical one for an ISFJ. :)"
943,isfj,I honestly think a lot in feelings. I feel a certain way and that is what I base my thoughts off of. Idk maybe I need to implement my thinking more in actual words but I would definitely say it's a mix of words and feelings depending on my mood. Sometimes I can just zone out in my feelings and I know I'm processing but I don't really have words for it. 
944,isfj,"If I'm thinking about a subject usually I just explain it as if I were teaching it to a class, and talking through it in my head is how I draw conclusions and make the connections that Ns seem to instantly make. 
Memories are basically images and chronologies. And if I'm doing something that requires only minimal thought, like cutting grass, I either think about a subject like as I said first or I just focus on what I'm doing. And I do either more or less on demand"
945,isfj,"I think in pictures and metaphors a lot lol. Or just weird stuff... like the symbolic meaning of things that don't necessarily have symbolic meaning.
Memory wise I think I focus a lot on how I was feeling, and how whatever I did affected others."
946,isfj,"Very bleak, and very miserable. I've been told by a lot of people that I have a black and white mentality. It is either 1 or 10 with me. I know there is a lot of beauty in the world, but I'm going through the worst time of my life, so a part of knows it is a wonderful world but all I see is the mess and hell."
947,isfj,"Yeah I also have aphantasia and my thoughts are very auditory/word-based. Music and reading come naturally to me, so that's nice. I get what you mean by ""impressions and feelings"" though -- I get the essence of my thoughts rather than really perceive senses other than hearing in my thoughts. idk aphantasia's weird.
But regardless, my thoughts are pretty centered around concrete things -- things i have sensed or do sense -- even if my thoughts don't process them in the most concrete way, if that made any sense. If not, disregard me HAHAH"
948,isfj,"When a friendship ends, or a break-up happens, or something bad... ISFJ's, how do you move on?  I've found lately that I seem to be dwelling on things.  It's like I can't forget and it bothers me so, so much.  So how do you just move on sometimes?  How do you not let the bad things in life get you down?"
949,isfj,"I have been dealing with this exact problem for almost a full year. My boyfriend and I broke up and it has honestly been brutal to me, so I understand what you’re going through. I also have to see him every single day at school (I go to a vv small school) which makes matters worse.
The support from my friends has been invaluable to me. They have helped me just work through my thoughts, build my self confidence, and also validate that my feelings are legit. I find that a lot of times I feel like I’m crazy, and having my friends around to voice my thoughts to helps me realize that I’m not crazy for feeling the way I feel.
Going to therapy has also been a huge help for me. My therapist has just helped me to process through my thoughts and the situation just by being an impartial person to talk to. She can easily identify my unhealthy thoughts/behaviors and give me actionable things to do to improve the situation. I found that a huge part of my frustration was that I felt like I couldn’t DO anything to help myself getting better, so going to therapy really helped me in this area.
Lastly, I think that time away from the person who hurt you is the only true way to move on. The only times I feel completely okay is after I have spent some time away from him. I know this is the most frustrating answer, but time is truly the best way to recover. But I think you also need to accept that you feel the way you feel and that’s okay. I used to get so upset that I still cared about ex. But I eventually just had to accept that the feelings were there and continue living. You can’t will feelings away, so don’t try. Just try your best to focus on other areas of your life, and don’t give in to the temptation to over analyze things. Good luck!! I know it’s really hard."
950,isfj,"I always have to remind myself that life goes on. And dwelling over spilled milk isn't going to do good for my overall well-being and thus i always look forward to new experiences. Negative experiences used to feed on my anxiety but mindfulness has helped a ton. I have this mentality of 'if i have to move on from something, something better will come into place'. I hope my advice would help in any way, be it small or big. My pm is open if you need to talk x"
951,isfj,"You honestly can't. I try to distract myself as much as I can and try to forget all the good times I've had with the person. I delete them from all socials, delete photos and delete all their text messages."
952,isfj,"Y’know, its posts like these that make me wonder if I’m actually an ISFJ, unless this is an INFJ thing too. 
I had someone in my life who I thought was a close older friend - like a mentor-type figure.  They were a fellow employee at my workplace and ended up getting a new job somewhere else - a good thing for them, as it was better pay and a better job all around, so I was happy for them.  But I thought maybe we’d see each other still at least occasionally... but it seems like that’s not going to happen. I guess to them I was just a workplace buddy and nothing more. 
It’s hard to process and let go, as I can’t even be mad at the person. They were just going ahead with their life as normal. I was the one who thought there was more to the relationship than there really was.  I just can’t stop missing them. Accepting the fact that I’ll probably never see them again has been a hard pill to swallow. As another commenter here put it, it is like they were etched into the very fabric of myself.
Now I’m wary of getting close to anyone again. This isn’t the first time it’s happened.  I just thought it wouldn’t be the same this time.  I keep thinking that I’m not necessarily angry with myself, I’m just disappointed."
953,isfj,You really don’t. I guess a comfort is that the pain might get dulled over time but you’ll always remember and think back about it constantly. 😕 I’m really hesitant to get attached to people but being attached to nobody makes me feel empty.
954,isfj,"To me break up was like drowning and I tried to grab everything I can to keep me a float. Things like journaling, self help books, motivational YouTube videos, changing my mind that he was supposed to be  my soulmate, ex no contact, gym membership, started praying again, konmari, traveling, bullet journal, taking one day at a time, throwing away momentos, working a lot, being open to a new relationship, projects like growing my hair longer, etc, etc. After two years I'm doing a lot better. I can't deny my feelings for him. But I told myself, I love the person in my head. He doesn't exist in real life. The real person doesn't deserve my love, even though I have it. I'm scared getting attached to somebody else. Heartbreak is really hard for me. I lost my mind for three days. But I know I learned a lot of lessons from it and it made me stronger."
955,isfj,"I have had two breakups with the same friend. the last breakup for good.  at first I cried every day. every day. but I got over it because of the support from my family and my other friends.
and Me myself. I laid it behind me, and now I'm a stronger person."
956,isfj,"Immerse myself in fun activities that keep my thoughts busy. Doesnt help u move on, but helps you clear your mind so you can sort things out later. Friends are important to me, so I don't just forget them. I fix things especially of i ruined them."
957,isfj,"I am sort of interested in an ISFJ girl right now who's having trouble moving on from her past relationship. It's a relatively recent breakup so I understand why the emotions are still fresh, but she gets so sad and depressed every time she is reminded of the fact that relationship has ended. She has assured me that she doesn't want to get back together with her ex and that her sadness is over the fact that she has lost a best friend along with a partner. I do believe her, but I'm somebody who doesn't really stay friends with my exes, so I don't quite understand this sense of loss on cutting them out of your lives once the relationship ends. I'm an INTJ though so maybe this is an Ni/Si difference."
958,isfj,"Agree, even when I know 100% that I’m better off and made the right decision, I find myself feeling sentimental for a long time. They say it takes half the length of time of the relationship to get over it, but maybe for us it’s more like the entire length of time ;)"
959,isfj,"Well im glad im not alone in this, but I also think it's partly my own fault. I attempted to tell this one girl my feelings one time, which she didn't feel the same way but we still ended up being friends... However whenever she does something negative towards me, like ignore me for her other friends when I'm trying to get her attention... It hurts all like the first rejection. And my subconscious becomes a tainted mess of fear, blowing the situation out of proportion, and repeating a moment over and over in my head. It's like my subconscious runs the worst possible scenarios so the reality isn't nearly as bad or something."
960,isfj,"I'm trying my best to not be sentimental about it and look at it from a rational standpoint... but even then, it's like the feelings just can't be stopped.  It still hurts, and I just can't stop myself from thinking about it.  I almost want to push the feelings down, but I know that that wouldn't be healthy... I've tried to do that before - all logic, holding back the emotion - and I've ended up crying harder than I would have in the first place."
961,isfj,"I wish I could. They just don't get it.  I hung out with them for almost a year, and they did it right before spring break, and it was all ""in the moment.""  I still think they're assholes.  They still think they're right."
962,isfj,"I just hate the fact that I was friends with one of them (one of the people I just stopped being friends with almost a month ago)... and she still did this to me.  She still chose them over me.  It wasn't like that, exactly, but I really liked her.  She was my best friend, for a while.  I have new best friends.  But it still hurts to look back and know that this all happened... and they just all said ""Get over it."" I don't want things to be the same, not after what they did, but my mind is still there.  From a logical standpoint, I understand why they want me to just get over it, but they really broke me down emotionally.  I'm trying to move on, but the memories are so there."
963,isfj,"It's so nice to have people here who understand.  My ESFP and ISFP ex-friends were telling me that I'm ""overreacting"" and ""taking it too personal.""  They've always said that about things I remember.  I thought that I was just being over-emotional."
964,isfj,"I honestly don't want to become attached to people anymore.  Hate to sound so cynical, but a person you trust one day will stab you in the back the next.  No one wants to admit that they're wrong.  And your feelings will never matter to some people."
965,isfj,"This is exactly what I do.  As soon as I found out they were gossiping about me, I suddenly had all this paranoia - I thought back to things that had happened, made decisions about what was going on, etc.  I reached conclusions that I maybe shouldn't have reached because I was having too many thoughts, and the anger was too much.  They admit that they blew the situation out of proportion.  I'm working on not being upset."
966,isfj,"To-do lists have essentially ruined my life. I would keep a normal to-do list, sure, and I use Habitica to keep track of things I want/need to do daily (because I'm bad at self-care), but then I have this list of habits on the side that I try to do every single day. It's taxing. Sometimes I make a second to-do list and then get stressed out because I'm trying to comprehend both of them. I would do this on a larger scale, with planning out my month, so much so to the point where it caused me anxiety and I had to get counseling for it. I'm tired of being tied down by my to-do lists, they're nice but when I'm constantly on a schedule and am constantly checking things off it's exhausting. Yet if I don't write them down and do them I feel like I'll forget things or never finish them.
Does anyone else have this hyper-organization problem? Any tips on how to deal with it? Today I'm trying not to look at my lists outside of necessary to-dos and then trying to remember what I want to do. "
967,isfj,"The most effective technique I have discovered is to have a top priority to-do list with no more than 5 items on it. 
Just move the 5 most important items off of your other to-do lists onto the top priority list and knock those out first. When you finish one, moving something else on there. This will prevent you from being overwhelmed and let you focus!
On the topic of organization: if you need a way to keep all of your lists and everyday notes organized and in one place, I highly recommend Evernote. It syncs between all of your devices and lets you save all sorts of information (text notes, lists, pictures, business cards, Word documents, etc). And it's free!"
968,isfj,"Saying something cruel to someone in a fit of rage and not being able to apologize. To die unrepentant is a bother. To lose someone, unrepentant, is a guilt that weighs heavier than an aircraft carrier. "
969,isfj,"Losing those I'm close to, some night I lose sleep over friendships that ended almost 2 years ago, and now that I'm graduating high school soon and going away to college soon, I fear losing the friends I have, because they are the ONLY support system I've ever had. "
970,isfj,"I can’t tell if I’m a Si-Fe or Fi-Se user. I always get ISFJ or ISFP as the majority answer depending on the questionnaire I fill out. When taking cognitive function tests, I usually get Si, Fi, Fe, Se in that order. The only thing I'm sure of is that I'm enneagram 9. I’d love if I could get help on confirming my type!
Warning: I don’t have that great of an understanding about the functions, so most of these may probably be stereotypes, but here’s my best shot. 

Si:


I enjoy recalling past memories and experiences


My memory for the past is better than most people I know


I hate taking risks even if they’re small


I dislike big changes such as new jobs and new schools, and take longer to adapt to these changes than necessary 


I like knowing what to expect / the details of things (ex: who’s going to be at a hangout, when is it, where are we going, how long are we staying for, what are we doing?)


I feel much more comfortable if I have a sense of familiarity. Being unfamiliar with a place or situation makes me uncomfortable


I like stability and security


I use what I know and have experienced in the past when working on present and future things 


Why I second-guess Si: I'm mostly only present-oriented. I would say I'm at least 85% focused on the present. Also although Si has nothing to do with anxiety, most Si users I know are prone to worrying while I'm mostly always nonchalant and complacent.
Se:


I’m very present-oriented; I hardly think about the future, and the only time I think of the past is to recall memories when being reminded of them 


I love designer items and wish to own many expensive, high-end things. I’m also a big spender who mostly spends money on appearance, and I dress for beauty not comfort


I like trying new food as long as I know what the food is


I just want to live in the moment and be happy even though I don’t actually do much 


When seeing something, I’m more likely to describe what the thing looks/sounds/etc like than to associate it with a feeling or memory from the past 


I almost never worry about anything and am more likely to just think, “well I can’t do anything about it, so I might as well just wait” or “when the time comes, it’ll come” and stuff like that


I find the arts appealing; music, film making, photography, drawing, writing, etc. I’m also pretty creative myself, but not all that talented with the arts other than writing poetry and stories 


I’m usually one of the first to notice something in my surroundings 


Why I second-guess Se: I don’t take interest in doing physical things like hiking, partying, raving, playing sports, and more. I also don't adapt/adjust to change that quickly unless I actually want the change, which isn't often. 
Fi:


When someone says or does something, my first reaction is to think about my opinion or my feelings (in my mind)


I dislike and am uncomfortable with expressing most of my feelings, so I keep them to myself 


I care about morals and ethics; I dislike when people do unethical things like lie on a resume (or lie about anything), steal someone’s belongings because they forgot it somewhere, take credit for someone else’s work, and etc


I don’t really care about norms and dislike some, such as shaking hands with people you meet, saying “bless you” when people sneeze, and more 


I stick to my values most of the time; I could agree to a hangout then not want to go anymore, but still go because I already agreed to it and I value keeping my word


I’m pretty reserved and private with most people, and I take a long time to get comfortable with someone or to consider them “close”. I’ve had the same friends since I was in elementary, but still don’t feel close to them even though they feel close to me


I don’t take criticism well and can take defense to what someone says (misreading it as something rude when it wasn’t meant to be), but I don’t express any of this to them


I look at many things as right/wrong or good/bad


I hate when people try too hard to be something they aren’t, like when they change their entire image or personality to fit in with the cool kids 


Why I second-guess Fi: I don’t place high importance on myself being authentic, individualistic, or having a clear identity. I also don't talk about myself that much even though I enjoy talking about things in my interest.
Fe:


I prefer to fit in with the crowd as opposed to stand out and be unique


I follow a lot of beauty trends


I’m accommodating and like to maintain harmony to avoid conflict. I have never gotten into conflict with a friend before


I kind of care what people think about me, but mostly just to the point of avoiding people hating me


A lot of my values are society’s values (ex: be respectful, polite, ethical)


I’m extremely agreeable on the outside even though I don’t actually agree on the inside. I’d pretend to agree with my friends about something I actually disagree with because I want to avoid getting into an argument with them and because it’s just easier for myself to agree than to express my disagreement just for them to disagree, which will make me mad on the inside


I don’t really have a sense of self; I have a hard time answering “who are you?” whenever asked


Many people find me warm, friendly, and animated in my facial expressions and body language/hand gestures 


I’m a pushover and easily taken advantage of. I let people get what they want all the time because I have trouble speaking up. Friends have said that I’m “too nice”.


Why I second-guess Fe: I don’t care about other people’s feelings and I don’t help people to make them happy unless I really like them. The reason why I sugarcoat, pretend to agree, and help people is to avoid conflict, so I can maintain harmony. However, I don’t care about group harmony; the entire group could be fighting, but as long as I’m not involved in the fight, I don’t care because I still feel at peace.

I have a questionnaire I recently filled out here in case anyone wants to look back on it. People there told me I'm probably ISFP, but on the mbti community I'm still getting a lot of ISFP and/or ISFJ answers. Here it is
I'm also willing to answer some questions if it could better help me find my type. Thanks!"
971,isfj,"Ok, so first of all, I think this is a great way to look into your type - much better than just testing or relying on descriptions. At the same time, you must be aware of your own bias - sometimes we can relate to other functions/types, but it can be hard to tell what is our real preference vs. what we would like to be instead.
Ok, so these are my thoughts on your notes - which may be biased as well. 
Si
Like I said, I feel strong Si vibes in your points. If you just said something about having a good memory, I would have dismissed it as a general human thing. But your aversion to risk and your preference for stability and familiarity - these are very strong points favoring Si in your stack.
About your second-guessing: how do you define a present-oriented person, as opposed to a past or future-oriented one? How does this work for you?
Se
Ok, so I don't have much experience with this function, but some of the points strike me as general human things.
I feel the same. I see no conflict with Si. Si-users are also open for new experiences, as long they aren't too jarring or unexpected.
Don't most people do that? It might actually be something Si-like, in some cases. For example, you don't have to associate with an actual memory - you can liken the thing you're describing to another thing you have experienced in the past, without really bringing out a vivid full relived memory. ""This fruit tastes a bit like basil"", ""the fur of this kitty feels like silk"" - if you do this, you're pulling from your past experience. This is how it works for me, at least. Sometimes, yes, the sensation is more intense and leads to reliving some past episode. Most of the times though is just comparing it to an inner catalogue of sensations.
Interest in art doesn't necessarily imply Se (or strong intuition, as some like to think). I also find arts very appealing and see myself as a creative individual. I think this is a personal thing, not really indicative of someone's type.
Can you give some examples of that?
(Will come back with my opinion on the Fi-Fe points)"
972,isfj,"Fi
This sounds like something everyone does. You say a thing, I get an internal reaction to it. Is there anything else that you do that would imply strong Fi?
This might be actually a sign of Fe. ISFJs are notoriously bad at expressing their feelings - they keep most of it to themselves in order to not give a wrong impression to others or to avoid creating uncomfortable/awkward moments. Is there a reason you would consider this an effect of Fi?
I can also relate to this. ISFJs often have strong morals/ethics. Some may dislike some norms and follow their own set. The question is how do you interact with others on this topic? Do you judge others openly or are you more tolerant? If you were to enforce rules, would you be lenient and let them go with a warning, or would you be more on the stricter side?
Most ISFJs would relate to this. If you come across as warm and friendly (like you wrote in the Fe section) even to not so close people, you might be more of a Fe user.
Fe
All these, especially the last one, scream Fe to me.
Sometimes it can be difficult to assess whether you use Fe or Fi. Mature Fi users will know how to interact well with people. Mature Fe users will know how to assert themselves and draw the line. How do I know I'm a Fe user? I just look at my actions and see how much of it is under the shadow of the Others. I'm always considering the Other. I don't love everyone, I don't want to take care of everyone, but at the same time I'm always concerned with their perception of me. I have a hard time standing up for myself, but I often stand up for others - i.e. when someone badmouths them or judges them too harshly, especially if they're not present. It makes me feel bad/angry seeing people behaving unreasonably towards another.
If still unsure, you should also check Te vs Ti. Are you using Fe coupled with Ti or Fi with Te?"
973,isfj,"From a lot of the descriptions I've read, ISFJ's seem to need some sort of responsibility in their life to feel fulfilled. Like as a ""guardian"" you're supposed to be a great parent or whatever.
I've struggled with depression since puberty, and I think one of the contributing factors is that ISFJ part of me that needs to be a ""caretaker"". After turning 25 this year, I've been feeling depressed, coming to grips with being alone most of my life, and thinking about how I probably won't have a spouse or kids to take care of in my future.
Anyone else found this to be true for them? Or are you another ISFJ, but with a different experience with depression?"
974,isfj,"ISFJ here.
I've never struggled with depression in my life.
I have moments and periods in time when I feel very down, and I sort of hit rock bottom during those episodes.
But they're always short-lived, and I bounce back very fast and very dramatically.
When I was younger, I remember I had sports coaches who made jokes about how I was smiling all the time. :)
I'm generally a very happy person. 
I personally believe that happiness is a choice, and every single day, I make the choice to turn my thoughts in a positive direction. I know a lot of people think that sort of thing is a load of crap, but I'm a living example of how effective it is.
It's actually really simple, once you make a habit of it, and it can make such a huge difference in your life.
I'm not gonna get all preachy about positive thinking, but if you're interested at all, I highly suggest googling it and at least giving it a shot.
So, to answer your question, I've never struggled with depression.
I'm happy, I've always been happy, and I choose to make myself happy regardless of the circumstances I'm faced with in life.
Don't get me wrong, my life isn't perfect and I've been through a whole lot of horrible things. But I gained something good out of every single experience I've ever had in my life, and I am who I am today because of it. So I wouldn't change a thing. :)"
975,isfj,"23 year old ISFJ guy here, and I'm in a very similar boat as you.
I've struggled with moderate depression for many years. Sometimes it is worse than others, but it never seems to fade away.
A lot of my distress comes from exactly what you describe as our need to be a caretaker, in my personal and professional life. For me this means being in a position to help people and provide them support, on a truly meaningful level.
As far as my personal life goes, I never seemed to develop strong social skills that translated into really meaningful relationships with friends or romantic partners. Thus, I've just never been able to take advantage of opportunities to create meaningful relationships. I would love to be a parent someday, and meet a woman I can really develop a deep and meaningful bond with, but everyday it looks(in my mind) more bleak. I realize this is an issue, and I try to work to fight it, but many times my efforts simply get derailed by my depression.
I'm very fortunate to have a good job that I am fairly good at, and pays very well. However, I just don't feel like it is meaningful work. I work for a mid-sized corporation, who's bottom line is to create profit for shareholders(which is the case for all corporations). As cliche as it sounds, I really feel like I'm pouring my time and effort into working  for ""the man"" and their pocketbooks, rather than something truly meaningful to people's lives. Nearly everyday I feel like I come home form work unfulfilled. Some days I just feel like want to drop it all and pursue education for something completely different like social work, counseling, or nursing, just something that has a positive impact in people's lives. But, I'm afraid to give up the security I've already established. It can be overwhelming to think about, and can really be a demotivator.
At this point, I'm just not sure what to do other than live day by day, as unfulfilling as it may be. Feels bad man...
I'm not sure what else I can offer you than my story and: I know what you're going through, and it really sucks. Take solace in the fact that you're not the only one experiencing these pains.
Feel free to PM me if you want. It sounds like we have relate able experiences, and I'd be happy to talk through them with you.
Sorry for the rambling novel y'all..."
976,isfj,"I have struggled with it and I know where you are coming from. I think I have mostly come out of my depression, but I still lack one very basic thing... I have trouble realizing I must be my own caretaker. We are always looking for ways to help others often at the expense of ourselves. If we can learn to care for ourselves as much as we do others, then we would be so well off--look how well you treat others and decide you want the same care and attention as others receive from you. It is much easier said than done, I still cannot get the hang of it 100% but I feel that it is such an important thing... 
Kind of rambling, but I hope what I said makes sense. 
Best of luck to you with handling hoe you are feeling! "
977,isfj,"Other ISFJ there, male, atheist, & non-traditionalist.
It's been a while since you posted this thread, I don't know if you're still looking for answers. Anyway, may the following be useful for other ISFJ struggling with depression, I'll try to answer your thread.
I've struggled with isolation most of my childhood, partly because of my very strong Si, because being a growing ISFJ child (kind, well-intended, interested in school,...), AND also for plenty of other reasons which have nothing to do with my being ISFJ (health, family,...).
I've been struggling with depression since puberty as you seem to.
Being a caretaker is obviously part of it, yes. But not the only reason.
I mean, being a caretaker, and a heterosexual not overmanly ISFJ man, is not the best option in the world, OK, so it contributes   :-)
ISFJs are often more easily/fastly tired than others (the ""I"" part of us having stg to do with it), that does not help as well
But well, I wouldn't be otherwise than ISFJ anyway, would you ?
I'm now 40, I know who I am, and don't want to be SO else.
I just face being who I am, and trying to get the best of it for others. And the ""not too bad"" of it for myself.
But being an ISFJ is not all about my struggling with depression. Health is a part of it (e.g. thyroid issues). Family story is part of it as well. Some non-typical-ISFJ mental traits of mine are part of it as well.
I've been married to an INTJ woman for 15 years (ongoing divorce by now), but I've only been knowing anything about MBTI for 2 years; that helps me understand some things (with no hope at all that MBTI would explain everything !!! How unsane would that be...).
Please give others the best of being an ISFJ: give your best to any persons who deserve it, without, eeeer... being a carpet, which us ISFJs seem to be veeery good at.
Being 25, you have an incredible potential and amount of time to meet a marvellous SO who will also be full of flaws, with whom to have wonderful children !!! Who will themselves struggle their whole lifetime with their own bunch of issues...
I married at 25, which is no problem at all, as well as the idea of, would I meet a special SO again, marrying again in the next few years would not be a problem for me either !
What I think for you is: 


Ask for help, see a therapist, and take it seriously. If this therapist does not fit you, look for another, without jumping constantly from one to another: once you've found an acceptable one, keep them until you feel you don't need therapy anymore.


Go on improving yourself, the way that is good for you. Some ISFJs will prefer working of toughening themselves to counterbalance their kindness, others will try to constantly improve their ""helping others"" toolbox, and so on...


Go on becoming the person you wish to be, THIS will be romantically attractive, but only to the persons who will fit you, which is sometimes a good filter against harmful persons   :-)


We're not helped with common representations (fictional, specially) of love, whatever MBTI type we are; get these images out of your head (age for marrying, way to fall in love, way to stay/live together,...)


Beware of takers; ""givers must set limit, because takers don't"". Ask for help ending harmful relationships if you observe you don't manage that by yourself. There's not shame to have about that.


Open up: we ISFJs are often under-the-radar persons, who look smart but distant, so try to balance it with other stuff in order to lower the barrier it makes.


Please keep on being the best person you can, AND do what's necessary in order to attract the right person. Whatever physically attractive you are, whatever 'old' you are, whatever flaws you feel you have, that'll make it    :-)
Also, the Internet is full of helpful articles & posts which may bring you comfort and help.
You can contact me via PM or through the forum, would you feel the need to have this discussion going on.
I wish the best for you !!!

978,isfj,"You mention being a very happy child - and I can really relate to that! I was one of the happiest children. I'm not sure what changed -- maybe some ""traumatic"" experiences where I was punished by a teacher for laughing in elementary school. But it's interesting for me to look back at my childhood and remember how happy I was.
I admire your positive thinking. I've been trying to get in the habit of finding something positive in everything. I usually take the opposite route and look for the negatives first, so it's kind of hard to break that habit."
979,isfj,"And yes, another thing: I know too few ISFJ persons in order to know whether we ISFJ are specially prone to depression; my mother is a noticeably unhealthy ISFJ who has NOT suffered from depression, as far as I know, but who has been having a certain talent to cause bad feelings (and at the end, bad feelings towards her) on every of her 4 children.
I don't know many other ISFJs, so I could not answer. I guess some ISFJs are more selective than me in their ""caretaker trends"", that may help them not to fall into depression (e.g. by not being a carpet, and not falling in love for, and/or not spending a high amount of time/energy by helping, the wrong persons), but it also makes them, eeeer... less open-minded persons, which I don't value.
The ""traditionalist"" trend of some ISFJs may help them to lower the risk of depression, with the same outcome however.
And some ISFJ have developed sooner than me their Ti, which seems to help them balancing Fe (which seems to be sometimes quite extreme in my personality), thus preventing some sources of depression which may be caused by extreme Fe (e.g. being overemotional, making inappropriate decisions based too much exclusively on feelings,...). But I like my Fe being the way it is. It's just a part of me being me, see what I mean ?
I told you I was OK with who I am...
Hihi"
980,isfj,Would depend how far on the introvert scale you are. I think I'd be good at it but I would get tired of it pretty quickly. Every time I go to buy a car I always think about being a car salesman since I tend to know more about the car than the people working there. 
981,isfj,"I have to sell warranties on computers. I t hmm ink I use my subconscious mind and the determination and caring aspect of the ISFJ personality, which is why I'm so bad I know the warrenties are crap so I don't want them to buy them. So it's hard convincing them to buy something I would never buy. But I don't hate it and I guess that's cause I like talking about computers."

983,isfj,"Hey guys. :) I'm trying to figure out my type and I'm stuck between ISFJ and a few other types. I have a few questions that I'm hoping to get ISFJ perspective on. Thanks for any help you can give!
Is it true that ISFJs are comfortable dealing with lots of little detailed things? For example, working on taxes... does keeping track of all those detailed things you might need in order to complete that not bother you? Or another example, if you were working on a painting and there was a need to focus on doing small detailed lines, this sort of thing wouldn't bother you? Sorry for the weird examples, lol.
Do you guys tend to take things people say at face value, or do you often 'read between the lines' and think they really mean something else?
Would you say ISFJs are generally fairly present focused, like 'in the moment' people? I've heard some ISFJs say they are a mixture of in the moment and past oriented, but I've heard other ISFJs/ISTJs talk as if they are more purely focused on the present. Which do you think is more accurate for the typical ISFJ? Is it rare/uncommon for ISFJs to spend a good deal of time thinking about and/or planning for the future?
Is it common for ISFJs to naturally consider many different perspectives/angles when trying to understand a person/idea/topic? Like naturally seeing multiple perspectives to different situations? I've seen this more often attributed to Ni-doms but I wanted to know if ISFJs are this way as well."
984,isfj,"
I like dealing with little detailed things.
I always over analyze. Not really in between the lines but more what the person is hiding kind of thing.
I don't think about the past that much, what done is done. Moving forward and think about the future most of the time.
Mmmm I would say it depends, but it's not something I would put my finger on.
"
985,isfj,"Hello! :) This is speaking from my personal experience, because I don't really know any fellow ISFJs irl.


I'm super into details to the point that it becomes almost obsessive sometimes haha (exactly like your example about working on a painting!) I have a tendency to work on things down to the littlest detail, but I do enjoy it.


I overthink a lot about things like the (possible?) meanings behind how people react in certain situations but in the context of speech I usually would take things at face value.


I'm not really sure about what is common for ISFJs, but I do spend a lot of time thinking about the past. I think planning for the future is a pretty J thing to do in general though!


I always like hearing different opinions on a matter! Seeing the different perspectives to a situation would usually come after reflecting on it and thinking about the different ways it could've gone.


Good luck in figuring out your type!"
986,isfj,"Late response, but!
1- Depends on the thing. Taxes, nope. I'm just now starting to get truly organized at nearly 23, and I do have my tax paperwork in order, but I have no earthly clue about the details that go into filing my taxes beyond finding the numbers to put into turbotax :P The painting though? Definitely. I have huge perfectionist tendencies and often slow myself allllll the way down trying to get tiny details in a project just right. You know those adult coloring books? I couldn't do them because the idea of picking the ""wrong"" color for a section stressed me out. 
2- Usually, right up until they give me reason not to. I forget a lot of things, but unless it's someone I have a ton of trust in anyway, I almost always remember to be suspicious of someone who's mislead me before, intentional or not. Until then, though, I absolutely take things at face value and probably seem quite gullible at times.  
3- I dunno about others, but I would say I'm more of a mix. I tend to be fairly present-oriented and can find it hard to look at the bigger picture without deliberately putting myself in that frame of mind, but it's also easy for me to get consumed by thoughts of the past and dig myself into a rut (or sometimes even out of one, if I'm in a positive and productive frame of mind). I also do a fair amount of planning for and thinking about the future, but usually in a more abstract way, almost as if my ""future self"" and my ""current self"" are two totally separate, disconnected beings. 
4- Absolutey!! One of my favorite things is coming at things from different angles and making connections between different subjects. In school I always loved interdisciplinary stuff because it was so fascinating seeing how science impacted politics impacted art impacted philosophy, etc etc. Taking different opinions into account also tends to come fairly naturally to me? Even if I don't recognize on my own that someone could feel a particular way about something, I think it's valuable and interesting to hear why and gain a broader understanding of people's different views and motivations. I would tend to associate Fe or maybe even Ne with that trait over Ni, honestly. "
987,isfj,"Thanks. :) Do you find it accurate as an ISFJ yourself? Or are you a different type? If you're an ISFJ, did you relate to the INFJ description on that site? I know the Fe and Ti descriptions will be similar, but what about the way the other two functions are described in the 'inner/outer world' sections? 
I remember reading these descriptions a while back, and I think I related best to them in this order: INFJ"
988,isfj,"Already graduated but from what I remember..
I always preferred to use Google keep/EverNote to take notes, was more of a typer over a writer because sometimes I get too hasty writing notes they become illegible
Unless I really didn't care about the class I was usually early to get a good seat (if it wasnt assigned). If the class was lax I'd probably get lazy"
989,isfj,"I am really bad taking notes. My writing is illegible for others and messy, and I get bored easily. If I attend classes is to keep track to know what I have to study after for the test. I usually take part of those student comittees that distribute classes and then share all the notes. The only bad thing about that is that you have to trust that others will do their part well enough and in time. Sometimes I have had problems with that... But normally, the load of work is much less which is appreciated. 
When I study I usually make pretty detailed tree-schemes, it's easier for me to remember than if I read directly the notes, but it takes a lot of time. "
990,isfj,"Hi I'm a college student. Two best things to get organized: A fucking planner and a phone calendar. With the planner, I look at all the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and put all the due dates for homework, when midterms and finals are, and when I should start studying for them. I use the phone calendar to put when classes are and when midterms and finals. I do this so I have two different ways of being organized for classes. I also put in student club meetings, social outings with friends, and student club events in my planner and phone calendar as well. This helped me a lot last year stay organized my GPA went up from a 2.54 to 2.93 as a result from me getting more organized for my classes. Also if you have a smartphone utilize the reminders to remind you to get your work done and set alerts for it as well. Cool thing about a planner and phone calendar with all the dates in it is I can take a look at it at the beginning of the week usually on Sunday and see the homework and tests I have that week so I can plan and study accordingly depend on how much coursework I have that week.
TL,DR: A planner and phone calendar helps me stay more organize and helps know how my week is going to pan out in terms of classes and school activities "
991,isfj,"Thanks for responding. I like how you set alarms to study. That is something I can see myself doing and then completely ignoring haha. Are you usually good at retaining information? I find that if I don't take notes then I am very forgetful. I am an English major, for context. So even though it isn't too many 'hard facts,' I still feel like I forget things easily."
992,isfj,"I am very similar! If I hand write notes they become completely messy and unable to read. I am a super fast typer though so I can type almost word for word what the professor is saying if I am paying attention. And yes, if I care about a class I always get a good seat, but if I don't care, then I will be in the back. Very interesting, thanks!"
993,isfj,"I do the same thing with the planner and a phone calendar! Same exact organization, and it totally helped bring my grades up as well. Good to know I'm not alone, a lot of people find it excessive since I have some things in both calendars but not everything in both. "
994,isfj,Hello lovely ISFJs. This is a video of me and my mom. She doesn't know much about MBTI so we played a fun game where I put a bunch of stereotypes on slips of paper that she has to read and guess if they are associated with INFJ or ISFJ.  
995,isfj,"Some things I was thinking of adding

Maybe a sticky topic of sites that can help figure out if you're really an ISFJ or stuff to understnad ISFJs better?
User Flairs, maybe just of the different types so we know who's an ISFJ and what type is visiting.
Update the ""Want to chat?"" section. Maybe more users want to be added to that? I noticed a few users on there are either inactive or have their account deleted.
Maybe more mods if people wanto be one?
Maybe do something with automod like a weekly discusion topic or something?

If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to post in this topic."
996,isfj,"ENxP, here. I can flair. I want to mod.
EDIT : Flairs are already here. My bad. I'll still have to state my type every time, I think.
I can furnish reasons, motivations and arguments why I'd be a good mod here. I just feel it's pointless to justify myself again and again. Especially when I'm somewhat condemned just because I proposed the idea.
Nothing can change if you don't trust those who know change well and/or act so nothing changes. I'm here to help an make things smooth. I'm here to learn to be a better human being by taking responsibilities. I don't know how it can be seen as wrong."
997,isfj,"Probably more on the messy side? Mine tends to be a little loopy on my g, j, and y, which can make it a little hard to read when they cut into the line below, and my u's and n's can be hard to distinguish lol.... Also, if people want to maybe they could post samples! I would be really curious to have pictures to go with people's descriptions :) "
998,isfj,"Very messy. I can turn on the neatness if need be, but most of the time I am only writing for myself and I have so many thoughts to get down on paper at the same time, that there is no time to waste being neat :) I can always rewrite or type it if it needs to be presentable!"
999,isfj,"Infj with an isfj. Goes pretty well. I try to limit the random non-applicable questions I ask so I don't get annoying, but I've never been judged on it and have only been kindly complemented for thinking differently, which makes me feel good. I've made an effort to have more small talk about more tangible stuff, which drove me crazy at first, but I've come to associate meaning with it in that we generally care about the specific aspects of each other's lives that no one else cares about and our small talk is therefore a demonstration of love that doesn't occur that way with anyone else. 
Feelings wise, on point. Super supportive of each other and completely mutual. Very kind and sensitive to each other's feelings and we both ask personal things in non offensive ways. Have never had an argument because we are both very calm in conflict and genuinely listen to each other in non judgement ways (or if it is something we stand on, we approach it sensitively and try to understand the other's point of view while explaining why we think like we do). 
Was frustrated at one point by a lack of opening up but that openness has gotten greater with time which is comforting to me because I know it won't be closed off forever. 
I've also realized that where I talk to think, ISFJs think and then talk, so silence on the other person's part does not mean a lack of opinion nor a disregard for what I am saying, it is just being processed and thought about....often times ISFJ brings it up hours later with some really deep aspect or further comment when I had assumed he said all he wanted to and moved on. 
I've learned to express something and then just wait, only bringing it up later if nothing changes and he doesn't also bring it up later
Overall feels like ecstasy. The subconscious knowing of each other's feelings and moods makes things wonderful. We both want stability and peace and predictability so that works too :)"
1000,isfj,"Besides fellow ISFJs, I get along well with INFJs, INFPs, and ESFJs. I can hang out with ESFPs, but I've learned not to take their tendency to be flaky personally.
However, I'm dating an INTJ and we have an awesome relationship, it just took a while for him to open up. "
1001,isfj,"He-hey! INTJ here, married to an ISFJ. Same problem, but on the other end. I'm an open book, but it made my ISFJ partner feel vulnerable and judged so she closed up a lot early in our relationship. 
Our relationship is pretty fantastic now. INTJs value honesty but can be really caught off-guard when asked about their feelings about something out of the blue, and it could cause them to avoid talking about it. We have a very functional inner thought-life, but can struggle to explain things we understand very well (because we take it for granted, and don't think it should need to be explained). Openness comes along with honesty, and it can be hard for an INTJ to really put effort into openness if he/she thinks it should be effortless."
1002,isfj,"Yay! I feel like there are few ISFJs in relationships with INTJs because it's assumed they aren't compatible. I've gotten the ""So you're dating a robot, beep boop"" comment from friends before and it couldn't be the opposite. Anyway yeah, for me I am more of the open book in the relationship, but he started confiding in me in small ways early on (Asking personal, but ambiguous questions) which helped our friendship (and eventually, relationship) grow. He challenges me with being honest because while I won't lie, I'll stay quiet if conflict arises and clam up. Whenever I am open with him about hurt feelings, he always says ""I would rather you be honest with me than keep it pent up inside."" Definitely builds trust that he won't explode in irrational anger when I bring up a problem. I have admiration for the INTJ personality type--the mental/logical side of it is fascinating :) "
1003,isfj,"This is like a month old, but as an ISFJ, do you find the pressure of nursing to be too much? I really am considering nursing and I feel I would like it! BUT I am scared of the enormous pressure/stress I would feel. Someone’s life is in my hands and I could potentially kill them. How do you deal with that? "
1004,isfj,I am an ISFJ and am thinking of declaring my major in accounting! How do you like it? Do you like it because of your ISFJ-ness? Or if you dislike it do you think you dislike it because of your ISFJ-ness?
1005,isfj,"Right now I'm working in Health Care but I want to become a Web Developer. I'm not always a people person (introvert) so I'm a little bit nervous about interviews, whiteboard questions, networking, selling my skills, all that fun stuff."
1006,isfj,"I went to school for studio art with a concentration in graphic design. My first job was in packaging. Absolutely hated it lol it was just so tedious and boring. I did do a little bit of work with some tables on Amazon’s site for our products, which helped me get my current job. Email is absolutely fascinating to me, I really do enjoy it and love that there’s always more to learn about it. 
As for working with people, we have a small email team of about 10 people that I work with  it’s a group effort in that I do step one then send it off to the next person to do their part, if that makes sense. So I work on projects alone until my part is done. There’s been a handful of times throughout the years I’ve worked directly with customers. I’m able to do it, I just have to read what I send them 10 times first in order to get it professional sounding lol I think that the main reason I wouldn’t want to ever have a job that I’d have to talk to customers a lot, I’d rather quietly do my work alone and pass it to the next person. "
1007,isfj,"I hear ya. It's been a crazy path for me. I kind of reached rock bottom and interviewed at my company for shits and giggles. Didn't really want the position, so I wasn't expecting anything.
Took a practical test, folks were impressed. Got offered the position. From there, things grew out of necesity. I hate talking to people but now it's easier with experience. I realized people don't know what they want(whole nother topic) and they need someone to explain it to them and have their best interests in mind.
Now I manage a team. Never in my dreams did I imagine that would happen. With experience came confidence. There were times I messed up, but I look back and cherish those moments as well as the good times. Take chances, make mistakes, but move forward."
1008,isfj,"I love it as both a hobby and a career. This may not be the case for all ISFJs though. I really value the team I work on, our communication, and the product we deliver.
I think software engineering is a good fit for ISFJs because of si. Problems in the industry have a way of repeating themselves, and Si allows me to recall past solutions when solving problems. It also allows me to be influenced by some of the brightest minds on my team."
1009,isfj,"I am incredibly dense. I know I annoy my ENTP brother and INTJ father at how socially dense I am. I just don't understand what to do. I often do/say stupid and/or embarrassing stuff without meaning to. How do I get better about knowing what is appropriate to say/do? I'm often told to take more initiative, yet when I do, I go about it wrong. What is the right way to do it? Please help. "
1010,isfj,"I learned by just observing a lot. 
After observing a lot of different social situations, you tend to get a sense of the pattern of how people tend to act or respond in different situations, and then you can act accordingly.
So just a lot of watching and active listening. "
1011,isfj,"a lot of that is confidence. Every day, instead of ruminating on how ""stupid"" or ""annoying"" and playing the mental tape of your father or brothers annoyance with you, do a mental review with notes for next time. Sometimes in the midst we experience a disconnect from brain to mouth. having self-coached responses may help. This works for reviewing most mistakes or embarassing situations."

1013,isfj,"I'm interested in becoming a cognitive neuroscientist, because my goal is to assist with research and help people with brain damage.  When I read about my personality type I see no mention of a science career. Would a ISFJ not make a good scientist?"
1014,isfj,"This is where classifications like this become dangerous. If you're interested in something and think you'd be good at it, who cares if one particular acronym isn't in line with it. Don't limit yourself."
1015,isfj,"I think because ISFJs on the whole are not inclined to become scientists, that career path isn't listed in the recommendations. But if an individual ISFJ has an interest in science I don't see any reasons he wouldn't make a great scientist. Brian May is an ISFJ and he has a PhD in astrophysics."
1016,isfj,"I want to become an entomologist and am currently doing undergrad research. While it is highly possible, honestly I do see many of my ISFJ tendencies becoming barriers but with time and practice and confidence in my abilities I'm sure I can work through them. Dont let a basic guideline on your personality define your goals in life but I definitely think being aware of your strengths and weaknesses can be a great help in any future field "

1021,isfj,"I can't turn off the pain and suffering of others. Recently, I read this article (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/06/dashcam-footage-of-cop-tasing-dragging-and-dropping-teen-is-unsealed/) and after reading it I couldn't even bear to watch the video. Any story I read or hear about that involves human suffering at the hands of others, avoidable human suffering specifically, drives me insane. Including global horror stories. I don't understand how people can harm other people with total disregard for human life. I run the trauma over and over and over again in my head wondering ""why?""! Why did this happen? Could this happen to me? Will I be next? I put myself in their place or in the place of the parent like the teen in this particular story. Incidences like this happen ""all"" the time. Abuse of power (don't get me started with child abuse), sexual assaults, murder, reckless driving, the list is endless. Isn't it enough that we have things beyond our control like disease, aging and death? Why are we continuously maiming, emotionally scaring and killing each other? And why can't I turn off the empathy?"
1022,isfj,"Can't say much other than I agree that it's hard to turn off the ""empathy valve"" (great term for it). I always feel sad when I see others by themselves, looking down, etc. I also hate when I see reddit comments talking easily about hurting others: ""We should kill all poachers,"" ""poachers deserve to die"" blah blah. They are humans too and we should understand the circumstances that made them choose that lifestyle over others... We cannot even begin to grasp that perspective because we are so far from it.
Anyways... I am going to therapy and seeing if that helps. I also recently saw a psychiatrist and got on medication which is supposed to sort of ""lessen"" my feelings. I am hoping it helps because it is a miserable life to live when someone calling you an asshole online can make you sad for hours.
Best of luck. You aren't alone, -- nothing is ever just a ""me"" issue with 7 billion people on the planet."
1023,isfj,"I'm the same way. I used to not be bothered by any of it, but as I've gotten older it's gotten stronger (and I'm only 18 haha). I don't notice it so much when reading, but any visual of anything bad makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Sometimes it gets ridiculous; I was watching Avengers 2 and all I could think of was all the people dying and their families and how much grief so many people must be experiencing... and once in class we watched live footage of a tsunami as recorded by locals and everything was just too much for me... I just buried my face in my hands and started silently crying in the middle of class. It was pretty embarrassing. I do wish I could turn it off at times, but then again our empathy is supposed to be something that makes us unique. "
1024,isfj,"There have been things happening in the media I had to completely remove myself from because it was affecting my day to day mood entirely too much. I feel like I take on what others are feeling, or like, the ""energy"" of what's going on, even if I don't want to and try not to."
1025,isfj,"So I've recently moved in with my INTJ boyfriend and his ENFP friend. Things are going well mostly, but I have found myself growing irritated with ENFP rm. He often talks big and exaggerates (imo) and also puts on facades and says stuff to seem cool (as far as I can gather -- he admitted he adopted his ""swagger"" just to seem more impressive to a certain group of ppl, stuff like that). I have known him for a while, and hung out quite a few times before moving in together... He is a good guy, no doubt about that, but I can't help but be annoyed sometimes (of course I don't show it). 
Any advice on how to stop being frustrated? My boyfriend says he is able to just zone out a bit and ignore the big talk etc, just let it flow by, but I am having more trouble dealing with his attention-getting antics. Am I perceiving it wrong? Maybe if I heard an ENFP perspective I'd get a different glimpse into why he acts the way he does? 
Like I said he's a great guy and has always been there for my boyfriend which I appreciate a lot. So no major problems, just this minor issue on my part. "
1026,isfj,"He can be a good guy and be full of himself. The ""swagger"" might have worked a few times, so he keeps it since he doesn't know how else to get people's attention. As the sensor counter part, I know what it's like to want to be an attention whore, but a lot of people can't find the natural balance. It's really obvious and annoying because it's either understated or over the top. Just don't feed him and his crap. Try to keep the attention off him if you can. It's harder to be annoying when you're not the center of attention."

1029,isfj,Does anyone else here feel like they have trouble reacting in a timely way. I often feel like I spend so much of every moment observing and categorizing my observations that I lag behind others in responding to current stimulus. The only way I've been able to compensate for that is to predict and plan out actions ahead of time.
1030,isfj,"Oh, yes! Especially if somebody talks to me and tells me a story or asks for my opinion I usually take quite a few silent seconds to sort my thoughts. With people I know this is not a problem but when I meet somebody new they can get thrown off.
My colleague asked me for feedback on her work on a regular basis. The first time she had a small freakout when I just looked at it without saying anything. ""It's that bad??!"" Later we did the same while sitting with a new colleague while I looked over their work and she calmed him down saying: ""Ah, it's just P4x taking his time. He will give us an honest opinion soon."" :D"
1031,isfj,cool. i don't have any isfj friends so i'm either always behind others in my reactions or i'm waaaay ahead because i'm constantly just predicting things. and my friends aren't able to really understand that.
1032,isfj,"Oh definitely. We play ultimate frisbee/football and wally ball at work on Mondays and Wednesdays and my reaction time is just shit. I see the situation unfolding, but I just don't react fast enough to hit it the ball or block the person. I don't mind working out (preferably running), but playing group sports really just makes me feel like a bumbling fool.
The reaction time thing is also why I don't like playing online shooters. By the time I've rounded the corner, I'm dead even though I've seen the person. 
As a side note, as I've really figured out who I am, I've realized I don't really enjoy open world games. I much prefer story line driven games. And sniping. Sniping is so fucking fun. I can take my time, line up the shot, then pull the trigger. There's also a deep satisfaction for crits and head shots."
1033,isfj,"Thoughts about Si, Se, Ni and Ne, context, cross-context, worldview, and possibilities

Si and Se deal with real experiences directly.
Ni and Ne deal with patterns and connections.
Si and Ni are concerned with worldview.
Se and Ne are concerned with possibilities.

Ni/Se and Si/Ne work together as pairs:

Ni/Se operate within one context at a time. Se usually focuses on the present context, but Ni can mentally shift the context in space/time so Se can have a look at it.
Si/Ne are cross-contextual. So Si builds up insights over time, and Ne uses it as a springboard to find parallels between situations, objects, ideas, anything.

Therefore:

Ni builds its worldview by looking at patterns and connections within a single context at a time.
Si builds its worldview by looking at real experiences across contexts.
Se finds possibilities by looking at real experiences in the current context.
Ne finds possibilities by looking at patterns and connections across contexts.

Any comments, corrections, elaboration, or relevant anecdotes welcome."
1034,isfj,"I have to say I find some of this quite surprising, especially coming from an INFJ. I think a lot of what you say is roughly correct, but not necessarily for the reasons that you think, and there are a couple of things (particularly relating to intuition) that are a bit mixed up.
One of the reasons that I'm surprised is that connections and patterns are very Ne-centric Idioms to use, and I don't actually think they apply that well to Ni.
A lot of people would use principles when talking about introverted intuition, but I actually prefer rules because principles is sometimes easy to mix up with values which makes people confuse introverted feeling and intuition.
The reason why patterns doesn't fit introverted intuition very well is that introverted intuition works mainly with novel things-- things that it may have no experience of. An introverted intuit can look at something brand new and make a judgement about it based on its innate properties in contrast to their rules, whereas an extroverted intuit would need to try and relate it to something he already knows.
One thing about introverted sensing-- I say this all the time and can't stress it enough, while it does relate to the real world, it is reflective and as sich out of date. It works by processing memories and impressions into its traditions, and so is incredibly subjective, and often tradition formation has much more to do with emotion relating to the impressions than anything more objective."
1035,isfj,"May I ask how you're using the word ""traditions"" here? On first read-through I think I disagree somewhat with your statement about Si, but I want to be sure I'm not just misunderstanding your wording. "
1036,isfj,"Ni uses spatial memory and thinks in cognitive maps, with the same brain regions used to recognize the general category of objects, navigate using landmarks, reconstruct events, etc.
Ni is very visual and spatial in nature, so the way it looks at the relationships between ideas is very different from Ne. Ni sees connections spatially and recognizes patterns visually, whereas Ne seems more arborescent and... semantic?
Ni uses visual recognition, with the same brain regions that answer questions like ""is this a face?"", so it really is more pattern recognition than rules. Ti and Fi use rule-based reasoning of one kind or another. Ni just squints and say ""yeah, I think it's kinda like X but more Y"". At the same time though, like other introverted functions, Ni is more concerned with mental models than external effects.
Ni uses environmental clues to make sense of new things. Think of the word ""right"". What does it mean? Depends on the context. See a new word with unknown meaning, looking at what else is being said around it often gives a vague idea of what it means.
So I've heard. Sort of a post-mortem kinda thing, plus comparing the current situation to past events, etc."
1037,isfj,"That and sharing my little theory so it might help others but most of all, hoping to spark some (detailed!) discussion to expand my understanding of the various types. Got some good discussions already, but the Sensible types are underrepresented and I'd really like to understand Si and Se better. Those functions are still a bit mysterious for me. (as an INFJ, I fully realize the irony of that statement)
I skimmed through a bunch of neuroscience stuff on top of what I saw of Nardi's study and did some thinking based on that, but firsthand knowledge of how people function in practice is a whole other ball game, you know? It all makes sense in hindsight, but I'm learning stuff I wouldn't have guessed about how each type functions."
1038,isfj,"So, I think my brother is an ISFJ (Like, I'm not an 100% certain, but he fits the description). He's currently failing in his studies, which in of itself, isn't a problem, everyone does that, and I did too...
The problem is more that his attitude is getting more and more dodgy : 
He avoids everything, blames his problems on other factor, he doesn't own up to anything. He's officially a NEET now, and well, beside passing time on his computer, he doesn't do much. 
If you confront him, he will say that he's tired or something, and try to escape, or other similar excuses (2 years of this). I'm writing this now, he went to sleep but I can hear game sounds from his room. He also using his own bad sleeping habits as an excuse for more bad choices... 
Now, I get it, he dislikes that a lot. He said it himself. Ie, too much Ti, not enough Fe. From my POV, it's not like I pursue him or anything, I just don't buy his BS. I don't yell or anything, I'm basically just asking difficult questions (and not just the gotcha kind where the answer is in the premise)
He imitates me : 
I'm 4 year older, not so much now, but a lot in the past, he imitated me. 
A good exmaple would be formation. Back in highschool, i choose a brand new formation called STI2D, which is kinda meant to form enginneer. That's on paper, I got fooled, in the end, you become some sort of tehcnicians, and you do what other people tell you. It was filled with idiots (we actually spent two months on how levers work because people pretended they didn't get it, where they simply weren't trying to listen or understand... 2months on fucking levers... The teachers made it simple, and they still managed to fail somehow.) 
Long story short, I dropped out, and managed to get my BAC as a free candidate and get back on track at uni. Right now, I'm in a Master, but I still lost 2 years.
So when it was time for him to make the same choice, I told him, multiples, just stay on the simpler path, choose ES (economique et social), the one with the most people on it. It's rather easy, you will be fine. 
Where it's weird is that he choose this exact same STI2D formation. He even put it as his first choice, with ES in second. I told him not to do it, tons of time, he still did it. I don't get that at all, he literally had no reason to do that, and tbh, it was a very stupid mistake. Now, he admits it was a mistake. 
Insights into this would be appreciated, because I really don't get it... 
Maybe it was teacher pressure or something... 
What I did so far : 
Unlike my father/mother, and some ""friends"" I don't put pressure on him. I don't ask him thoses bs question about his plans or tell him he needs to get on it. That's counterproductive, you only get pre-made answers...
It's like a ""-How are you ? - Fine"" exchange...
I don't sympathize too much eitheir tho, because it's kinda dishonest, he didn't really earn that sympathy eitheir. I also tried in the past, it didn't work at all. There's also that I'm an INTP, I dislike to do that shit. 
Also, if the problem is that the group doesn't accept him, I, as an individual can't counterbalance that, no matter how much I try.  
Like I said, I was in a similar NEET situation a few years ago, so I really get where he is right now, but I dunno, I completely assumed my choice, and it was relatively easy to get back on track. Using that experience, and just looking at his actions, I can see he's full of shit when he says he will change...
So when I talk to it with him, I try to get at the root of it. What does he want deep down ? If he doesn't get that himself, he won't make good choices/keep being lost. I guess it's too much Ti, because it always end up with him running away (still, I'm the only one irl that he talks so long with, anyway)
What others did : 
Personally, I know pressure doesn't work, it's actually a huge part of the problem. The more pressure you put, the less he does. Putting too much pressure will just push him to choice that aren't his own, so when he fails, well, it's not fault, now is it ? 
My mom just insists that he works harder. My older brother, an ISTJ, is trying stuff out on his part, also arguably failing in his studies, but he is owning up to it. It's hard to contact him on my part, and I don't think he gets it eitheir... Not enough to give good advice or help him... 
My (ISTP) dad did even really stupid things to force his hand, like putting him in some residence for young people with problems, as it would ""teach him discipline"", or taking away the computer because  he's ""addicted to it"". Dumb, dumb, dumb...  All that set us back a lot... 
My dad also divorced my mom, and now is together with some SJ, with her life in good order and all that. (I actually think she's an ISFJ too) She has children of their own, and well, they are sucessful compared to us, so not only the comparaison pop up often, she also acts like she can give advice. Itt, more stupid, pointless pressure. 
So yeah, I'm basically the only one... 
What he's doing : 
Right now, he's trying formations that are engineer-ish, on the same path of that STI2D formation he kinda faile (He did it to the end, earned his BAC, but he skipped so much that he has big holes in it, also, a terrible attendance record.)
As far as we (the family) are concerned, he is simply unsuited for thoses engineering formations. He tried a BTS last year (post-secondary education in 2years), and gave up pretty quickly. So the rest of the year, he did nothing, when time came to make a new choice for new school year, he basically insisted on continuing on that path even if we told him to try other stuff. Be it law or economics, or even a language formation. Nope, he just put the same stuff, got accepted in only one (a DUT, this one in 3years) ... Now 3 weeks in, he decided he would stop... 
I don't know why he's insisting on it where he would have better options elsewhere... He just doesn't listen to me, even when he answers and even agrees with me. 
I don't know why. Maybe he didn't considerall his options well enough. Maybe it's a form of pride. Maybe he just continuing on this out of habit, in a way... 
He says it interests him, but well, it doesn't interest him enough to actually work on it or go to class, so we might as well say it doesn't. 
Now, he talks about changing, and doing something in informatics, but the same problems will occur, he will start, see he doesn't have the level of knowledge necessary, stop going because he feels bad about it, and thus his lack of knowledge will only increase, and he will have lost another year. That's it, if he's even accepted in it in the first place (Btw, we're in france. Higher education is more or less free, but they select the better student. With his current dossier, they will say he's not serious and et someone else)
That NEET thing is really a vicious circle, so he needs to get out ASAP. 
I won't say he's ""depressed"" or anything, I don't throw bs diagnostic like that around because I'm not a psychologist, but it certainly is getting to him too...
We are in october right now, so it's probably too late to salvage this year, but I want to do something now, because he's running out of option fast. If he fail to complete this yera of formation (even if he intends to change afterward), it will just leave another bad mark on his dossier/attendance record. 
You guys are ""responsible, loyal, realistic"", and really, he's good at that stuff concerning others (like, he was very helpful at my cousin's recent marriage), but he fails to do apply the same standard to himself...

Anyway, my point is this. 
How do I push/help him out of this ? I don't want a direct solution, a miracle cure or anything, just that he owns up to his choice, because he's really running out of time and options. I'm also tired to cover up/lie to our mother on his behalf. 

Of the stack, what should I focus on ? Fe ? To me, the solution was more that he confronts his problems, so Ne and Ti... 
What kind of job/career really fit you guys ? And why ? Just saying what you do/have tried works for me, I don't want to rely on the shitty ""best career for ISFJ"" pages on the internet.
Is it actually depression ? Please don't use the term lightly too or play internet psychiatrists, but if you have insights because you were in a similar place, I will take it. 
"
1039,isfj,"Can someone please translate this wall of gibberish into English? It looks like they are trying real hard to sanitize any input on the matter, but I might just kirk out being American, ""Respect commentator authority"" and all that jazz."
1040,isfj,"It's not something ""so deep than can't get away"" tho. It's new, and solvable, imho. I also don't think just abandoning him is a good idea. 
It's a vicious circle, the key is to break it. 
Maybe it's caused by something deep down that I don't know about, sure, I'm not omniscient... But from what I see, it's probably solvable."
1041,isfj,"I can always try to convince him, but I personally don't think it's depression. But since I'm no psychologist, that's that... I know it's a real issue/epidemic, but I also think it's overblown a bit on the internet ? People just diagnose other people online, with no training, nor the necessary info."
1042,isfj,"Now, that's an useful comment/perspective.
Tbh, this almost happened, and it's not like I'm that close with him. I'm his brother, not his SO, and tbh, I'm a bit of an asshole to him. Anyway, he almost was at that point where he just says it. I didn't push it further, because I didn't see as a solution at all. (I guess we INTP don't need that kind of release... Never did it in my life, or maybe when I was little. Always prided myself on solving it myself. ) "
1043,isfj,The first step to solving a problem is realizing that it exists. If you tell me it's not gibberish and you are all well and good then wherein lies the problem? I am not here to dictate how you run your life. I am a commentator and like every couch potato before me I commentate not dictate or as you say tittle about?
1044,isfj,"So, you get to criticize my post, but I don't get to criticze  your comment ? 
Well, you're a commentator. I should bow.
Maybe you're right in your first, and it's something about being American. ""The customer ris King"", and all that...."
1045,isfj,"I read through the answer key and it's pretty clearly biased. However, I have no qualms about the bias it has. I think the greater revelation for me was that I stuck pretty heavily to my choice and agreed with it's assessment of me.
Though I would question the way this test assumed ""happiness,"" I think looking at how it did it would point out something important about our society. Who ever wrote this considers selfishness inherently mean spirited and associates personal moral greed among the lowest ways to live one's life. Whereas generosity and the ability to forgive and forget seem more ideal when it comes to deriving happiness. I don't want to give anything away from the answer key in case one of you would like to take it fresh, but I'd honestly like to hear people's arguments for or against the ultimate moral ordering's assessments of people who chose what ever order they picked. 
That's where my revelation came from. The people I know and love the most happen to be like that, where they can forgive, forget, and are generally nurturing. They may not factually forget misdeeds, but they work towards happiness instead of allowing things, no matter how egregious, to get in between them and their loved ones. 
Thanks for this, I enjoyed thinking all around it and I plan to forward this to friends. 
For anyone wondering, I selected JMSR. "
1046,isfj,"I went with MJRS. 
Marion in my opinion made a great sacrifice to save two others. John did nothing overtly wrong. Robin back stabbed Marion pretty much, and I dislike him/his actions the most. But the sheriff was the cause of the whole situation in the first place so he is last."
1047,isfj,"I picked the same. The answer I got was as follows: You are the slightly romantic realist. You respect truth, and are broadminded and flexible. Whether you are a man or a woman you are probably a happy person. You like people and they can readily make friends with you. You are not very adventurous, but this does not bother you."
1048,isfj,"It's starting to bother me. It's only been a week and three days (and counting) though, so I guess it's still normal. But, every single day I reminisce more than thrice. Shit. Hurts. :/ How long until this fades away? If only my friend would welcome me back, that'd be great. But, that ain't happening."
1049,isfj,"i try not to think of stuff like this as an on and off switch. it's a slow fade. and trying to count down until it's done only makes it slower. 
there is more to your life than this person. keep focusing on those things that also matter but you can actually do something about aside from waiting. eventually you'll be fine when it fades beyond a certain point."
1050,isfj,"My friend is an INTP and this is similar to the state of our friendship. She said I'm still a friend, but she'd rather I only talk to her if it's necessary. Translate = if I don't need anything from her, leave her alone. Even if means years.
Must be an INTP thing. Weird and unconventional to us, but probably normal to them.
I feel you. You're hurt. Yes. I was there. Don't be hurt. Your friendships hasn't ended. You're still friends. INTPs just have a different understanding of friendship. Don't expect him to ever contact you to ask how your life's doing. Just know that when you need him, he'll be there. Imho the way I see it, INTPs see friends more like objects, in a sense. They're used for their purpose/abilities, not for social needs. Or maybe it's just her. I don't know, I'm still in the process of understanding INTPs."
1051,isfj,"I only get like that with romantic interests
I had a really close relationship with my sister growing up and we grew apart after a few incidents. and even then it isn't like what you're describing. maybe i'm more detached than other isfj's when it comes to family and friends."
1052,isfj,"It might last even longer than that, depending on the friendship. I (INTJ) lost a close ENFP friend and it's kinda different because I was romantically interested in him, but the loss of the friendship itself still hurts three years later. I don't think about it every day or even every week and the emotional pain itself is nonexistent but I still think about him and regret the actions I took that led to the loss of our friendship. The best thing I could do was move forward and take the knowledge I gained from that circumstance and use it to make my future relationships even better."
1053,isfj,"Okay,  fuck. I can't stop thinking about her. What we used to have. I can't stop reading old conversations. I can't forget when everything reminds me of her. My tablet reminds me of her. Just waking up reminds me of her, because back then the moment I wake up I'd check my phone for messages from her. 
Sometimes I develop feelings of hatred. Like, I wish I hadn't met her if I knew I was gonna hurt, yet at the same time all I want is for things to be back the way it was.
Bro, I'm losing sleep here. 3:41am and I still got classes tomorrow. Fuck is this."
1054,isfj,"I pick up a hobby. Usually something physical. Like working out and martial arts. There are a lot of benefits for dealing with this stuff.
1) you are spending time in a new place where you don't have reminders to old memories.
2) you are spending time with people to distract you.
3) you start to think about nutrition or moves or form/forms throughout the day which also distracts you.
4) you are doing an activity where effort leads directly to results and goal hitting. That feels good in the brain .
5) aside from that there are more feel good chemicals that get released with physical activity. And they help fill the void of happy chemicals you relied on before.
6) hitting goals over and over is a regular reminder of positive change. It's slow, but it's observable, and it gives hope.
7) you also improve yourself. And that's a sweet bonus."
1055,isfj,"Hi everyone, love from an INFP
My mother is an ISFJ who's retired in the last couple of years. Almost every day she says she's bored and doesn't know what to do. She's dabbled in many hobbies over the years (including different forms of painting) but nothing has stuck. She loses interest quickly and her reasons for quitting are often people-based e.g. she couldn't get along with the others in the group. She's good at many things but she underrates herself and doesn't stick with anything long enough to improve or to fulfill her life
What hobbies would you guys recommend? How do you stick to them?
Also, any tips for making friends?
Thank you thank you thank you"
1056,isfj,"(ISFJ here) I rotate between hobbies like crazy. Reading, video games, playing music, doing embroidery, coloring.. You name it. The problem is I never get too good at something, but I do like having varied interests. And I don't get bored with them.
edit: I can understand why your mom wouldn’t like something because of the group of people. For me, the activities I stick to the most involve socializing because I enjoy the company of people I like. I am part of a few meet ups. But I don’t have the time or energy for all of them so I am currently deciding which ones I thrive from the most. So maybe she needs to find a group or meet up with people she likes. That could be very invigorating."
1057,isfj,"I am very interested in applying the myers-briggs in real life situations, which means I often have to ""type"" people. So I am interested in how easy it is for ISFJs in particular to tell the difference in other people they meet. "
1058,isfj,"To my understanding, each of the four traits is on a spectrum, so how easily I can tell their preference depends on how strongly they express it. :) Some people are easier to read than others. However, since ISFJs can be pretty observant and detail-oriented (I know I am), it is something I like to pay attention to."
1059,isfj,"INFP here -- I can usually tell if someone ""lives in the present"" or is more ""forward-thinking"". For INxx, we have our own ""rich inner world"" and tend to live in our own minds a lot; if someone else is an introvert (quiet, reserved; needs ""recovery"" time after a social interaction), and lacks this ""rich inner world"" (I have one, I can tell), then I can determine that they are Sensing.      
For Extroverts, look for if they are ""living in the moment"" or if they are constantly talking about thing that they want to do and stuff that hasn't happened yet. The ENxx people I know talk about things they want to do later, or things they could do. ESxx people, especially ESxP people, tend to ""live in the moment"" and have ""a lot of energy"" - depending on who you are, they are exciting or overwhelming.   
I hope that helped!!   :)"
1060,isfj,"I would recommend researching Cognitive Functions - It's a very accurate way of typing once you get the hang of it. Here's a quick summary of difference in functions to look for between S and N:
Se: Lives in the moment; totally aware of their environment
Si: Nostalgic; compares the present to the past; traditional
Ne: Can predict all possible outcomes of a situation; visionary
Ni: Knows things intuitively without evidence; has big ideas"
1061,isfj,"Spring break has started.  I've gotten the vibe for a couple of months now that things were ""off"" with my friends, but yesterday really put things into frame for me.  In our group chat, they started texting me telling me I'm annoying, fake, self-centered, etc.  They told me it's embarrassing going out with me because I've never learned to swim or ride a bike.  They told me I dress like I'm 10, and that they created a new group chat to get away from me.  They said they still want to be friends with me, just ""not close friends.""  I've found new people to sit with at lunch, but I feel like the way they handled things was ridiculously harsh.  I hadn't even known that they had all these problems with me.  Some people told me I should cut them off.  I'm glad that I have other people around me to support me, but I can't say that this hasn't been a huge blow to my self-esteem.  It sounds like I really need to work on becoming a better person - I didn't even know that I had all these problems, and I can't tell whether they're over-blowing it, or if I need to change myself to go back to them.  I kind of don't want to go back to them, but I also don't want to have bad blood and just cut all of them off.  I still think that there are serious problems with the way they treated me that they all refuse to acknowledge.
So, fellow ISFJ's: what would you do if this situation hit you?"
1062,isfj,"Oh no... I'm so sorry you had to go through this. First of all - really happy to hear you have other people to hang out with. My advice is to work on your new friendships, and not spend too much time thinking about the old ones. I would say that what they did is just mean. First time I hear that not swimming or riding a bike makes you a bad friend (it doesn't.). Sometimes people realize what they have done and apologizes later on. Sometimes they don't. 
Be yourself. And rather hang out with people who likes you for who you are, instead of with people trying to change you into something they like.  
Greetings from Norway. "
1063,isfj,"I went through some serious mean friend drama when I was in middle school and high school. I suggest: know your worth and move on from them. Please know that their (ridiculous) opinions of you do not define who you actually are. I used to feel shame and guilt because other people made me think I should, and the truth is, each person is unique and special for what they are, and should be appreciated. You can find people who appreciate you for you, and until then, I would focus on all the things you like about yourself and the things you do well and are passionate about. "
1064,isfj,"Something similar happened to me when I was 15 with my two best friends at the time. They told me there was a problem and that I would say things that were ""unnecessary"" and ""weren't funny"" and that I talked too much about certain topics. The one friend, I'll call her ""L"", was notorious for picking fights with me and I believe that she influenced my other friend to be part of this confrontation. Afterwards, I was so insecure that I was doing everything I could to win their approval (especially L's). Spoiler alert: I was never ""good enough"" for L.
For YEARS I blamed myself and had terrible anxiety about saving our friendship but in reality, she didn't want to cross the bridges I built for her. Our friendship fizzled out with time and as an adult, I am SO relieved we aren't friends.
Please, don't waste your time or your tears on these people. They aren't your friends. They're being bullies and they don't have your best interests at heart. You will never win their approval and that's ok. You have other friends who DO care for you and see the others for who they are. Stick with them. You'll save yourself from a lot of drama."
1065,isfj,"Intp here, i'd say nothing comes from nowhere but most people have a tendency to overblow most situations. I'd say take your time to go over what they said and try to find both truth and discrepencies in their statements.
I wouldn't keep on being their friends if i were you because wanting to be friends, just not close friends sounds like you're just a backup plan in case everything else backfires. Stay away from them but do consider their opinions. You'll have a lot of filetring to do but you might be able to find some constructive critisism in there, hidden in the shit cake. Good luck"
1066,isfj,"As an ENTP happy to hijack your question, I'm willing to offer a (hopefully) unforeseen perspective.
You need to realize you're a more capable killer than you think. For all you know it might be them with the problem, so quit beating yourself up, (while also, quitting the things you know you shouldn't do). Ttake a breath, self-analyze, and slap yourself in the face a few times in the bathroom, cause you're going into war here.
Without saying anything to them for a day or two, walk up super ""sassy-like"" during lunch and sit down with them saying something like ""what's up bitches"". (war zone) When they ask you what the  you're doing, you tell them you want to know what their problem is. They're being jerks, so show them you can cut the crap and bust some lips if need be.
Or become friends with your new lunch mates, but I have no suggestions on how to feel satisfied without at least trying to be a complete scourge on them. Girls seem to be pretty innovative in that area though.
Instead of comparing yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday."
1067,isfj,"I have experienced this first hand. Your friends probably put off telling you their true feelings for a few months now because they did not want to hurt your feelings. At this point, you are better off just ignoring them and their toxic energy. I would suggest talking to one of them to tell them how this made you feel and that you know you are better off without them too. Focus on your new friends instead. They don't deserve you and you certainly don't need to go back to them. If you are uncomfortable facing them atm, it is totally fine. Just don't internalize your problem forever and confront them when you feel better."
1068,isfj,"I did cut them out, and I'm very happy I did.  They were telling me - and I'm not over exaggerating here, I was literally told this - that I had to shop for new clothes, learn to swim, and learn to ride my bike if I wanted to hang out with them again.  They told me that they ""may have been harsh"" but that they were not sorry.  And the entire time I was thinking ""really?  After what you just pulled, I'm the one that needs to change?""  Those four conspired against me, talked behind my back, and in the end... they still think that they're in the right.  I'm willing to learn to swim.  I'm willing to learn to ride a bike.  But I'm going to do those things on my own terms.  I'm not going to do them because I'm apparently ""hindering their plans"" or because they want to stop feeling guilty for not inviting me places.  What they did was shitty.  They sat there and told me that I needed to change, but the honest truth is that they all need to change.
Upon telling others about this situation, I've been told by every single person, both at my school, on Reddit, and even in another group chat I have on Facebook, that I was in the right here.  And I'm happy that I cut them off.  I don't need that in my life anyway.  
Thank you for your comment - having others validate my feelings has been helpful, and helped me recognize that I'm not 100% in the wrong here."
1069,isfj,"I did waste a lot of tears on them, and I definitely wasted a lot of time on them.  I cut them off today, and a response I received was, ""okay, whatevs,"" and when I said I was sorry for anything I might have done, ""idc lol.""  It just hurts so much to know that sometimes people who you really cared about don't care about you back at all.  It hurts to know that people who you spent so much time on give 0 fucks about you or your life.  It hurts. 
And now I'm worried that everyone I know hates me, so there's that."
1070,isfj,"I cut them off, but now I feel even worse because none of them cared about my presence - I mean, one of them said, ""okay whatevs,"" and then ""idc,"" when I tried to say I was sorry for the way things were ending between us.  I mean, I didn't think they were that terrible of people, you know?  And they broke my self-esteem down.  I just don't really know what to do about this situation.  "
1071,isfj,"I agree on it sounding like a backup plan.  In fact, one of them even directly told me a few months ago that they sometimes remain friends with someone ""just in case they need them in the future.""  
I do understand why they didn't directly tell me some of these things.  I did have a tendency toward holding grudges at one point, but I've gotten over that now, and I can see how that might have effected things, but they also complained when I tried to sit down and discuss my feelings with them.  It seems like I could never do anything right for them.  I'm trying to not let what happened have a big effect on my self-esteem, because I know that what they said wasn't the most important thing ever.  But it still does hurt."
1072,isfj,"Ooh, I like this post!  I do want to follow your advice here after spring break has ended.  And no, I'm not a female in my early twenties, I'm 13 (14 in a few days!) - are women in their early 20's still this level of immature?  Lmao, what really got me about what they told me is the fact that they said ""don't tell anyone we did this, everyone's gonna take your side because you're sooo nice"" and so it's like... you know that what you're doing is wrong, but you're doing it anyway.
I do remember them mentioning to me that I talk too much about school, which I guess could be true?  But I'm always worrying about school because nowadays, it seems like you have to do so much to assure that your college goals work out, or at least that's what it seems to me.  But then again, my plan is to go to a community college and transfer... so maybe it isn't like that."
1073,isfj,"My problem is that they all called me toxic.  They basically told me I have to dress better and change myself to hang out with them.  I cried until my stomach hurt.  I had to call a suicide hotline because I couldn't take it.  The worst thing for me, really, is that none of them care at all.  I almost killed myself today, and to them, they were in the right because they ""told their truth.""  I just feel like I've hit rock bottom."
1074,isfj,"You made a wise choice and I am so sorry you had to go through this. It's okay to feel the way the way you feel right now. Your emotions are 100% valid and important regardless of how your (ex)friends minimized them.
 If I was in your shoes, I would be feeling the same way. Time will heal your heart. I hope you have friends/family/mentors you can share these insecurities with so that they can support you. Even so, there are a handful of kind internet strangers here that support you and would offer a listening ear.
You have value and worth, OP. "
1075,isfj,"Of course it hurts, and that's normal, unless you're an NTP. The thing is that you cant let everything that hurts go lower your self esteem. 
I am 97% emotionally constipated so maybe my opinion isn't too too valid but i do thint that you have to compartmentalize critisism/ borderline bullying and self esteem differently. The filter in between the 2 HAS to be managed by your Ti otherwise you end up with no self esteem. Best way to do that i find is to ask for confirmation from other people around, mainly objective people that know you well and aren't attached to the situation. "
1076,isfj,"They just did something that really stressed me out though
They thought I told someone what happened since they told me not to tell anyone and then they started texting me individually, saying I was going to ruin their reputations and that we should maybe make amends just so people wouldn't think they were bad people.  And they tried to make me feel bad because they supposedly get ""bullied"" all the time
And now I just hate my life 
But thank you, and I'm sorry for that emotional dump, I'm just not in a very good place emotionally right now "
1077,isfj,"Thank you, and I've had people from school reach out to me after learning about the situation as well and tell me that what my former friend group did was wrong, regardless.  I know that I'm not perfect.  I don't know how to do everything. But what they did to me was verbal abuse.  I'm a person, and I deserve a chance to move forward in life."
1078,isfj,"I followed your advice, and the people I asked have told me that I was in the right in this situation, and that what my former friend group did to me was, as one person said, ""pretty much bullying."" I was told that I was right to cut them off, and I have 7 different people who I'm set to try sitting with at lunch when spring break has ended.  I'm very happy I took your advice, and I want to thank you for it.  For the past two days, I was blaming myself for what happened - I felt that maybe I wasn't worthy of anything because people who I thought I mattered to had been talking about me, and took to insulting me all at once.  But today I've realized that even though I absolutely wasn't a perfect friend... what they did to me was unacceptable.  And the insults that they hurled toward me say more about their immaturity than they do about who I am.  I've realized that I can't allow what they think to effect my entire life - sometimes I need to put myself first, and in this situation, that's an important thing.  If they had come to me casually with what bothered them, then we might be in a very different spot right now.
I've tried my best to look at this situation from a rational viewpoint, and when I do that, it makes me feel so much better.  I think that sometimes what I really need to do is emotionally remove myself from the situation."
1079,isfj,"No problem, i'm glad i could help. 
My gf is ISFJ and i've noticed that whatever the situation, she'll take up the weight of the world on her shoulders. I know how much these things affect you guys and i'm glad you could find a little solace with my advice. 
Don't forget that once in a while, it's okay to be a self-righteous asshole. And as hard as real communication with others can be, the only true way to see the world is by combining multiple viewpoints.
Best of luck with your future friends."
1080,isfj,"I'm not sure if this is an ""ISFJ"" thing or if I am more anxious than others... (also a bit of a long post/rant, sorry)
I am very afraid of not knowing what will happen in the future. Just thinking about the future makes me nervous because all I see are uncertainties. Nothing is truly ""certain"" and I will worry about it until finally something is figured out. I honestly cannot remember a time in my life where I was just content to be--I always find something to worry about. Probably the best time was when I was in highschool (before junior/senior year) because then I knew ""next year, I'll be in school!""
Right now I am going to be graduating college next June. Not knowing what I will be doing after that is terrifying me. I am stressing out about it right now and it's not even that near to June. I'm also stressing out about my schedule for next quarter-- this leads to me guilt. I feel so guilty that I didn't double major or at least minor in something -- because I feel like it would have been so easy if only I figured out my major sooner and didn't take so many elective classes. I am getting over it now, but yesterday I almost wanted to cry because I realized too late that it would be easy to add on a Minor in communications or something -- but now I only have two quarters left and can't squeeze in those 4 extra classes! I feel guilty like I wasted my mom's money (she's paid for my tuition) or that I just should have done things so much differently...
I don't know if it is normal to be this stressed out or not. I have been having shoulder pain for the past few years and I think it is due to stress. Side story: two years ago, I was in so much pain for a few days that I went to the on-campus health clinic and they told me something (can't remember) but it didn't help... I then called my mom and she said ""try relaxing your shoulders"" and I had to consciously try to... and then the pain was relieved. I had literally just been tensing my shoulders for so long and my body was not subconsciously relaxing them...
Is this normal? At this point I am not sure if I should be on some kind of anti-anxiety medication or not. I would rather not if possible but it's starting to seem like maybe it would benefit me. But I don't even know, I almost feel guilty thinking something is that wrong with me... I don't know how to explain. I don't want to be that person who has to take medication for something as minor as anxiety.
But the guilt really gets at me. I get guilty when I feel like I am not doing things I should be / should have. I procrastinate but the whole time I am stressing out because I should be doing something else--I can't even relax while procrastinating. If I know I have a big project due in a month, if I don't work on it I'm not being carefree and happy, I'm stressing out about how I'm not working on it! (even though I know I always get things done on time -- I've never made a failing grade or even come close to that...)
And the fear of uncertainty is starting to worry me because I feel that what will my life be when nothing is ever really certain? Will I ever just relax and be happy with where I am, or will I always be worried about where I am going? I know I can plan ahead to some extent, but that doesn't always satisfy me. Even writing this post, I am starting to tense up and have to remind myself ""relax."" But my shoulders always start to tense up until I actively remind myself to relax them...
Does anyone here have experience to this or can anyone relate/give advice?"
1081,isfj,"Hey! I'm not sure that my situation is exactly like yours, and I'm also not sure if it's a personality type thing, or a pumpkinmuffinz thing, but for what it's worth, I, too, often feel inappropriately ""guilty."" I also experience anxiety, but as I learn more about myself and the world around me, I am able to control it better on my own. 
I am a chronic worrywart. I worry about shit that other people don't even notice. Every little detail stresses me out. I even worry about feelings or thoughts that I assign to others, when they don't actually exist. (So, like, I get really stressed and worried that my SO thinks I'm a terrible person for wanting to skip the gym today, and then I feel guilty for skipping the gym, and then I feel righteous, like, I should be able to skip the gym right, so then I'm annoyed at him, and then I'm guilty for feeling annoyed at him because it's my fault in the first place for skipping the gym... and on and on until I talk to him and find out that all along, he didn't care one bit that I skipped the gym, and hadn't given it much thought beyond ""okay, I know I am working out alone today instead of with pumpkinmuffinz."") 
As I've gotten older, I've been able to have better emotional control, and I've developed the ability to step back, reflect, and think critically rather than just freaking out over every little thing. Something that has really helped is putting effort into being more vulnerable, and being okay with it. Instead of stewing and being upset over things, I am making more of an effort to just talk to the person(s) involved, and put my feelings out there. Yes, I still get nervous doing this, and I still risk someone judging me or thinking I'm silly or dumb or whatever. But, I'm also working really hard to just not give a fuck what other people think, with the exception of a few close individuals. 
With regard to your future, I get that. The future used to scare the crapola out of me, although these days, I find myself being a little bit more laid back. I often find myself thinking ""I don't know if this is the right choice but this is the choice I am making and I have faith that everything will work out as it is supposed to."" It's hard to give up that control, but I've had to do it, because otherwise I debate over every possible scenario and outcome, and I end up never taking action because I'm too busy processing every potential outcome of that action. I look back now and realize that in my past, I have not always made the best decisions, but whatever consequences I have faced, I've been able to overcome and work my way out of. I'm scrappy, and I've taken the good with the bad to help me better myself and make more informed future decisions. When I was in college, though, literal, physical sickness that the thought of ""holy shit, i have not idea what i want to do when I grow up"" was a real thing. 
While I still feel uneasy about things sometimes (yep, just turned 25 and still sometimes wake up thinking ""wtf am i doing with my life right now""), my advice is this: try to appreciate yourself as you are, right now, today, in this moment. Yes, you have to think about the future and you have to plan for it, but you can't skip out on today just because you were too busy thinking about tomorrow. You are wonderful the way you are, and you're okay, and chances are, you are not the only person to have felt the way you are feeling or to have thought what you are thinking. Have a little faith in yourself. You'll make things work and you'll figure your shit out as it comes. And hey, if reddit doesn't do it for you, seek out someone else to talk with about this. There are a wealth of resources available to you (especially on a university campus) but you have to be the one to seek them out. Also, it's worth noting that anxiety is not always a ""minor"" thing, and there should be no shame in dealing with that in whatever way works for you, medication or not. Seeing a counselor or therapist may provide you with alternative coping mechanisms, like practicing mindfulness techniques or meditating. But, you know, you are who you are, and it doesn't make you any less awesome if you need to take something for it. 
SORRY for this super long rant! I didn't intend to write something this long! I hope this is helpful, even if it just reassures you that you aren't alone. Also, because I am a career adviser and I feel really passionate about these things... seek out your career development department on campus if you are having anxiety about what you'll be doing after graduation! They are there to support you!  They can assit you in identifying what types of jobs you are interested in (if you don' t already know), and they can also help you to prepare for job searching (resume writing, cover letters, networking, interviewing, etc. etc. etc!). With your adviser, you have a team member in your corner to back you up, and, trust me, they won't ever judge you for your situation or your questions. They'll just be happy you came in and are taking steps to get the resources you need! "
1082,isfj,"I get so stressed with the future, that i immediately block it out. I don't know what i'll be doing in the future, but it's something that i just learned how to tune out and not think about it. Sorry i can't give any actual advice other than ""see what happens"", but it just came naturally to me after a few years of stressing out.
I understand the guilt with procrastination. No matter how hard i tried to ignore something for a later date, it was always there, nagging at me. To resolve this, i stopped using a calendar. I stopped planning out anything farther than a week away, unless it was necessary, like a due date for a school project. It helped, but it still affects me, although not as much anymore.
Also, anxiety can be serious. I've had an anxiety attack so bad recently, i made myself sick and actually got nauseous over it, nearly throwing up. It isn't something to take lightly."
1083,isfj,"Oh I get dreadfully anxious when talking about the future, specifically if it involves money. My SO always loves to talk about possible trips to take and all I immediately think of is how can I afford that, or what do I have to do to prepare for it. I can definitely relate to the anxiety aspect. It kills me"
1084,isfj,"I'm a big worrier myself, so I can relate. But from my experience, whether you declare a second major or a minor isn't as important as the classes you take and what you get out of them. I don't often think back on how I filled out the paperwork to declare a business minor, but I do remember how I learned this or that useful tidbit from an economics or finance course. Since you've taken a lot of electives, there must have been some of them that you enjoyed and have learned from.
If you're still interested in choosing a minor, you might find that some of the electives you've taken can count toward one, leaving fewer extra classes for you to take in your last few quarters."
1085,isfj,"Hey, I'm a 17 y/o. I just got out of treatment for anxiety and depression. I learned a few things.
Guilt: If your trying your best, there's nothing to feel bad about. I ask you to treat yourself as good as you treat others. Don't say anything to yourself that you wouldn't be willing to say someone else. Reassure yourself just as you would a friend.
Anxiety: Understand that in all these situations the only thing you can control is you. You decide how you react. If you really really don't have any options, try to learn something from the ordeal. Let those lessons marinate in your mind instead of all those negative thoughts.
I struggle with the vacation thing too. I realized that it was just speculation, that is, make-believe. When reading a fairy tale you would question about castle construction, so don't about beach houses either. There is no lesson to retain but there is information. Store these ideas in your Si memory bank to use later when you're better financially."

Doesnt look like there are many matching in the thread. The definitions on the website seem a little wishy washy though. Each of those 9 types could be made up by anybody. "
1089,isfj,"How it works is that there are three centers  (feeling, gut, thinking) 2,3,4 are feeling types deal with the heart. 5,6,7 are thinking types deal with the mind. 8,9,1 are gut types deal with action or inaction. In your tritype you have a number in each center. You have your core (dominant) type which comes first. Than you have a number in each center which deals with matters in that center. So for instance I’m a 925 so 9 is my core type, 2 is my feeling or heart type, and 5 is my thinking or head type. If you google enneagram tritype they can give you more information on it. "
1090,isfj,"ENFP female here curious about ISFJ male. I met him and have never found someone so easy to be around. I felt listened to, respected, adored, and vice versa. Constant smiling and fun. We saw each other for a few weeks pretty consistently and we had sex multiple times. His work schedule changed and he had to go out of town for a week so we just finished two weeks without seeing each other. 
Before he left I was a little upset because we didn’t get to see each other even though we both said we wanted to. He calmed me down,  called me when I asked him to and we talked through it. We both might be in a position of moving in the next few months, him sooner than I but neither a sure thing by any means. He said he doesn’t want to get too deep into anything because of this. I asked if he liked me and he said “yes, and I WILL see you when i get back.” We talked minimally while he was gone, random Snapchats here and there. Mostly every other day or so I’d send one and he was always responsive. The last day he sent me one that was incredibly sweet and specific to me in a “thinking of you” sort of way. 
Well, he just got back to town and he text me a bit (initiated by me) about his trip. He was with a bunch of work buddies there and now he told me he has to work extra shifts at his other job for his coverage while he was gone. So I know he is going to be busy. I told him I missed him and he responded with:
“I had some time to think too. I’m not saying I didn’t miss you but I think what’s going on is that the introvert in me is really coming out right now. I tend to go through phases where I just don’t like being around people. That’s also kind of how my past relationships have gone. We’ll hang out for a little while, then I just kind of shut down and stop talking. I don’t know what my problem is. I just have a hard time figuring out what it is that I want I guess.”
Is this his way of breaking things off with me but in a let me down gently type deal? I know I don’t know him that well yet but he is such an incredible human and I want to keep getting to know him. I like him and I don’t mind giving him space if that is what he needs. I am just so confused. I explained my side to him and hope it doesn’t scare him off."
1091,isfj,I’m not afraid of you guys hurting my feelings. They are already hurt and I am just want to find some clarity or see a different perspective. And yes I am giving him space and working on myself for now. Help?
1092,isfj,"I think he is trying to let you down softly. 
I do like my own space and time to myself but I've never have shut down and not talked. If a woman smothers me (eg sends a messages every day and wants to hangout every time we are free it usually wears me out) i am usually fine as long as I have 2 to 3 nights a week to do my own thing. 
So if the you really do like the guy maybe give him space and check in a week later but usually when someone goes on break like that it's usually the end. "
1093,isfj,"Hey, DJMaxAlex, just a quick heads-up:
foward is actually spelled forward. You can remember it by begins with for-.
Have a nice day!

1094,isfj,"ISFJs are known to have a hard time ending a relationship, especially getting over it. They are very loyal and committed people, so I was wondering, why didn't your first relationship work out? How long did it take you to move on?
Short story: ISFJ friend has been with ISFx friend for over three years. They're more like best friends labeling themselves in a relationship. It's very stagnant with not many sparks; so it's a healthy relationship, just not healthy for them. "
1095,isfj,"Not first, but most serious and longest. Got married right out of high school and stayed that way for 7 years, despite being miserable within the first year. I liked her as a person and cared for her a lot, but she was not really ready to be a wife. Needed taken care of, was not able to be a partner for me or meet me in the middle. But, I couldn't let go. I felt it was my duty to meet my commitment.
It wasn't until something happened that showed me just how fragile life was, and also how much I had run myself raw before I knew I needed out."
1096,isfj,"Five years ago, when I was fifteen, I met this amazing guy. Online.
It was over a game, and I developed a really close relationship with a few people over this game. Before I knew it, I fell in love with him.We lived in different countries. I, loved this guy. I would have dreams about taking bullets for him, etc. I sent him little letters and small birthday gifts. He said he felt the same way. But he never did anything for me, sometimes he would say really sweet things, and it would mean a lot, because he wasn't very emotional to begin with.
We got into an argument in the first year, and then made up. We decided that we'd like to meet some day, and that we wouldn't ""see"" other people, or grow emotionally attached to others. But at the same time, we wouldn't call it official until we met.
I end up meeting him for the first time after 4 years. It was amazing, one of the greatest, most satisfying and happiest moments of my life.. And his actions for once, matched his words.. I thought I would honestly marry this boy someday.
When I got home, we were talking and I asked if he saw a future with me, and I guess he was uncertain.. He said he loved him, and that he always have, and that it was him. Not me.. But I never understood that.. Which broke my heart.. Because I was 100% certain sure about how I felt about him. When we were ""together"", sometimes I was depressed, sometimes I was really happy, all because of him. He could never pin-point how he felt about me, and always kept me just.. hanging. And it wasn't a real way to live a life.. I can't be half happy , half sad.
It's been seven months since, and I feel a lot better than I ever have. But still, when I'm not keeping myself busy, I am sad about it. I miss him, and I still miss him more than anything. 
I wish I could get over it, but it's hard.. 
I think about this all the time, and my friends know.. But I never say anything about it any more. It's kind of nice telling someone about it.."
1097,isfj,"The reason at the time was religious differences but in hindsight it wasn't a great relationship anyway, it was just my first one. And once I'd made the commitment, I didn't know how to let go. He didn't have a great family and I was determined not to be another person who abandoned him so we stayed together for over two years. We broke up nearly ten years ago though and we're both engaged to other people now. 
I've definitely had an extremely hard time getting over relationships and have been told I'm loyal to a fault several times. I almost missed out on my fiance because I was still dealing with the end of my previous relationship when we met. Thank goodness I changed my mind and called him back!"
1098,isfj,"When ii came out I met my first bf online and then decided to meet up at some club. I'd like to believe that we had good relationship but looking back at it now, it was a bit self destructive. I didn't even end things. He messaged me through MySpace saying he wasn't interested after maybe not seeing him for a month because he was visiting family. I held on for way longer than I should have but it almost took a year to get over him. That and he'd text him saying bs stuff like he missed me and I should come over. Finally after giving in and visiting him I knew I was over it. Now I'm living with my current bf with our roommates and everything is great!"
1099,isfj,"(discovered this sub a few days ago so I'm commenting on ALL of the old posts)
dated an INTJ for 9 months, realized it wasn't going to work out after around month 3 due to complete lack of emotional connection/communication (we connected on a ""you're an interesting person to talk to"" level but not the ""you're an interesting person who I have a lot in common with and I find you very attractive"", + if something was bothering him he wouldn't say it and I hate playing the guessing game) but had no idea how to break it off kindly because I really hate hurting people's feelings.  we're still friends now but I'm still not sure whether some part of him thinks he still has a chance.
for some odd reason INTJs seem to express interest in me frequently, and I'm not sure why."
1100,isfj,"It is hard to get over people, it's very difficult, especially those we throw ourselves so wholeheartedly at who don't return our strength of emotion. Just have to take it a day at a time and really focus on moving on rather than dwelling on the past which can be oh so tempting. Here's hoping you can find the strength to move on and find someone who can reciprocate your feelings :)"
1101,isfj,"This really hits home with me right now.  My relationship ended about a year and a half ago, but without the clean break-up.  He was still a part of my life everyday.  Two days ago he decided to cut me out of his life completely.
He was the one to pursue me, and wanted to jump whole-heartedly into the relationship.  We had been friends for about a year before that.  While we were together, he was the one to want to fix everything, keep going when I had doubts.  He poured his heart out to me, he shared his deep dark thoughts and insecurities with me, he was willing to accept my flaws.  He was always there.  Until one day, he just snapped.  His personality changed.  He was cold and insensitive because I had said something a couple months before that had really hurt him.  He never got over it, even though I tried with actions and words to show how profusely sorry I was.
He moved out, but never really broke up with me.  We were in a relationship limbo for months.  He said we needed to be friends before getting back together.  Said he still cared about me.  So I tried my hardest to deal with this awkward situation of being kept at arms-length.  Needless to say, it didn't work.  I ended up feeling manipulated for a year and a half after .  But I was willing to subject myself to it just on the off chance that he would change his mind.  It wasn't healthy.
The pain is just about unbearable.  I poured my heart out to him the last time I talked to him and basically his response was ""I wasn't trying to rekindle things with you.""  I'm dwelling on everything that was good, and wondering why he doesn't feel the same way I do.  It's like poking at a toothache.  It hurts but I can't stop!
Thanks for sharing your story.  Maybe it helps to hear someone else is in a similar situation."
1102,isfj,"A little, I'm not religious, and I think there is no ""point"" to life. But I think morals are important as well as being a good member of society. Why not be comphy and have fun while we live out our pointless, meaningless lives?"
1103,isfj,"Well, I won't lie, sometimes I do have nihilistic thoughts.  I understand that the world - government, school, workforce - is all a ""system"" and even though I intend to follow the system, I have respect for those who break away from ""the system"" because deep down, I disagree with the way the world works to some extent and feel that life doesn't really have a meaning.  That's why I try to give my life meaning by aiming for what I'd like to do, and trying to help out others."
1104,isfj,"My mother is an ISFJ. She grew up in an abusive home, and at 62, still hasn't recovered from it. She still keeps in touch with her parents, bottling it up and acting like nothing happened. She has a temper and is prone to angry outbursts. I know she means well, and just has a lot of emotional baggage without any idea of what to do with it. I think she honestly doesn't understand that even though she didn't physically abuse my brothers and I, she passed on the psychological abuse. She also abuses my disabled father, even physically.
I can't just pretend it never happened. I have tried to talk to her about it before, but she gets very defensive. Do you have any tips on how to talk to her without making her feel attacked?"
1105,isfj,"Personally, when I get defensive, it's easy for me to start building a mental wall, one brick at a time.. Especially if it's for a good reason.. But unfortunately, I'm not always justified.
I think the best approach you could use is easing into the topic that's most troublesome.. 
Myself, I find it easier to confront people by laying all my cards down on the table.. Never take an aggressive approach.  Have a silver tongue and be gentle with words.
Be comforting but be direct.
If things start to head south, that's probably because she didn't pick up your frequency and refuses to meet in the middle.
Judging by the situation, that would be pretty difficult to do.
Good luck to you.  "
1106,isfj,"Winter!  I love the cold and being warm and cozy inside.  Sleeping cuddled under blankets.  No bugs (mosquitoes, wasps, gnats, horseflies, chiggers, ticks, all plague me), so taking walks outside is enjoyable.  I like the short days and it getting dark early.  Living in a warmer climate, winter never lasts long enough for me.  
This might be a bit weird?  I'm a night owl and feel happier and more energetic at night.  The heat and long days of summer make me depressed.  It's like I have opposite SAD."
1107,isfj,Summer. I love warm summer nights and how it stays light really late. Fall is my second favorite. I like the changing colors of trees and all or the holidays. I just don’t like how when we change the clocks back it gets dark at like 3pm. 
1108,isfj,"Naturally I want to say autumn but it’s probably spring bc that’s when everything comes to life again! The sun shines, flowers bloom, the fresh scent💚 
*This can also be bc I live in a predominately rainy area, but then again rainbows :))))"
1109,isfj,"Fall, right up through Christmas and New Year’s. Beautiful colors, the feeling of anticipation in the air, sometimes actual chill (hey, southern US)... it’s like going back to childhood for some reason. And ending with cozy lights and gifts and family. 😊"
1110,isfj,"I live in a place where there are only two seasons: burning humid hell and Noah’s ark part 2. If I lived in a country where there are four seasons, I think I would love autumn. I’ve never experienced it but I feel like I would like the mood."
1111,isfj,"Spring and summer are my favorite because of the warm weather. (I live in SC.) Autumn is pretty, but sometimes it gets too cold too fast for me. I hate winter because of the cold, dry weather, and the reduced daylight. (I got myself a therapy lamp this year to help with Seasonal Affective Disorder.) The only thing I like about winter is the occasional light snow because it makes everything look brighter for a little while."
1112,isfj,"Winter’s my favorite too! I love the cold. Like you said: no bugs of any kind, and the heat and humidity arent in your way, and sleeping under lots of heavy blankets is wonderful. I live in a place that has consistently hot summers and cold winters. I also like just how pretty things look in winter. It’s really relaxing due to how quiet and calm it can be. "
1113,isfj,"Well, I live in LA and we have warm summers but not too hot. I also like being able to go outside and see the beautiful sun. It also gets dark later in the day so I have more of a day to work with. Summer is also a great time to go to the beach or walking around out in nature. "
1114,isfj,"What do you like about where you live? Hate? 
I’m in Boulder and both like it but also feel like a complete outsider (there are so many N’s here!). I felt so much more home in FL- felt like more S types lived there who I could relate with and carry a conversation with more .... comfortably. I also miss it tons because my family and friends are there. Really I’d prefer to be where they are, as long as I got to travel the world and explore.
Anyway, just curious. Also where would you LOVE to live and why?"
1115,isfj,"I live in Barcelona, Spain. Bad things: It's a busy city, but I like to use heapdhones when I'm in the street , so no big deal. But the amount of tourists is insane and sometimes is a bit ennerving to get stucked between crowds haha. Cost of living is a bit high when comparing with the average salary. And for good things...  I like that we have beach and mountain at the same time, but in a very cosmopolitan area. Also, it's quick to go from one side of the city to the other with public transport (max. 45minutes). We have overall good weather and mild winters, I love that! There is a lot of offer regarding leisure, restaurants, etc. So you are never bored. And I love mediterranian gastronomy! "
1116,isfj,"I live in the Dirty T aka Tucson, Arizona. I hate it here. I’ve lived here my whole life (23 years) & I’m ready to GTFO ! 
I guess the one thing I hate about Tucson is the people. 1. People don’t know how to FUCKING DRIVE HERE 2. Fun fact: people will drive after you if you piss them off in traffic 3. Soooo many CRACKHEADS !!!! 4. Crime rate (google that shit) 5. Getting pan handled in the grocery parking lot, ughhh
Most definitely the construction tho ! There’s always construction but somehow the city still floods when it rains & is covered in pot holes.
What I love ?
There’s nothing like an Arizona sunset.
We have saguaros ? Idk I guess people have never seen those before & are vastly fascinated by them haha
The nature (lmao I have yet to see the Grand Canyon, don’t come for me I KNOW OKAY).
I am working on moving to Colorado (Fort Collins) to complete my Masters degree & am planning to live there permanently. It’s not too far away from AZ & CO is beautiful. I’m really craving something new & I have high hopes for CO. Other than that, Germany, the UK or the Netherlands."
1117,isfj,"Currently I live in Wyoming. Things I like about Wyoming is the isolation, friendly people, and not overpopulated. What I dislike is the Seasonal work for construction and heavy equipment. However I'll plan on moving away from Wyoming. Most likely South Dakota. "
1118,isfj,"I live near Boulder too! I am from California but I really loved living in Portland. Was only there for 6 months but I really loved the city there.. so many different types of artistic people, and the drivers were so nice.. they would stop for you even when they had the right-of-way. "
1119,isfj,"Northern Ontario, Canada... I'm from southern Ontario which is a lot more fast paced than here, but I don't like the fact that I'm several hours away from my family. But I have a good job with the government and cost of living is a lot more reasonable so when it comes down to practicalities, this is probably a good place for me to be..."
1120,isfj,"CO is absolutely stunning. It’s actually pretty perfect. Offers a wide variety of outdoor activity options. We actually have seasons! Moving from FL that’s a new concept to me, seasons. If my family were here with me I’d be pretty set. Now on my quest to own 2 homes: 1 in CO & the other in FL. =) Anyway, I’m sure you’ll love it here. The classic saying about the place is you won’t want to leave when you get here. "
1121,isfj,"I dig it. I was only there for 6 months so it never became too taxing, although I did feel my spirits lifted when I moved here to Longmont. And the summer was wonderful.. although it does get really hot there for a couple of weeks."
1122,isfj,"this is really hard to explain and i think a good answer requires me to have a deeper understanding of myself. so here is my best-i-can-do answer.
all i know is that i meet new people at parties or social gatherings. and always start new interactions with people with the intention of friendship. and that friendship can progress to ""i feel excited to spend time with this person"" and that leads to me asking them out on a date."
1123,isfj,"Is it worth saying dont be afraid to be a bid more bold? It is my understanding that isfj's have trouble showing and/or vocalizing feelings. Sometimes that is all it takes is to speak up. 
I almost hate to say that because i find your shyness endearing and real. But not everyone is like me so..."
1124,isfj,"Thanks! They's why they call me ice break brave face. no one calls me that actually.
I thought about it some more. i definitely look for signs to know if the person im interested in is also excited to be with me before i ask them out. facial expression, tone of voice, real smiles, and them actively trying to make time for me as i do for them.
i guess i don't just ask people out. i have to know i like them and that they like me before hand. otherwise they're either strangers or acquaintances and i'm not particularly interested in investing lots of time with people i don't really know.
though sometimes that process goes by real fast because so much clicks so i'm really interested and i can see things are clicking with her too, and it's like the 2nd time we've met but it's enough to ask her out."
1125,isfj,"I was stuck in a si-ti loop for months after my breakup and it was NOT fun. It would interfere with my work since I’d be so stuck in my head all the time and it’d be very hard for me to do anything other than just internally ruminate on my problem. Of course, I could operate, but everything just felt like it was revolving around the problem that triggered the si-ti loop. Idk if that answers your question, but I’m happy to explain more."
1126,isfj,"I think I got into a Si-Ti loop for a few years of college. I almost never left my room, so I doubt many can remember encountering me lol. 
On my end, I was very avoidant of other people, and felt my interactions with other people went super negatively. In retrospect, I think I was doing okay! But socially aware people could sense I was trying hard to keep it together, so they tried to avoid upsetting me/engaging me unnecessarily. 
So glad that particular si ti loop era has passed..."
1127,isfj,"During the end of last year, I was locked into a really bad Si-Ti loop. I need to have a reason for everything I did and criticized people’s logic. I would spend hours analyzing and researching my interests. I thought me using Ti so much thought I was intelligent . I definitely avoided people a lot as well. I was so out of touch with my feelings and emotions. I would argue with my teachers and would show off my weak Ti to this girl to show her my toughness.. had this really bad incident with this girl in one of my class. That incident taught me that I’m not as smart as I thought I am. I didn’t realize until I got back in touch with my Fe and emotions that I had a crush on her. I’d imagine to other people I looked overly critical, defensive, and combative."
1128,isfj,"Me! For me it turns into lots of weight training (solo), delving into learning in depth any interests I may have, and overall wanting to be by myself just sucking in information. I avoid people when in the loop. It feels good and comforting at the time, playing around with thoughts and ideas (Ti sprinkled with some Ne) or working on bodily functioning type stuff like yoga, meditation, working out (Si) - until you realize you’ve spent days, weeks, months mostly by yourself which is generally very stifling and unhealthy."
1129,isfj,"Wow after reading these comments I’ve definitely experienced this. I spend all my time alone and don’t really want to talk to people. For me, this was sparked by being in college and not having any friends with anything in common with me. I got into this loop and spent lots of time alone, developing my interests and skills, avoiding other people. I’m doing better now since I live with roommates that I like much better than my past ones but I occasionally find myself slipping.  I get this way when I’m depressed."
1130,isfj,"I feel I should say the following, because ISFJ are often stereotyped as dumb cinnamon roll cake bakers. 
We can never beat the Ti Te auxes and doms in an off the cuff debate, but we’ve got an instinctive handle on a thing people don’t bother to measure: self awareness. 
When we don’t cut off our Fe, we’ve got a voice who whispers in our ear what people are feeling, what they think of you, and how they would react to certain moves. It looks like witchcraft to Ts."
1131,isfj,"Agreed! I’d bet most healthy ISFJs have high Emotional intelligence. I’m so glad this loop era has past. Honestly, the stereotypes used to bother me too. But then I realized the stereotypes are inaccurate/biased and don’t represent all ISFJs. If anything those stereotypes taught me that everyone within our type or any type isn’t the same."
1132,isfj,"Cousin/best friend: ESxJ 
Dad: ISFJ
Brother: ESFP (he makes me feel so relaxed and uninhibited) 
Nana: xSFJ 
Group of best friends: INFJ, ENFP, INxP (just realizing now that I think they are all intuitive types)"
1133,isfj,"I've worked in my current job for 5 months and a few times each week this one lady from the office greets me with a cheery ""Hi Amy!"". I always respond and smile... the trouble is my name isn't Amy! I've put off correcting her, thinking she'd realise one day and now it seems too late! I don't want to embarrass her, or myself, by correcting it after so long!
Plus I kinda like the name Amy... Hah!
Anyone else have silly issues like this or am I just a twit?"
1134,isfj,"I have similar issues. My name is often pronounced wrong. Whenever I correct people I feel like I sound snooty. But if they are just an acquaintance I really don't care either way so I will rarely correct them. I have a co worker who is from another country and just cannot pronounce my name. I haven't had the heart to correct him. I think even if I did he still wouldn't be able to pronounce it. 
I also have a twin, and people who don't know me too well will occasionally call me her name. A lot of the time I don't even bother correcting them. "
1135,isfj,"People always forget my name/call me the wrong name - not sure why.  I don't usually correct them myself unless it's important that they remember (in a job context, for example, it is important that your boss/whoever handles your paychecks & stuff remembers which person you are) - I usually sort of just sit there and let them figure it out/be embarrassed about it on their own.  If I have friends around they'll correct the person for me, so I don't have to do the awkward.  If you need to do the correcting yourself, it often helps to reintroduce yourself and make eye contact, esp. in a professional situation.  It gets the point across without being expressly rude, I think."
1136,isfj,"I have a name that is frequently mispronounced, or confused for another name that's similar, and I don't think I have ever in my life corrected someone about it.  As long as I can tell they are talking to/about me, I figure it's not worth bringing it up.  It does make me more conscientious about figuring the correct way to pronounce other people's names, though."
1137,isfj,"Usually I want to be helpful to others and have a bunch of good friends.
However, sometimes I get annoyed to the point to where I can say some nasty things.. usually when I'm not in a good mood which tends to me when people happen to be annoying me more than usual (and I tend to usually be fairly forgiving/understanding)"
1138,isfj,i'm just grumpy when i'm sleepy and hungry at the same time or if it's really hot and humid. but i don't say nasty things. haven't done that since high school. it was when i was annoyed and shitty and said something that really hurt a classmate and i still remember how awful i felt after.
1139,isfj,"I usually only get grumpy when I'm depriving myself of something important (i.e. sleep, food, caffeine). Everyone has bad moments. For me, the threat of doing harm in my relationships with others is what keeps me from saying the nasty things I will think when grumpy."
1140,isfj,I am the same way. Introverts need that recharge time or we get grumpy. That also includes having a low tolerance for loud or annoying people in general. I also have high standards for people and can become annoyed and passive aggressive when I'm feeling unheard or disappointed. I feel so bad when I get pushed to the point of lashing out.  
1141,isfj,"This is my Girlfriend. Dear God she can be shocking, says incredibly rude or nasty things then expects me to be okay with it. 
Often the catalyst for a bitchsplosion is the tiniest thing (yesterday's example - I took off my shoes and left them in the wrong place - BOOM! Bitchsplosion).
Whilst I understand that it's likely a culmination of factors, as an INTP I can't help but get incredibly frustrating by the irrationality she displays - which certainly never helps my situation.
What do you ISFJs actually expect in this situation? No cryptic crap, no 'You really don't know?!' How do I manage this behaviour?"
1142,isfj,"Yeah, I can have really bad mood swings sometimes.. Or I'll just get upset or something little. Usually there's stress or some kind of issue beneath the surface that's bothering me. I just hate saying awful things then realizing 2 seconds after that I've been hurtful. I tend to keep quiet and away from others if I'm in an irritable mood. Better for me better for the people around me ha."
1143,isfj,"I get grumpy when I need to recharge too, as well as when I'm feeling put-upon and need to set better boundaries. Finding out what was causing the grumpiness (and therefore what I can do about it) was life-changing. "
1144,isfj,"What do you do to regain confidence and mental clarity after high school? I loved high school and became very emotionally attached to it, my teachers, my daily routine, and my home life. I felt in control and powerful over my home life and school life. I graduated in May 2014 and have not felt the same since. I do not feel like the ""old"" me who attacked everyday and looked back. Now my mind is more anxious and feel so unstable. 
I've lived in the same house for almost 18 years. I now live with my mom and dad and commute to community college. I went to a small Catholic school that cost $50,000 a year (I had a $19,000 a year scholarship) my freshman year, had horrible roommates that did drugs and partied, and ended up flunking out. Even though I moved back home I still haven't regained my self confidence."
1145,isfj,"Learn to let go. Ofc it's probably a lot easier for ENTPs to do, but you should realize that it's a new chapter in your life. The future awaits and it could be better than your high school days. Once you've accepted this transition period, I'm sure you'll find your groove again"
1146,isfj,"I'm making some wild guesses based on minimal information here and a nearly 15 year relationship with an ISFJ:
My partner is very self motivated and driven when there is a clear objective with a plan and is something important to them. Is it possible that since highschool you haven't had a clear direction, or is the path that has been laid before conflict with what you personally want to achieve?
Wild speculation here, but if you have never been fully responsible or committed to your path, and someone else choose something for you it might be tricky to regulate self motivation if you're not emotionally invested into your path. And if someone has always outlined your objectives for you, than its hard to know how to practice self regulated motivation if you're unfamiliar with that process, it doesn't come naturally it's obtained through experience.
My spouse went to college, then got dream job and never missed a beat. But they plan was in motion for so long. "
1147,isfj,"In high school my day was extremely structured. Get up, eat breakfast, walk the dog, have my mom drop me off at school (I didn't get my license until I was 19), be in classes 8 to 2:45, and then wait until my carpool came at around 4. My parents got home at 5:15, so I was not alone very much. 
I also ran my own businesses throughout high school and was a B/C student. I ""floated"" through high school academically. My life was business, family, and then school in that order. My businesses were on my mind 24/7, I was obsessed. 
I was always been extremely close with my teachers. They knew me very well and always supported me and made me feel good. I have always been kind of needy emotionally.
In my first year of college I got kicked out of my 4 person suite (roommates were doing drugs and partying and disliked me for not participating), failed several classes, started having anxiety attacks, and went on medicine/steroids that made me gain 40 pounds in three months, and started fighting with my parents more"
1148,isfj,"It appears to me, (and I could be way off) that a person who thrives off structure and positive reinforcement was abruptly released into the wild. And your (possibly) first real unsuccessful attempt has discouraged you. You've mentioned multiple times about your support system you had with your teachers, and even blatantly declared dependency on emotional support, that's not a bad thing it's just something that's important to you and that's okay, but you haven't mentioned parents in the same breath. Yes, I'm sure your parents are/were supportive, most parents are, but is it the kind of support that really energises you? Maybe a support structure is also in need as well as a plan of attack and a map to succession. Through countless debates and discussions with my spouse, I know that harsh truth and crass reality and blunt criticism with the best intentions are the absolute worst way to motivate you. Reassurance, kindness, and someone to help you up and show you the next possible challenge can be far more uplifting, but tough love trends to strip you of power and is ultimately counter productive.
PS, I'm just speculating everything and comparing to experiences I've had with ISFJs in family. I could be completely wrong and I'm not trying to criticise you or your situation. And most importantly, I'm no where near close to being a professional, I'm just a person that finds other people interesting."
1149,isfj,"You are 100% spot on 
My parents are supportive. I love them 100%. After high school a lot of tough love began (like get a job instead of running my business). They paid $30,000 a year for my freshman year and I flunked out with a 1.8 GPA (I was a 3.0 to 3.2 GPA in high school). I rely on my mom for emotional support now more than ever. We have always been close (I'm a mama's boy), but in high school I was so confident and emotionally ""stable"" and happy, that I did not need much emotional support from my parents (I never said no to it, though). 
My parents want me to succeed, but they want me to work for it like they did (Go to college and get a job). My mom paid her way through college with absolutely zero help from her parents. I have always been an entrepreneur and have always had huge goals/dreams, so since the age of 10 nothing I have ever done since then has impressed them or made them say wow. I have only had one ""real"" job and that was the summer before college working at TJ Max making $7.25 an hour.
I have always been a little behind in life. I did not get my drivers license until I was well over 19 and failed my test three or four times. I did not talk until I was three years old. I was born with some thyroid/hormone problems and my mom has 100% been there every step of the way talking to doctors, making appointments, etc. I'm almost 21 and she still goes to appointments with me and asks the doctor questions. Plain and simple, my mom is my rock. But that does not mean we do not argue. Growing up I was a VERY submissive child. I would agree with my mom on everything. That ended by the eighth grade. 
My mom is 51 and my dad is 59. I have an 18 year old sister who is a straight A, 4.0 GPA student, as well as an athlete. She is headstrong, completely independent, and not attached to my parents at all. They are paying $40,000 to send her to an out of state college.
The high school I went to was a small Catholic high school. My graduating class had 310 people (1,200 students in the whole school). I knew everyone and everyone knew me. While I had plenty of friends, I was always closer with my teachers (and the librarian for some reason) I started a bass fishing club there (I love to fish) and even started a charity fishing tournament. I had influence and clout in the school. I have not felt ""in control"" since graduating two years ago. "
1150,isfj,"I become very calm - inside-out, still, smiley.. I like to sit close to or lay down with my loved ones, hug them, kiss them. But, what is most important to me when I'm drunk is MUSIC. Music must playyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.. I love laying on my bed and listening to music when I'm drunk.. "
1151,isfj,"I’m very friendly, touchy feely, usually trying to make out with everyone. I also am much more open and share stories, don’t mind having attention on me. I alternate between taking shots and checking on the person puking in the bathroom and making sure they get to bed okay with a glass of water. "
1152,isfj,"Depends. If I'm with someone - specifically someone I'm attracted to - I make my attraction very well known (not inappropriately mind you, and I still respect boundaries). Easier for me to put my emotions into words, go for a kiss, hold hands, whatever. Much less self-conscious.
With social groups, just overall more chatty and involved. Not internally going ""Oh god I need my hiding place."" Other times I get ""locked in"" where I'm sitting on the edge of the group, observing the chaos and taking the energy in without being involved."
1153,isfj,"If so, do you feel like your personality traits as an ISFJ help you excel at what you do? Do some of them hurt your ability to excel? I'd like your thoughts in general on being an ISFJ firefighter.
I'm an ISFJ considering a career change, and firefighting has been something which has really appealed to me. Although, at this point changing careers would be a pretty big deal (At least in my mind), so I'm trying to find every and any bit of information which can help me make the right decision."
1154,isfj,"Hey, I was going to be a firefighter. I was working as an EMT, almost finished all my fire classes, ready to go to the academy, and had a huge change of heart. It just wasn't for me, even though I had been working towards it for 4+ years. I just didn't have the personality for it and didn't feel like I belonged. I don't know what state you are in, but in mine (CA), it is really competitive in the job market. Everybody and their mothers wants in on a fire career and since 90% of calls are medical aid, it is practically mandatory to be an EMT basic but much more helpful to be a paramedic  as well. Do some research though. Its a great career and it was hard letting go. Sometimes I think back and think ""what if"" but if you set your mind to it and really think that you want to do it, go full force. "
1155,isfj,Honestly it was a little too over whelming for me. I got nervous and lost confidence really quickly. It might have to do a little with my fto (field training officer) but I didn't like the pressure anymore. My brother is currently a firefighter paramedic and he could not love his job more. But he has a totally different personality than me.

1157,isfj,"If we were on /r/entp, I would have gone to my usual point about how much discord servers are linked there, relying on the concept of sensory overstimulation.
But here, I'll have to ask you a question before :

Why here ? You know about the proportion of each type on Internet, right ? You know this subreddit it rather calm, to put it as  politely as I can, right ?
"
1158,isfj,"So, I myself, am an INTP woman. And a couple months ago, I met this isfj dude. After we became friends he asked me out on a date, and I said sure why not. I didn't find a romantic spark of any kind but apparently he found several. Now, I have openly expressed my disinterest but he just keeps on trying, and I really don't get why. Its not like we have deep conversations, and literally everything I say upsets him. So, my question is what can i do to end his little infatuation with me, preferably with little hard feelings because we work together?"
1159,isfj,"Honestly, this is a difficult situation.
I myself have been completely infatuated with an INTP for years, and I just can't seem to get over him.
However, he did have feelings for me as well for a long time, so that situation is a little different.
The problem with being an ISFJ is that once we fall for a person, it's very very hard to get rid of those feelings.
It obviously becomes a problem if the feelings aren't reciprocated, as in your case.
Have you been direct and just told him you don't feel that way about him and it's never going to work? Because I think that's a pretty good first step.
If you're just sort of brushing him off and dodging the issue, he's never going to know how you really feel, and he'll have no reason to stop pursuing you.
Yes, it would be a hurtful thing to hear, but sometimes that's necessary for a person to move on.
If you've done that and it hasn't worked, you should try to minimize the contact you have with him, if not cutting it off completely, though that may be difficult if you have to work with him.
Any rational, sane person isn't going to continue pursuing a person when they've been very blunt about the fact that they don't feel the same way.
I would also suggest sitting him down for a talk, and just gently telling him he's making you uncomfortable, and you'd be very grateful if he could keep his behavior professional around you.
As an ISFJ, nothing would horrify me more than somebody telling me that I'm being unprofessional and socially inappropriate like that.
I sincerely wish you luck. In future, I would recommend not getting involved with people you have to work with, due to the fact that it makes it impossible to just cut ties with them, though I'm sure you've learned that after this incident."
1160,isfj,"This isn't even a personality thing. Regardless of what MBTI type he is, he should be enough of a gentleman to understand that you're not interested, you still work together, and it shouldn't impact your professional relationship.
I asked a girl out at work. When she rejected me, I just smiled and told her that we were cool, and we still are; regardless of how attractive I find her, I treat her just like every other employee, and I don't give her a thought when I walk out at the end of the day. 
If the guy in question can't do that, tell him to leave you alone or you'll talk to HR/management.
TLDR: Being an idiot is not exclusive to ISFJs."
1161,isfj,"I am an NT but would not tell the HR unless he forcibly makes a physical approach to kissing, for example. Even if emotionless, abrasive and thick-skinned NTs would get really embarrassed by getting called up by the HR regarding a dating problem. It is too harsh from my perspective. "
1162,isfj,the people clamoring HR i think is horseshit.  the dude likes you and has feelings for you.  tell him you're not interested but that you appreciate the compliments.   if he continues making you uncomfortable.  tell him you want him to stop and don't want to go to HR but he's going to force you too if he doesn't stop.  
1163,isfj,"I have been very clear about it not having a chance to work out, but I am pretty sure that he thinks our life is a romance novel where the girl looks closed off and emotionless on the outside but shes a cinnamon roll when you get to know her, and he's the only person who can break through the shell and I can't seem to get this idea out of his head"
1164,isfj,At this point I think it goes beyond MBTI and society teaching men that they deserve women if they try enough times. Tell him no means no and that he's being unprofessional. If it doesn't stop please consider going to HR. 
1165,isfj,"I'm an ENTP in the Seattle area and I'd like to try some online stuff to meet people and I'm trying to figure out how to attract an ISFJ on those sites.  First of all, I never intend on lying.  That isn't my goal.  I'm just not a very good writer.  As an ENTP, my writing can be jumpy/sporatic and I tend to not focus on the feelsy stuff.  I also have no problem talking about my negative qualities though I've learned not to put that in a profile.  I know it's important to say that family and loyalty are important (and they actually are).  I just don't know what else could get you gals interested.  Can you help me?"
1166,isfj,"Can't say for others, but these are my top do/don't


I can definitely tell when it's a copy and paste message. I get that there are tons of girls, and very few will reply, but if you read their profile and find nothing unique/interesting to say, then why bother? Right? I hate copy and paste messages. Will not ever reply.


On that note, don't send messages describing yourself.. Or send messages that are paragraphs long.. And when you talk, don't try to make small talk. Asking questions like ""This is really important, ice cream vs cookies!?"" is the dumbest thing.. ever. 


I hate profile that talk about themselves and only themselves for like long long long paragraphs. I don't want to read about how amazing you are, and how you should basically be a God. Just short form stuff and make it as painless as possible to read. 


Your number of replies will usually depend on attractiveness. If you get lots of replies, great, if you get little replies, whatever. Right? Who cares. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. 

"
1167,isfj,/u/killspiration is right. I only replied to people who clearly read my profile and responded with follow-up questions or comments and tried to show a sense of humour. I also particularly liked guys who seemed like they had both short and long term goals and were clearly working towards them. 
1168,isfj,"Totally agree with /u/killspiration. It is super important to reply with genuine things. Honestly, the most interesting messages I have received are Game of Thrones themed. Is that lame? Just find something that you are both mutually into and lead off with that."
1169,isfj,"THIS. I agree! There's nothing more attractive than wit and motivation. If I think you're funny, am into some of the same stuff and know you're future oriented and motivated I'll want to talk to you. ""Heys"" bore me and if you can't keep a conversation going don't even bother. 
As far as the family oriented and loyalty stuff -- I don't think that's as important up front. At least not for me. "
1170,isfj,"I'm not sure what my results mean but here they are... maybe someone can help me understand this?
Type 9 - 10,
Type 1 - 3,
Type 8 - 2.7,
Wing 9w1 - 11.5,
Wing 9w8 - 11.4,
Wing 1w9 - 8,
Wing 8w9 - 7.7,
Wing 1w2 - 4.4,
Wing 8w7 - 3.7,"
1171,isfj,"The results suggest that you're a 9w1. 
The first set is saying which main type you are most likely to be - the highest number, I presume. This means it's type 9 for you.
The second set is suggesting which wing you're most likely to have - again, the number suggest you're a 9w1, although 9w8 is extremely close so also worth considering. 
Read up on type 9 and its wings, and then decide for yourself. Enneagram isn't really a simple test, I'm afraid! "
1172,isfj,"Does anyone else always find your brain/emotions negatively overthinking how you would feel in a given situation (ex. Potential new job, new place to live, etc)?  Seems like I always have a tough time just letting go and embrace change or the unknown.  I just get really bad anxiety and pass on things because of this.  Not sure if this is a ISFJ trait or not."
1173,isfj,"Absolutely. I think of everything possible and it causes a lot of anxiety. Honestly, sometimes I need someone to ground and remind me that it will be okay and that I don't have to assume the worst case scenario. It's still something I'm learning how to handle. Change is scary and so is the unknown but I know that I have myself and that I've been through worse things in my life. I feel confident that I can handle whatever life throws at me. "
1174,isfj,"I have this problem too. I still struggle with this and sometimes I would think that maybe I have to struggle with this forever and it's just something that I have to get used to. It sucks but I hope that's not the case at all.
Anyway, something that helps lighten up the feeling of anxiety for me is when I think that my problems and worries are petty compared to someone else's like a starving family in Africa for example. They don't have time to think of the same worries i'm having because they have more important problems to worry about. For some reason, this helps lighten my anxiety over things that haven't happened yet."
1175,isfj,"Yes, I've heard that I just have to do it, but I get such anxiety about it I just end up passing on something.  I start thinking about something concerning or unknown and quickly my brain snowballs into anxiety about it.  It's even worse when it's life events that take awhile before you actually get to the other side.  It's not anxiety that is severe I need to see someone about it, but just enough to affect my actions to avoid that feeling.
I tell you it's a big battle; logic over feelings."
1176,isfj,"Well I won't lie and tell you that it isn't difficult, because it is. Unfortunately I can't tell you any quick tips or how to's in order to overcome this anxiety you feel, other than reminding yourself that much of what you feel is in your head. I used to think that asking people to hang out would be absolutely horrific, to give you an example, yet every time I mustered up the courage to ask someone new, they would say yes. Again, there is no easy way to overcome your anxiety, you just have to keep pushing against it until it subsides somewhat. Don't let it hold you back you back from doing the things that would benefit you or make you have fun, like it did with me. 
JUST DO IT. ;) "
1177,isfj,"Hm. Lately I'll write down all my thoughts best I can. I just keep repeating the same anxious worries and thoughts in my head until I get them out. After I finish I tend to be able to have a sigh of relief and calm down. I also write down reassurance to myself. Such as: I am doing well, I'm not the same person I was and can handle a lot more than I think I can."
1178,isfj,"Hello! I am an INTJ [21M] and I have this friend ISFJ [20F] who a while back told me she had a bad weekend and is dealing with this 'self crisis'. I do have a lot of interest in her, and I'm intrigued by the way she thinks and by all means I wanted to help and understand her. But when I asked about it, she deflected and avoided the topic alltogether. I know it's hard for her to just open up like that so I didn't push further when I saw she didn't want to give any details. At that point, we were not too close either, more like friendly acquaintances if even that, so I had no reason to continue on the matter.
Couple weeks passed, we ended up talking a lot more. I could tell she enjoyed my company and on numerous occasions she was the one who initianed the conversation (which is totally out of her character, but she is definitely making an effort for our little friendship to work). On the other hand, I also enjoy it as I find people with a different view than me especially intriguing. 
Then yesterday, after a short chit-chat she tells me she had another bad day. Now at this point I am confused, worried and the curiosity is burning me inside. From my point of view, you don't go around telling someone you had a bad day without being at least a little bit enclined to share it. Therefore I assumed she wants attention. Furthermore, as I said, I do want her to share what's in her mind with me so I can get more insight in who she is and possibly help her or at the very least give her some feedback, yet again, to my surprise, when I asked her about it, she changed the subject instantly. I told her that she can be open with me, yet to be fair, I might not have been very clear.
Now, my question for you ISFJs out there is if I should keep pushing considering I really want to know what's going on and understand her, or just let it go and give her some space. Rationally, she being an ISFJ, the reasonable choice would be to let her deal with her stuff despite that being against my interests if I don't want to end up dismissed by her. Though I can not ignore the fact that she was the one that bringed up the bad day in the first place.
So how can I go about her opening up? Is she not comfortable enough yet? 
Would you mention something personal to a friend without actually wanting to discuss that thing or go into details about it?"
1179,isfj,"Often times when I say I had a bad day to a friend, I don’t want to talk about bc I feel that talking about myself seems selfish. She most likely is telling you that bc she wants you to know she’s having an emotionally down day, and maybe you can cheer her up. But it certainly is a way of her telling you to get that she may not be herself bc of it. A big part of her not telling you is that she may be afraid she can’t fully trust that you won’t share it to others or that you won’t judge her. She wants to share her pain, but spare you the details. I would emphasize that you care about her and she should be able to spill out to you bc you’d never betray her. I would only emphasize asking again if you made sure to let her know you want to be there for her. 
Although, I find concern in you saying you’re “curious” about her issues, which to me, as an ISFJ translates more to wanting to know rather than actually caring, and she may be picking up on that. "
1180,isfj,"keep asking her if she wants to talk about anything, or if something is bothering her. ""it might feel better talking to someone about it."" but don't keep pushing if she says no.
you're a good friend,! she's lucky to have you!!"
1181,isfj,"I would try gently asking her about it. Like the next time she mentions having a bad day, say something along the lines of, ""What happened? Do you want to talk about it?"" And that may encourage her to open up. Sometimes when I mention having a bad day I want to talk about it and sometimes I don't. If it's with someone I'm interested in, then I'm more inclined to talk about it when prompted. But that's just me- take this with a grain of salt!"
1182,isfj,"INTP here. I can confirm my ISFJ girlfriend says this to me also. Def. an ISFJ thing. They get caught in the same over thinking kinda loop that INTPs do.  She's never told me what it means, but I know they dwell on the past, and I suspect she may be over analysing sad things. :(
I too would like to know what it's about, so that I can understand her better and make sure she has what she needs. "
1183,isfj,"First and foremost, be honest with her. Tell her you want her to open up. Try to figure out why you want that, and also tell that to her.
Second, you might want to tell her that it's important for HER to open up, not for you in the first place. But don't push her because that way she might end up in defense mode. You might even want to tell that it doesn't have to be with you, but telling how she feels will relief so much for her. The fact that you tell her so might increase your chances that that person is you. This part takes a lot of patience. 
Last, try to be open yourself. This has a contagious effect. This might be a tricky one because you're not a feeler but there are feelings in there somewhere so go find them.
Best of luck,
An INTP"
1184,isfj,"i don’t know about the others, but in that context, i’d avoid the subject afterwards cause i’d be afraid of possible judgement from him/her (fi critic, ne inf). personally, i would want the person to show that he/she rlly does care and would not judge. that would signal the “ok” for me to share, to make sure that i’m not “burdening” him/her. u can do this by sharing ur problems first, then requesting for her to share hers too. kind of like a transaction? but more like assuring her that u feel close enough. 
and tip: after she shares her problem, reassure her that u understand and are not judging her for it. reaffirm this regularly for as long as u are still friends/wtv relationship u have with her. (u probably don’t have to try too much, considering the very good compatibility. that strong-ish fi should be able to curb this!)
i don’t know if this’ll help. but best of luck "
1185,isfj,"Yes, I enjoy shopping but I do run out of stamina and want to go home.  The busier the shops are, the faster my tolerance decreases.  Thank goodness for online shopping for allowing me to skip the stores between Black Friday and Christmas.  Some of my coworkers were telling me how they went shopping for literally the whole day and I privately thought that sounded like being in actual hell.  "
1186,isfj,"I'm in and out of a shop in fifteen minutes if I'm alone, there to purchase something specific and not in a shopping mood, but otherwise I don't mind shopping for 3+ hours. Yea my feet die by the end of it but at the right place with the right people, I don't notice too much."
1187,isfj,"Definitely an in and out shopper. Research ahead of time what I want and execute. I make the exception and gather energy when the ISFP gf wants to go ""shopping"" aka paint herself in Sephora..."
1188,isfj,"Yes. I LOVE online shopping. And if I have to go to real shops I prefer going alone, and be able to get to the car and leave as soon as I don't feel like shopping anymore.. And prefer small shopping malls over huge ones.. And prefer shops where staff doesn't constantly ask me if I need help.. "
1189,isfj,"I have to be in a very specific mood because half the time it involves constant bumps, sorries, and trying to get around people or out of people's way. Salespeople always seem to get me, too. It's like I have a target on my forehead..."
1190,isfj,Yea I have this issue a lot especially when I am shopping with someone else I notice it a lot more. They are all excited about buying all these thing and being around all of these people. My main problem is I have very little money so I hate to go shopping because everything is just too much. 
1191,isfj,"Nooooo, that does sound like hell!! I was actually shopping with three other girls when I wrote this post yesterday, and had just left the group to go get a drink and shop by myself for a bit because I was overwhelmed. Dude, I had no idea how amazing solo clothes shopping is!! Of course I have people on standby on Messenger so that I can ask for opinions on clothes, but like, hot damn, it's so peaceful. I also went into EB X and Hot Topic - the girls I was shopping with are not nerdy in the slightest, so it was nice to be able to chat with staff and other patrons who were! :)
I did enjoy hanging out with them though. I just have very low stamina for it."
1192,isfj,"Omg, that's so me!! I am a very quick grocery shopper unless I can't find something or I suddenly think of something new I want to make in the store and have to collect the ingredients for the recipe. Other people are always soooooooooo sloooooow in shopping. Drives me insane!!"
1193,isfj,"Omg, Sephora is so stressful 😂 I'm not a big makeup person - a lot of it gives me migraines because I'm quite sensitive, and I'm a bit lazy so it suits me just fine anyway. The most I do is paint my nails. Sephora is just sooooo crowded all the time, and I feel like a fraud going in there because I don't know shit. 😂"
1194,isfj,"So in a way I prefer big malls because I'm less likely to be seen or noticed. If the store is already quite crowded, it's less likely that a staff will ask me for help. That being said, it can also be overwhelming, so I usually make it quick.
The worst is when you're the driver and everyone else depends on you for their ride home so you can't just leave whenever you want. 😅 As the only friend with a car in most of my groups, I run into that a lot!"
1195,isfj,"Some things for me

I keep a queue of order what games/shows/anime to watch, a mixed order of preference and when it came out (I'll also include release/starting airing dates of games/shows)
Every month or 2 I peruse my social media follow list to unfollow people that either dont post anymore or I dont want to follow to make sure my timeline is relevant and not cluttered. Especially since I'll randomly follow people I feel like I should
I started keeping an inventory of food so I motivate myself to eat out less. 

I use a lot of list organization in Todoist and Trello"
1196,isfj,"I keep a text file with various lists of what I want to do (things to read, watch, play or learn) but only rarely I follow through them and instead I usually just waste time browsing other stuff. How do you guys do it?"
1197,isfj,"I keep a pretty intricate log of my life in a journal. Everyday is broken into ten lines, with a line representing a block of time.  Two pages is an account of my week, and then every month, quarter and year I will jot out the highlights and try to reflect on the period a little.
...It keeps me mentally compartmentalized. I understand where I've been, how I spent last week, or yesterday without forgetting. And a measure of accountability to myself so I am not frittering away time. It's a way of keeping my life organized in the most broadest sense I guess. "
1198,isfj,"I have a spreadsheet that lists all my fixed monthly expenses, the amount, the day they are due, and the way they are paid.
I also have a planner where I keep track of my migraines, where I keep track of what I eat (I sometimes forget), and keep various reminders. I mainly only open it to write down my food, though.
I also use a lot of Google Keep notes in my phone to keep track of stuff."
1199,isfj,"Not random but I keep track of bullet notes in my phone app. For example, things to do, things to save up for. Since I usually like things tidy and organised, I see myself doing that random. For example, when I know I have the time to do it and once I decide to clean this, I'll start organizing this and that until I'm satisfied with the results."
1200,isfj,"-i go on unfollowing sprees
-religiously started following phone calendar for class schedule
-have a note on app of food bucket list, songs to download, dramas/movies to watch
-i also have a whiteboard to do list i try to update each day"
1201,isfj,"Hahah I do this too! I have so many different folders in the “notes” app on my phone to organize thoughts. Thoughts on health, fitness, my favorite bars and restaurants in certain areas, gifts I wanna get all my favorite people, things I want to buy myself. 
My mind is so flooded with so many thoughts all the time that if I don’t write all this stuff down I will forget immediately. "
1202,isfj,"Well for me I only keep things I have a high chance/really want to play/read
Having those lists helps me figure out a good order to play or else Ill do the things I want too early and lose motivation to do others"
1203,isfj,"I have over 200 notes in my phone!! No one i know uses the notes app more than Me. I also have countless excel spreadsheets w bills, confirmations dates , things to do, movies watch, the list goes on and on"
1204,isfj,"In the past several days I found out about personality types and also that I'm a pronounced ISFJ. Needless to say, I spend hours researching the topic and what I found revealed that what I have been doing for the bast 25 years is probably the worst profession I could have picked. I'm a performing musician who works in academia, and deals constantly with lots of projects at the same time (which leaves me frustrated that I cannot finish well any of them at a single point), complete job insecurity (yet I've always put personal and financial security hight on my priorities' list), needs to react right away to feedback (and often feels frazzled and stressed to do so, which lowers my usually punctual performance), is extremely self-critical, yet utterly loyal and supportive to everyone else, takes the constant criticism I receive personally (if you're a person and I'm a person, then it's personal), and don't feel appreciated for my work, on top of not being able to see any tangible result of said work (because performance is such a fleeting, time-defined event, that leaves no evidence, except a recording that I do not think is good enough anyway). Now I see why it took me so long to realize all of this - I was looking at every single tree in the forest and excelling at it, and missed the fact that I don't even like this forest at all! 
The question is what to do next..There are plenty of things I love about music and performing - friends that are colleagues, with whom to play, the storytelling aspect of performance, seeing your efforts touch an audience member/s, the afterparties. Yet I hate having to juggle multiple projects, being paid minimally for them, not getting to experience the laurels of the work, and the philosophy of ""you're only as good as your last performance"", which rules my current job description. You're as good as everything you've ever done up until here, and if you happen to have a shitty day and not everything in a performance is perfect, no one will die because of it. It's not brain surgery. 
What would you advise? Stay within the field but change direction (music administration? Outreach program organization?) or get an associate degree in accounting (although I make numerous mistakes with numbers?.. Yet apparently most jobs for ISFJs are in Medicine (too late for me and too messy), Accounting (I don't have the ISFJ's affinity to number crunching), and Business (I don't like lying and deceiving for the sake of profit). I'm really trying to find a career that would cater to my strengths - being very organized and focused worker, responsible, loyal, tactile, facility with languages, writing, desire to learn a skill very well and then excel at its application (I'm a little reluctant to learning new things when I don't see their practical application. I get tired when constantly bombarded with new information to process, which I understand is a major human and character flaw, since everyone says life is constant learning and change)
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! 
Thank you for reading until the end! "
1205,isfj,"I just want to say: don't let your typing as ISFJ dictate your career. If you have been feeling stressed with your job and unable to to figure out why, and MBTI has helped you see your traits in contrast with the demands of your field--that's great. But please don't feel you have to drop everything and become an accountant because the MBTI said so. 
You said you only found out about MBTI a few days ago, so take a while to sit back and think. Figure out how you really feel about your field and if there are ways you can change or manage the things that stress you and cultivate what you feel like it's lacking. I say this because I'm a stay at home artist, which is definitely not at the top of any ISFJ career list, and while some things don't mesh well I'm also passionate about what I do and would hate to give it up for a different job. Maybe I would be happier working in a library (I've considered it before) but I'm content with myself right now.
I unfortunately don't have more advice as to what direction to look at if you decide you do want to jump ship. Good luck though, and remember that you are you, not a type description, and you shouldn't let MBTI rule you whatever you decide (even if it can have some great advice sometimes)."
1206,isfj,"It's good to use your type as a stepping stone rather than an outright definition of you. That being said, you do seem to really enjoy music just not the stress of projects.
Have you considered teaching music lessons? You could set your own schedule, choose who you'll accept to teach, no performing required other than to guide the student(s). You'd also clearly see the effect you're having as the student learns more and more and becomes better. Other options are working backstage for music performances if you'd be into that.
Best of luck to you. "
1207,isfj,"My main job/major is a Computer Science so I was surrounded by a good amount of ISTJs
I've never been particularly close with an ISTJ (in person) but my general experience with ISTJs has either

Chill and down to earth. Fairly honest but every so once in a while kinda harsh with words. Competent and confident in what they do
A slight more extreme where brutal honesty is their default behavior. They know what needs to be done and prefer to work alone while doing so but they'll communicate when they need to. 
"
1208,isfj,"Lol this one is easy because my sister is an ISTJ. 
I'd say her most glaring quality is her ability to call it as it is... Pretty much brutal honesty. Everything is logical with her, her overconfidence in getting things done ON HER OWN, is very very noticeable. Think ""Angela"" from the tv show The Office. 
She does think a lot, which she mentions is her downfall. She has a very big issue discussing feelings or even discussing her own problems so it festers. She works even harder when she is stressed out. 
My sister is a nurse, and for an ISFJ like myself, when I start to worry about really small (in hindsight) and unfounded health issues (like a sore muscle that's been sore for a few days), she'd say things like, ""Are you breathing? Are you alive? Then no, it's not an emergency.""
When I need solid advice, when I am really down in the dumps and in the grip, my sister is pretty much my saving grace. She combats my intense softness with her intense hardness. She knows just the right words to say to counteract whatever I am feeling. She makes sense of things I can't make sense of. So I love that balance I get with her. As harsh as her words are when she's trying to get me out of whatever bad feeling I have, you can't help but really think that whatever she is saying is very logical and reasonable and so contrary to how an ISFJ like myself would view it. She doesn't do it in a commanding way like shouting orders at me to ""feel this, feel that!"" but rather, she asks me questions, but then answers them anyway because she knows my answers will not make any sense to her as my answers are almost always based on emotions, not logic or reason."
1209,isfj,"I have been an INFJ for years now, every time I take the test it always comes up INFJ.
In this last month, I have been seriously ill and more depressed because of several different reasons. Two days ago, I took the MBTI test again just to see and it came up as ISFJ.
Question: why am I now apparently more introverted sensing than introverted intuiting? My mind is very foggy a lot of times and I find it hard to concentrate most of the time. So, because of this has my personality changed and I can only wrap my mind around concrete facts? I can no longer see the bigger picture because I just have a hard time thinking lately? Does any of that make any sense?
Has anyone else had a change in their results of the MBTI test resulting from changes in life events that have happened to them?
Thank you in advance for any thoughts."
1210,isfj,"Well, MBTI tests are notoriously unreliable. I flipped between INFJ and ISFJ every time I took the test, and it took actually reading up on the cognitive functions to realize I'm definitely ISFJ. So, if you really are an INFJ, it's possible that if you've been depressed and ill, you've been relying more heavily on your inferior function, and thus answered in ways that caused the test to interpret you as a sensor rather than an intuitive. "
1211,isfj,"I went through a 'depression' where I went from ESFJ to being ISFJ. I don't know if it was a part of me growing up and maturing, or if it was my 'depression', or...my S.O. thinks I'm an ""extrovert riddled with anxiety"" instead of an introvert. It's a little complicated.
If it helps any, I depend on people a lot and I don't know if that cancels out some of my introversion."
1212,isfj,"Hi there, 
I think there's a misunderstanding here.
Your MBTI type does not change through your life, and is independent of your answers' variability to MBTI test. This could be surprising, but it is true.
There's a post by Heidi Priebe on ThoughtCatalog.com that explains that crystal clear.
You can also find nice information about ""tertiary loop"" and ""inferior grip"" that can also improve your understanding of why your type does not change despite your answers to the test could make you believe it does.
A bit more research on the Internet about the rise & expression of cognitive functions trough age may also help you understand what I mean here.
I can provide you links to useful articles if you want.
Hoping this answer could be of some help,
Kind regards, 
PY"
1213,isfj,"Thank you! That actually made sense to me! I say that not as an insult to you, I just needed a good laymans explanation. And, I like that you recognize that the test can be unreliable. I didn't want to come off as an idiot, but I wondered how accurate it really is."
1214,isfj,"No problem, I'm glad I was able to help! And yeah, I don't have any hard numbers, but MBTI tests are fairly unreliable to the best of my knowledge, because they're asking you agree/disagree-style questions and fitting you to a type based on your answer (usually via the introvert-extrovert, sensing-intuiting, thinking-feeling, judging-perceiving categories rather than the cognitive functions, which would further compromise the accuracy). It may be accurate in some cases, but MBTI is about motivation and cognitive processing more than behavior or opinions, so it's very possible for a test to give you an inaccurate result because you answered a certain way for a different reason than the test expected you to. That's my understanding, anyway! "
1215,isfj,"I have an ISFJ mom, and she’ll eventually give in to my sister asking for her to undo her punishment, and she’ll seem kind of hurt on the inside but behave in a childish way about it on the outside. Why is this so?"
1216,isfj,"She reacts angrily and childishly, though. I mean I'm pretty stupid when it comes to the emotions of others, but I think that'd make sense.
There will be screaming between the two, and my sister will say nonsense, lie, and have a meltdown, because she won't get her phone which she's addicted to. My mom will resist for a long time, but she'll eventually give in. Her methodology doesn't work, but she has a fragile, child-like ego that never developed properly, partly attached to her age and being a mom, so she's unwilling to listen to others. She won't listen to others on what to do."
1217,isfj,"She seems very ISFJ to me.
Ah. That'd make sense.
I think much of Gen X and the Baby Boomer gen have this problem with their egos, especially Gen X and Baby Boomers in Texas...I just moved to a city where almost everyone has a truck, and chances are it's a big truck on big wheels..I can guarantee you at least a large percentage of these people don't need trucks...Also, a huge percentage of this city consists of rednecks and white trash. If you think Honey Boo Boo was bad...This is WAY worse..."
1218,isfj,"Her desire to serve others and her ""need to be needed."" She's bad at delegating. She has ""inferior Ne"" moments. She stresses herself out and overworks herself. She's the typical American mother, enjoying kids. She even taught pre-kindergarten. She's a homemaker too. She's clingy. She has major Si. She's like an introverted ESFJ. 
She has tiny penis syndrome (don't know the actual name), though, which significantly hinders her."
1219,isfj,Does she feel like she always has to help other people but is overbearing? Reason I ask is because my dad is the same way and he's an ESTJ. I don't think your mom is T based on your description of her but she could be an ESFJ. I've heard they tend to be a bit introverted.
1220,isfj,"She's definitely not an ESTJ...She definitely uses her Fe, but she's not ""gossip girl"" or anything. She's also not the ""grandma giving candy"" kind of person. She's whiny but not as much as ESFJs. It's worth noting too the problem she has. She's not squeally. She has that ""Oooh. A novelty"" to her when something interests her."
1221,isfj,But how?!? My dad tries to help the family all the time but he uses Te. He does this by making sure they're on the right track to succeed. I would think an Fe dom would prefer to everyone is wanting to do the same thing. They want to find the thing that works for everyone and go that rather than what they want to do.
1222,isfj,"I love doing presentations in front of class whenever I have to and love talking to people, but am kind of shy when it comes to parties. I love parties when it involves friends that I know, and I dont mind if half the people there I dont know, but if im with a group of people I dont know, I want to get away.
Shouldn't there be a middle ground when it comes to the mbti?"
1223,isfj,"I'm also an isfj and am the exact same way. I love public speaking or talking with friends. Taking with people I don't know is when i get shy. Nobody's introverted all the time. Being introverted isn't all about being shy it's more about not ""needing"" to be around people all of the time. "
1224,isfj,"I find it funny that you like giving presentations. I LOVE giving presentations and  public speaking, which I felt was really odd thing to enjoy as an introvert. I even gave presentations at a competitive level for a student organization I was a part of in college.
I can come across as an extrovert to people because I can be very outgoing and engaging in a one on one conversation, but I can only do that for so long. I definitely need time alone to recharge my batteries. Sometimes I feel like I am putting on a facade and it feels disingenuous. I just try to be friendly and engaging with people because I don't want to come across as uninterested or apathetic. However, I don't truly feel comfortable enough to show my ""true self"" until I really get to know someone, which for me seems take a very long time."
1225,isfj,"I like talking in front of classes. I especially love improv or acting on a stage in front of people. I like making people laugh and feel comfortable doing so on a stage. 
I do have an interesting story though. For my first speech in Public Speaking in college, I did a speech on Coca Cola. I felt more comfortable acting as the creator of Coca Cola than simply speaking as myself. Because I felt like I was acting, I felt more comfortable giving a speech... Weird but relevant story. "
1226,isfj,"I'm an introvert most of the time, but my extrovert side will occasionally come out when with close friends. The longer we are hanging out, the more I start to really express myself. It rarely happens, but it's definitely there.
Also, depending on my mood, I'll come up as an ESFJ sometimes when taking an MBTI test, but I'm mostly ISFJ"
1227,isfj,"I'm introverted in the sense that I want/need time alone to decompress, and I'm shy around new people.  I don't really feel like I have a problem talking to people, though, and once I warm up to strangers I'm fine."
1228,isfj,"I actually consider myself ambiverted, a mix of the two. I love acting, and speaking in front of others, but I definitely love being by myself rather than with new people. A lot of actors and comedians are introverted so this is totally normal :)"
1229,isfj,"I also love giving presentations in class. I am not sure why, but I like that I prepare and think that I am sharing something with others... I don't really enjoy being the center of attention, but if I am doing it in front of the class I really like it!
I also agree that I am able to talk one-on-one to people somewhat comfortably (but do horribly in small/large groups) because it's easier to focus my attention on what that one person might be thinking... But just because I talk to them doesn't mean I am showing my ""true colors""-- it takes me such a long time to truly open up to people."
1230,isfj,"Besides the introverted part its pretty spot on haha, I tried it with my skype buds, they all hit the nail on the head, so I guess we just need to wait until further progress is made in the early life of psychology to get access to a more accurate test."
1231,isfj,"Basically as above.
On all the websites I've been on, they all say that ISFJ's are kind and empathetic people. Although I feel like I'm the least empathetic out of all of my friends (most of them don't have Fe in their stacks) and it makes me question whether or not I'm an ISFJ or not.
Is it possible to have a low amount of empathy and still be an ISFJ?"
1232,isfj,Do you at least have a lot of empathy with people you care about? I feel like I can turn my empathy on and off when appropriate. So in certain circumstances I can be the least empathetic and in others the most. 
1233,isfj,"Need? To be an isfj? You're either an isfj or you're not, and the amount of empathy isfjs has varies like just any other type. If course isfjs tend to have quite a load of empathy, but again it varies!"
1234,isfj,Empathy means you can read how people feels which is literally Fe. It doesn't mean you pity them or have to do something with it. I don't bother to fix strangers emotions because I don't give a damn. I use powers for my friends and family.
1235,isfj,"I am an entp who has studied personality theory for a while, and my wife is an isfj. We regularly retested her for a while because she felt like this, but we're certain now that isfj is correct. 
Isfj is a very common type so there is more variety than other types. Additionally, no one is an embodiment  of the ""ideal"" isfj. Everyone he's personal experience, different levels of development, and trauma that affects their processes. My wife grew up between a mother that was very non-empathetic and tried to instill in her a ""take care of number one attitude"" and a father who loved big groups and had to be the center of attention. Lots of family drama and all that really caused some issues with her Fe development. 
Fe is the process that gives you your empathy, and if it doesn't develop correctly then whenever it begins to fail and you get stressed your shadow Fi can come in to play. You can get pushy, rude, and stubborn.
My advice is to simply be aware of it. Type theory is not the only field out there, but it would suggest your ""best you"" can be empathetic and is best when it treats people that way, but forcing it only brings out that shadow. Try to avoid that stress, but don't avoid groups. Expose yourself and be receptive to change. It's not easy, but you might have the potential to grow into it and feel healthier. "
1236,isfj,"Well, like another person said, the level of empathy really depends. I've met cold ISFJ's who come off more like ISTJ's or INTP's. I've met Fe-auxes with nasty hearts. I think most people have some kind of empathy, but I've met cold ISFJ's and in this world, you'll meet them too."
1237,isfj,"Eh, I do have a bit more empathy with my friends, but I don't think it's enough to be actually considered proper empathy. I do feel bad, just not enough to actually feel what they're feeling ^^;; 
I do care about them though, and when I feel like I'm not being helpful enough when they're struggling I tend to feel kinda guilty."
1238,isfj,"I'm alright with reading people's emotions, I just don't do much about it half of the time. Plus my face, along with my voice lacks expression which makes everyone around me think I'm cold and emotionless.
It's good that you're dedicated to your friends and family :) I'd like to help my family and friends too, but like I said above, it doesn't really show;;;"
1239,isfj,"There's been a few major situations where my friends have been really affected, but for some reason I couldn't even shed a tear about it. I think I'm only able to empathise when it's related to something that's directly connected to me. I'd really like to improve my empathy though, but I just don't know how."
1240,isfj,"I just want to share something that has happened to me in the last few days that might be beneficial to other ISFJs here. This post might be a little self-involved but I hope that you all can relate to the situation. 
I would say that I am an average male that goes to university, possibly above average looks and not completely socially awkward, so an eligible partner for someone.. somewhere. Anyways, seemingly as a typical ISFJ male, I have not had a wealth of experience with girls, am extremely timid and shy in 50/50 situations I can't envisage the outcome of. I am also self-sabotager when girls show interest who I am not interested in, and feel terrible about it afterwards. In other words, ""what are you doing man?"", is what I say to myself a lot. I had a few girlfriends when I was at school, however they were more ""girlfriends"". I could hardly say they were serious.
So I have pretty much been in love with the same girl for a year, and finally got the courage to ask her out yesterday. She said no, that she liked me as a person etc. Working up the courage to ask her out was difficult enough, but being rejected after putting my whole self on the line was extremely terrifying as an experience. As one would naturally expect, I was crushed and cried myself to sleep, wallowing in self pity (haha).
So she is my co-worker and today I knew I would be around her at work and I assumed my world was about to crumble. I promised to myself I would at least be brave upon first interaction. I have no idea when or how this happened, but the moment I said hi to her, I did not sink into myself but rather owned the person who I am. It was like I matured instantly. I was not awkward and didn't actively avoid her, which was definitely something I thought would happen to me in the past. Although the pain of rejection hurts, I don't feel like I am the one with the problem (not totally, though) and even going so far to think that maybe she might have missed out on me. I've not really felt this confident in a long time.. which is completely strange as I thought I would be in the dumps for weeks.
I'm not sure what I actually meant with this post, but just wanted to share it anyways. So all of you tentative ISFJs, I say seize the moment. Do not be like me and wait a year to ask someone out, because you may be holding your own self back. The asking wasn't even that bad! It was slightly exhilarating. Now of course it is not all blue skies ahead, I will probably feel sad about this in the near future.. but at least I know that there were some positives to come from this otherwise bleak situation.
tl;dr: feel weirdly refreshed and confident after being rejected from someone I was in love with. Gonna be sad at some points but mainly surprised and happy I have grown from this situation."
1241,isfj,"I can completely relate to this post, thank you for sharing it! It takes so much for us to build up the courage to actually ask someone or to genuinely tell them how we feel which is why it hurts us so much if they decline. The immediate aftermath hurts, and hurts hard, but as long as you don't lull over 'what could have been' forever, then everything gets easier.
I also think self-esteem is important too because if you thought you were the problem it'd take longer to get over her. But since you are happy with your looks, social skills, etc. you accepted that it's her loss rather than something wrong with you.
Good luck out there, keep your chin up :)"
1242,isfj,"Not sure that was the reason for the rejection, I thought I masked it pretty well. Also I work in hospitality and not an office so it's not an amazing job nor anything in close quarters so I don't really mind too much."
1243,isfj,"I often get these boosts of confidence after some kind of rejection like this. It's weird but once I get over the initial sadness, I almost wake up feeling like the world looks and feels a little better and I'm more motivated to do better. A day after my last big breakup I was talking to everyone about how it was probably the best thing for me, even though it wasn't my decision "
1244,isfj,"Hi everyone,
I’m an ISFJ struggling to find a career path and have recently been introduced to a career path in the insurance industry, and was wonder if anyone had any experience working in the industry?
If so, what do you do?  What do you like and not like about it? Does it have decent career potential?"
1245,isfj,"I do! I work as a commercial underwriter (assistant for the time being while growing my own book) at an E&S MGA. It isn't what I ever saw myself doing, but I've been with my company for 3 years. The portion I actually struggle with the most is the marketing while I try to build my own agency relationships, but I love the fact that there is always something new to learn. No two insureds/policies are the same. I'm offered the opportunity for continual growth in this career, which I did not have in my previous career as a Vet Tech. 
Do you have any specific questions about the job? "
1246,isfj,"Excess and Surplus Lines Managing General Agent. Basically, we are the middle man between the agents who deal directly with the customers and the companies that actually provide the insurance. We have contracts with the insurers, so we get the applications and business from the agents and use our connections to find the best rates and terms with the insurers we represent.
My company in particular is huge on relationship building with our agents because we want to be the first broker they think of when the piece of business comes in. We also want to be responsive and accurate for our agents.
Adding in that this is my first insurance job, so I'm unsure if it's the same with every company but I imagine it would be an important aspect. "
1247,isfj,"I switched because research has been my career goal but I hadn’t had the opportunity until recently. If you’re stuck on wanting to do insurance, and if you’ve got a head for numbers, I’d recommend the actuarial track. "
1248,isfj,"I recently found out that I'm an ISFJ about a week ago.
My friend was really curious to see how I'd turn out and if she'd be correct.
She wasn't disappointed XD 
However, when my results were finished, I received a 1% of sensing over intuition, but to my preference, I don't feel as if I only use one of these things the majority of the time.
Anybody else have a similar result?"
1249,isfj,"Google cognitive functions, like ""isfj cognitive functions""  - - you'll find we are Si Fe Ti Ne but infj are Ni Fe Ti Se. So we have Fe and Ti the same but our two outer functions are different.
To type yourself it helps to take the online tests, but an even more accurate way would be to read about the functions and then determine which ones you use the most and rank them 1st to 4th. There's certain orders they have to be in etc but you can learn a lot from it! "
1250,isfj,"ISTJ here. I'm currently interested in romantically pursuing an ISFJ. 
So far, we've been on just one date and I'm quite sure our communication styles are similar (concrete and present). But I'm curious if an ISFJ's decision-making process is similar to an ISTJ's, 
My dominant Si means that I tend to sponge up information which then marinates in my mind for a while so that my Fi has ample time to make sense of it all. This means that when it comes to deciding on how I feel about someone, especially in a romantic sense, I require lots of personal time (could be days or weeks) to reflect on the experiences that I had with the person in question.
With Si being the ISFJ's dominant function as well, do you operate in a similar manner of requiring time for your Ti to introspect and make sense of an experience that you had?"
1251,isfj,"It’s hard to speak for all ISFJs out there because I think decision making processes are not only dependent of thinking style or personality types but tend to be shaped by personal experiences as well. However..
I think we could be quite similar. Speaking for myself I’m very much in my head trying to make sense of everything, but I will let how someone makes me feel weigh in quite heavily. So if I were to reflect on a date I had, I’d recall someone’s facial expressions, their tone of voice, their smile, the things he said, but also how all those things my Sensor function picked up made me feel about him or about myself, or about our compatibility, etc. Also, I’d be thinking about the future, about the next date or further along (if it went well haha) and try to imagine me being in different settings with that person to figure out how I feel. 
Does this make sense to you?"
1252,isfj,"Thank you, I appreciate your response :) 
Could you elaborate more on this?"
1253,isfj,"Sure. I described some things my sensor function would pick up, eg how he looked at me, how he treated the waiter in the restaurant, how he walks, talks, the things he said and the way he (looked when he) said them etcetera. All those sensory things will “marinate” in my head as you accurately described it and then I’ll translate them into feelings. So how did the way he looked at me when I said X make me feel? How do the things he said make me feel about him as a person? Can I continue dating someone who said X? How do I feel about being with someone who is interested in [insert topic]? Will I have a meaningful connection with someone who does/says/thinks X? (cannot stress the meaningful connection part enough, that’s what makes us tick) What will my friends think of him? Or my parents? Do all of these things make me want to have another date? 
All ISFJs (and other Feeling types for that matter) that I know need to have a meaningful connection with someone to consider them dateable or real friends. We bond over feelings, shared beliefs/interests/experiences. We want to know what makes you tick. So be open with your ISFJ and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable and share your thoughts and feelings (I know you have those :)) with him or her."
1254,isfj,"Thanks for explaining, this is really helpful :) 
I used to be terrible at this. I think I'm getting better nowadays because I've learnt that it's a good way to connect with people. But it's still a butt clenching moment for me whenever I try to share my feelings because I don't know if I'm doing it right. It's like walking around in the dark and the other person's high Fe means that they have night vision and can see all my clumsy movements. 
May I know how you'd feel when you've opened up to someone and they don't reciprocate for whatever reason? Would you feel disappointed and/or cheated? Like you're trying to connect with this person but your signal is just going down a blackhole?"
1255,isfj,"Being clumsy is also vulnerable and we love it. We won’t judge you for it: to see you make the effort is everything. If I can’t make a connection with someone after I opened up, I’ll feel ashamed/humiliated and will feel like a weirdo who’s oversharing. There’s a big chance I won’t do it ever again with that person, unless they open up first."
1256,isfj,"I often find myself wanting to learn how to do something (Drawing specifically has been something I wished I could do. I can draw a kick ass stick man though?) 
But alas then I'm just too lazy to practice and learn."
1257,isfj,"Yes - when I see something I like, whether it's someone dancing, or a crafty thing, or a type of food, I'm rarely content to just enjoy it.  I want to do it myself, and I want to do it just as well as that other person did it.  It leads to me jumping around a lot from hobby to hobby, because at least 50% of the time, once I try the thing myself, it's not  nearly as fun as I thought it would be, and I end up quitting."
1258,isfj,Yes! Absolutely. I love making things. More so I prefer to make things for people. I would rather make a present rather than buy one for example. I just find it really rewarding to make things. Sewing tends to be what I'm good at though. 
1259,isfj,"Or, if you're still in school... how are you doing, in terms of grades?  Do you do well on testing?  Do you feel that you are smart?  I've always been known as a straight A student around my school, and my peers consider me smart.  I think I'm... sort of smart.  I'm very motivated, for sure - I have the urge to learn everything and get good at everything.  I've always taken advanced classes, but I feel like my ""intelligence"" is more memory-based than anything else.  I don't always do well on testing, even when I get the material, because of anxiety.  
Oh, and one more question: What do you do for a living?  I have about 10 potential career options in mind that I really like - nurse, engineer, sales-woman (my friends think I'd make a great one, and I generally do well with public speaking,) doctor, therapist (though I've heard this takes a long time,) teacher, accountant, pharmacist, financial manager, etc.  I think I'm good at many things (and bad at many things) so I could see myself with a number of careers."
1260,isfj,"Stepping back, I'm doing pretty well in school compared to some others. I am currently the top 10% of my class, graduating early from college with a 4.0 with a double major, receiving departmental honors in research with a professor of mine. 
That being said, I DO NOT chalk that up to my intelligence- I stand by saying that I got where I am being I work EXTREMELY hard for everything I do. I have always felt like to get to the same level as everybody else, I have to work 2x as hard for it, and in college, I needed to prove to myself that my hard work can pay off. Not as a competition to my peers, not a competition to myself, but just to teach myself that my work has some kind of effect in the end and it all pays off. It's one of my only forms of motivation (which i feel like makes sense because isfj's often look on their past experiences to make sense of their present self).
I completly agree with you too, I am very good at memorizing, which comes in handy for assignments and general knowledge, but i often choke out on big tests that puts a lot of pressure on me. I am also very afraid of being a disappointment to other people, so I try to overcompensate my worth by demonstrating academic skill.
I am a huge believer in that you can accomplish ANYTHING that you want to do, so when it comes to school or work or friends or hobbies, you can do anything that you set your mind to. For me, I wanted to do well in school, so I have done everything in my college career to do that. 
And it took me a realllly long time to figure out my career path haha, but I got it! After debating with myself and considering all other possibilities, my top choices were: nurse, psy.d therapist, HR manager, and pathophysiologist. I knew I needed to be in a career centered around helping people, but I also wanted a job where I could learn about so many different things and have something new everyday. Out of the blew, my career path stumbled upon me. Audiology! Its really great because not only do I get to help people on a daily basis, giving people something that they've lost back to them (their hearing), I also get to counsel them, I get to learn the different pathways that you use to hear, I know the anatomy, and I love learning about new disorders and learning to diagnose them. Aud's have specialties too. I think isfj's are so good at giving so much of themselves to other people, but we still need recognition for what we do. If I were you, start looking places where your hard work that you do wont be snubbed or glanced over. 
Again, i think you can do anything that you set your mind to. If you love it and you think its worth it, that's all that will really matter in the end! If you're happy, you can spend more time helping other people become that happy, too. Sorry if this was too long, this is my 1st post!! Good luck with whatever path you decide :)"
1261,isfj,"In elementary school I did great, I was so afraid of messing up or breaking the rules. Turned in all my homework and did well on tests. Once I got to middle school and high school, I realized I didn’t need to do all that and stopped caring. I liked to learn, but hated school. In high school, I was a pro bullshitter, I probably did homework less than 5 times, never read a single book. Still managed to pass by being respectful to teachers and not causing problems. I wasn’t great on tests because I never studied haha, almost failed the ACT. All I cared about was music and sports. 
When I got to university I got a 4.0 my first year, I think living on my own kicked me into gear. Second year I went to local community college and lived at home. I had no idea what I wanted to do for a career and basically went to school so I wasn’t “a dropout.” That second year I was really depressed/angry, skipped class, didn’t care, but still managed to pass. Still hated school. I dropped out. It was the best thing I’ve done. 
Been out of school for 2 years now and found my passion, I’m much happier. I enjoy learning on my own and teaching myself new things. I’d consider myself smart, but not totally in the school sense. I’m a logical thinker with knowledge of random subjects across the board. I can sometimes see what I lack now, from not caring or learning anything in high school when it comes to reading, English and occasionally history. The only subject I learned from was math.
Edit: for a living I’m a delivery driver, but currently been backpacking for 8 months. I hope to get into the film industry and make documentaries about people around the world."
1262,isfj,"I did well in school. Top ten of my graduating class (tho my class was kind of small...180 people haha). Participated in honors stuff, educational competitions, did fine. Went to college, did fine, went to grad school, did fine. I'm now working a low-paying job in foodservice but it doesn't have anything to do with my intelligence level, moreso my inability to overcome my fear of job interviews and rejections. (Also related to my extreme depression. Which is getting better but also not really.)
Ideally I'd like to work in the book publishing world, which is what I went to school for, but I overestimated my motivation to actually get a job."
1263,isfj,"I would say I am more academic than intelligent. I have gotten straight As throughout my schooling. My partner is an INTJ, much more naturally intelligent than I am. However he usually is not as persistent as I am. I do things because they're a means to an end and I work damn hard at it to deliver consistently high results. He only puts effort into things that interests him. If he's bored in a class he checks out mentally and daydreams about something else. I know how to test well and find out what the marker wants by giving it to them in an organised manner.
I've grown a lot, I'm not as insecure as I used to be which makes me a lot more confident and less anxious around others. I don't enjoy public speaking but if I do it, no one can tell because I come off competent while I'm in the act. I did my degree in accounting because I love categorising and organising. Now I'm looking towards a career in HR because I do love interacting with others and finding out about their struggles, despite being an introvert. My friends always come to me for emotional support and advice. I try my hardest to be objective and not as judgmental."
1264,isfj,"Average. I stuck in college 5 years now. I don't care about my major anymore. I switch jobs to often. I have never been in one job longer than year. I used to be salesman for long time but shit is not worth when you back home frustrated everyday. 
I am curious to become personal trainer but my body is too fat and I lift shit weight to be one."
1265,isfj,"I did pretty well in school. In high school, I started off in regular courses and did super well in those. However, I thought they were too easy so I moved up to the gifted program. I always liked math and  science courses. I ended up taking 4 AP Courses as a senior. I took the AP Calc test and got a 4 and the AP Gov test and got a 3. In college, It was a bit of an adjustment getting used to be on my own and adjusting to college life. Part of the reason I chose accounting is cause I like math so much. First year I ended with like a 2.5 GPA. But I was able to get that up when I learned better study skills. I consider myself to be pretty smart (although not a genius haha) cause I can learn quickly from my mistakes and improve overtime. I also like to learn things on my own such as MBTI and Enneagram. I think our dominant Si can be a real asset when it comes to college and school.
I’m an accounting major right now get ready to graduate and hope to get my CPA in the future. It’s cool that you are interested in accounting, I feel like it’s great fit for ISFJs since accounting is a detail-orientated and pragmatic career."
1266,isfj,"I don't know if I'm too late--but I'm doing pretty well in school! I get consistently high grades and graduated with a few awards. I don't know if I'm smart as well, because from what I noticed I also am a memory-based learner. I'm about to go to a pretty good college and afaik it's the best in our country, so I'm kind of afraid and excited at the same time.
I'll take a science course! I wish I would become a successful geologist in time. I still have to work alot on my self-confidence though. (I'm an ISFJ-T, with my T being an exaggerating 97% lol)"
1267,isfj,"What do you like doing? (For instance being good at public speaking doesn't necessarily mean one loves it and would like to do it year after year..). Think of something you like doing, and choose a career where there are many jobs available, and which pays ok. Good luck!"
1268,isfj,"Oh I so relate to you! I also feel my intelligence through school was largely memory based. But it worked for me. I studied engineering, and work as a scientist now. University was tough but I pulled through with average grades. My mental health got really low in university, as a combination of school pressure and family/personal issues. But now the years are paying off now. I wish you luck!"
1269,isfj,valedictorian--- though i wouldnt consider myself naturally smart. i always had to study and i take long to truly grasp concepts. i'm not the best test taker either. sometimes i am not completely confident in myself and don't want to trust my intuition on certain application-based test questions because i rely so much on patterns and what i have studied.
1270,isfj,"I did well in school, always taking honors classes and always made honor roll. However, I sucked at standardized tests. I’m wondering now if it was anxiety and the pressure under a timed situation that was hard for me to prepare for. 
That being said, I went to college and majored in accounting. I was an auditor for 10 years and now I’m a financial consultant. I LOVE it because I have a lot of freedom and flexibility. I also work with a lot of engineers that I admire incredibly. 
I’m above average in intelligence but I attribute my success to perseverance. The most intelligent aren’t always the most successful. 
Be sure to recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Self awareness is key."
1271,isfj,"Well hey, what a great 1st post!  And wow, ISFJ, you're doing really well in life!  And that's a great way to motivate yourself.  I personally motivate myself with my concerns for the future - in the past, when I haven't done so well on certain things, I've managed to motivate myself by reminding myself that in order to be successful one day, I need to be doing well right now.  People sometimes call me weak, but I know good and damn well that I'm not.  When I fall down, I get right back up, and I work harder than I was working before.  I want to be valedictorian one day, and I'm aiming for that, more than almost anything else.  I want to do well in life, find a place and sense of happiness.  
And dude, I hate testing.  I know there have been arguments about whether or not ""testing anxiety"" is real on this site, and I usually receive a higher score than other people on tests, but for me I need to study consistently - consistently - to test well.  I'm the kind of person who croaks under a pop quiz.  I'm trying to find a good way to find my passion in life, so goal is to ask different people with different careers what they do, and see if it appeals to me."
1272,isfj,"Oh man I studied engineering, but I feel so curious how my life would have turned out if I studied accounting instead. At points I've wished I did. And your description of growth totally relates to me. As I grow more confident and learn to be my authentic self, I get along so much better with coworkers which is awesome"
1273,isfj,Never too late to pivot! I thought a lot about changing directions. I felt like life had to be a certain way and changing meant that I was going off script. Took me a lot of soul searching to settle on HR now and the decision as based on my personal values (I love helping people and ISFJs are natural empaths with a strong sense of justice) as well as the practical demand for jobs in that industry. I always doubt my ability and I sometimes look back on my own accomplishments and wonder how I did it. Self efficacy is still an issue at times but I'm practicing cognitive behavioural techniques to not be so fearful or doubtful. It seems to help!
1274,isfj,"yeah this question is kinda strange but i want to know if someone else is able to tell very fast what kind of person someone is?
Because whenever i met someone new i dont need much time to tell that this is a good or bad person. Its just i look at them and i know i want to have something to do with them or not."
1275,isfj,"Mm, maybe like a week or two of consistent contact? Some people it's obvious right off the bat (people who are loudly bigoted or openly mean/cranky, that kind of thing), but a lot of the time I think I tend to assume the best of people or take their ""polite social face"" at face value and then realize as they relax more that they're not someone I want to be around. "
1276,isfj,"I do this too but I've learned to not judge people to quickly some can surprise you , but usually my first though of them is right , I look at how they act on certain situations,  the way the interact with people . "
1277,isfj,"I can tell if someone has the right motives or not, or whether I need to be cautious of them. Couldn't tell you why that is though, they give me an odd feeling is all :P But as for getting to know people and wanting to spend time with them, it can take me weeks to really see who they are and become motivated to keep in contact with them, if I was trying to date someone for example."
1278,isfj,"Same here! I (try to) assume the best people at first and try not to judge them until having gotten to know them well, but eventually you just get a vibe that they aren't a person to be around (Si/Fe?), and that vibe tends to be right."
1279,isfj,"I used to get in trouble in school, too. I could ace every exam but that low/nonexistent participation grade really screwed me over. Just because I don't feel like interacting doesn't mean I am not learning. So frustrating. "
1280,isfj,"Hm. I was always missing the mark in class participation but I really had nothing to say and I was too quiet to want to answer questions. However I heard no complaints otherwise, I was a ""pleasure to have in the classroom"" ha. The one time where I felt really bad for it was when my nanny (really just a girl a couple years older than me at the time) said that I would be the old lady that died and no one would know for weeks. That hurt to say the least."
1281,isfj,"Hi
My ISFJ wife and i (ENTJ) are married since 5 years, both ca. 30 yrs old.
Not having common life style and interests causes great pain in our marriage.
She is mostly interested in practical works and personal well being where-ever she is.
I am just interested in achieving together greater things and pushing forvard in life.
​
It makes me very sad to see, how different our focus is because we dont pull on the same strings.
What would you suggest?
​
Best greetings"
1282,isfj,"Socionics views entj/isfj as conflicting types. We use functions completely differently, therefore hold different values.
Isfj: Si, Fe, Ti, Ne
Entj Te, Ni, Se, Fi
Si values stability, consistency, practicality, internal physical homeostasis. Therefore physical change can be incredibly stressful, even though metaphysical/perspective changes highly desired (Ne seeking- change, different perspectives, open-minded)
Fe values exchange of pleasantries and making decisions that benifit the common good.
Ti enjoys learning for the sake of learning, not achieving. It enjoys creating webs of logic internally, not necessarily to be used to gain anything.
Versus:
Te enjoys learning for the sake of achieving, not learning itself. 
Fi makes decisions based on how something aligns with IT’S values, not the benifit of common good. But it can be empathetic. This is your last function though.
Se doesn’t get stressed about physical changes and doesn’t take internal homeostasis too seriously.
Ni is less open to metaphysical changes and perspectives, and instead continues the path it’s carved. (Whereas the isfjs Ne wants to mentally float and see alternatives, even though it’s our last function and we’re not the best at it).
I hope this helps you understand why there may be a lot of challenges in this relationship. I hope that even made sense for you.
A solution? I would say be understanding of the differences and try not to change either yourself or her in a way that doesn’t align with each other’s values. Rather perhaps gently nudge one another in a loving way to remind each other of your differences, but how those differences, although challenging, can help grow/develop one another and thus the relationship blossom."

​
She will want to take care of you so that you can you achieve great things, just not always with you. ISFJs like to support someone in their ambitions in the sense that you will always have a good base holding you up.
​
If that doesn't work you may want to consider divorcing honestly."
1284,isfj,"Actually this is untrue, ISFJ - ENTJ is a duality. The ISFj sounds exactly like ISFJ (and dualities are based on descriptions) and the functions are defined differently. I did not get along with my ENTP teacher at all. I don’t think I’d get along with ENTJ either to be fair. lol
Also I would not give relationship advice, or suggest a divorce, based on this. Really he should be talking to a marriage counselor instead of asking strangers on reddit. "
1285,isfj,"If you’re referencing Socionics, duality for an isfp is entp (in Socionics isfp is generally and in most cases equivilant to isfj): http://www.socionics.com/articles/howto.htm. This translates from Socionics to mbti as isfj and entp duality relations, yes. Not mbti isfj entj. This is, as I mentioned, conflicting types:http://www.socionics.com/rel/rel.htm. 
The OP asked for suggestions which I gave him. He can think for himself as to what to do with that, as any general conversation goes. Agreed counseling could be helpful. I never suggested divorce. Glad you’re in tune on what you would do. Good thing we are all different, with some open to providing different perspectives."
1286,isfj,"Don't. You'll wanna guide her as gently as you can, taking care that the steps are easily laid out for her. Sensing doms sometimes fear the unknown quite a bit. So if you wanna push her in the right direction let her take it at her own pace however talk about it without throwing any blame at her. Let her know that you wanna take the journey of growth together."
1287,isfj,"Sorry for the delay. 
There's so much that can be said.
I've always had a thing for ISFJs (and ENFJs) going back to grade school.
I like that they are calm, modest, gentle, dedicated, and quite souls, just to name a few things.
I don't like that they seem to expect trusted companions of the opposite sex to somehow pick up on their faint hint. They want me to just know what is going on; even for an INFJ that's a stretch. They can be so subtle that it's hard to know what they REALLY want or think until it's toooo late. They hold themselves back a lot. They are hyper conscious of being judged by the social standards they find themselves in, this makes it hard for them to cut loose and relax in a new environment. They always need to be on their best behavior (but I love this also). 
​
They can be quite forgiving.. but not entirely, they will always ""remember"". 
​
The biggest challenge is getting back into their good graces once you've been replaced as a best friend (not unlike INFJs)."
1288,isfj,"I'm aware of different perspectives, but your advice is pretty harmful b/c you're wrong. I said ISFJ = ISFj. Socionics j/p is the same definition as mbti J/P. Someone who tests as ISFJ will typically test as ISFj too. ISFj is a rational type-that means more organized, plan ahead, make decisions early, stick to schedules, etc. Read a basic ISFj description; it's the same type.
It makes a big difference, because ENTJ is actually the ideal (dual) match for ISFJ. 
It's a myth that j/p switches. Read up about socionics letters here.

http://www.socionics.com/main/types.htm
Rationals (j)
Tend to plan ahead, make decisions early
Are more often rigid and stubborn
Do not like to change their decisions
Tend to finish what they started.
Usually have stiff movements.
Usually more 'authoritarian' leadership style.
Low stress tolerance.
Irrationals (p)
Tend to wait and see, more spontaneous
Are more often flexible and tolerant.
Change their decisions frequently.
Tend to start new things without finishing them.
Usually have gentle movements.
Usually more 'democratic' leadership style.
High stress tolerance.
I'm aware you never suggested divorce, but the other guy commenting did-pretty hilarious."
1289,isfj,"Hi guys, I posted this elsewhere, but wanted to ask for your advice because I think ISFJs give really good advice. Also because we are a bit different personality types, I’d love to hear your perspective. 
There was a guy I met almost two years ago. It wasn’t exactly love at first sight, but very close. I had never met anyone I felt this intensely about, even though I have loved people in the past. When we were together, it felt like time stopped. I remember going on a date with him and not being able to say much becsuse I couldn’t stop staring at him.
He was in a really bad place, as was I. We were both struggling with depression and both had just gotten out of shitty relationships. He was closed off and impulsive and I was clingy. We were on again and off again for a bit until I called it off, but I regretted it the minute that I did. We’ve since moved on with other people, but for me, I have never met someone else who made me feel the way he did. Dating feels like work because I have to constantly convince myself to keep giving guys a shot. For awhile I was preoccupied with other people but recently I’ve been remembering him more and more. And when my married friends talk about how they felt when they met the one, it mirrors the feelings I had for him. We’ve run into each other a couple of times and each time the feelings have been just as intense.
We didn’t end things well. He told me that the way I was acting was pushing him away. Over the years I have done much better and am now very much the confident, kind and calm person I’d like to be. I know that if I met him now, I would have handled the situation much differently.
He’s moved out of the city after graduating from his masters program, but is starting a job in a nearby town. If he’s not still with the girl I saw him with last winter, I know dating will be really hard for him in the middle of nowhere. I have been considering reaching out to him, but I don’t know what to say. Has anyone done this and what happened? Has anyone found peace another way and moved on? I never thought I would still be thinking of him almost two years later, but I think he was really special to me and I feel like I will only live once and don’t want to live in regret for so much of it. He’s and ESFP and I’m an ENFP if that matters.
Thanks so much in advance guys :)"
1290,isfj,"Hello ENFP,
I am with you, you could try reaching out to him. I can only tell you what I'd do if I felt like what you expressed in the post... this isn't really an advice but... you can think about it.
You could meet him personally, see if he is open to talking to you or having a chat with you. If you can sense that he is open to having a chat, admit the way you feel about him and how you have been feeling over the course of time, and how you have changed. Do ask him if he there's any chance to come together again.
Make sure you let him know that he has nothing to feel pressurized about, and that you just wanted to show him what's in your heart, and that you have a small hope and wanted to let him know. And if his heart is somewhere else, you have nothing against that. Tell him all that you said towards the end of your post.
Do make sure he is comfortable enough and is open to hearing you, tell him that you are sharing as someone who had been/is close to your heart, and not as a lover or someone whom you see a prospect of relationship with. Just purely, as someone who you hold very dear - who has touched your heart like no one else did.
​
If you feel like you couldn't explain all of it face to face or in a conversation, you could meet him personally, but hand him a letter where you express your heart, and let him read it in front of you.. and you could talk to him after.
​
Really wishing you whatever you hope for happens! :) Godspeed x
​
I hope you aren't too worried about the outcomes... just think of it as letting him know of what's in your heart, taking a chance. Atleast, you wouldn't feel in the future that you didn't try :)"
1291,isfj,"I don't want to push you away from reaching out to him but I want you to think about how he feels as well. 
How did he deal with the break-up? Has his relationship preferences changed? 
He might be wary of opening old relationship ""wounds"" and emotions especially if you two were really close. I guess, judge it for yourself but you need to be aware of his emotions too."
1292,isfj,"This is perfect. Thank you so much for being able to express everything I’ve been feeling and translating it into action. I’m going to have to think some more and process my own emotions a bit more until I feel comfortable doing what you suggested, but it feels so right. Thank you again."
1293,isfj,"I agree and I think the worry that I might be bothering him is what is keeping me from reaching out. We were not very close - he never gave the relationship a chance - and he's always said that he's happy to hang out with me (but then will disappear and not reply or something like that). I think it's a very real possibility that he doesn't want to revisit the past, but I don't have any data to tell either way. What would you suggest I do in this situation? Thank you for your thoughts!"
1294,isfj,"Hello all, if you are interested, I created a survey regarding Mbti type and music preferences. It's just for fun, but I am curious to see the results. I personally don't expect to see a huge difference between types, but who knows! It'll only take a few minutes, so please check it out.
I will be posting results after all the data has been compiled.
https://goo.gl/forms/wgMY0z9LvWmN0NY23
Edit: I will be closing the test to do data stuff at 2pm CT on Sunday, August 5. Sorry if you didn't get it a chance to take the test. Look for the results post in a day or two."
1295,isfj,"Good text in general, but I don't like the emphasis on tradition. I think ISFJs often look more traditional because it is the path of least resistance, and the one that seems the most secure on the long term, it's where our Si naturally leads us. But I felt, from a couple of ISFJs I met, that they yearned for somebody to help them out of that path that is, and they where all more or less aware of it, boring and not self fulfilling. It's important to realize that an ISFJ can be the caring, providing, etc. person it wants to be out of the traditional life of housewife/provider of the family."

My wife and I were both between jobs. Having to stay at the hospital and with no cash for food.
I went to the toilet (bathroom), and found someone had left their wallet with a load of cash in it. 
My first thought was to hand it in to the nurses station, which I did.
The wife was a bit mad at me, but she knew that's all I would ever have done.
That's the integrity part, not the ending.
A nurse later came round to tell us there was food in a dayroom down the corridor and we were welcome to have some.
My wife went down, got chatting to some other parents including a very emotional man who's 6 year old was in as they tried to battle her cancer - someone found and handed in his wallet. "
1298,isfj,Because whenever I'm thinking about what to do in athe situation or I make a snap decision my deciding factor is what's ethically right and I often think about the well being of other people before mine so I guess that would be most accurate. And you?
1299,isfj,"I guess righteous sounds like I'm tooting my own horn but something like virtuous or whatever. I just always think about what's right and how it affects  other people, not just how it affects me. I often make a decision that's actually worse for me if its better for someone else, sometimes to a fault."
1300,isfj,"Not necessarily. It is in a way, righteous. The way you express it made me realize we just over-sympathize in interpersonal situations, sometimes sacrificing ourselves just so they get the better outcome. You should stand more up for yourself, because it will be more inevitably damaging in the long run. It's not wrong to be unselfish, but there's a line so we don't hurt ourselves. From an objective perspective, it is a weakness. From an ethical paradigm, it is kindness. In society, there will always be people who will step over you and abuse that kindness, even when they don't realize it. And it just downright sucks to experience or see it happen to anyone."
1301,isfj,I'm happy to hear that! Also it isn't something easy to change considering you've probably been like this a long time. It's something I'm trying to get better at too. As long we keep it in our mind it'll be bound to spark a change in the long run. :-D
1302,isfj,"I am a 24 years old ISFJ and group conversations are quite difficult for me to handle. I do not have social anxiety though. And I do understand people do not have to get along well with everybody. I like observing a lot and paying attention on people, but I seem to have some delays with reactions/responses when I'm on group conversations, specially. I was hoping that more ISFJs would agree with me and maybe share a strategy or book that helped you engage and make better conversations with people. please!
Thanks in advance."
1303,isfj,"I wish I knew. Sorry for not having anything more usefull to share. Had to check that it wasn't a post I had made because it was so accurate with what I experience.
I'll be checking here to learn the strategies other isfj are using. Please share"
1304,isfj,"Since we're considerate and don't want to interrupt anybody you have to find the openings where you can go in. 
You may have to overtake a person but sometimes if you really want to get your point across you just have to assertivley say it and make sure to not talk too quietly or too loudly. Loud enough to make your point known.
It can be difficult but just practice. Try to set small goals that for each conversation you want to say something in, find an opening to say your thoughts and people acknowledging it. It'll feel good!"
1305,isfj,"So, I have been researching a bit.. And apparently, this book could help: 8 Keys of Self Leadership by Dario Nardi. It suppose to help us work on/develop our cognitive functions. I'm hoping another ISFJ already read it and might be willing to share the experience. If it was helpful or not. :) "
1306,isfj,"thank you! That was helpful... My voice is low range but that has nothing to do with psychology lol 
Most of the times I feel like I have no point to state though. Many things being said too fast and mostly chit chat. :/"
1307,isfj,"I'm totally smitten by an ISFJ guy but he's not talkative and doesn't open up much. I asked him to say something interesting about his l him and he replied ""I like coffee"" 😑😂. My insecure self is worrying that he is no longer interested in me and that he probably finds me boring. Need help on how to get close to him. An INFP guy here. "
1308,isfj,"I mean... putting him on the spot like that probably isn't a good idea. If you asked me that I probably would've said something dumb too, and felt pretty weird and insecure about it, to boot. I'm not 100% sure if this is common in ISFJs, but for me at least, I need to have some nominal level of trust with someone before I open up to them, and a ""tell me something interesting about yourself""-level relationship just ain't gonna cut it. 
Just have regular conversation! Ask him if he has any hobbies, what he's doing this weekend, what TV shows he likes, that kinda thing. And talk to him about what you're into, too! Being interested in other people is a great way to get on their good side, but it can seem weirdly one-sided if you only ever ask questions and don't offer up info about yourself in return. See if you can find some common ground to start a more in-depth conversation on. 
But generally, I don't think ISFJs are the type to have a natural answer to a question as broad and subjective as ""what's interesting about you?"" Our self-esteem isn't usually all that great, for one thing, and our Fe I think tends to make us worry about offering up the ""correct"" answer so much that leaving something that open-ended can stress us out and kinda shut our brains down. Or at least, that's how it usually goes for me. "
1309,isfj,"ISFJ (m) asked me (ENTJ f) to be his girlfriend. 
I’m here to seek advice on this match-up. How do I best make this work? Is it a good fit? What’s your experience? 
————————
If you care to keep reading, the background context: 
I’ve dated an ENTP, INTP, INTJ, and ISTP & I’ve fallen super hard, but this has been a slow burn. Nothing crazy, no falling, but consistently enjoyable, good sex, attraction, we have a lot of fun together and align on equal levels of productivity. We both enjoy structure and family.
It hasn’t been easy getting to this point. We miscommunicate frequently, it’s taken him a long time to accept my TE as opening up and growing close and not criticism, and to me he’s very sensitive in nature to the point of frustration because he won’t stand firm in his opinion, isn’t a natural leader, and won’t dive deep on emotional issues, experience or personal history. It feels superficial compared to other connections I’ve had. 
This has made me hesitant to commit to him. But my intuition has been prodding me to commit because I wonder if at the end of the day we will actually be a much stronger partnership than someone I may have more natural chemistry with — because he is so loving and supportive of me, and I need to achieve my very lofty and intense career goals. 
Intellectual sparring, ideation, dreaming, and back-and-forth conversation hasn’t been a center piece of this relationship. ALTHOUGH, I have seen him grown in these areas while dating, just as I have become more considerate of others and what they need in my decision making.  "
1310,isfj,"Granted I don’t have relationship experience specific to your type, but from an isfj perspective,  commitment is “going deep”. There’s really nothing deeper than being by someone’s side on their best and worst days time after time. I’m never going to be one to fall deep into a passion that flames out quickly. If you’re looking to settle down and be adored forever, an isfj is a really good bet. If you’re looking for excitement and volatility, probably not so much. Also, to some extent, I need a certain level of commitment in order to really open up emotionally, so you might find more of what you’re looking for in the future should you decide to dive in. "
1311,isfj,"I heard once ISFJ and ENTJ is actually pretty good combo. You know every relationship need some adjustments no matter what type. Also you confront nurture as well. Not every person is the same (I hope so).
Just hit him with criticism time to time but not break his threshold. Remember he will remember everything you said to him. Literally everything. Like seriously everything. EVERYTHING."
1312,isfj,"I see a strong opportunity for growth in your futures if you stay by each other's sides!
https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/post/134014269157/see-this-post-for-relationship-tips-entj"
1313,isfj,"Being with an ISFJ (m) has been one of the smartest things I (f ENTJ) have done this year. I do kinda feel like I do most of the communication, and that he doesn't open up a lot about ""emotional experiences, emotions, and personal history"", but that's a result of the higher sensitivity. ISFJs feel things deeply and take a long time to recover from pain. Obviously they're going to be more hesitant to give people chances to hurt them than types who bounce back faster! I just take the moments when he does open up as a chance to be happy that he feels safe enough to do so.
The problems you have are things that can be solved as your relationship deepens and your trust and communication grows. You can intellectually spar with any internet rando. But you can only find peace with someone truly special."
1314,isfj,"Hi!
I was wondering if anyone had any experiences to share with love.  Specifically, what do you do when you feel unloved/lonely, yet you feel like you need someone?  I know the answer is to not look for love and just let it happen naturally.  It's something that can't be forced.  That doesn't stop me from craving intimacy and sometimes feeling worthless/overly lonely.  I want to cuddle up with someone and to feel valued, special, and cute.  I want to get to know someone fully and spend time with them.  
Basically what I'm asking is, does anyone ever get super lonely and self-critical, and how do you cope?"
1315,isfj,"I feel this way sometimes. I usually try to take my mind off of it by doing something mindless and entertaining, like watching TV. Then I go to sleep, and I feel better the next day.
I still don't have the intimacy I need, but it doesn't bother me as long as I can forget about it. Sometimes I even feel perfectly content being alone."
1316,isfj,"I went through a stage of this during college freshman and sophomore year. No friends irl, no one to physically touch -- I would get excited when I allowed myself to get a mani/pedi because for a brief moment I would be having human contact. It gets bad when you start to realize ""when was the last time another person touched me in some way?""
I tried to allevaite some of the loneliness by talking to my online friends. Whenever I play games, I do it as a social activity 90% of the time (I do play a few single-player games, but largely I play games I can play with people). I just reach out to random people I have played with, and because there are so many eventually you make a few connections. I was lucky to meet a few good friends this way, well enough that they would tell me they love me. This helped me get through a lot, because although I was alone in my own home, I knew that out there there were people that loved and cared about me.
A lot of the time I coped by having... well, melt-downs basically. Hours of crying, hating that no one was with me, hating that I could not be held and knew no one well enough to ask for a hug... And then at the end of these episodes I would try to convince myself I was better this way, that I wasn't meant to have friends, that I just needed to get used to it. I'd try to put on a brave front whenever I went out in public and saw people walking in groups when all I've ever done is walk from class to class by myself.
MY boyfriend and I like to say it was a miracle we met at all because we are both pretty much homebodies. But we met at a small party where I was playing a game like dungeons and dragons when he walked into the room for a drink and someone said ""oh hey, you both play league of legends and y'all should play together"" so I handed him my game name... We started talking online, and I was much more comfortable with me ""online persona"" so we got to talking a lot...
When I met my boyfriend, I was not expecting it. I was in a stage of having a lot of online friends but none irl. It took me by surprise. I also dreamed of the instant friendship/romance I read about in books and had high expectations and this was much different. Relationships take work, you can get them to the point of ""knowing someone fully"" but it isn't like making instant grits which is what I always hoped for.
I do still get super lonely, and I am always self-critical. I am not sure what can help with that. While I have my boyfriend, I still only really have online friends and no friends I can ask for a hug (although my boyfriend is always there for me). But if you are lonely, I would say reach out to people. It is easier for me to do online-- I just strike up a conversation with someone on my friends list on LoL (and I add random people after games, because even though most don't -- some do accept) and just say something random to start a conversation. It's not a deep, meaningful thing always but the more you talk to someone and get to know them the more conversations you can have with real content...
As for the self-critical... I am 22 years old and still depress myself. If you find a way to become less critical and more just happy with yourself PLEASE tell me. I wish I could treat myself as nicely as I treat others but I just hate myself most of the time.
But I hope if anything, that you can feel a bit better. I know how truly sad feeling super lonely is, as if no one out there even knows of your existence -- but I do and I hope you feel better. If you ever want to message me, feel free. Here is a quotation which I have always liked and I think relates a bit...
""It would be easy to say that I feel invisible. Instead, I feel painfully visible, and entirely ignored."" - David Levithan"
1317,isfj,"Generally, usually, most-of-the-time people cope with this by increasing the amount of self-love they give themselves. And generally, usually, most-of-the-time people who love and respect themselves are capable of giving the warmest and most sincere love to others. I'm not sure what kinds of activities you could do for yourself that would help you feel worthy and not lonely. One of my friends got into yoga and meditation and it's worked fantastically for her. She's still single, but she's so much happier. Not only that, but she's gotten out of her habit of falling for virtually every guy who shows interest in her. "
1318,isfj,"Hey guys, I’m just wondering what immature ISFJs are like. I’m 17 yrs old and would like to become more self aware and possibly avoid some pitfalls. What were you like/what immature ISFJ traits do you know of?"
1319,isfj,"this may all be unique to my own experience, but i'm a pretty textbook ISFJ, so it may help to recognize if you see these patterns forming in your own actions: 
judgmental and alienating, projecting your own insecurities on to other people and ostracizing them for these perceived inadequacies while using this to create social currency for yourself. being attracted to people with higher social status and using them to bolster your own self-worth because you believe you are not deserving of anything. getting others in trouble for transgressions to avert the blame/attention from yourself. throwing yourself into new experiences 100% until you make one mistake and then giving up, or not engaging in experiences that could make you a better person because of a fear of failure/disappointment.
learning my own strength, talents, and abilities helped with a lot of these issues, through pure trial and error and dumb luck. i still deal with these issues as they come up, but rarely, and the first step is to acknowledge the things you do that you know are wrong. i would be interested to see if any other ISFJs have experienced these negative traits."
1320,isfj,"Immature ISFJs: are judgemental, rigid, emotionally manipulative, overly conflict avoidant, and perfectionistic. Prone to Si-Ti loop, analyzing and reanalyzing past experiences and not doing anything about it (I made a post about it Check it out.). Overly Critical. Passive aggressive. Extremely fearful of change and new possibilities (Ne grip/inferior). 
Source: ISFJ Male with plenty of experience being immature. "
1321,isfj,"YEP. That was me for the longest time. I think a lot of that behavior is due to being in the loop or grip. A lot of this was fixed for me when I read about how to use each function in a healthy way, and knowing that it's good to switch between different functions throughout your day so you don't get trapped in your own world - just Ti-Si or Ne. Also, get perspectives from someone with a different function stack. "
1322,isfj,"personal experience speaking, i grew up with an extreme martyr-complex mother who in turn made me identify this as a negative and destructive thing that i never want to emulate, so i never had that compulsion, but have tended toward the extreme opposite, like taking on too much more than i can handle and never complaining even while failing to follow through with what i took on and then making excuses. but i could see how the martyr complex could be an ISFJ thing, just not for myself, personally. thank you for sharing."
1323,isfj,"Ohhh yeah. To make a long story short, he’s my ex and we wanted to stay friends and we’re in the same class of only 17 kids. And we’re in the same friend group of only about 4 people. He keeps doing crappy things to me and I talked with him about it twice and he apologize profusely and changed his behavior for a few days after but just kept being mean. So the problem now is that I can’t really avoid him and I can’t really talk with him either. And he just acts like everything is fine. (That’s it in a nutshell anyway.) So yeah, it’s a bad situation but I’m trying to keep the popping off to a minimum haha"
1324,isfj,"I imagine there will be a lot of healers here. But tanks would make sense too as it is a ""protector"" role!
I always choose healer, but then I'm usually too shy to talk to anyone until the mid levels when healers actually become useful (I end up soloing a lot on these multiplayer games... -_-)"
1325,isfj,TF2 medic here. Thousands of hours of dedication to healing those in the frontline. I always enjoyed the paired dynamic and teamwork of an attack class and the supporting medic. All makes so much sense!
1326,isfj,"When I used to play gratuitous amounts of League of Legends I mained support. I almost always played support in ranked, and I really enjoyed it. Plus, it was nice because I didn't have to get into verbal brawls with other players in lobby who wanted a position. No one wanted to playssupport, and I was happy to pick up the slack."
1327,isfj,"Oh boy,
Guild Wars 2: Engineer - I really liked the fact that you could use a gun in a fantasy game. That was a big reason. Also they looked pretty swaggy.
LOTRO: Hunter - I liked that I could stealth and get hits without taking damage for a little bit while they ran towards me. 
Planetside 2: Light Assault - I might be cheating here, but for a while I was heavy assault, but I grew to re-love light assault again. I liked the fact that I could hop around the battlefield and drop c4 on tanks without them noticing.
Just barely played Dota 2, but I enjoyed the ranged assault roles i.e. sharpshooter and gyro copter.
I find myself drawn to ranged roles more than full on support. I always felt support roles were very hard as they require specific button mashing in order to activate spells instead of regular button mashing, which I happen to specialize in. Even so, I dislike being in the center of action as it is often too chaotic to do anything of value, plus all the spells are directed there anyways so I would die in an instant. I prefer to sit a bit away, taking my potshots where I can...
TL;DR - prefer to snipe rather than heal, healing feels too complicated for me
/lecture"
1328,isfj,"I prefer either cleric type or tank type. I just feel that I'm really bad at the damage-dealers and would rather just heal/protect my own team.
For MMORPGs I was usually the cleric, and now in League of Legends I main support with Nami/Taric mostly. I love ARAMs much more than normals though, because with normals I always feel super bad if I'm not doing well."
1329,isfj,"As a general rule of thumb I like taking the hardest class in order to test myself or the underdog/underused class, for instance, in Destiny I use the hand cannon over any other gun (not a class, I know). In TF2 I pick the sniper 9 times outta 10 and in payday 2 I picked the technician skill tree cause I thought no one in my friends group would pick it (and I assumed correct)."
1330,isfj,"Borderlands 2: Zero TF2: Medic, engineer or Pyro. WoW: I love druids.. I can't tank very well and I'm awful at healing sadly. Too much pressure. Diablo: My favorite is witch doctor now.
I end up playing a lot of games solo too honestly. It's easier for me and i don't have to worry about disappointing someone.
Edit: I also prefer archer classes, aside from Borderlands. I like to keep my distance and deal out damage."
1331,isfj,"Depends on the game. I see myself as a support tank most of the time. I play bards often. But my favorite times are when i find a build that involves buffing and debuffing at the same time, or life vamp builds. Even in Magic I play lifelink like its my job. Usually blue/black. I'm the guy who holds people while my team punches. I love tank Vlad in League."
1332,isfj,"Paladins, or whatever the resident holy warrior class is. I pretty much  always try for a tank-healer hybrid. Failing that, healers or general support. I played support almost exclusively during my Dota 2 days, and I frigging loved KotL. "
1333,isfj,"haha you're stuck on the FFXIV storyline too? I'm close to 50 and am only a few quests after Titan. That fight just about killed me, well multiple times. Not looking forward to beating Garuda down when I get to it, I've heard that's a hard fight :P  
I play Scholar as my main job, although I've been playing Thaumaturge a lot recently. I have done a few dungeons but mostly with my FC. Even though I'm guaranteed a ton of xp and better gear, I avoid Duty Finder and daily roulettes like the plague. My boyfriend keeps bugging me to try that but I just can't get myself to do it...and he has no problem doing raids and whatnot. Watching him play, it looks so easy. I think I'd just get stressed out and rage quit.  :("
1334,isfj,"I've read horror stories of people who did DF for dungeons and the people were just outright mean and critical. Vote kicking and whatnot. 
My boyfriend is more hardcore with the game than I am...he plays archer/bard and is on the Zodiac relic weapon quest grinding. His goal is to get the Zeta weapon before Heavensward comes out. o_o; And that requires a lot of dungeons to complete. So day in and day out, he's grinding away, but he's pretty focused on it. I only wish I had that tenacity.
The only reason I haven't reserved Heavensward is because I play FFXIV on Steam. -_-; I'm screwed out of getting the physical copy, so I'm still waiting to hear when Steam preorders will open up. 
The only job I currently have at 50 is Culinarian, but that job is a lot of fun! :)"
1335,isfj,"Hey!!  I'm an ISTP and been with my gf for awhile who I think is an ISFJ. I'm waiting for her to do an assessment but she shows almost all the tendancies of ISFJ.
Just want some general advice about you guys and any tips you may have. Let discussion build from there"
1336,isfj,"Hey there, I know you posted this a while ago and I meant to reply but in true introvert form, I wanted to process it first.
So I'm an ISFJ and a pretty self-aware one.  So I will try to give some heads up based on what I know of myself.  
First, I see you're a P to her potential J.  This can sometimes cause conflict depending on the severity of your P and her J.  For example, I'm a J and my SO is a P.  We have a hard time with spontenaity  sometimes because of me.  Speaking personally, I have to prepare myself for social interactions and for events that are coming up.  When she suggests something on the fly, it takes me a while to figure out if it's something I truly want to do.  It causes great anxiety to not have time to mull it over.  It can be pretty frustrating for Ps, though she's always handled it well.  As a compromise, I try to allow the spontaneous things to happen from time to time.  
You're also a T to her potential F.  The way you guys process emotions will differ.  ISFJs are sensitive creatures.  Not all are insecure, but little things can get taken very personally.  I don't want to paint us as horrible, because we're not.  We're very caring and giving and loving, but we're just sensitive.  Be mindful of how something you might say can be interpreted.  
You're both I's, which could be nice as far as communication goes.  I'm with an E and it was a learning curve figuring out that she can speak exactly what's on her mind when it comes up and I have to take time to think about how I want to say things.  She'd fear I was hiding something because I wasn't as forthright, but really I was just making sure I was understanding everything accurately.  
I asked my SO for some input too, and she suggested that you not assume that your girlfriend will know how you feel about things.  You may need to tell them straight up or show them.  If you love her, be affectionate.  Also, make sure she feels safe to express themselves even if it's something negative.  This is key.  A big key.  
I find with myself, I'm very nurturing.  I love taking care of my SO.  I can't say this is what your girlfriend will do, so please don't get upset if it's not the case.  But I tend to find other ISFJs are good caregivers.  In the same respect, I don't do it for just anyone.  So if you guys are new to each other, it may take her time to warm up to you, to feel safe with you enough to share that part of herself. 
I appreciate your interest and I hope this helps in some way.  Good luck!"
1337,isfj,Yeah that totally makes sense. She is really quiet and shy so its rare for her to talk about issues she is handling. Maybe due to her thinking I don't care? I've been told I have a pretty strong personality in the work place..
1338,isfj,"Hi! Im on tinder and wonder if you ISFJ guys are there? And how to spot you ? What are typical photos you would post, do you write a bio text, and about What? Do you tend to ask for IRL meetup right away or do you make long txt conversations? Sorry for alltid questions, but would really like to find myself an ISFJ guy; you seem awesome! - ESTP girl . And btw What attracts you? "
1339,isfj,I’d ask a lot of questions and try and meet for coffee. I don’t use tinder or any online dating app at all now as it feels like a flock of seagulls trying to grab a scrap of food. I get more value out of a singles night or speed dating (I still haven’t met anybody that I would consider normal though)
1340,isfj,Well on Tinder I just have pictures of me. I also have pictures of me at places I have been like France. I use Tinder every know and then but I know Tinder can be a hookup site. I like to get to know a girl somewhat before I ask to meet up with her. Lol I hope one day to find an ESTP girl. 
1341,isfj,"You can spot ISFJs by requesting anyone who chats with you to do the MBTI test before even saying hello to you.
Don't say that you're looking for ISFJs or anyone will pretend they're ISFJ for the sake of opportunities"
1342,isfj,"Thank u for answering! :) do you allways smile with your teeth showing f.ex? I feel like so many profiles are very similar, and that i «like»/swipe the wrong type. What about asking out for dates; how long info the conversation will u bring it up? ( NON native english speaker...) Sorry for typos- my phone is «correcting»"
1343,isfj,"Thank you for answering! :) Yes its hard to find people that match, and swiping through all the hookup dudes is annoying :-p I tend to steer away from shirtless pics. I feel more comfortable talking to people in person thou , and dont feel like my humor and quick remarks come through via txt; What is the kind of things you typically txt about? Tnx again:)!!"
1344,isfj,Yes; of course many could claim that; the problem w people taking the test is so many get it wrong; scoring as introverts when they clearly are extroverts. Are really looking for more text based/ picture based clues;) 
1345,isfj,"Its hard to say as everyone is different. The type of people I want aren't exactly on tinder but the type of people on there are different in each city and country. 
All I can suggest is to try them all, youll never know where you will meet someone. Its pretty difficult to pin down exactly where everyone might be as I am less introverted than other guys, so I may do things others might not even consider."
1346,isfj,Yes;) guess I was trying to find a shortcut in stead of having to go on countless coffees/beers which seem to lead nowhere. And of course there are so many varieties of each type. But maybe you had discovered some similarities/ traits of ISFJs that would make you stand out in the dating scene? 
1347,isfj,"I know what you mean. I wish I could easily find the girl in after but it's a difficult search. 
Its pretty hard to say as I'd say most of us would be hiding out at home or going to a restaurant with close friends. I don't get out as often as I should. "
1348,isfj,"I’ve always gravitated to languages...In high school I opted to study both French and Spanish (no one did that), I majored in Spanish in college, and one of my hobbies post grad is to learn words in more languages (I love the Duolingo app), currently working at Portuguese. 
Learning languages has always been incredibly easy for me. Sure I still have to study and work at it, but it amazed me when people would do so poorly in their language classes when I easily aced them. 
Wondering if this is an ISFJ thing at all? I think Si allows for excellent language acquisition and in my case I feel I have not only a photographic memory for how the words are spelt and used grammatically, but also an auditory memory for how things sound and phrases that are bunched together. 
I also love the idea of connecting with others via speech, which perhaps is explained by the combo of Si-Fe functions "
1349,isfj,"Nope! I'd tried to learned Spanish in my high school years, but being from the hood made it very difficult for me. There was consistent fights in the classroom. Including overpowering the teacher. But oh well..
Edit: Misspelling"
1350,isfj,"That's so cool! I'm actually terrible with languages. I'm pretty sure I'm an ISFJ, but I've always had issues with paying attention and listening so learning the details of all the different new sounds and spellings were difficult. And never tried to constructive a framework to learn it more easily."
1351,isfj,"My wife is ISFJ and certainly has a level of linguistic talent but doesn't really have the headspace to dive into one.
I'm an INTP myself and have always had a passion for languages and they come quite easy to me as well, however I think it has more to do with your upbringing than with your type.
Let's take me as example. I'm Dutch and I was raised to be curious, which lead me to be able to read before I was 4 which gave me a head start. I started English at about 10 years old. At the age of 14 my school offered me Latin and Greek, which taught me a lot about the structure of languages in general, but I also took German and French. Since then I've been using Duolingo in combination with various grammar resources to learn Swedish and Italian. "
1352,isfj,"Reading and writing it yes. Speaking absolutely not.
But, in every class except anything with numbers I easily excel and wonder how others don't :/. I don't know if I just take better notes or something but ""school"" and learning have always come very easily. "
1353,isfj,"English is my best subject.  Sounds surprising, but I won't be in high school for a few months, so technically haven't learned any other languages.  I'm going to learn Spanish in high school, but I want to learn French so badly - I'm a huge fan of ""French classics"" (well, I guess I mean 60s French music -  Serge Gainsbourg, Jane Birkin, Francoise Hardy, I like the song ""Porque Te Vas."")  I want to understand the lyrics to the French music I listen to because it's so catchy!"
1354,isfj,"Yes and no. I did Japanese all through school (roughly 10 years) and ended up with nothing usable. I wasn't able to make a conversation and still struggled to read anything. I know Japanese is one of the hardest to learn but I don't feel I made any progress with it. 
I've started learning French in the past year only doing classes on the weekend. I feel it's a lot easier and I'm able to make sense of a magazine article if I read it. It could be because English is made up of so many french words but it seems to be a lot easier to translate in my mind. I still struggle to have a conversation though but I understand that will take a lot of time and practice."
1355,isfj,"It depends, if I am emotionally invested in the language - say, my crush's mother tongue is a certain language - I pick it up fast. Or, if I am watching some show or film and greatly enjoy it, I pick it up fast. Or, the cultural aspect of the language I am learning has to interest me... 
There always has to be another motivation other than just learning the language, sadly. "
1356,isfj,That's interesting how you say it's more about your culture. Did you find that your classmates were able to pick other languages up easily as well then? Do you have an idea of their types? I'm curious as well because I'll be going to the Netherlands in a couple of months.
1357,isfj,"I honestly wonder if I am too. I'm still trying to figure that out. My hunch is I've never really used my Si properly/in an unhealthy way. I think I rely mainly on Ti and an unhealthy use of Fe I can't help. Ever since I started to use my Si and Ne better, my life has drastically improved. I also didn't have much an of interest in languages in high school, at least, so did the bare minimum to get that A or B. "
1358,isfj,"Sorry if I were unclear, I meant nurture instead of culture. It's the way my parents taught me curiosity that got it all started. 
I only learned about MBTI after school, so I don't really know about my classmates. I think the ones that liked languages and got high grades were very diverse in types.
I do know we (the Dutch) are early with teaching our kids English at school, but I don't think that has a lot of impact on how curious kids are. I mean, they're taught math too and not a lot are enthusiastic about that. "
1359,isfj,"Hello Everyone! I am undertaking a project to investigate the relationship between people's personalities and their sleep patterns. This survey will be posted in all MBTI related forums- if you could take it, I would greatly appreciate your time. It is pretty brief, and at the end there is the option to see the descriptive results (percentages of each response to see how you stack up to your fellow redditors). Once I have a sufficient number of participants, I will analyze the data to find correlations between different traits, and then post any interesting findings from the data. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lW19vAWhfaGu_MBDWkZl2KrJkTTGj3nXSvZJOTvEJhg/viewform If this goes well, this could be the first installation in an interesting social science series! Thanks!"
1360,isfj,"""Creeps. “Nice guys.” The ISFJs are really fucking creepy. They do not know what privacy means, and they do not care even if you direct them to a dictionary. They are the traditional silent stalker, the ones who become serial murderers at age 40 out of a growing sense of meaningless in life. Everyone moves away from them, and rightfully so.
The word “love” to an ISFJ is loaded. If they say they love you, you should change your name. They are talking about an undying burning flame of worship and eagerness to please, and though they will never voicewhat it is they want, you will know. Usually they will romanticise a scenario and keep trying to achieve it. We do not recommend becoming involved romantically with an ISFJ, because you will never know what goes through their mind, and you will never be able to react exactly as the ISFJ wants. If they need to articulate what they want the whole thing is ruined, you see.
You might have an ISFJ friend, and you might have them for like, 8 years without even touching them, and then one night you overhear them describing you as their [gender]friend on the phone.
These people give you gifts and need help. The ISFJ animal is a leech, or anything disgusting and creepy, really.""
https://zombiesintelligently.com/myers-briggs/"
1361,isfj,"This is great.
Oh dear 😂😂😂 I actually am that creepy though!! Plus I'm really good at prying - unless you're paying attention you might not even realize that the questions I ask have a bigger purpose. I love knowing everything about everyone, heh, it's bad."
1362,isfj,"So I am an ISFJ, but I'm wondering if the way I flirt is common among us. I usually end up being incredibly sassy, sarcastic, and try to learn as much about the person as possible. 
Either that or I completely avoid them in case they think I'm flirting and I'm not willing to risk that even though I am interested because maybe they don't like me. 
So what about you guys?"
1363,isfj,"Same! I'll try extra hard to make the object of my affection laugh or I'll completely distance myself god forbid they realize I like them. Unless you get a few drinks in me, then I start touching their shoulders/hair/back/etc and get quite a bit more forward."
1364,isfj,"Same. If someone is trying to flirt with me and I'm not interested but am up for some entertainment, I will be sassy and cute. If I'm actually interested in someone I will hardly let it on for a very long time. I'll talk about trivia or just friendly topics. Or even better, nothing at all. When I'm comfortable with them I'll be clever and sarcastic but also helpful and sweet until I'm mush!"
1365,isfj,"As others said, pretty similar. I like to tease/joke, be a bit mean (jokingly), etc...
In some cases I lay it on thick. I feel like a lot of people think ISFJs = prudes, but I was the sexual initiator in a lot of my relationships. And I am so thankful for winky emoticons! ;)"
1366,isfj,Hi I'm a Esfj but my Isfj best friend seems to be sassy and  sarcastic towards the boy I like and she knows I like him . It sometimes hard for me to tell when she is flirting but she is sassy towards the boy I like and I am on the shy side. Is she flirting or being her sassy self?  but it seemed to be more than usual. Don't  get me wrong I love my best friend but is she flirting with the guy I like?
1367,isfj,"Hey everyone! I'm an INTP, I live in the heart of New York City, and I'm going to be entertaining an ISFJ visitor for three days who has never experienced the city before. The primary purpose of her traveling to New York is so that she can spend some time with me, because we live far away from one another. 
How should I go about making sure that her three days in New York are as good as possible for her? I'm asking this because I realize that we have always taken radically different approaches to traveling. We seem to appreciate completely different things, and I don't want to end up dragging her through nothing but the sorts of activities that I would enjoy. Especially because she seems to have difficulty saying ""no"" to activities when others suggest them, I want to make sure that I'm not forcing my interests onto her. What sort of events, activities, sights, etc. do you like to do when traveling? What sort of things do you NOT like to do/find boring?
She has booked a hotel room across the street from my apartment because I live in a studio and I don't have proper room for guests. I've given her general instructions for getting to my apartment from the airport and although I know she's always worried about getting lost, I'm sure she'll be fine - otherwise, I'll probably be handling all of the navigation. 
I realize that judging types are much more comfortable when they can plan out activities, travel logistics and details in advance. I'm terrible at doing this - so what sorts of things should I take into consideration that I may not have considered yet? 
​"
1368,isfj,"My ideal vacation has a few planned activities (I like visiting museums and local shops and restaurants), and a lot of down time. I like relaxing vacations, not busy ones. While I like to have a general idea of what each day will look like (Monday is sightseeing/shopping day, Tuesday is lounging/reading on the beach day, etc), I don't like to have every minute planned out. I don't know if that's much help!"
1369,isfj,"Hi. 
If I was coming to stay at yours.  I’d want to go to Central Park, probably spend a whole day there, if the weathers good, maybe take a picnic, or eat at a near by restaurant.  
Maybe, walk over 1 or 2 of the big bridges.  Go on the subway.  
Travel on a boat going by the Statue of Liberty, but don’t need to get off at the island.  
Go for a drive in a yellow cab.  I’d like to actually see some of the rough/poor parts of New York.
I’d like to eat at a diner, go to a bar, in the day time.  
And I’d like to go to a show, either Opera, ballet, classical music, avant guard dance, theatre.  
Can’t remember how many nights it is?  3 or 4.  But, I only want to go out one night.  
And I do want to go to the 9/11 memorial and spend several hrs there, maybe even a whole day, and deffo got to go see the subway white spikey building around there.  
And maybe try to get to some of New York’s more or less known architectural highlights. 
That’s my perfect New York, 3 day stay.  
Thank you.  
And I think this girl needs spoiling, like being her personality type, if you went to stay at hers, she would do everything for you.
So, be yourself totally, with all you’re quirks ect...  but please, do you’re best for her.  "
1370,isfj,"I would suggest some super low-key places like museums and libraries that aren't likely to have a lot of loud and obnoxious people. Also, if she is coming to spend time with you, just chilling at home with her for some time might be a good idea too! As an INFJ, we Fe users don't mind if other people take the reigns. As long as you don't take her to a non-introvert friendly place she should be fine."
1371,isfj,"Edit: I changed up some of this.
If it’s someplace like New York, I want to experience all those places I’ve seen in movies: Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, that kinda thing. I would have a mental list of the things I specifically want to see and do, then a few other things that aren’t necessary but would be nice. A nice dinner one night would be good, but then staying in the next night.
Honestly, I would ask her first! If she gives you some things she wants to do, come up with a plan that you think would be easiest and least stressful time-wise.
If she’s not sure, give her a couple options - “we could go walk around in Chinatown, or we can hang out at my place, or we can go see something (wherever).” And make it clear that you’re cool with whatever she wants to do. 😊
Also, subway maps may be fun and sometimes helpful."
1372,isfj,"Just spent the past few days in Chicago and NYC as a quick getaway trip, and I really enjoyed spending a couple hours of the day exploring the city and sightseeing (riverwalk, wicker park, central park, and times square).. but that being said, I loved having some down-time after a couple hours of walking/exploring. Spent several hours trying mini retro coffee shops and dessert places. Also crashed at the hotel a LOT. 
tl;dr ; enjoy sightseeing and exploring, but only for a couple hours. I like my chill time too :D"
1373,isfj,"I would have written exactly what you just wrote.  Thank you.  :) 
But I live in the UK.  Never been abroad, couldn’t afford it.  So, I like to go to either Cardiff, Blackpool, Torquay.  I’ve sailed the east and north  coast of Ireland, west coast of Scotland.  North Coast of Wales.
But back to my favourite holidays.  I stay in a nice hotel, not 5 star, usually 4 star.  
Travel by train to destination.  I do plan a theatre trip, a classical concert, an evening meal out.  Visit the sites, museums, go to the cinema once.  And the Zoo, fun fair, indoor, water parks.  Ect....  And generally do a lot of walking, cycling.  I stay in at night.  Even at weekends.  (I don’t frequent pubs, nightclubs, ect....). But, my theatre/concert trips are at night, and cinema trip is in the day.  
That’s it really, there is some flexibility, on daily planning.  But I will have planned each days general activities, a few months before had.  
😊
I plan to add further destinations to my holidays list of destinations.  
I only started holidaying as an adult at 37yrs old.  😭😂"
1374,isfj,"Hi, sorry for my late reply, I took a short reddit T-break.  
I did all of that on my own, I prefer holidays on my own.
I never really travelled anywhere before age 38yrs, holiday like.  
When I was 25ish, I went to the west coast of Scotland for a week.  Had a really bad time, mental breakdown time.  How old are you?  
😊"
1375,isfj,"In a negative way, if Im really stressing out I start thinking of all the bad things that could happen or all of the things I could have done to not screw up
In a positive way, once I find a hobby or something I really like Ill occasionally think of all the different types of things of that hobby I try with that hobby (sometimes I eventually do sometimes I dont) "
1376,isfj,"ISxJ's will sometimes speak, with great confidence and satisfaction, of ""getting"" something. They really love it when they feel like they grasp the bigger picture, or caught something subtle. It might be cute or something if they weren't constantly wrong - usually due to the nuances of reality being lost in translation to their clean, binary mode of thought."
1377,isfj,"If you make me angry you're gonna get my wrath but I'm usually super reserved and will ignore you or will be nice if I acknowledge you. I'm kind of like an emotional mirror when they're heightened, though. Be nice to me, you'll usually get more niceness back but I can be the world's biggest jerk if you're mean to me."
1378,isfj,"I have a bad temper when I lose it but that hardly ever ever happens. I tend to just go cold and freeze people when they grate on me, if they're looking for a reaction/validation it totally annoys them."
1379,isfj,"I had a friend, I guess he was parasitic time to time. It took me 7 years to explode on him, and when I did, i grinded his bones so bad he started crying a lot. After that I stopped any contact with him. And the thing is that I didn't feel bad about the whole thing even slightly. (I still don't know how to feel about that reaction of mine)
I guess I have a whole lot of patience, but if somebody manages to get to me, I will break people. 
And yes, interesting observation: a lot of people tend to forget bad (or at least not nice) stuff that people do to them, but I personally feel that I have an ""asshole meter"" for each person that can never be reset. "
1380,isfj,"Yes totally. It’s funny bc when I like someone...I’ll cut them a lot of slack, be super nice/friendly/talkative. But if someone just bothers me straight off the bat, I literally don’t give a f*** about them and will ignore them"

1383,isfj,"English isn't my main language so if you guys think that my writings are funny that cud be the reason. Soo yea, I have been friends with an ENFP guy for 4 years now and have started to fall for him since 3 years ago.  I'm 100% sure he knows how I feel (I told him & also hinted to him numerous time) but the thing is, he never respond to this. He is always silent when it comes to this topic and I know ""no respond is also a respond"" but I feel like without a proper closure, I'd just keep thinking there could be a ""what if"" between us. He is a good friend and he helped me alot during my tough times so I do appreciate him for that. I am not sure if his ""silent respond"" is to prevent himself from saying anything that could hurt my feelings. 
Also he is not showing any typical ENFP traits that could mean he has feelings for me...for example 

He never compliments me. Not even once though. When I ask him about this he'd just say I shouldn't fish for compliments and that I should make myself feel good, no need others to do that 
He love teasing/making fun of me. Literally anything I said can become a joke/tease by him. Its not like an insult or what though, more like harmless fun. 
He'll help me whenever I need it. He never force me to tell him the whole story too, he'd just jump in and help out when I need it or ask for it. 
He listens to everything I said and give me his comment after. 

Honestly I don't know what to do. Should I really give up on our friendship just so I can let go of the feelings? I think I need a closure from him but I feel like that's not something I'd ever get from him. I feel like am not ready to date other guys either cause I always feel something is missing from them or am comparing him to other guys. 
Can someone wake me up perhaps? 
​"
1384,isfj,"​
He's just not that into you (hug) You've been friends for 4 years and he's never made any romantic moves towards you. ENFP men are not shy like isfjs are, they will not sit on the sidelines for 3-4 years without saying/showing that they like you
​"
1385,isfj,"I think you need to flat out tell him “i've been falling for you for the last 3 years, is there any chance something could happen between us?”
Maybe your advances aren't as obvious to him as they are to you. Or maybe he really isnt interested, but i think having him tell you that flat out will help you find closure. What's the point in pining over him if he's made it clear nothing will happen? So i think you should just let it all out and see what he says."
1386,isfj,"I am in the middle of a quarter life crisis and currently am exploring career options.

1388,isfj,"I am graduated in Veterinary medicine, but last year I decided to change my path a little and started a biomedical research master program. I have always been passionate about health sciences, but I didn't see myself dealing with irresponsible clients/owners of pets. Also, last years have been rough in my family due to health issues, and that also made me decide to work in a field more related with human medicine.

1393,isfj,"It's so unusual, but I recognized that ISFJs and ENTPs, if healthy. Get along really well. (Someone I liked was even an ISFJ at one point haha.)
Long story short, I notice that ISFJs become decent friends of mine, despite having opposite variables, perhaps it's because we are both quite healthy with are mbti types.
But I have clashed heads with ISFJs before as well, same with ESFJs. When they expected me to be ""this"" and ""that"" I started an argument in which they took personally. ENTPs refuse to be controlled, and I feel as if ISFJs have expectations for there friends, and the ENTP may feel as if he or she is being controlled when they confront them about there expectations.
And when that happens the ENTP feels as if the ISFJ is throwing a gauntlet down, that the ENTP is very happy to pick up. And thus, that's when the argument begins. Or normally, when ENTPs/ISFJs don't work out.
Your opinions on ENTPs?
Here is mine.
I like the healthy ones, the ones that I can respect and appreciate.
But the ones that make me feel as if I am being controlled will often aggravate me to an argument."
1394,isfj,"I think the conflict is better avoided when ISFJ take in an entp in small doses. The devils advocate thing runs its course quickly, although slightly interesting at first. The the chaos of a thought train is easily seen as disfunctional and distracting. The spontaneity loses its shine after while. And the perceived lack of compassion when thinking through sensitive topics, is impossible to comprehend. 
I'm entp and my wife is opposite and, I've come to the conclusion that our relationship isn't as symbiotic as I once thought. I have much more to gain from her presence than she does from me. I can be draining or sometimes say the wrong thing and although she is understanding, it seems unfair that I can't offer as much a positive benefit. I know that my traits have undeniable value to her, but at a cost of stress. And I don't think that price is fair to her.
Tldr:
We as entp have far more to gain from these wonderful people, but they aren't nearly as dependant on us as we are off them. That at least my observation."
1395,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ, my boyfriend an ENTP. We have made it to 2.5 years so far.
From the get go, we've been very curious about each other. There have been obvious misunderstandings, but we have only grown more to accept/appreciate our differences.
I think opposites can not only get along but stay attracted if you appreciate the differences and not despise them. I personally find my boyfriend to be more complimentary than opposite. The way I see it, he's literally my other half, like yin and yang.
Also, it helps to be curious because you'll always want to know why a certain reaction/behavior happened."
1396,isfj,"I am an ENTP who recently asked an ISFJ to marry me, and we have been great.  The short version of my opinion...wait until they are in their 20's and have at least matured on some level or another.  I don't think things would have worked out if we met or dated earlier in life.  
Oh also be weary of the tendency for ENTPs to steamroll you.  I know it can be tough, but we really need you to call us out when we do something that negatively affects you.  Often more than once.  But this becomes easy with a little third party relationship coaching and an overall understanding of who the other person is.  Both types have a lot more to gain than lose in this combo."
1397,isfj,"If it's any comfort, she seems to have decided that you're worth the ""price of admission,"" as it's been called. It's a very fair observation though, and hopefully our types can figure out how to evolve into a less stress-inducing type. "
1398,isfj,"Lots of truth in this post, but don't discount what you can bring to the table.  This post leads me to believe that you are a matured ENTP that understands the differences between the both of you.  That is a recipe for an awesome relationship that will continue to achieve great things together.  "
1399,isfj,"According to MBTI we shouldn’t really get along, and after reading an old post about how ISFJs perceive INTJs, it’s clear there’s some truth to it.
That said somehow I managed to become best friends with an ISFJ. It took a long time to get to that point. It’s by far the most meaningful friendship I’ve ever had. We have an enormous amount of respect for the way the other perceives the world. I’ve learned a lot from him about being more easy going and not being so hard on myself.
We met at work, and soon I’ll be leaving to start my own business. Looking for advice on how to stay in touch with your type and also just to be a good friend in general. Getting him to do stuff outside of work is already a chore, and as an INTJ it’s exhausting being the only one to make the effort. Typically for us the most efficient thing to do in this situation is just drop the friendship. But I don’t want to lose this one."
1400,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I’ll admit that when I make friends at work, I often lose touch pretty quickly after one of us leaves. It’s not that I stop caring or even that I stop thinking about that person, but it does feel like so much more effort to maintain the friendship once we’re not automatically seeing each other every day. I don’t like having to play catch-up every time I text someone because that’s very exhausting for me. 
From my own experience, it would be easier to maintain a friendship if you make the effort right away to keep in regular contact. If you get in the habit of texting every day, for instance, it won’t seem so difficult to keep up with each other’s lives or make plans. I have a group chat that I’m in with my more extroverted friends and we talk there most days. That makes getting together much more comfortable for me because we’re constantly maintaining the relationships and not having to feel like we’re starting over again every time we hang out. "
1401,isfj,"For me, friendships that trail off because of me are because of things in the realm of social anxiety, and a general feel that our friendship was kind of a ""we saw each other a lot but didn't have a ton in common outside of work/school/activity"" thing. I still have unopened messages from about a year ago because I didn't know how to respond.
ISFJs can also be notoriously hard to get out of their comfort zone. For example, I've played bass for 6 years. My mom took me to a concert last Mother's Day, and I didn't like the band's music to begin with, but the most enjoyable things for me were talking to the bass player afterwards and spending time with my mom."
1402,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INTJ and I am an ISFJ and we get along wonderfully. The only issues we've had is in learning how different we interpret the world,  situations with other people, and how to deal with them. This difference allows us to learn a lot from each other and I feel like I have a bigger perspective of the world!"
1403,isfj,"My best friend is an INTJ. (I’m a ISFJ F.)  He’s wonderful. As many have said, we see the world very differently. However I feel that in this way we help each other so much, to see different perspectives.
I talk to him for hours a day, something I do not do with my other friends. I love that we can have  philosophical talks, but also silly ones. "
1404,isfj,"That's great advice. I'll certainly keep up my end. I also feel like it's a tremendous amount of effort to keep up with people that I'm not forced to see regularly, but I want to make the effort here. My concern is that he's historically non-responsive, so I also don't want to come across as a needy attention whore.
It's frustrating because he will never reach out to anyone. Ever. For anything.  Unless it's an SO, then he'll make sure every ounce of his free time is spent with her. Is this an ISFJ thing?"
1405,isfj,"It could be. There are people who take less energy for me to spend time with than others, and my SOs have tended to fall into that category. I have friends whom I love dearly but still have to kind of “gear up” to see, but people like my husband or my mom or certain friends I feel so at ease with that it’s not the same challenge. I typically prefer to spend more time with those people. "
1406,isfj,"Sadly, yes. Some of the greatest moments I've had in the last 5 years are with current friends who I sort of isolate myself from online (therapy is too expensive rn) but I do have a great time when i see them IRL. I'm much more of an in person/video call hangout person myself, so maybe that's how said friend is as well."
1407,isfj,"This is good to know. I've noticed that the closer we got, the less interested he seemed in spending time with me. I've wondered if its just because he's comfortable, but my INTJ brain was seeking out any reason why I might have upset him, and in turn taking a steamy shit on myself for not being a better more enjoyable friend."
1408,isfj,"I'm making a thread for the whole week because I suck and forgot to make one this weekend.
I'm going to start scheduling them - I plan to set up automoderator but somehow I haven't had ANY time to myself lately in which to do so!! People want to socialize with me too much. 🙃 Not that I'm complaining...
Okay, anyways. Let's chat it up, folks! What are you expecting to do this week? Any big plans? How much has the time change thrown you off?
For me, I'm the second in command on a project I'm working on at work and the project lead is on vacation Monday and Tuesday, so I have to somehow stop everything from going up in flames. I just hope I'm ready for it!
I could ramble forever but I'll leave it here. Talk, folks!!"
1409,isfj,"I slept at 3am last night (when it was actually 2) and was so confused about why I wasnt drop dead tired at that time. 
No plans for the week but it's probably not going to be a good one because I'm already irked. I was supposed to take a picture of some pages in a book from my school's library since it isn't available anywhere online, and I needed to read them for a small class assignment due Monday. I told my friend (who was nice enough to give me a ride home and is also taking the same class as me) to leave without me so I could take these pictures. She said that she will be at school the next day so she will do it and send them to me. Spoiler: this was on Friday and i asked her about it on Saturday (she forgot to do it) but she said she'd be back at school on Sunday, it is now Sunday night/Monday morning and I have not heard back. Yay"
1410,isfj,"I got my first job! It’s at a startup and the salary is pretty entry level but i’m hoping to learn a lot and i think the location is super convenient for me so i’ll still have time to practice yoga and pursue other things. Right now i’m looking at classes at Skillshare to learn more about copy writing, digital marketing, and web design :) "
1411,isfj,"I loved the whole female superhero aspect, as well as the lack of a love interest (wouldn't say the dynamic Fury and MC is anything more than friendly bantering). But yeah, I too feel I've had less of a reaction.
I did like how the humour was more deadpan, rather than overt. I could relate a lot more to the main character because her humour is more like mine.
I kind of want to analyze it more in depth but I'm not sure this thread is the best place for it as there's lots of people who haven't seen it yet. I might make another thread about it."
1412,isfj,"I've never heard of the DISC one before but I got SC too? And I'm 9w1 for enneagram, although currently a moderately unhealthy 9, so I probably seem more like a 6 lol. Not sure about the instinctual variant, though. "
1413,isfj,"Here are two free tests. I suggest you do both. (They are short and quick to do) 
Then you can read more about your result here. 
Let me know what you get! :)"
1414,isfj,"Ah... then you and I have lots to talk about..... :D 
I know.. I'm in the middle section, trying to move up to the top 3.. ;) (Avoiding conflicts at all costs at the moment..)
Aiming for (at least) level 3: 
""Level 3: Optimistic, reassuring, supportive: have a healing and calming influence—harmonizing groups, bringing people together: a good mediator, synthesizer, and communicator."""
1415,isfj,"I've taken multiple tests in the past here is what I got:

1416,isfj,"Ahh yeah, I'm in about the same place I'd say! There have been points in my life where I'd say I've been as high as a level 3, but right now I'm more like a level 5, unfortunately. Getting back to at least a 3 would be ideal, but I'm definitely in that hazy, anxious, ""don't wanna deal with it"" space right now where I feel like I barely even have the energy to think positive, much less actually take useful action (and it certainly doesn't help that my ADHD is currently untreated). May I ask if you've had any success with starting to make progress in the right direction? If you have any advice, I would love to hear it :) "
1417,isfj,"I wish I had any advice. My moving down a couple of levels was mostly caused by circumstances. But for me it does help to get enough sleep, eat right and get fresh air - and get enough alone time. (That last one is an important one for me). That does remove some of the haze. Other than that I'm praying for better times.. :)"
1418,isfj,"The thing is with these Enneagram profiles I can relate to a whole bunch of things. It's really hard to say what I ""most"" relate to because on all pages, there are some things I relate to more and some I don't. Mostly I relate to 1, 5, 6 and 9 in different ways. 
The fact that there's the whole (dis)integration doesn't help and Enneagram hasn't been as dissected or discussed much as MBTI so it's hard for me to figure out."
1419,isfj,"Understandable! I figured it couldn't hurt to at least ask but it can be pretty hard to break out of. Taking care of the basics is definitely always a good start though! I struggle with a lot of that stuff, which doesn't help lol, but I should probably redouble my efforts again :')"
1420,isfj,"I try and usually I'm pretty easy going and chill
I guess unless something is REALLY pissing me off I dont believe I always show how Im really feeling
Sometimes I dont know if this is true or not
If I make a mistake, I can be hard on myself especially on the severity. I'll convince myself to get over it though
If I were to reach out to others it'd be to ask fro help. I don't really like venting for the sake of hitting people with the feeelings I have, dont want to waste their time
What kind of problems?
What do they mean by stubborn unwilligness? LIke even if something is really really bugging them they'll fight back and refuse to try to let these negative feellings get to them?
How do they test people? BY asking questions or trying things to see how they act before they get close to them? 
disengagement of their attention? I can be pretty trusting but I can tell if someone is REALLY obviously suspicious and avoid them.
Something that confuses me heavily
Uhhh depends on the topic. Like if I have a feeling someone could still harbor some ill will even if if minor I'll get anxious over it.
I would prefer to be easy going when possible but sometimes I cant help it and be anxious"
1421,isfj,"A poorly functioning 9 will gravitate towards the negative sides of a 6. A well functioning 9 however, will gravitate towards the positive sides of a 3. (Yeah I know, slightly confusing, but very interesting at the same time...) :)
I'm a 9. 


I usually trust everybody. (Why on earth would anyone want to harm me.. right??) ;) 


I ALWAYS hide my negative feelings. The only ones to see them is my husband and kids. 


I will do whatever it takes to keep the peace, and avoid confrontation. 

"
1422,isfj,"hmm well I'd prefer to trust people when I can and I havent had too many bad experiences
I try to hide my negative feelings when I can, mostly because I dont want to lash out and hurt someone or make myselfl ook bad
I HATE confrontation thats when I get super anxious. Like I dont want to start anything it might cause someone to not like me or it could potentialyl change the way the community goes or something. Recently ive been trying to get over it."
1423,isfj,"One of the things I like about the Enneagram test is that every personality profile is describing 9 different levels of functioning. (Towards the bottom of each profile)
Top 3 is when you are well functioning. Middle 3 is.. well.. middle functioning. (I'm probably a level 4 on the 9 personality...). And then the bottom 3 is if you are functioning very poorly. But reading through them on 9 and 6 might help you determine which one you are.   "
1424,isfj,"Hey team :)
I'd like input from ISFJs on my website. It's basically personal growth and life coaching meets video games. The main aspect of it is a re-skinning of MBTI in which each function has an RPG character to represent it.
Si - Elf warrior (guardian)
Fe - Dwarf healer (cleric)
Ti - Elf mage (arcanist)
Ne - Dwarf hunter (gunslinger)
Each function has abilities and a pre-made character with a backstory to give some spice. Click on the names on the website to go to each function's main page with RPG and technical explanations.
The level 30 Hero (you as Si), the level 30 Companion (Fe), the level 10 Newbie (Ti), and the Ai Escort (Ne) are on a quest to slay your dragons and uncover the epic loot behind each struggle.
As an INFP, I could use some help in making sure it fits your style. I've shared this site with some other types in their subreddits, and I'm curious how you all view your own ISFJ profile.
I'd be very happy if I got some feedback on it in case anything needs to be adjusted. Is there anything that hits home? Anything that doesn't?
www.boss-mod.com/isfj
Thanks :D"
1425,isfj,"Heh these fit basically all my favorite roles in RPG campaigns (Guardians = the tank/support, Cleric = the healer, Arcanist/Gunslinger = ranged fighting) 
These are nice writeups you posted, good job."
1426,isfj,"Dude! I love ISFJs. I think my Si character of Silemem'ri is one of my favorites.
Honestly, I love every type! But I find so much inspiration in Si doms. I guess it's because I understand it in a distant cousin sense (as an INFP). And Fe is relatable but slightly different from my natural way (in another distant cousin sense).
Either way, it's all love. I think you all are responsible for so much positive reinforcement in the world.
I've been drinkin. But it's all from the heart lol"
1427,isfj,"Sorry I didn't see your message! Thanks for commenting!
I'm glad to hear you liked it! Statistically, ISFJs are most likely to pick stealth and ranged classes, then mages. So it's good to hear that you were okay with the classes I chose :P"
1428,isfj,"I'm not sure if this is ok to post here but I need advice. I'm an INFJ for reference.
I have this ISFJ friend that I have been best friends with for several years. I've noticed that she has been rather distant lately. I've also noted that she hasn't really made an effort to hang out with me. The times that I would reach out to her, via text, she would claim she hadn't read the message, even though the read receipts were on.
In the moments that I would hang out with her, it would seem like she didn't want to be there with me. She doesn't speak much, and when I ask her a question, she usually gives very short answers. I found this strange because she used to be very talkative around me.
I'm not sure what I did wrong to her, since I am always considerate to her feelings. Do any of you guys know why she is asking this way? What do you guys think of all this? Do you think she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore?"
1429,isfj,"Mm, it's kind of hard to say. I can get like that for two reasons; either if I'm trying to distance myself from someone because I don't want them around anymore, or because I'm going through a really difficult patch and I just don't have the energy to be around other people. I would say probably the only way to figure out what's going on with her is just to flat-out ask her. If she's trying to avoid you she might try to play it off depending on how she handles conflict, but for me personally if it's a ""rough patch"" issue, I might try to downplay how bad it is but I wouldn't totally deny it. "
1430,isfj,"I second this, these are the only reasons I would do that to a person. 
It can be really awkward to try to end a friendship, and while it isn't necessarily kind or healthy, I'm more likely to do a gradual fade like this, than to tell someone directly that I don't want them in my life anymore. It may not even be anything personal. For me, I can only handle having a couple of close relationships in my life at a time, friendships included. 
If I have too many friends/acquaintances at once, and they're all wanting my time, it's too overwhelming for me. I put a lot of effort into my close relationships, and I don't have it in me to have more than 3-4 at a time, so in the past, I've had to prioritize a little bit, and distance myself from people. If that's the case, it doesn't mean you're not worth as much as her other relationships or anything like that, it just means she's spreading herself too thin, and for her own sanity, needs to withdraw and focus on her closest core relationships.
It could very well be something she's going through, too. When I'm in a really rough place in life, I tend to push people away and really pull back, socially. A lot of people feel rejected and hurt, and that's never my intention, I'm just so emotionally messed up that I don't have the energy to maintain my friendships with anybody, and I need to spend some time focusing on myself and my own needs. 
ISFJs can be selfless to a fault, so it's difficult for us to take care of ourselves when we're focusing on other people. We just can't do both at once. "
1431,isfj,"Hey guys, I'm an INTP and my wife and I have been spending time with a couple. Our wives get along splendidly as they are both ENFJs. The guy and I get along fine but I just feel like there is a lot more dead air than there should be. I don't mind particularly, but is this something that you ISFJs would be uncomfortable with? He's said to his wife that he finds me a little hard to read despite the fact that I don't think I'm that complicated.
There have been a few times we're I've tried to discuss my theories and latest pet interest but the topics of interest we share is pretty narrow so far.  He's a really decent guy and I'd like to develop things a little bit but if could get some pointers to help talk in his language that would be cool."
1432,isfj,"Do you know he's an ISFJ?
I'm pretty good with silence but do tend to over think when it's a 1 on 1 conversation with silences because I think I'm not interesting to them.
I recommend just acting as comfortable as you can which will show him he can be comfortable too.
As for topics to talk about you may have to ask his wife what he's in to, though every ISFJ I've met I've had large discussions about philosophy/life/the universe. Mostly deep discussions because we'd always hate small talk about the weather/traffic etc."
1433,isfj,"First off, sorry he kind of sucks around your daughter.  This may be part of the issue if she's around during all your interactions.  
Also, keep in mind, and it sounds like it's the same for you, too as you're an I and I think it's an I thing, but small talk doesn't get us very far.  Reaching for interests generally doesn't work, either.  As in, if you expect him to come up with things to ask to get the ball rolling, it probably won't happen, as you've found out.  
But don't write it off as you, it's just a tough nut to crack.  I'm like this as well.  In the beginning I hardly say anything but I need my chance to become comfortable with the situation.  
Things that can generally always get people talking are TV and movies.  Politics and religion can too easily offend.  
If push comes to shove, asking his wife may not be a bad idea, either.
Good luck!"
1434,isfj,"Two of my best friends have been INTP, and I've known a few others as well. These relationships have brought some of the most interesting and insightful conversations and experiences I think I've ever had.
What do you have in common? Hobbies? Sports? Some metaphysical philosophy? Ask investigative questions and the conversation usually will work its way through."
1435,isfj,"INTJ here. I've been dating an ISFJ and I find that there is a lot of ""dead air"" with her. It dosent seem to be a bad thing though. But I try to talk theories with her and it just doesnt happen. I've found of I talk more about current events or more mainstream things I get a better response "
1436,isfj,"He took an online test and he seems to fit the description fairly well. He's described himself as intellectual before but a lot of the things I bring up seem to be dead end. I tend to approach things from a technical side so I'm not sure if I'm being too academic about our conversations.
One show stopper so far has been that he's pretty open about telling my 3 year old when she's misbehaving. I have trouble paying close enough attention to catch all her little things so when the kids are around I'm focusing really hard on making sure she's minding her p's and q's so he doesn't feel like he has to intervene. I'm trying so hard that it's difficult for me to carry on a conversation. Basically when our kids are around I'm talking to my daughter and that's it. He's also been pretty stern with my daughter and it makes me uncomfortable. Not sure how to approach that or even if I should.
So far here are a few things we've been able to talk about:

Magic mushroom trips we've had. Neither of us are in places in life where we can do that but it's fun to talk about our past experiences. 
He has a vast knowledge of beers and scotch. I think this would potentially be an untapped (no pun intended, honest) area but my knowledge is pretty limited, so I'll need to do some research.
He's a roofer and he likes to talk about work but after the initial conversation, I got bored pretty quick.
"
1437,isfj,"It seems like if anyone else says something, they don't get questioned too much. But if I say something, such as ""I don't want to go out tonight"", I get talked down repeatedly until I either give in, or try justify myself, at which point the person gets defensive and says that ""you just had to say no, no need to get so emotional"" (which is infuriating because I literally did say no, several times). 
Does anyone else struggle with this? "
1438,isfj,"Yes, this has happened to me too. It’s a terrible feeling. I also struggle with wanting so badly to be carefree and super easy going all the time, while also wanting desperately to be taken seriously by everyone...haha"
1439,isfj,"I don't think you specifically aren't being taken seriously (in this case at least)
For some reason it's common sense that everybody wants and needs to go out (that's totally crazy). So if you say you don't want to, people will try to talk you into it. And there is little boundary to that.
Just be very definitive right away, or even pretend to be upset. I do it, that way I don't have to actually get upset for people to understand and it's smoother (because I'm not actually upset)"
1440,isfj,"I created an initial version of this survey a few days ago, but after receiving feedback and reviewing many of the responses, I restructured it to increase accuracy, depth, and easier data analysis. Even if you've already taken the previously posted survey, please take this new one as well.
This is a survey searching for correlation between MBTI and musical interests such as genres, instruments, singing, dance, and composition/production. Once I get a descent amount of responses, I will post the results in r/mbti (unless r/isfj would like me to post them here as well). I've created individual surveys for each of the 16 personality types, and the one below is SPECIFICALLY for ISFJs.
The ISFJ survey link:

​
Thanks for your responses! As I said previously, I will post the results and analysis in r/mbti once the survey is completed."
1441,isfj,"For me it was realizing that maybe my standards of people and myself was too high
I had to lower expectations of everyone and myself that there will always be flaws to deal with
Starting slow and getting more people in your life can make your group of people slowly expand just take it at your speed and start somewhere"
1442,isfj,You know by lowering your standards It always mean you accept what it is instead of pushing. I am just sad that I reject people over simple things that I thought are red flags for me like smoking. Then you sit alone and you don't know how to make friends anymore. 
1443,isfj,"I understand the accepting what you have vs pushing yourself thing.
The thing is, I personally think it's all in moderation.
If you push yourself/others too hard you can shut yourself from others and yourself from standards that are too high.
If you only accept what you have dont improve at all you're limiting your potential.
Instead of just only following one set of advice for every situation you have to look into where you currently stand on the scale and adjust to what you think you can improve on.
And of course every little adjustment can help, just constantly be doing something or trying to think of do something. Not everything is a major change that can happen overnight."
1444,isfj,"So there is this good guy friend of mine that I'm pretty interested in, and for every thing that makes me think he might be interested, too, there is another that makes me think he really couldn't care less. For example, I am frequently his confidant- he trusts me with some pretty heavy stuff that he hasn't told anyone else and always kind of seems shocked at himself for telling me. I don't know whether to take this as a good sign or not, partly because I do have a knack for getting people to open up. He takes things I say very seriously, for example, there was one time where in a moment of vulnerability told him that his teasing of me (which he tells me he just gets the urge to do with me) was getting to be too much and asked him if it was him being passive aggressive about something he wasn't confronting me about, an accusation that he took kind of hard, I think, because he very abruptly stopped teasing me, and will still occasionally bring that conversation up (it was about 1.5 years ago) and quote me on things I said during it (and generally remembers things I say long after I've said them), and tells me how guilty he felt after I told him my feelings were hurt. He even jokingly inquired once if it was because 'I was in love with him' that I took his teasing to heart. He will initiate things with me, but only when I bump into him - usually when we hang out it is a spontaneous suggestion on his part, whenever he sees me, but has only ever planned something with me once (concert), as opposed to me actually planning to spend time with him. He compliments my appearance every so often but we are friends so that isn't really crazy. Oh, and he did once randomly show me a picture of himself shirtless, with no prompting on my end, because he was showing me a different picture on his phone and scrolled passed it, but then for some reason felt he had something to prove and made a big show of showing me the pic. Honestly, I guess I just want to know what kind of signs to look out for in an ISFJ guy. I considered telling him how I felt but didn't want to try if there was nothing there, esp since we've been friends for this long. "
1445,isfj,"A whole day to my self. 
Other than that, I keep telling my husband that I would rather get something i NEED, rather than something ""romantic"", or ""special"". After almost 14 years of marriage he still finds it hard to believe.. "
1446,isfj,"Two types of gifts get to me the most:
1) Something practical, where the giver has put a lot of thought into your personality or interests... in my case cookbook with beautiful food porn does the trick. Or a nice journal. 
2) Something that can be shared with others, like sweets/snacks or a bottle of wine, perhaps a meal out. What’s even better about receiving a gift is being able to share the experience with other loved ones. "
1447,isfj,I feel as though I have been in a loop for a few months now. Can't get through it and can't get over my crappy situation that happened. I thought researching the loop would help and it has helped me understand even though I haven't found a clear solution except to develop FE better. I feel like I've done a pretty good job of that and it still feels hopeless. I did find this though and thought it was a pretty funny example of how our brain works when in this kind of loop 
1448,isfj,"Some background information. I am male, and had been diagnosed with Autism/ Aspergers syndrome (mild) at an early age.
I've never seen myself as an ISFJ, or even thought I had the qualities of one. I discovered what an mbti test was a week ago, decided to try it out, and ended up with ISFJ. I would have never believed anyone if they told me I had the traits of an ISFJ. I spent the next few hours looking up what exactly makes up an ISFJ, and it finally clicked. I never gave a second thought to why I act like I do before, so I never saw it. But now, I can clearly see my motivation behind my actions in the past, and the reasons behind my feelings that I just ignored because I never understood them. It's extremely overwhelming, suddenly realizing that maybe I'm more sensitive and caring than I thought. All I've been doing the past 3 days are researching what defines an ISFJ, and what makes them different from others. It's almost like an obsession, I need to understand everything now, now that I have a grasp on what I'm actually feeling. I really needed to get this off my chest, my head has been hurting every time I start trying to figure this out on my own, I would really appreciate the help understanding this.
I also have some questions I would appreciate if someone could help me understand them better.


It's hard for me to talk about myself. I don't feel right when even thinking about it, and the times that I have gotten into a conversation regarding myself, I feel like I'm taking up too much attention, that subconsciously I'm only doing it for attention witbout realizing it (even typing this down is hard enough for me). Is this common among ISFJ's and introverts?


I seem to feel more safe and ""at home"" with friends than family. Anytime I have been alone with friends or family, out and about somewhere, I have a much better time and feel much more relaxed when talking to friends, and feel much closer to friends at the end of the day. I have no reason to feel this way, I don't have a family that I hate or don't enjoy their presence, yet I feel this way around my parents and sister, and I just don't get why.


I hate conflicts, and seeing someone or something provoke another absolutely infuriates me. I feel an immense hatred towards anyone who performs an inhumane or immoral act, and I feel powerless when I am forced to watch a conflict play out in front of my eyes and can't do anything to stop it. I have seen very little talk about anything regarding this and ISFJ's, and don't know why seeing things like these tick me off so much.


I feel I need to help out with everyone's problems. I never get ""tired"" of discussing someone else's problems with them, and I kind of feel good when I know someone is depending on me for support. A while ago, I had gone on a trip with my high school marching band to our annual Disneyland trip (when I was in HS), and hung out with a friend within the band that I had grown close with over the 4 years in the band (quick background on the situation, he had gone through finding his sexual preferences and had found himself to be gay a while before this). During the trip, we (me, him, 2 other girls in the band that he knew, I didn't know them as much) had ran into another group of guys that they really wanted to talk to because they thought they were cute. I had no problem tagging along with them despite being the only one of our group that isn't into guys, and sometime later before meeting up with them, we had sat down somewhere and my guy friend would not stop going on about the guys, and I felt really good being able to sit there and discuss how he felt, chime in with something helpful here and there, and him thanking me for listening to him and sticking with him the entire time. For some reason, this is my most cherished memory that I can remember, and just don't understand why. What makes me feel this way? I can listen to my friend's personal conflicts all day, and sometimes I feel like I just want to listen to someone, to be useful and reliable to someone else. I don't get why I realize how much I enjoy this all of a sudden, and in turn feel good that I'm helping someone out with their own problems.


Thanks to anyone for reading through this enormous amount of text. I needed to express this somwhere, and I'm glad to have an outlet to express myself, whether it gets read or not."
1449,isfj,"All 4 of those points describes me pretty much spot on.
Not only do I not like talking about myself but I'm terrible at taking compliments. I never know what to say and if I do say the right thing, it just ends up sounding awkward. I have no idea if this is common or not.
Your 2nd point is something I might as well have written myself, that's how accurate it is. Again, don't know if it's common.
Honestly, I was pretty surprised reading this as I didn't think there'd be someone else with all 4 of these same traits that I have. The thing for me is, I wasn't always like this. It started after high school and hasn't really changed since. I've chalked it up to the way I was raised or something genetic but I don't really know."
1450,isfj,"All these describe me pretty well too.
Just a warning though: what you posted was exactly where I was a couple years ago. I helped out with everyone's problems, I was a go-to shoulder to cry on. Taking care of other people requires a lot of energy and at some point you're going to have to focus on yourself. Make sure you have at least one friend who you can talk about yourself/your own problems with without feeling guilty. I've been there, done that, ruined friendships because I took on too much (see: loves helping) and couldn't confront them about how I was feeling (see: hates conflict).
Spread that love, but remember you can't help everyone all the time."
1451,isfj,"I can really relate to your first and third point. It takes a long time for me to be comfortable enough to tell someone about what I really am thinking, what I really feel, etc. And even then once I've ""earned"" that person, I oftentimes just feel bad or like I am talking to much about myself when I talk to them. I think it's due to me feeling like I bother people.
The third point really hits me spot on. I have always been known to cheer for the ""underdog"" or play devil's advocate... Another thing that I feel strongly about is cheating. I fucking HATE cheaters (in school, in relationships, whatever). Someone is working hard to earn their grade, yet a cheater can just CHEAT without feeling morally wrong and earn a better grade. It's just their complete lack of caring that they cheated. Where is their moral compass pointing?!?"
1452,isfj,"1-3 perfectly hit home for me. While also like to be considered depenable and be a shoulder to lean on for people, I wouldn't go as far as to say that I never get tired of discussing someone else's problems. Still it's all pretty accurate for me too. "
1453,isfj,"1 seems quite ISFJ-ish. I recently started reading the tumblr of the person who said this quote and one thing that came up a few times is ""You have as much right to take up space as anybody else."" I feel like it's quite common for ISFJs, along with similar types, to feel guilty about taking up space, whether it's by talking about ourselves, asking someone to do something for us, saying no to somebody or speaking up about our needs.
2 resonates a lot with me, and I think that's because I chose my friends based solely on how well we click with each other, whereas you don't choose which family you're born to. So even if your family members are nice, you may not click with them in quite the same way that you do with friends. I thought there was something wrong with the relationship I have with my family because we stick to surface stuff, but the reason for that is because my family process the deeper stuff in a way that's not really compatible with how I do, and the result is that it's just easier for me to talk to friends about those things.
I identify strongly with #3 and #4 too. I feel everything you've described in #3 really strongly, even toward fictional characters, and I definitely feel the same enjoyment of being useful to someone that you've described in #4. I think a big part of #4 for me is that being listened to and allowed to express my feelings is really, really important to me and I've been let down A LOT by people who meant well but didn't understand that I just needed someone to listen and that's a valid and healthy thing to need. So because listening without leaping in and trying to fix it is so valuable to me, I feel really good when I'm able to do it for somebody else. And when it comes to smaller rants, like when colleagues complain about a customer or boss, I feel connected to that person because they're opening up to me on a level that has to do with something I value strongly (being able to have feelings like frustration or annoyance or anger without feeling like I'm being selfish or lazy or weak or making a big deal out of nothing).
I do have limits, though, and as guilty as I feel about it (see #1), there are times when I need to rest or focus on my own problems and let somebody else be the helper instead. The mantra ""Self-care is not selfish"" has helped me a LOT with this, as well as ""I don't have to be everything to everyone"" and ""Most people don't have any overexpectations of me."" Another thing that's helped is trying out things that feel selfish to me and watching how the people in my life react. A lot of the time, they're happy to go with it, and that gives me confidence. I'm needing to take baby steps here, and some of the steps have given me a lot of anxiety. And that's OK, because along with learning to get comfortable with taking up space, I'm learning to stop discounting my feelings about things. I wish you the very best of luck with the things darvillian mentioned, because you are as deserving of attention and care as everybody else. :)"
1454,isfj,"Regarding point #4, I enjoy helping other people out as much as you do. I'm glad whenever I'm able to put a smile on someone's face.
But there is a darker reason for this too. I have very low self-esteem and not a day goes by when I feel that something is wrong with me. I believe the only redeeming point about me is that I actually sit down and listen to other people's problems."
1455,isfj,Funnily enough I always come up as INTP or INFJ even once came out as INTJ which blew my mind but after a while due to major confusion and doubt it turned out I was just a very weird ISFJ with INTP-esc traits
1456,isfj,"Thanks for the advice! This only happened recently, and I haven't had the opportunity to meet up with any friends lately (everyone's busy right now, and none of our free time falls on the same days), so I'll take this into consideration if anything comes up"
1457,isfj,"Wow, and I thought this was just me.
Adding on to Aadrianseth's point about getting an advantage in life without really putting any kind of real effort in, or by using underhanded means, is something that has always bugged me growing up.
But I was really too weak to make a difference, so all I could do was stand by and watch.
The only people who win are the people who cheat, lie and do whatever's necessary to reach the end goal. There is no place in this world for honesty and integrity. Such is my view on life right now."
1458,isfj,"I think it's because that's the only time I feel useful around my friends. I often feel lIke the third wheel because I prefer to listen rather than talking, so I feel like my friends sometimes forget I'm there, despite how close we are when we do get time to sit down and talk"
1459,isfj,"Thanks! :) All this has only come up recently,  so I'm still trying to process everything without getting too overwhelmed. Just the thought that I can look back into the past and actually understand my motives behind my actions for once is alot to take in. "
1460,isfj,"I just really like how you phrased this for some reason:
Also I'm really glad I clicked the tumblr link... This quotation makes me feel so much better because I often feel bad just for feeling bad at all. Like I just need to snap out of my mood instead of just accept it.

1461,isfj,"That still doesn't stop me from trying to be the best i can. Even if it's the easiest way out, if i don't think it's right, i won't do it, and to the point where i feel like it's physically impossible to do it even if i was forced to do it. Others may call it a weakness, but i'm proud of it."
1462,isfj,"i'm estp and met these guys on the internet, he seem to like me a lot at first, communicate well so he ask if i like him i said i like him. [But not love man!] i always want to have some one take care of me so i committed in relationships with him but after we committed be in relationships and when i start to fall... he not doing anything except call me all day when i said 'my mother is here we cannot call' but still he called and say love love love you but not doing anything to pls you, i hate him, maybe he thing 'why i have to take care of you because you already mine' while i encourage him everything and say many things just to pls him and it's doesn't mean that if i say i love you you will not doing anything back to us, you are so cruel, now i blocked him...never ever want to see and date isfj again...never ever ps.dont mind my grammar, tx"
1463,isfj,"Your post has terrible English and you are calling ISFJ guys stupid. If you talk like this in real life I’m sure many types will definitely have a hard time understanding you (not just ISFJs). Back to the guy in the post, most of us aren’t that dysfunctional. At the end of the day, one person doesn’t represent a type. I’m sure there are many great ISFJ guys out there. I also think that stereotyping an entire male mbti’s type as stupid says a lot about your own intelligence. That’s like stereotyping all black people as basketball players."
1464,isfj,"If you communicated with him the same way you did here I can see how he didn't understood your needs... I don't know if you are as dumb as you sound in this post/replies or english is a real struggle for you, though I'm inclined to think is the first. Anyway, this comes from an ISFJ girl (surprise, we can be cruel!), just for you to realize that each person is different and you cannot generalize to a whole population. "
1465,isfj,"What do you think you're doing in this post? This entire post is you blaming someone else.
You aren't jut sharing your experience. You're saying your bad experience with one ISFJ guy means that every ISFJ guy is a piece of shit. That's not just sharing an experience. That's condemning an entire demographic."
1466,isfj,"i just want everyone to know you are bad because you not except what other perspectives are, at least you could except your false but you're not because you're egoness, and i could said isfj girls are far more better than that, my isfj girls-friends never say cruel thing to me but you guys says, even with this normal talk it sore, you guys are so lack, and i like boy(s) not girl(s) but boy that make me sore...other mbti's type's just better than you guys"
1467,isfj,"It seems like you met a stranger on the internet, got in to a relationship with them, and then got upset when they didn't meet all your needs. I'm not sure what you expected. You seem very emotionally fragile, particularly in the way you're handling this post.
Also you said ""ISFJ men are the worst species."" That seems like you're saying all to me."
1468,isfj,"Cognition is a Discord server with MBTI theme with already quite a few ISFJs, with a big intellectual focus and emotional support, as well as some memes and a lot of fun :) Check it out if you want to meet other people but you don't like having to leave your room, like me!

1469,isfj,"Communities usually vary a lot. As a user it's good to have multiple options to choose from. Competition for users may also drive up the quality of servers.
Some people prefer smaller friendly servers where their voice can be heard. That's why I'd recommend Cognition. "
1470,isfj,"When I was younger, I looked forward to hanging out with friends on the weekends, and generally enjoyed being around people. Within the last year or so, however, I try to avoid people as much as I can, and find time spent around them exhausting and somewhat pointless. I'd rather be alone and think about life and deep stuff. I think it's like, when I'm around people I use my Fe to the point where I get annoyed with how happy I'm acting, when I'd really rather be serious in solitude. Any other ISFJ's feel like this?"
1471,isfj,"Whenever I'm around people, specifically people I care for, the slightest air of tension, sadness or sour-ness changes the climate of my mind. And it's exhausting, the amount of processing done in my brain is staggering. It's as if I can't accept it until I've had the time to digest it.
On a less negative note, I also get a little worn when people make plans, and ask if I'm interested in tagging along (ski trip that will cost you 500$ this weekend ?). It's too short notice for me to feel comfortable saying yes, but I don't want to disappoint people with a no. 
I prefer laid-back, neutral company. Though I never feel like I don't wanna go home."
1472,isfj,"Totally what I am feeling.  I am almost 53, and honestly I feel I could be a hermit.  I do teach middle school, so that explains some of my need for alone time.  I wonder/worry it might be depression.  I also find myself not needing as many friends.  My ideal life: a cottage with wifi near the beach....alone.  "
1473,isfj,"Yeah, I used to worry about disappointing people by saying no to their invitations, but I've gotten to the point where I'm like ""you know what? If you want to be friends with me, you're going to have to be okay with the fact that no, I do not want to go out tonight . . . also no, that does not mean I don't like you or your friends. It's just not my cup of tea."" People are usually pretty accepting once I explain my personality. "
1474,isfj,"Yes! Living alone in a cottage sounds wonderful. I'm beginning to consider looking for my own place (currently live with 2 roommates), but I'm not sure how good that is for me. My roommates are the only people I really interact with, so living alone would mean going into full-on hermit mode, which I suspect may have negative repercussions. And yes, I also wonder at times that it might be depression. "
1475,isfj,"That's a valid concern.  I've been mostly keeping to myself for the past few months, only occasionally hanging out with friends.  This leaves me with a lot of time to think about things... too much time even.  Very recently I've developed extreme social anxiety and I tend to overthink/overanalyze situations to the point of paranoia, thinking everybody is judging me behind my back.  Apparently this can be fueled by depression and stress, both things I know that I suffer from in abundance.  
For a while before this, I used to tell myself I was an introvert and was the most comfortable when alone.  This may have been true, but it led to me flaking out on friends, spending a lot of my time alone and now I'm in the middle of this anxiety business so I can't help but wonder if I did this to myself.  
Sorry for the rant-thing, I guess?  My point I'm trying to make is that I've been where you are before, and those 'negative repercussions' you mentioned are very real and not fun."
1476,isfj,"Nah, I like rants =) Thank you for sharing. I'm sorry you've been going through that. Not fun for sure :/ I've learned how unhealthy it can be to only live inside our heads, but at the same time I'm hardly ever in the mood to be around people, so I never really get out of my head. So I sort of compromise by keeping myself busy with academics and such when I'm alone. This has helped to keep me focused on physical reality instead of my wild imagination :P 
Do you think that depression is the reason for your introverted tendencies? Like maybe without it you would be more extroverted? "
1477,isfj,"I think it's more the other way around. I was an introvert long before I ever even suspected I might be depressed, so I think that indulging my introverted side (flaking on friends to watch Netflix by myself instead, and avoiding people most of the time) actually just snowballed into this social anxiety, and added to some close family members' deaths, depression as well."
1478,isfj,"Hello,
So unfortunately I haven't been into the MBTI  community as much and also seldom find time to make updates to the /r/ISFJ subreddit in general.
So I'm looking for more moderators who for the subreddit who are willing to do at least one or more of the following:

Make/Add/Edit/Delete Post and User Flairs. Will be useful when any new game in the series comes out. You don't have to have experience making flairs before since there are guides but previous experience can certainly help.
Add, Edit and Enforce the Rules. Our ruleset is very outdated and could use a makeover. Depending on how you view the state of the subreddit the mod team can think of ways to improve the sub for what they think will be for the better. And of course make sure to view the mod queue, any user reports or any topics/comments you think are not following the rules.
Think of ways to update the appearance of the subreddit. Whether it's banner ideas, the overall presentation of the topics on either old or new reddit, subreddit icon, etc. CSS and/or Photoshop experience can help with this.
Ideas for sticky topics. At the moment I've just been stickying anything that looks like it can be helpful or hard to find.
Keeping information, wikis and sidebar up to date. As I said above, I have a table that lists upcoming events that I never update. The wikis are empty and could use nice information. Other important info could be put in the sidebar.
Any other ideas to make the subreddit better for all users.

Here's the link to the official Signup form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKHM1s80iThHIRscrvhP3a1Z95IdzOKlpFAvFwrpt-CnbnKQ/viewform?usp=sf_link
I'll leave this topic open for at least a few weeks. Make sure to only sign up if you're serious about being a mod here."
1479,isfj,"I think I broke him. He's an enneagram 6 so a little different from your typical ISFJ enneagram 2 types, I believe. 
Anyways, I kind of used to handle him like glass because... I was being considerate of his sensitivities, as I can read it on his face pretty well, he seemed often easily .. not hurt I would say but... kind of.. like he doesn't take jokes well, if I call him out for something(always as a joke) he gets .. defensive..almost.. on guard? E.g., we were racing to the elevator and he got there first but I pushed past him inside just as the doors opened and I yelled ""HA, you lost to a girl, does that make you feel emasculated?"" (clearly joking since I lost) And he was just like, ""What? No..."" and he got that stubborn look on his face and it got awkward and I tried to brush it off and stuck my tongue out at him or something but damn was that an awkward elevator ride up. 
SO, I was treading carefully but then one day he sat me down and told me that he would prefer that I speak my mind so the next time something came up, I did. It was about sex. I tried to fix it. The sex pretty much sucked. So I told him how I felt about it (which is basically that I didn't like it and that I wanted to work on it) AND NOW HE WON'T LOOK ME IN THE EYE, he flinches when I touch him, and idk, he gets this stubborn look on his face, and it's been going on for awhile now and I'm about to dip out of this relationship real soon but....... I mean.. why don't I just give it a shot and ask y'all... how the flying fuck do I fix it? I didn't mean to offend his pride, he's extremely physically attractive so I don't know what he has to be insecure about, if it is insecurity... 
But the more he avoids me physically, the more he seems to approach me conversationally, especially over text, which is kind of hard because I'm not a great texter but I'm really making an effort here because I know I dip out of relationships too quickly and he's a pretty great dude.. 
Anyways... I don't know whats going on in his mind, maybe you guys will. I know I'm extremely upfront but it's never personal, more informative, I'm not really good at softening words, but I don't mean it to hurt or offend so maybe theres a way I can say things without it putting him on guard? 
Maybe I'm just not compatible with him or with this type in general... idk, I don't seem to come across many of you often. "
1480,isfj,"I'm a enneagram 9 (I'd say 6 and 9 are more common with ISFJs than 2 from my experience)
ISFJs can take anything to heart really hard, even little jokes that have negative part to it (something I'm trying to work on).
In a way we're weird in that we want people to be honest/real with us (Si, Ti) but as I said we take criticism to heart.
There could be the Si/Fe 'traditionalism' mindset of you making the joke of a girl beating him in something that triggered him but I don't think I would mind (but I like to think I'm pretty mentally strong and would get over stuff like that)
Funnily enough like you said while we are sensitive we can be super stubborn because I think we want to fulfill a need especially to people we love.
While you were honest with him which he does appreciate, I'm going to guess he's feeling REALLY guilty at the moment (I know the feel!) because of the sex thing (and maybe little things like the emasculating joke?) he feels like he's not satisfying you enough as a significant other.
However, ssince he seems to be a conflict-averse person (like me) thats why he's kinda keeping his distance since he's aware that he's disappointing you in those regards (even if you appreicate him for other things)
I really think the only advice is you're gonna have to force him to sit down and have a serious talk about it.
My brother who also had an ISFJ girlfriend had similar issues when they got into fights and ultimatley making sure they were on the right page is important.
I think it's good when talking to him seriously about this is to find a balance between softening words and honesty when needed"
1481,isfj,"i know what would work for me but.... it might just be me. 
if i was feeling like 1) i suck at doing something i consider important for someone i feel like i have to please and 2) i am scared of conflict, which i'm normally not, but if i was.
a way for the other person to ""fix me"" would be for the other person to go H.A.M on the thing i'm avoiding. if it's sex then if the other person shows me that they want sex with me in an extremely aggressive way, i'd feel like i'd better do something about it and get better. 
and though in a perfect world, i'd work together with that person to try to get better, i'd want some direction and positive reaction or encouragement when i get them right. maybe even commands. just take the pressure off of me and my probable lack of experience and tell me what i need to do to make you happy.
again, this might just be me though. i'm a bit of a sub. not sure if this is applicable to all isfj guys. i'm only suggesting it, maybe, because he seems to want to please you but doesn't seem to know what to do about it. sounds like he needs direction and is scared or ashamed to ask."
1482,isfj,"I have an ISTP friend - we get along well, as we have common nerdy interests. Sometimes he makes jokes which I find inappropriate. I get hurt/stung for a short while, then I remember he probably doesn't mean it. If it was a closer relationship, these would probably hurt more.
You should be probably more careful with this kind of mean jokes. If you slip one, assess his reaction - if his mood changes like you describe, you should maybe apologize and reassure him you were just kidding. Don't get angry with him or start questioning like ""why are you so sensitive?? omg! I can't believe this"". I would even avoid trying to start a long serious conversation over a small episode like this - if the ISFJ is overwhelmed with emotions, he needs time to process them. If you put pressure on him during this, he will bottle up even more. Just comfort him and help him get over it and then you can have a discussion about it at a later, calmer time.
Emotions are emotions - as an ISFJ I can't really control them, I feel hurt and the realization of being hurt over a silly thing hurts even more.
Ok, so this is just general advice. It seems you are in a more troubled place in your relationship. Still, despite his physical avoidance, he still seems to be open to conversation, so maybe you can still have a talk over it. I can understand him being more open over text - if he's emotionally troubled he finds it easier to communicate this way. Thing is, you have to be patient and more diplomatic. I too would be very hurt about the sex thing and it would cloud my judgement - if someone would pressure me or judge me for being so sensitive, it would make it even worse."
1483,isfj,"Well, using emasculation as a joke is rarely a good idea. =P
If I'm in a good mood, I would have tried to overbid you with something cruder, but chances are I would wonder where this come form.
Nothing of that is about MBTI. It's about intimacy. Maybe you both lost that for some weird reason. Try to talk it back. If he do is broken like a crystal vase past over by a road roller, then fuck all this shit. Nobody but him can fix that kind of thing."
1484,isfj,YES but i think the best way to get out of that thought is to work even harder and strive even higher. When i have too much good stuff going on i sometimes even feel that my downfall is coming soon too
1485,isfj,I Just wanted to know how many of you that WILL COMMENT have suffered much from anxiety/depression or knows someone with ISFJ personality who has. I have an ISFJ personality and Im just a bit curious.
1486,isfj,"Been depressed multiple times in my life. After any major event that affects me negatively or whenever people I've been close to leave from my life.
We invest a lot in our relationships (romantic, or non-romantic) and it's always hard for us to part. Same goes with a lot of changes (moving, new city, change of friends) - that brings anxiety and too much anxiety makes us shut off from the world."
1487,isfj,"As a fellow ISFJ who too suffers from drowning in the worst thoughts my mind can hit me with more than occasionally, I upvoted all of you. 
It's a small, and frankly meaningless gesture.., but I hope you all have a great day today!!!"
1488,isfj,"I used to be completely unflappable until I got to college, then college gave me anxiety and now it's generalized to a lot of other aspects of my life :/ Depression is a lot harder to say... I have frequent, temporary depressive ""slumps"" that last a few days to maybe two weeks max, but I might also just have dysthymia or something in general. I don't really think so but I feel like mental health professionals keep trying to push me in that direction so maybe there's something to it, who knows. "
1489,isfj,"I personally have not, but I know far too many others (none ISFJs) who do. It honestly hurts to see people I care about going through such deep suffering and not be able to fix it. The most I can do is be there for them, and while it sometimes feels like it's not helping, I'm not going anywhere because nobody deserves to feel alone. "
1490,isfj,"ISFJ Female
Social anxiety for me since I was pretty young. It's better but I'm still working on it. I've notice I go through cycles with it personally. 
Depression...I have a lot of symptoms of it I noticed for me but not full on. Sometimes though it may hit worse then expected but overall it's the anxiety that's worse and the depression can be sometimes the add on or social anxiety is the main course and the depression is just a small side dish I guess."
1491,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ with extreme anxiety & depression. I think like others here, my anxiety is the underlying cause of the depression.
Meds help with the depression but I'm still struggling to cope with the anxiety daily. Have meds for panic attacks but need to work more on cognitive therapy techniques."
1492,isfj,"While I'm not ISFJ we do share a lot of the same plights in life with regards to our cognitive functions.  Leading with an introverted perceiver, Fe Aux, Ti tertiary.   I often view ISFJ's as the more stable version of INFJ's.  
I also have an ISFJ buddy who deals with his fair share of anxiety and depression.  We kind of share Ni's future with Si's past in conversations to sort of supercharge dealing with life's problems.  
If I had any advice from what I have seen in my ISFJ buddy and how he is working to be happier.  Stability can suck, once you learn how to exist in your little world of anxiety and still succeed in life, it seems like Si keeps ISFJ's closed off and stuck in this world of anxiety because of it's familiarity.
So shake things up a little, take on little challenges to open up and be part of the world.  Have that conflict you have been avoiding, tell someone how you actually feel, talk about all of those awkward things that run through your head 24 hours a day, step out of Si's comfort zone.  
And you fucker's are better at progressing once you start going too, the whole ""Remembering things"" that I hear about so frequently gives you a bit of a leg up when you decide you want to do something.  But it also gives you a .... leg down?  Getting started since Si dislikes unfamiliar/unknown situations.  
TLDR: Work on being vulnerable instead of being so private.  The world will open up to you.   "
1493,isfj,"I'm the same; depression is brought on by anxiety. This has been going on longer than I can remember. Sometime in elementary school, kindergarten even? (I'm 26 now)
Learning to take care of myself and reduce anxiety has been helpful."
1494,isfj,"Dear self,
 
Remember that time you almost majored in the sciences because you spent too much time on Reddit and genuinely believed that STEM subjects were better than the arts all the time forever and always?  Yeah, you're kind of really impressionable and need to be more independent.
 
Ignore Myers Briggs stereotypes.  Before you knew about all this, you were sure you were an artist and a creative person.  You seriously don't need another voice telling you your artwork is worthless.  Creativity is independent of whether you're a sensor or intuitive, and you don't need someone to tell you that!  Sometimes people get obsessed with the idea that they're special by nature and sometimes people make huge, damaging generalizations on the internet.  Ignore this and remember that every single person is capable and wonderful.  Every experience and moment in life creates a wonderful flaky pastry of a human.  This is never not special.
 
It's ok to be reserved and keep your thoughts, feelings, and ideas to yourself.  You don't need to prove anything to anyone by sharing your innermost self in search of approval.  You already are wonderful and no one else gets to decide that.
 
Give yourself permission to get lost in your imagination, creating things!  You know you love the creative process, even if it can't get you a job... for now.  Maybe some day! 
 
Stop thinking of how your crappy $10/hour job is a waste of time.  For now, it's a means to an end.  You even think spending time on the things you love is a waste of time and that's not a healthy mindset."
1495,isfj,"You are so right to look to yourself for self esteem, but I think the world is wrong too. 
The anti sensor bias is real, and it just reinforces itself. Why think you are a sensor if you can reasonably deny it and hoard all the positive, creative adjectives to yourself? 
I remember a study that shows significant artistic emphasis in isfjs brain activity. I'll try to find it. 
Also this same painting by an infj and an isfj. Someone in the comments outright can't believe isfjs can be artistic. Like, really? How do you even think all sensors must spend their time, sniffing rocks and cake baking? 
In my opinion memory is so tied to feeling it can be categorized on so many interesting, creative axes. Smh"
1496,isfj,"And don't forget it. Particularly the 'ignore the stereotypes' part. It's so easy to get caught up in that and use it as an excuse, but it doesn't mean that you can't do things that arent stereotypically ISFJ. Keep doing what YOU want. "
1497,isfj,"Yeah, I saw that painting post!  Posts like those (and MBTI communities in general) are great for the discussions they open up, but maybe not so much for making concrete conclusions about large groups of people (for that, you need good experimental design and large sample sizes).
If there's anything science has taught me, it's that it's really really easy to be wrong.  I get surprised all the time in the small ways I've misjudged something when dealing with more black and white subject matter, but there aren't any hard checks on accuracy when analyzing others.  It's so easy to be biased ):
This is the best.
(edited due to awkward phrasing)"
1498,isfj,"It may come down to you taking a look at your values, which is more of an Fi (introverted feeling) thing to do. We, in theory, are pretty good at Fi. What do you value? I’ll give you an example. I value freedom of when and where I work. I want to be outside in the sunshine, and have the option to do so when I  work (ie not stuck in a cube inside all day). I value learning. These are just some. Thus I’m a contractor. I mold my own schedule and choose where I work = freedom to that extent. I learn something new every day I work. Sometimes I’ll take my laptop outside to work. 
What do you value? There’s something out there that captures it. :)"
1499,isfj,"I'm in the same situation and am trying to figure out what job would be the best fit for me. I have a lot of inventory management experience and think that somewhere in Supply Chain may be a good fit but it's hard to know where to look and start. 
Most of my jobs have lasted less than a couple years, a couple less than a year, so I get the vicious circle."
1500,isfj,"I’m in the same situation! I’m in a vicious cycle of getting a job, hating it, quitting after a couple of months, being unemployed for a few months, accepting another terrible job and repeating the process
Ive even changed career paths a few times in a desperate attempt to land a job I like, but to no avail. I accept underpaying jobs I’m overqualified for because of anxiety and self doubt, even though I know I have the skills & ability to be elsewhere. It’s a fun life lol"
1501,isfj,I'm the same way and I have it. I've only ever had a job that later a year but then I was back to the same cycle. Most jobs last like 4-6 months and then I'm done. I want to stop this cycle since my fiance has a successful career and I feel like a burden jumping jobs constantly.
1502,isfj,"I am a 23yo guy ESTP dating a 21yo ISFJ and I need some advice in regards to trying to get my girlfriend to try new things. For example: I exercise and play a lot of sports. I've tried for months to get her to exercise with me and so far no luck. She is fairly athletic and in great shape so I'm not sure what the hang-up is, and when I ask her she doesn't have an answer. Suggestions? "
1503,isfj,"For me it's an issue of nervousness, of feeling scared of walking into a new gym. Maybe show her information on the gym, or specifically say what equipment it has and be like ""you can just go when I go and we can leave whenever you decide--there's an elliptical you could try and a variety of weights to do some arm stuff also!""
Honestly I've been slacking on the gym also, does she have time for the gym? Is she already super busy? "
1504,isfj,"When I make decisions about something, I rely heavily on past precedent, and at age 21 I didn't have a lot of past experience to go on. So you could try telling her about some of the sports and workout activities you do so that it's not such unfamiliar territory. Then you could tell her that you'd really enjoy doing one of those sports/activities with her, but she can pick which one and if she doesn't like a particular one, she doesn't have to do it again.
And don't forget that while some or even many ""no""s may be because it's unfamiliar, others may be because she really doesn't like some element of the activity in question (for example, I don't like competitive things.) So you could say that you want to try some new things together because you like variety, but as with the exercise example, give her a say in which things (for example, you could give her a bunch of suggestions of things you'd like to do and let her pick one) and give her time to find out some information about the new activities in advance."
1505,isfj,"Thanks a bunch, guys, this is really helpful!
She is interning this summer, but only three days per week, so time isn't the issue. 
When I go to the gym I usually follow a pre-made plan. She is a gymnast, so she mostly does cardio or some type of tumbling. I can't actually go to the gym she uses because I'm not a gymnast, otherwise I would just go with her. 
Do you guy think asking her to assist me in the gym would be a good idea? I was thinking about asking her if she could just come to spot me; she wouldn't even have to do the exercises. She is pre-physical therapy, so she would be able to critique my form. Good idea, or insulting?"
1506,isfj,"Ask her to try it at least once and if she doesn't like it, she won't have to do it again. ""Don't knock it till you try it!""
What is her workout routine and can you join her? Take turns picking activities to do together... like she picks zumba and next you pick basketball."
1507,isfj,This is also important. Be clear about what will happen. I personally hate shopping or exercising in a regular gym with people I have to stay side by side with. Coming together and generally doing our own thing is my preference. 
1508,isfj,"Any articles or videos on Si superiority and how to deal with people with it?
What I mean is people who are arrogant in their Si or are close-minded as a result of putting too much stock in their Si, thinking Si is superior to Ne and Ni and that Si is always right.
I'm having trouble finding videos/articles on it. I thought it was worth a shot asking here.
I've met people who are confident in their Si, and they're great people, but I've also met people who are incredibly arrogant in their Si, and they're arrogant pricks. They arrogantly think ""Tradition is always right. You're an idiot if you even question that."" eyeroll with exaggerated smile. They look down upon people that don't use Si as their first or second function, and see them as inferior."
1509,isfj,"try r/mbti
EDIT: barring that, the r/INTJ sub is always willing to circle jerk over other people thinking they're superior, and i suspect the INTP and ENTP subs as well
but yeah on second thought, my ISTJ mother is like this to a t. the biggest example is when I came out to her. she's super conservative, religious, and we don't talk about my sexuality to this day. If and when I have a partner, I'm more than willing to cut her and her bigotry out of holidays, events with any potential grandchildren, the whole works. Not to be nasty, but to protect my partner from it. I guess we'll see if Si continues to uphold tradition when it's preventing you from being in your children's lives."
1510,isfj,"interestingly, I encourage you to bring this to the INFJ sub.  Since Si is damn last in our stack, but conversations are tempered with Fe, you may get interesting anecdotes of Ni vs Si clash without circlejerking.
In my experience, I've never met Si superiority in Dom position.  the ISTJs and ISFJs I've known (lucky me) are all observant, open-minded, communicative people who navigate the world based on their traditions without feeling like imposing these traditions on others.  It's actually Aux Si (ESxJs) that feels pushy.  I've been told by ESFJs and ESTJs what is ""the right way"" to do things, often implying I am not, in fact, doing it the right way XDDDD
I don't mind being looked down upon because it doesn't affect me.  I'm secure enough not to feel threatened if someone is being condescending, so really, someone who looks down their nose at me feels more like they're revealing something about themselves that was much better off being hidden.  It gives me a feeling of insight and power to see someone behave that way, because it reminds me that they were probably once a petulant child--and this petulance has only been adapted, not outgrown."
1511,isfj,"That’s the one thing I’ve found that works with her.
I mentioned how she’ll have no control over me when I move out. Even if she were to get me to say I’ll do what she wants in the future now, I don’t speak for my future self. Any claim I’d make about my future self will have no ground and no backing, because I don’t speak for my future self. I only speak for my present self.
This drove her nuts! It was crazy! She knows I’m right and knows that she could call the cops if she wanted to but that’d it be of no use. I’ve done nothing wrong, so she’d appear like a lunatic to the cops. They have nothing to go by, so the cops wouldn’t take her seriously. She wants to have control over me, but knows she doesn’t have control over future me."
1512,isfj,"Well it gets a lot better once you move out. I still come back to town and stay with her and I love her, but it's a lot easier dealing with parents when they really can't do anything because you're an adult. An adult who isn't financially dependent on them anymore lol."
1513,isfj,"Two things that I find myself doing subconsciously when I'm attracted to someone:


Making an effort to be around them as much as possible, for as long as possible. Calculating excuses to interact with them more often than normal.


Acting exponentially more energetic and social than normal. This is huge. Normally I am more reserved and less talkative at social events, but if someone I'm interested in is around, I find myself acting more extroverted in groups (joking and goofing off, telling stories, and generally taking a more active role in conversating).


These signs of attraction are probably true of most personality types, but with introverts it's a dead giveaway."
1514,isfj,Look for differences. Are they hanging around you more than they are others or are they talking to you more than anyone else because yes if they are initiating conversations with you that is generally a good thing if they are doing the same with everyone else just as often than they probably don't think of you any different than everyone else. Keep in mind this is true for everyone. For ISFJs especially look for if them trying to spend time with you. We love to be in places that are super lively and conversational so if you're providing that than there is a pretty good chance that they like you.
1515,isfj,"We were planning to go and see a clairvoyant and i was surprised because he said he wanted to know something. But i didnt ask why. I find it strange because i might just have influenced him in clairvoyance and predicting the future. He watches what movie or series i recommend, and vice versa. 
He goofs around too and exaggerates when im there. I am sure he likes it when im around. But he keeps on insisting in an indirect manner (i read between the lines because im a sucker for human behavior and mbti is one of them) that we go out together for a purpose. 
Thanks again. Sorry i am not confident in deciphering people even though ive put all my efforts in studying them lol"
1516,isfj,Well he is as far as im concerned. He also listens to my suggestions and vice versa. Im just worried that he doesnt show his bad side to me. To his friends and family he’s lazy and a bully. But he never showed that to me when we’re together
1517,isfj,"Thanks. Lol. Good thing i didnt give any signs that i like him. We only meet for reasons. I could tell he enjoys my company though. But that sign isnt enough, i think. This is actually embarrassing lol but thanks again"
1518,isfj,"I'm definitely agnostic, leaning towards atheist. I was not raised religious at all, so I don't know if I would have different opinions if I had been raised religious. But as much as I'd like to think there's some sort of afterlife, I just can't make myself believe it. It doesn't feel right, in what I imagine is a similar way to how faith does feel right to others. I'm keeping my options open, but I have a hard time seeing how my opinions would change."
1519,isfj,Me—I used to be an atheist but I have embraced agnosticism in the last couple years. I absolutely do not have blind faith in things. I like to know why things work the way they do. I think my Ti is pretty well developed
1520,isfj,"I kind of believe in God, but I'm also not like a super believer and my beliefs may eventually change. I'm unfortunately rather superstitious despite being very logical (like, seriously brain?), so basically I guess that's where it comes from. 😅"
1521,isfj,"I'm an atheist. I was raised religious, but as a teenager gradually stopped believing in the Christian god, then eventually lost faith in any spiritually. It came from a place of reading and studying large parts of the Bible, as well as getting really interested in science."
1522,isfj,"I just seen both sides of conflict I mean atheists and theists. They can discuss whole years and using the best arguments and they won't ever figure it out any conclusion. 
There is no proof to either say God exists or not in any shape or form. Believing or not believing is just matter of choice. That's why I am agnostic because I don't believe any of side."
1523,isfj,"Traditions are good. Imagine that theists are the only thing in this brave new world that promotes tradition and some old fashion working patterns. Politicians suck at it and they change their mind every month but churches hold still to this day.
Confirming existence of God is theist."
1524,isfj,"I broke up from a pretty long term relationship with an INFP and I am NOT coping. The reasons were because we are young and commitment is really intense at this age we both are going down different paths in our lives... you get the point. He seems to be moving forward so well, but I just really don't know what to do without that segment of my life. I feel really lost and pointless on my own?? I struggle to make decent friends who I can connect with on the level I want to connect. He has been really the only person I've had a deep connection with in my whole life, so its hard to let that go. He wants to stay friends, and of course thats what I'm doing at the moment because I'm clinging on to every last piece I can. But i know i should probably just cut him off, right? But how am I supposed to do that? I feel like I can't move on"
1525,isfj,"I was in your shoes a couple of months ago OP! ISFJ's are really feeling people and that type of ""betrayal"" from someone we invested everything into just hurts. I feel like an INFP will look at the facts and it helps them move on quicker. Speaking from experience, going NC for as long as you need and immersing yourself in something else helps. Do you have any friends you can talk to? I actually strengthened a couple of my friendships bc I leant on them while I was in a bad place and it made our bond that much stronger. I was like dead on the inside for a month but now I'm doing better than I was my whole relationship, at least mental wealth wise :) if you need to talk my inbox is open!"
1526,isfj,"I was in a 5 year relationship myself , it ended about 3 years ago , the best thing I can tell you is what I would do , for me keeping in touch with someone that I just broke up with doesn't work, I would always want to do something that makes him love me again and want to get together so it would drain me it's better for me to just cut it off and don't look back , talk to your close friends your best friend and just move on , yes you'll still think about him all the time but time heals soon it won't hurt so bad , if you ever want to talk just message me , best of luck "
1527,isfj,"I'm seconding the other opinions - it's better to just cut him off. It doesn't have to be an angry, toxic breakup, just explain him politely that you need to move on and staying friends doesn't help. As ISFJ you might feel guilty to do such a thing - try to fight it off. 
I went through something similar (although it was a bit more complicated and toxic) and somehow I felt obliged to keep in touch with her. Looking back to all of it, I see I was too submissive and lacking self-respect. Once I realized I don't have to do this, and that I wasn't owing her anything, I managed to get free and improve as a person.
Do you feel very dependent on others? Perhaps you should take some time and try to find yourself. Do the things you like on your own, find some hobbies, learn to enjoy your own company. This sounds awfully cliched, but I found it to be a solid advice, regardless of MBTI type. Don't repress your suffering, it's ok to feel like this, but don't wallow in it more than necessary. Ultimately you need to learn to enjoy yourself again, and to love yourself just a little more than the others. People are drawn to other happy and confident people."
1528,isfj,"That's really a loaded incentive, everyone reacts differently when coping with their first big break up and personality types can give you a probability for how to cope but it's a personal journey. I remember my first break up, and I too felt that void of pointless direction. It's easier to face the challenges in life when you have a solid assist, but I put myself in a scenario where I knew this could end up as a possibility.
I began thinking about how big the world is and how many others must feel the exact same way but just don't ever say shit cause it's an awkward subject. Eventually I found coping mechanisms, like trying out new things, that was about the time I started parkour picked up rollerblading again. I came to terms with the fact that the relationship did not define me and friendships literally come and go. Even your childhood friends will cater to their own life in time. It's a melancholy emotion when you do come to terms with it, and you will realize you do not want to be dependent on anything but your own will.
So my best tips would be, yes distance yourself from that which you know you do not want. Embrace the despair and use your own intuition to rebuild the process that got you into that flaw of character. Make time to dedicate to doing something new, ask strangers questions, get a feel of how it would be to be the other person you are not at this moment. You never know, you might like that person. "
1529,isfj,"Honestly? This is not the healthy response I'm sure, but I usually just remind myself it's my fault anyway for being basically a hermit and hunker down with a good distraction. Trying to reach out to people and having awkward, shallow interactions just makes me feel worse, so I keep to myself, and probably will continue to do so until I feel capable of being a better friend. "
1530,isfj,"I may not be the best example because I have many friends and I think I rarely ever feel truly lonely. However, there are some nights or weekends where everyone is doing something and I have nothing to do but stay at home and pass the time. Thoughts start running through my head like, why does no one want to spend time with me? I'm just worthless? I'm so needy, I can't even go a weekend without hanging out with my friends. On these nights I think I feel lonely, but in reality I probably am quite needy, and I'm so used to hanging out with them every week that when I don't, I start questioning everything. 
I think true loneliness isn't necessarily about having no friends or no one in your life to talk to. I don't know your situation but, loneliness can happen when you feel there's no one you can be honest with or genuine. I have experienced this before where I have many friends and I hang out with them a lot, but none of them give me the opportunity to vent, to say how I truly feel and to have that be reciprocated in the same conversation. This may be an isfj thing or just a human thing, but I crave connection. I hate small talk, and I love those deep personal one on one conversations you can have with other people. It's in those moments that the feeling of loneliness flies out the window, and so I always strive to reach that in friendships. 
Like I said before, I don't know much about your situation. If you don't have many friends I would say try and put yourself out there, the usual things like go to places and join clubs etc where you think it might give you an opportunity to socialise. After that that, you just need to follow it up by asking to hang out some weekend. I would also say, try to just be yourself, people love genuine people and if you're a sound guy/gal you will attract friends like a magnet. 
If you do have friends but you feel you have no one to be honest with, try to maybe get one of your closest friends by themselves. This will give you an opportunity to hang out and talk on a more personal level, and if they're a good friend they'll welcome that. 
On the topic of temporarily coping with loneliness, occupy yourself. Make sure you have something to do, whether that's chores in the house, weekly shopping, or more leisurely activities like reading a book or playing a game. Try to distract your mind so that you won't think about those negative self pitying thoughts that won't do you any good. If you live with your family, maybe try to hang out with them, or atleast talk to them, once again I don't know your situation.
This is just a little bit of advice from someone who really hasn't felt true loneliness much in his life, however, everyone does at some stage. It's just something to expect in life, especially these days when it's so easy to fall into its grasp. Although it might seem difficult to connect with people, once you put yourself out there and try to connect with them, you'll realise that connection is all they ever wanted, it's all anyone ever wanted. We are not much different when it comes to basic human needs. "
1531,isfj,"I like my alone time, a lot. But yes, I go through bouts of loneliness too but the lonelier I get, the more I want to be by myself. It's almost like I have to sort it out myself and I feel like a burden to someone if I go out with them in my bout of loneliness. It wouldn't be fair anyway because even if I manage to find someone to hang out with, by the time I drive home, I'm still feeling lonely and as I'm spending time with them, I still feel lonely so what's the point? Might as well hunker down on my own and go through it since it will pass in time."
1532,isfj,"This is such a difficult question, I don’t even really know an answer to it myself. Every time I feel extremely lonely, I just feel like losing my mind and keep thinking how I’m going to get rid of this feeling, but I guess I just do things that I like and focus on them. Or if you have some friends, try to talk to them and if they don’t seem interested, do what makes you feel good. Maybe get to know new people on the internet. I barely feel lonely because I often enjoy being alone, but when I do, it makes me feel really anxious. "
1533,isfj,"I'm a textbook case of the Si-Ti loop, so basically I deal with it by spending all of my time alone focused on various distractions, instead of dealing with it in a healthy way lol. I know I need to develop my Fe if I ever want to feel any better, but that's too scary and I don't know how to begin lol"
1534,isfj,"The answer is simple : how one who doesn't could look like ? That means no good.
It appears in Maslow's pyramid of need. It may be a higher tier need, but it's one nonetheless.
What happened if one is the villain of his own story ? Bad guys don't have friends for a really simple reason : being genuine isn't enough.
That advice works for any type. It means it's a really good ones.
Though, one could be at loss about what's distracting enough.
Aaaaaand that's the proof you really downplayed your whole message by humility.
You could go, ""as a human being, that's how I do"", but you preferred go ""I'm not sure it's ISFJ or human, or if it even works, but here it is.""
It's a really good advice, and I'm just cynically nitpicking on it. Wear it : it's something you'd be proud of."
1535,isfj,"My family and my close friends are living far away right now. And I have no pets. I feel lonely at home and can't even push myself to read a book or a project, because I fear I'll be lonelier at the end. Thanks for your advice. I'll be looking into clubs."
1536,isfj,"This part?

1537,isfj,"This part? 
""Si-Ti loop dynamics: concocts convoluted “logical” rationales to avoid confronting insecurities and to justify staying within excessively narrow comfort zones -"
1538,isfj,"Why do you think ""bad guys"" don't have friends? They often have plenty of friends, mostly because they have confidence, and that attracts people to them, even if they're terrible people deep down inside. You don't really need to be ""genuine"" as long as you're sufficiently confident."
1539,isfj,"I'm an insidious evil, meant to undermine nearly everything. No confidence.
Also, being loud and attracting people doesn't mean any closeness. Maybe they have some entourage, but nobody gets ever really close.
Be genuine means being vulnerable. I think it's vulnerability the key."
1540,isfj,"Currently, I will be a college senior. I have moved from major to major. I feel like I don't know what I am passionate about or what my talents are. A major in undergrad I've learned is meaningless and only is successful if you make the most of it. Only yourself and more schooling can change that for a career. Anyway. I am struggling to figure out what career path or school trajectory to follow. Thoughts. I've taken many personality tests and they all say spot on I am an isfj! "
1541,isfj,"I was/kinda am in the same boat as you. Started as an English major, didn't take really any English classes the first year. Then switched to environmental studies as I happened to take an intro class in that and liked it. Then switched to environmental science at my INTJ mom's request/demand. And now I've graduated and am looking for jobs in the environmental science/education field. 
Honestly I still don't feel incredibly passionate about what I do, but I do enjoy my job to some extent. I always figured I'd be better at some random office job--low key, low stress, no decision-making... 
Still not completely sure where I'll end up. Good luck finding something, what is your current major? "
1542,isfj,You might look into any resources your college provides as far as career exploration options. Mine offers a combo MBTI and Strong interest inventory test that helped inspire me to try to figure out what I want to do. I'm also going to be a college senior this year but it is yet to be seen if I know what I'm doing or not haha.
1543,isfj,"Hi iphoneanonymous,
I'm an ISFJ employment counsellor who works in a liberal arts institution.  Basically, I help my students market themselves to prospective employers to get the jobs that they want!
You've obviously taken a few personality tests (otherwise, how would you know you are an ISFJ?) but have you checked out your institution's career services centre?  I would echo DolphinShades' suggestion.  
Hopefully, your institution can give you some one-on-one guidance in how to start. There's no quick answers to this: it's a process of self-exploration and trying things out.  Usually, career centres have assessments that do take into consideration your skills, your interests and your values to see where those intersect.  That information, combined with labour market information (knowing which jobs are in demand or are in over-supply)  would be a starting point to start looking up specific jobs that might interest you.  Then you could start researching further into those fields (meeting people who do those jobs for a living, etc).
I'm also hearing that you're concerned about your skills.  I can assure you that you DO have skills.  I see liberal arts student after student in my office, and they all think that they no skills to offer an employer.  Each one walks away from our meeting with several skills that they can express on a resume.  As a starting point, I would suggest using this checklist http://www.southwestern.edu/live/files/118 to start thinking about the skills that you have to offer.  I always use this checklist as a launching-off point to talk about student skills before we begin work on resumes.
The thing with Liberal Arts degrees is that it's sold as a package.  No employer really cares what you've majored in (with a few notable exceptions, including Journalism).  They care more about the skills that you learned and the experiences that you've had.  Hopefully this will help you in your career/employment journey!"
1544,isfj,"Okay interesting. On your end what kind of envrionmental science do you enjoy. I took one environmental ethics class and I got a good grade and enjoyed it! Have you ever thought about teaching? Or is that not your thing? In some areas teaching fits ISFJ. 
I started off as a Communications major. I love sports and baseball. I thought I would go into journalism! Although I wasn't passionate about  broadcast journalism. And I didn't see a career in print journalism (to me its a dying industry-which to me includes online blogging, etc.) 
My roommate is a business major. I've always gotten good grades in Marketing but don't really like that. I took an intro to information systems class and liked it but don't see where it will help me end up. I couldn't get a degree because of majoring so late in it/Calculus I)
Long story short- I am  a Political Science major and am miserable. Law school-idk. I've been told consulting and I went over to /r/consulting and I got berated to just google it if I wanted help. "
1545,isfj,"I enjoy teaching but it can really wear me out depending on the context. I taught a weekly homeschool class and k would have nightmares the night before about it going wrong because each class was something new (until I got used to it). I enjoy doing field trips where school groups come in and I teach the same 20min station a few times (means I really know I won't mess up bc I've done it so many times).
So ideally I'd like to do some teaching but teach the same thing multiple times rather than a new class each day. Too much room for error doing something new each day haha. 
I can't see myself being a communications major, altho I did take a class in it and liked it. But I can't see myself doing it as a career. 
Yeah... My mom is pushing me to take the LSAT and depending on how I do I'll go to lawschool. Idk about it either but my family wants me to be the next Robert Kennedy or something like that. So I'm trying it for them.
Ideally career-wise, I think I'd like something much different but I have no idea where I'll end up in a few years. "
1546,isfj,"I was there at /r/consulting watching the shit show. You know why you got berated, you literally did't ask anything but ""How do I get in"". 
If you had looked at other people's posts who have asked similar things, they include background about their situation and had put a little fucking effort in. You wanted everyone else to ask you the information you should have included in your fucking post. If you had read a single other post in that subreddit or even used the search bar you'd have half a good idea of how to form a good question. If you ever went to office hours you'd fine that telling your professor ""I don't get it"" is a pretty bad question, usually ""I have difficulty understanding how we derived 2x from x^2"". But go on, think that it is everyone else.
The reason why they're so vitriolic is that day in, day out consultants deal with morons who are too stupid to wipe their own asses. I'm not just talking about the clients, I'm talking about the interns, the first year analysts and anyone else too dumb enough to work a little for what they want to know. 
So you want some real fucking advice about consulting you could probably do a throwaway and reask with some god damn background. With your half assed degree, probably political consulting in Washington DC or perhaps one of the Big4's federal groups that deal with long government contracts could be viable. "
1547,isfj,"Like this?..So yeah I fucked up big time... It was poorly done and out of laziness and bad reddiquette!. The thing that makes the sense is the professor comparison. 
I don't need some throwaway account. Just post another restating facts and appropriate background about consulting before posting generalizations. 
Mind my asking: Whats your experience in the field (consulting)/ experiences with Isfj personality(obviously you are one? or just searching through subs?"
1548,isfj,"It isn't even about reading the FAQ. That would help but you'd had gotten more help if you provided even a couple paragraphs about your situation. You aren't the first with a question about a poli sci degree, but you got worst answer because you asked the worst way.
Consulting is a funny business and albeit I'm relatively green only a year and a half. Everyone will tell you introverts make poor consultants. I'd disagree to a certain extent. I'm not friends with everyone who I work with, but I tend to find two or three good people to weather the storm with. I focus on making solid connections that will last past this job. It is tough to get out there and out of your shell but I find if you do it enough you can go on auto pilot. Do enough interviews until your introduction is solid and you can recite it off the cuff. 
As an introvert I'd rather invest in the few people I connect with than a dozen exchangeable copies.
No personality is a dead end and connecting deeply and personally is a huge a strength. 
I spent three months as a door to door salesman and I swear that more than any other job has made me contemplate suicide. But it forced me to be able to generate a conversation and once I did my intro I would try and find something to connect on a personal level with. 
I'm not saying consulting isn't for you. But whatever you end up doing, research it and put some fucking effort in. You get out what you put in."
1549,isfj,"And I'm very grateful we finally figured it out together! It's opened my eyes to the way that her mind works (this is for all of you as well!) I can now try to be more understanding of her weaknesses, and more appreciative of her strengths. The biggest strength that comes to my mind is her ability to support me/make me feel supported like no one else can. I think it's great that she's able to always lift me up into a position I feel comfortable leading from.
I appreciate her greatly, but I can't verbalize it very well; God forbid my mom ask ""what do you like about her?"" again. I'm not the very good at conceptualizing emotions in any way other than logically (I just posted on r/ISTP about this lol; it's a screenshot of our texts one day)"
1550,isfj,"I can't say that it worked but I ran into two ENFPs while dating and they both irritated the shit out of me.
They were both really nice, interesting and had a lot of energy. The problem was when something didn't go the way they wanted it resulted in very sudden swing of mood to anger or unreasonable behavior.
One of them was hungry during a city trip and asked me to get her fries. We managed to buy fries and I headed to our destination to eat them there. But she wanted to have them immediately. We were standing on the sidewalk somewhere and it was only 500m to where we could sit in a park on a bench. When I refused and asked her to come with me she started walking slower and 10m behind me, looking at the ground, kicking stones. She was like a damn toddler.
Yes, I get that you're hungry and I really, really want to help you but please be an adult while I try.
In the end it was too much dealing with big reactions over small irritations which gets me into alarm mode. Also this can be over as quick as it came. Give the girl a hand full of peanuts and she will start smiling and dancing around again. But the conflict sticks with me as ISFJ. I get super concerned and need to calm down for much longer.
If you want to make it work then make sure to create a game plan for when one of you gets irritated/triggered. Teach each other to recognise it and how to deal with it."
1551,isfj,"Hi! Makes 7 years that I am together with my ENFP. At first we struggled a little, mainly due to my difficulty of understanding and transmitting my emotions and also my constant need of attention. For me to understand his deep, complex and confuse mind was (and sometimes still is) difficult. He always have a broader way to see things, while I try to keep them simple (this dfference is good, but can cause disagreements some times).
What contribues to the stability of our relationship is look to detect and solve any problem (for smaller that it may seem) as fast as we can, without affraid of exposing the deepest toughts, and willing to do the best to understand the other's reasons.
The key is look for attend the needs of the other, and try to understand the limits of your companior in accomplishg yours."
1552,isfj,"So my friends and I all think I'm an ISFJ, because a lot of the stuff I've read says ""yeah, that's me"" but I've never gotten that on the Briggs - Meyer, got ISFP and oddly enough ENFP. So, no... I don't even get along with myself! Ha!"
1553,isfj,"ENFP male married to ISFJ woman
Does it work?  Any combination can be made to work...  Although ot feels more so like we are roommates with kids... I'm bored a lot.   She is content hanging around the house where that drives me crazy.   She is supportive though.  So that's another positive. "
1554,isfj,"I know of two ENFP-ISFJ marriages, in first the ENFP is the woman and ISFJ is the man, in second ENFP is the man and ENFP is the woman. In socionics this relationship is described as ""semi-duality"" which is ranked as one of the better type matches: Love Types for ISFJs. As to why this doesn't happen more often? Perhaps because both are feelers and sometimes relationships between F-types can start feeling like friendships, but they can certainly be supportive for each other."
1555,isfj,"This feeling that there is always something going on really exists, but for this don't turn into a problem the dialogue is fundamental and to be open and willing to discover what is happening. As an ISFJ the first impulse is to ignore this feeling and just keep going. But you need to chase the origin, be connected to your partner and understand that every little thing can be huge for the other person, and if it is important to her it must be for you too."
1556,isfj,"5 years with my ISFJ. I really like Bbrrfs post as it shows something pretty important:
ISFJs have a strong urge to preserve outer peace (their environment) and are willed to internalize issues for a while until it becomes too much.
ISFJs often don't want to bother anyone with what they are concerned about, you could say they shield you from any negative emotions.
ENFPs need their inner self to be at peace, to bottle up and internalize the problem does the very opposite.
ENFPs might even see this shielding as a sign of  lacking trust or not caring enough.
A good example is an ISFJ turning off the lights  after an argument and be asleep within minutes while the ENFP sits upright in bed and will possibly face a sleepless night. "
1557,isfj,"Hey, Bbrrfs, just a quick heads-up:
realy is actually spelled really. You can remember it by two ls.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
1558,isfj,"I don't understand that. Are you saying that ISFJs tend ignore other people's feelings? Because that doesn't sound like ISFJ at all.
My problem was rather that I got way too invested in their up and down feelings. If my partner gets worked up about something that is major for me. The sane reaction would be to wait until their first freak out is gone and see what happened but that would be quite difficult for me.
Anyways, this was obviously highly anecdotal and I also wasn't in a relationship with either of them. We were just seeing each other."
1559,isfj,"I didn't mean that. Is more due to the practical and literal way of seeing things, that is opposite of ENFPs. More in that way... sorry if I didn't make it clear.
For me, this can be the reason why they get so impredicteble for ISFJs, because for many times their nuances can pass unoticed trought us, even if it is not our intention."
1560,isfj,"I didn't know ISFJ was a personality type until I took a personality test last week. It helps me to make so much sense of the way I think, particularly with regards to the things that bother me and can easily hurt me.
My question to you is: do you find it difficult to be genuine and authentic, to fully express yourself, as an ISFJ? Not in a deceitful sense, but more due to self-sacrifice and self-imposed standards
I can't find where I read a excerpt on this question at the moment. I'll try and find the source later on though.
Edit: I believe I may have drawn this idea from the quote, ""ISFJs are most attractive when they are simply being themselves in a comfortable environment such as work, where their natural flow shows this kindness and dedication."""
1561,isfj,"I'm glad you brought this up!  I relate so strongly to so many ISFJ characteristics, but I also read about how they seem to be the type that adjust their personality to the situation which strikes people as un-authentic.
To answer your question, yes, I do have a hard time being myself in front of certain types of people.  I have a really corny sense of humor and I love deep discussions about feelings and other non-manly things that my male engineering coworkers would never want to talk about :) I guess I've just accepted the fact that I don't need to feel comfortable around every person in the world.  As long as I have those people in my personal life, that's all that matters."
1562,isfj,"Yeah, I do tend to change my personality around certain people, for sure.  It depends on the person how much I change and what changes, but I do change for sure.  About the only part that stays the same is the crying at the drop of a hat part and the overly-protective part... both of which cause me serious problems in my day-to-day life on a regular basis."
1563,isfj,"Man, your words are real encouraging. I get what you mean by different groups of people. It is so easy to act different and such an fulfilling when you know you can be yourself around others. 
Thank you for your answer.  "
1564,isfj,"I have a bit the same, although I don't really see it as not being myself, but more as different versions of myself. Let say I show 80% of myself and depending on the situation it can be different parts. Some personalities also seem to be in contradiction with other personalities.
I can really appreciate being alone and I don't like most family events (some people, including my dad, doesn't understand how they can be exhausting for me, but my sister for example does). With sports however I can be very energetic, enthusiastic and seeking a bit the centre of attention since it's my passion. At one of the sports I give training once a week which I love to do and automatic puts me in the centre of attention, but at some others I'm just doing my own thing.
Some people also simply don't interest me and then I prefer not talking above the fake interest. This happens especially when I know that I will never see that person again such as on a party."
1565,isfj,"Nah man, I think you're onto something. It is so much easier to handle when you know what will affect you in a certain way. Obviously we can't control how others will act so it's likely people will disappoint us or hurt us. That's just how life is. But we can definitely be careful to keep our minds in check by being aware, like you said, so that our reactions don't take us by surprise. 
I appreciate the conversation. Thank you for sharing with it with me. It's not easy talking about these sort of insecurities. "
1566,isfj,"Hi everyone!I'm an INFJ who has a good friend that is possible an ISFJ. He's going through some tough times and I was wondering what you guys appreciate hearing or wanting when you're going through something. What are the little things that make a difference when talking to someone? Also, how do you guys express if you like someone's company? I'm afraid that my INFJ-ness is a bit overwhelming as I like to ask deep questions, do you ISFJ's hate that?
Thanks in advance! Sorry for the overload of questions haha"
1567,isfj,"For me personally, I will usually not volunteer much (if any) information unless the other person takes an active interest and asks those deep/tough questions. I really love deep conversations, but I am HORRIBLE at starting them, so I definitely appreciate people who have a knack for that. However, if you are not one of my ""people,"" my select few, I am likely to deflect those questions in an attempt to get the focus of the conversation off of me. So basically a lot will depend on how close you two are. 
And as far as ""the little things that make a difference"" -- listen, tell them that you care, and NEVER invalidate their feelings (we do that enough inside our own heads). "
1568,isfj,"Not a fan of being asked deep questions and feeling like I need to have a specific answer... I use a lot of ""I don't know, why don't you google it?"" bc google is smarter than me.
For me, I just want to know someone cares about me and is thinking about me. Texts like ""Hi, I just wanted to say I love you and hope you have a good day!"" or ""Hi, I thought about you when I saw this :)""
I like reassurance a lot as well. If I'm feeling down I'm usually being very harsh on myself so I want someone to say, ""You know, I just want to tell you what a wonderful friend you are to have! You mean so much to me."" Because honestly knowing other people are happy with me makes me feel better.
Just be there and let them know you are there. I have a lot of trouble asking for help, but if it is offered to me I might accept it... I won't ask for a lifevest to be thrown to me but if I see one nearby I might try it on of that makes sense."
1569,isfj,"It depends on person to person, but let them just pour out everything if they feel comfortable. As an ISFJ myself, I tend to keep all of my problems to myself and when it's too much it gets bad. Basically just talking it out should help alot. Of course depends on your relationship and how open they are. Let them talk, don't try to expand on their thoughts but let them do it instead. "
1570,isfj,"I would say that you should absolutely use your INFJ strengths to help your friend. 
I have a very close INFJ friend that I can always talk to whenever I'm going through something tough, and it always offers me new insights that I have a lot of trouble coming to on my own. I find that I often get stuck in these loops when I'm trying to resolve my own personal conflicts and INFJs seem to be able to work past these. It needs to be done lovingly enough, as exposing myself that much can leave me feeling very vulnerable. If your friend really does open up to you, then they have an immense trust. If you violate that they will not forget. They might be able to get over it on the surface and it might seem like it has disappeared, but they very likely won't share that type of information with you anymore. "
1571,isfj,Yes! I also feel like ISFJs believe that they're right alot of the time because of their Si. They are attentive to the small details(of people especially) so let them feel like their side is the right side(to your judgement). 
1572,isfj,"I’ve been dating an ISFP male for a couple months now and here are my takeaways:
PROS
- we click really well and compliment each other. He is far more relaxed than I am and helps me chill out. I am organized and diligent and get help him get shit done. 
- I love how physically affectionate he is with me. It’s perfect 
- Great sense of humor 
- We mentally jive super well and are on the same level. He is very easy to be around 
CONS 
- he’s not as driven and ambitious as I am 
- Struggles with commitment and defining the relationship (which was really tough for me at first and I think something ISFJs find frustrating. We like to know what to expect). 
- Difficult to have serious conversations about us bc he doesn’t always “understand his feelings” 
- Generally a slow thinker and speaker. They like to mull things over for a while, whereas I tend to think fast and if I’m in a comfortable environment (such as with a partner) I’m a fast talker too. He struggles to keep up. "
1573,isfj,"I suspect I’m dating an ISFP. We’ve been together for about 6 months; there are ups and downs, and I’m not sure if it’s gonna work out long-term. I feel very comfortable with him and find him easy to get along and joke with, and we’re both very physically affectionate, which is nice. We tend to stay in when we hang out, but when we do get out of the house, we have a good time. 
However, he’s got a lot on his plate and much of it involves his close friends, so I tend to take a back seat 95% of the time and don’t see him very often. The time we spend together is usually really good, but he’s very passive, especially in letting friends and family rule his schedule, and hasn’t found an effective way of carving out time for me yet. It bothers me a lot due to my desire for consistent, attentive expressions of affection, so although I like and admire him very much as a person, I’m not sure it’s going to work out in a romantic sense. "
1574,isfj,"Thank you so much for your comment! I can already see similar things about the communication with us :D Nothing that would be a dealbreaker though :) I just notice that im usually the one carrying the conversation and being the one talking, he usually just listens. I need to learn ways to include him better. "
1575,isfj,"Wow, came back to these comments now after a month, I'm together with the dude and things are looking great!
Your comment just really stood out to me, I can now more than ever relate to being the more extroverted and assertive one! I made a shopping list so we'd breeze through the store quick, after we were done he was like ""oh my god that was like real life porn, not having to make decisions and getting out so fast!""
I'm usually not good with decision making especially if it involves other people but that side of me is getting stronger now that I'm with him. Its a completely new feeling to me, I'm used to just being the one following other people's choices :D"
1576,isfj,":) so happy to hear it’s going well. How old are you btw? I’m 25 and my ISFP is 34. The funniest thing happened last night....we were in the car and he was trying to explain something to me, and mulling it over trying to figure out the best way to say it and I just kept chiming in trying to help him finish what he was trying to say. He got frustrated and eventually was like “will you just shut up for a sec” and we both burst out laughing. It’s so funny for my bc I’m NEVER the person that’s talking over someone or cutting people off. But with him I do sometimes 🙈"
1577,isfj,"isfj's have Ti child and that makes them believe in their own thinking rather that group thinking for example Te trickster makes them unaware of it,,, and believe in their own thinking!:0! while ISFP's have Ne trickster ,,, that makes them unaware of the intentions of other people."
1578,isfj,"We were in college, my roommate was dating one of his friends. Our friend groups merged and hung out watching movies on the weekends, and Husband and I chatted online quite a bit (this was in the AIM days).
I suspect Husband is an ISTJ, he's a programmer. I'm a data nerd."
1579,isfj,"Met my INTJ during junior year of college. We are in very different majors, but had a mutual DungeonMaster friend. One day I'm lighting up and doing jello-shots during a dungeon mission and this cute guy walks into the apartment. Someone in my DnD group said ""Hey, you both play League of Legends -- you should exchange summoner names."" So I gave him my summoner name on an old receipt, he added me on there, I sent very suggestive messages to him over the course of a few weeks and then he came over to ""watch a movie"" at my place ;)
I find it is much easier for me to talk and express myself honestly online and I have met all 3 of my SOs in the interwebz. And in line with the generic ISFJ descriptor my first SO was abusive. But third time's the charm!"
1580,isfj,"My boyfriend is an istp and we met through a mutual friend. We started off as friends first and we've been dating for almost three years now. It was a bit difficult at first because he is not very emotional so it was easy to assume he didn't care. He does care, but in other ways...he likes to build and fix things. He noticed I had no bed frame, so he built me one :)  "
1581,isfj,"I have trouble expressing myself when I'm upset, mostly because I'm quietly terrified that everything I do is just gonna be the last straw, and that has nothing to do with him I've just lost him once I know how much I hated my life without him. And he sometimes has trouble understanding where I'm coming from or sometimes he's just insensitively blunt which makes it feel like he doesn't care. 
Luckily my bff is also dating an intp so I can al her all of my questions about what the heck is going on. "
1582,isfj,"Conflicts. Yes. But because I'm willing to learn and want to understand, I listen...a lot. I haven't mastered the ability to change my own way of seeing things, though. It's like I can see both sides...you know? Like the old phrase, there's more than one way to skin a cat. Except there really is only one ""efficient"" way and more often than not I choose the easiest way possible. It's still a huge challenge for both of us but I definitely see the benefits that come with an intj (or in this one anyway). And I'd be a fool to let my SF have the last word. I've never had a more rewarding relationship. I find it amazing how this intj sees the potential in others who can't or won't see it in themselves but repeatedly tries to set them on the right path. Oftentimes, to no avail. Including myself but thankfully, patience is in huge abundance here. It's a learning and growing experience. I wouldn't trade it for anything. "
1583,isfj,"i'm ""with"" an ISFJ female, and it's very hit and miss, communication is always the stumbling block.  If that passes then it can be warm and cozy, but if that fails even once, it triggers the FiTe ""Bitch Slap"" response mode, which takes a few days to get around.  NF - SJ relations are tough imho, it takes a lot of work and calmness on both sides, especially with the ENFP as we hate be ""tied down"" and doing the same thing over and over again.  its the Dominant functions in reverse, which cause all the stress.... the ENFP just wants more and more ideas and to talk about everything (even if its utter crap), whilst the ISFJ just wants stability and to know that everything is going to be okies without the explosion of the brainstorming creates.
Also Strong Fi and Strong Fe collide head on as well.
Tl;Dr  ENFP - ISFJ relationships take a heck of a lot of work on both sides especially wrt communication"
1584,isfj,Yes I find I am also open to new ideas. But I have been told by NT in my life that they much rather me come to that conclusion myself rather then having them have to point it out. Have to work on developing that inferior Ne of mine.
1585,isfj,"Thank you for your insight, this is interesting. Fe is about harmony over strict values and authenticity, while Fi is about values and authenticity over harmony. It is true that ISFJ want stability, but they are also open to change when they feel that they are comfortable enough. "
1586,isfj,"Haaai !
I did mistyped as an INTP, before.
To say it simply, INTPs are world builders and passionate experts, ENTPs are playful entertainers and covert nerds.
Really prepare yourself for a lot of casual shitpost on /r/entp 
And /r/INTP just learned how to make a centralized DAE post. Crippling overspecialization in action ! =D"
1587,isfj,"Oh geez. That sounds like a nightmare to me! XD  Ugh. That's something that we need to be taught. I just don't think it comes naturally. How do you ""figure"" that out? My intj SO is so good at explaining things and has a way of making me see things much more clearly and intelligently. And in doing that, repeatedly mind you, it's helped me to recognize when I'm slipping back into old habitual thought processes. Had I not been given the information to learn how to develop that I'd still be were I was years ago. And I'm still a work in progress. "
1588,isfj,"Yes, Myers Briggs is simply a tool, not a label. A person can change personality types several times throughout his or her lifetime. However, each type has a different focus on their cognitive functions so changing from ISFJ to ESFJ is no simple matter. I encourage you to read about it!"
1589,isfj,"I've subscribed to it a while ago. =D
I laughed hard when I saw that post earlier today. It reminded me all the shitty DAEs I used to read there.
/r/entp is really a lively place. But quite a majority of us like offensive humor, and silly debates.
It takes a bit of time to most non ENTP people to get used to it. I felt at home the first time I went there."
1590,isfj,Understanding and willingness to think outside the box is definitely the key. We grow up being spoon fed all sorts of information that may or may not be true. Intj' s are truth seekers. I won't say they're perfect but they really want to find true answers not just blogger b.s.
1591,isfj,"I think I'll have to take a ticket, and get in the line, before earning any validation.
I can relate to most of them, but they have hard time accepting me as one of them, most of the time.
It's either I bend in front of the social order, or I remain excluded.
I don't know what to do.
I just got told I was an INFP. It's still far better than bing called of AIDS or of dense imbecile. But it makes no sense to me.
I don't understand why I can't just be listened to and be told I'm not a freak of nature.
An unspeakable annoyance. Foreign."
1592,isfj,There are outliners in every type you don't need to fit into a box. As you age you grow and develop other functions and even Jung himself said in a lifetime we will change types. At the end of the day it's just a tool to help you understand yourself and how to interact with others. I think as social creatures we all search for a group that we belong to but finding one person that is willing to listen is enough. 
1593,isfj,"My brother is an ENFJ and we've had a pretty close relationship for a long time. Despite me being the older brother, I never tried to do the whole older brother dominance thing. I tried to have an equal relationship (we're 1.5 years apart) and make things as fair as possible and he always respected that.
We even moved out together for the first time for a little over a year to get used to independence (we both lived with parents for a long time) and it was fun to learn together. 
It's an interesting dynamic he was a lot better at long term planning and socializing with others and I was better at the smaller things. 
For example, he set up ideas for convienent watching of shows we like, shared account for paying paying bills, new stuff to cook, doing research on proper insurances, etc.
On the other hand, I tended to drive more since I had a hybrid (and he likes driving even less than me), I set up the shows and schedule/queue to watch, Im a lot more naturally good with directions, there's a few foods I was better than cooking than him so he trusted me with those, and I'm a lot better at managing money than him.
He's a lot more of a natural with people so he made lots of friends easily but it was good to see how an ENFJ thinks of people when they dont have to do the whole Fe being nice to everyone thing and how much a person can really get on their nerves.
Funnily enough, my brother started dating an ISFJ girl and I think they're great for each other. I'm also close with his girlfriend and we treat other like siblings and we have similarities in terms of personality and viewpoints and humor styles. I feel like I might have influenced my brother to have a thing for (healthy) ISFJs because ever since he started dating his ISFJ girlfriend he's had less motivation to interact with other people even on social media (which is how they met and my brother was actually more popular than her on Instagram by far)
My boss at my previous company was an ENFJ and I really respect him since he was always a forward thinker and he was great for helping me move forward and get more confident in my career.
I go to him for advice in my field from time to time and I like his positivity, open mindedness and knowledge.
Sadly the company I worked with him as a boss decided to close down the department and I can't work with him or the other cool employees anymore (but this new company I work at is great too).
That said, as you can tell I've had VERY good with experience with ENFJs and now they're one my favorite types."
1594,isfj,"I'm another ENFJ who is dating an ISFJ; my mum is also an ISFJ. I would defend the fuck out of the both of them, despite them being much, much older than me 😂
I feel like I have loved every ISFJ I've met! You guys rock.
Also, you sound like a great brother. You guys must have the greatest roommate experience ever."
1595,isfj,"Hmm, I have one friend who's ENFJ, although they're 6-7 years older than me and we both have various types and levels of mental health things going on, so that may impact my experience with them slightly. 
Basically though I think they're great! I mostly know them online, but I got to spend a long weekend with them once and was mostly extremely happy about it; they accidentally wore me out pretty badly at one point by following a huge art gallery one day with hiking the next, but they made up for it with TV and cuddles later on lol. Basically I washed their dishes/cleaned their kitchen up a bit and they appreciated me for it and we talked a lot and cuddled a lot and I was able to feel honest and it was really nice :')
This was also probably colored somewhat by the fact that I used to have a huge crush on them and can never quite seem to get all the way over it, though. Feeling domestic with someone was just lovely haha, but I did genuinely feel like we got along really well and had a great time even if there were maybe some moments where I wasn't fully getting my preferred level of attention to my needs (which, to be fair, is pretty high). 
Online is a bit different, because they're extremely social and I'm more anxious online than in person. I tend to have to be the one to contact them, and we talk less and only about certain subjects usually. I want to talk to/comfort them more than I do, but I feel awkward about it a lot of the time. But they always make me feel very warm and welcome and cared for, even if I'm a bit of a self-sabotaging mess. "
1596,isfj,"What are the characteristics of a healthy ISFJ if I may asked? I used to think I was an INTP until I got into a relationship with an ENFJ. He is my ex now. I got really clingy in the relationship, because I felt insecure."
1597,isfj,"Our team has been looking for people that are interested in MBTI/Socionics or Enneagram to be new members of our sub. Most personality subreddits focus on stereotypes, and general ""fun"" conversation that isn't necessarily producing value. Our subreddit has been created by a team of 6 users extremely versed in MBTI, Socinoics, and Enneagram. We plan to have a highly organized subreddit that combines ideas of Enneagram and Socionics (both are to be discussed). There aren't many communities where the interplay of Enneagram and Jungian ideas are discussed - and we wish to change that.
We are going to include weekly typing threads, that require video submissions answering a questionairre, and we have many experienced typers on the team. We hope to have a community that fosters noobies as well as those more experienced. The typical subreddits /r/mbti and other mbti subreddits focus on stereotypes, and many people are incorrectly typed, we hope to change that. 
Our subreddit is private as of now, but we are beginning to add people as the final design, as well as wiki work is finishing up. Let me know if you are interested. We have a severe lack of representation with ISFJs and ESFJs (which is usual for the internet) and it is important for us to have not only diversity between peoples expertise in the subject (we want interested newbies as much as we want experts) but also general diversity in types."
1598,isfj,"Ohhh I would love to be a part of that!! Hope I am not too late..
I have no idea why but ever since I heard about MBTI/socionics/enneagram I have had an interest. And I know I am an ISFJ from the many times I have taken the MBTI test lol. Also I have been wanting to join a community of people that I can freely talk about this with, the internet seems to be the only safe place, as nobody in real life is ever interested in these theories."
1599,isfj,"Weekly typing threads for people unsure of their type - much more effective than other methods.
Discussion of Enneagram in general -  a lot of MBTI enthusiasts are not aware of Enneagram, and the interplay between these is especially important if you want to understand all aspects of personality.
Clear information of the topic of socionics - its hard to get any real clear understanding of these materials because most of it is translated from russian. We want to port the most important parts of Socionics for people to gain access to this.
all in all we hope to have a much more guided community that helps others rather than perpeptuating mere stereotypes of personality systems. there is a deeper use for MBTI besides just fun, as well as Enneagram even moreso. There isn't a good hub for these ideas on reddit, and we've had really good responses so far in regards to interest."
1600,isfj,"Hi,
I came to find help on getting along better with the girl I really love. Our conversations normally really stop midway as personally I find it really hard to be able to keep a consistent conversation.
Is there any tips I can have to help me understand her more?
Thanks "
1601,isfj,"I have a close friend who is an ISFJ and it's been my experience that that personality has a need to observe but feel involved through observation.  They like to pick up on little things they think others are missing and act on those little things.  They're the type of people who you think aren't listening but then suddenly appear a month later with a new version of that candy bar you haven't had since you were a kid and forgot you'd even mentioned liking.  When they do things like that, they like to feel appreciated.  As an INFJ you're probably pretty good at noticing the little things people do and understanding how to react so they know they're appreciated, so in that way you're rather compatible.
It's hard for me to have a long conversation with an ISFJ because they focus so much on concrete things and I tend to be a ""what if"" ideas person... we can both do the other a bit but our focus of interest tends to differ in that way.  My ISFJ friend and I like to DO things together.  We have the best time when we've planned to do a certain activity and then go do it as planned.  A lot of the time it's something as simple as a board game.  Conversation tends to happen naturally in that circumstance and when it's not happening there's something to do so it doesn't feel unnatural.
Hope that helps."
1602,isfj,"As sad as it may sound, literally just expressing and consistently reaffirming that you like me/care about me lol. I've developed my first real crush in ages lately, and it won't go anywhere, but with their warm personality, all they had to do was make it clear that they enjoy talking to me. They're like this with a lot of their friends, but they call me pet names and speak very affectionately to me and they don't mind if I come to them when I'm upset or having a bad day, and it just makes me feel like my insides are gonna fall out in a good way. I hardly ever get crushes, but they managed it in the space of like four conversations even though we're still really not closer than average friends. "
1603,isfj,"Little gestures that show someone cares is really special to me.
When I first started dating my boyfriend, we went on this scavenger hunt sort of event, and he was checking ahead of time that the meal stop had a vegetarian option, because I don't eat meat. That just about melted my heart.
He's always checking to see if I'm hungry, cold, comfortable, whatever. That means a lot, because I'm not super likely to speak up about that sort of thing if I'm in a new environment or around someone I haven't known for a long time. 
Honestly, it's the sweet little things that mean the most to me. He'll wrap a blanket around me if I look cold, he'll tie my shoe if he sees it come untied, he'll put his hand on my back to guide me if I don't know where I'm going. 
He really won me over be showing kindness and concern for my well-being. I think ISFJs are so used to taking care of everybody else, nobody ever takes care of us, so when somebody does, it means a lot. A good sense of humor always helps, too.
Also, I love affectionate people, personally. I tend to be pretty shy about expressing my feelings for people, whether it's friends or a love interest, so I really enjoy being around people who aren't afraid to show a warmer side to them. Most of us love hugs, in my experience. "

​"
1605,isfj,"Since the ISFJ subreddit is largely dead, I figure I'd give it a go.
I'll firstly say that I believe there are bad and good versions of each type, or adolescent and mature.  And when ISFJ's are bad, they are really bad.  I was once a bad one, but I've known far worse.
That being said, a friend introduced me to a deeper understanding of MBTI and cognitive functions, to which I'm largely still a novice.  I've learned to use MBTI as a double-check to keep myself in line.  I've even got a whiteboard in my office when I decide I need to find a reason to why I would by default act or feel or think a certain way if its been bugging me long enough.
It's not that I ""needed"" MBTI to self-identify; that came with personal growth and maturity, which some people never seem able to do and is certainly not limited to any type.  But it has been a great enhancer to things I already know to be true and good and gives some new perspective on people who are not me.
As an example, I'm fairly confident that to most my friends and family, I put more effort into maintaining ties than they do with me.  There was a point in the past when this was an entirely foreign concept that I didn't understand why somebody didn't have a level of appreciation (I had some struggles with affirmation) that I had.  MBTI has shown me, not that types are just the way they are, but another perspective.  If I'm putting 150% effort into something, and somebody else is putting 80% in, there's probably nothing wrong with that.  
It's allowed me to appreciate other peoples differences.  I've found that differences and imperfections are usually interesting and can be attractive.  I've got an incredible amount of respect and admiration for anybody who can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and make active efforts to better themselves.
It's gotten me to really like the good traits about a being a quality ISFJ like information absorption, awareness of others, and loyalty, because I can see it lacking in other types.  The opposite is also true, where I see most commonly the issue for an ISFJ is the sense of self actually coming from the self, and not others.  At our worst we are incredibly difficult to deal with, and I find it a bit ironic that ISFJ's are usually good about taking in other peoples emotions but very poor at releasing their own. 
This is still all fairly new to me, but if I had one tidbit of advice for any ISFJ's out there, if you can manage to learn to do without needing constant validation and affirmation, you're gold.  Try and get over the coddling.  Took me over a decade."
1606,isfj,I see my girlfriend struggle with this all the time. She's totally capable yet seems to be carrying the weight of the world on her conscience when she is considering making and decision of some weight on her own.
1607,isfj,"You are correct.  ISFJ's are generally very capable and unshakably reliable people.  The main problem with our decision making abilities is that we often make those decisions more based on the influence of others or at the approval of others, or by societal standards of how things should be.
As an example, even on a small scale, I use to have serious issues making any concrete decisions.  When out with friends, the question of ""where should we go eat"" always came up, and my response was usually ""I don't care"" or ""doesn't matter to me"".  The truth is, I was more concerned at maintaining harmony (setting up a standard isn't a bad thing).  When you do this for long enough, you lessen your ability to make any decision and risk being walked over.  And this all for just deciding where to go and eat.  I knew exactly where I wanted to go, but didn't want to voice.  Sometimes I really just wanted and I waited for somebody to ask me.  Compare that thought process to a much larger decision like a career choice or relationship and you might have a brewing disaster.
Now, I'm not saying make decisions FOR your girlfriend, but in a way you probably know her well enough to know what her thought process is and what her decision was already going to be.  Give her that slight nudge every once in a while, and if she was already thinking about making the same decision, she'll affirm it.  You know your girlfriend better than anybody on Reddit, but I caution the ""nudge"" being too strong.  I'm not trying to send a mixed message here, but ISFJ's are capable of changing their minds in an instant.  Occasionally, I manage to talk myself in and out of a situation, or even a mood, several times in such a short amount of time.
Now, I don't know the maturity level of your girlfriend, but a clear indicator would be how often she needs the validation.  Once upon a time, I needed it for the smallest things to derive any value for what I did.  As corny as it sounds, I found out service is its own reward.  Even doing something like taking a friend out and paying for the occasion, I expected people to bow at my feet.  And when I didn't get it, I closed up and got incredibly frustrated.  I figured out I was only doing good deeds for the praise.  Now, I just like doing good deeds for a bit of self-satisfaction.  Don't validate her for everything she does; she'll come to rely on it every time the deed is done.  However, it is warranted every once in a while, and that's just a level of common appreciation that everybody should have.  
The pat on the back every once in a while will allow her to grow on her own, and you'll get the return on your investment tenfold.  "
1608,isfj,"You're beautiful. You have a tenacity and love for all things that is so incredibly attractive. The way you speak about feelings flows like water. You can often turn situations around and keep them positive and upbeat even when it feels like there's no saving it. 
But you can be so unreliable. Maintains a schedule (even a basic one) can be so difficult. We can pick up that slack, but sometimes things are beyond our control, in which case it seems like they are most definitely beyond yours.  You speak beautifully about feelings but they are often your own feelings. The concept of truly feeling the feelings of another is foreign to you. You can absolutely feel, but they are your feelings, not those of another. 
All in all, you really are amazing. But it's hard to trust you with my deepest self. "
1609,isfj,"Infp here. I must admit I'm one of the unreliable infps and I really hate it myself, but on the other hand I feel like my energie is flowing out like tea out of a broken cup and I can't concentrate the rest on what must be done. But I think, I can understand the feelings of others, I understand that most can't follow my thoughts and that I'm annoying and difficult with my changing moods. One snap and I'm from happy-like-fuck to I-hate-all-humans. So sorry for being a difficult type of personality, I hope we're worth all the work."
1610,isfj,"Wow your overall comment was really beautiful and beneficial. I agree and both the positive and constructive things you've said. What advice would you give in terms of the cons? How can we go about about working on those things? (schedules, being more practical, etc we really do suck at those things)"
1611,isfj,"I don't mind your personality at all, I absolutely love it. You're very good at something ISFJs in particular are quite poor at (Ne) and it's filtered through a lens of what you truly feel, and we definitely want you to feel amazing so in a way it's a great pairing. But given that what you value how you feel more than anything (Fi), and we value how you feel an enormous amount (Fe), things can start to feel one sided unless the ISFJ can learn not to overextend and spread themselves too thin, and the INFP can learn to genuinely value the feelings of another person and use that in decision making as well. 
I think that there could definitely be a healthy balance somewhere. You guys are a true kid at heart, and I can almost guarantee that an ISFJ would want to explore with you. "
1612,isfj,"Thank you very much! 
I do believe you, my experience has just proven otherwise thus far. I only know ~4 of them, and they are all infectiously beautiful, but I have learned not to try and rely on them with things that deeply matter to me. "
1613,isfj,"I'm feeling really flattered because of all your positivity. We INFPs may have the same seeds, but it's up to us how good we grow and how beautiful our flowers are. If you will be the one to water one of this flowers, you will be rewarded, it just takes a time :) my best friend and I know each other for ten years now and I won't let her go ^^ 
so don't give up, we can learn if you teach us and we WANT to learn, because we want to give something back, we just don't know how."

1615,isfj,"Unsurprised by the huge number of INxxs, considering that almost every introvert I know has (mis)typed that way at one point or another lol. I've met far, far more supposed intuitives online than sensors despite the current statistics about type frequency. 
It does make me laugh about there being so few extroverts comparatively, though. Better things to do, I guess? Good for them. "
1616,isfj,"Introverts being introverts i guess.
also, the lowest frequency in personality types are the ones with the most subscribers. i guess we start looking for people who can understand us in the internet when we can't find ones in the real world"
1617,isfj,"The first part of your reply has nothing to do with what I said, so I'm a little confused about that. As for the second part, it was just a self-deprecating joke, darling, no need to worry. I'm quite aggressively introverted myself, I don't actually think I'm wasting all of my time. "
1618,isfj,"For me I like getting something done that is not influenced (directly) by external motivation. I will usually get stuff done that is needed to not disappoint the people around me but if there is nothing ""pressuring"" me it gets a whole lot harder.
There are plenty of things I am interested in but then I spend a ton of time on research and preparation to make everything perfect instead of getting something done.
Therefore taking the leap to doing something like planning and executing an event (which can simply be game night with friends or whatever), something creative (art, writing a blog post, learning some piece of music) or attending an ""event"" (sports, cinema, ..) on my own disregarding that nobody wants to join.
I really like if somebody recognizes what I did but I can still be pretty happy and satisfied about myself without it.
This week I invited some old colleagues of mine to dinner at my place and cooked myself. Quite a bit of prep work but everything went well, people enjoyed themselves and I got plenty of compliments for it."
1619,isfj,"So last night the guy I'm seeing (ESTJ) came over and we were watching tv. Several days ago, I began to tell him about a story that had gone on at work that was interesting to us both and I told him I'd get back to him when I found out more details. Last night, as I began to tell him, I said ""before I tell you what happened.."" I was beginning to tell him how something that happened yesterday directly correlated with last week's events. 
Well, he completely interrupts, says ""I don't want to hear about anything else. Just tell me about last week's situation."" I really did think that what I had to say was interesting enough that he'd want to hear. I started again ""But no, this goes with last...."" I get cut off again, getting talked over so I couldn't say anything at all. At this point, I instinctively just said quietly, ""I will not say anything then"" and completely shut down. 
He tried to joke a bit after that but I gave yes or no responses. While he did stay over, we didn't speak much at all after that. This morning, as we both left, we didn't really say anything and just went about our way.
Usually, we just joke about differences/things like this but not this time. He's an ESTJ so he's a VERY strong personality, but over time I've gotten used to that. We both are playful so it's always been okay. This time, though, things were different. 
Am I being too sensitive? I'm not even sure what I'm feeling right now. Sad? Hurt? Annoyed? Should I reach out to him? Should I wait? How would you feel as an ISFJ?
Thank you."
1620,isfj,"You’re not over sensitive; that’s rude as fuck. I would’ve reacted the same, but be more visibly angry and call him out on it. 
I’m sorry he did that to you. I hate it when people take advantage of someone else’s kindness/ tolerance and use it (or his own personality type, too) as a free pass to be a complete dickhead. What a terrible listener and friend."
1621,isfj,"My wife is ISFJ, I am INTP, we just discussed this, and we both agree this is a red flag. His actions show disrespect for you as a person, and this is not likely to change unless he is confronted on it.
I have over the years become used to my wife's more ""rambling"" way of communication. I just learned to make a mental note of which points I hope she touches on by the time she is done with her story, and remind her if she doesn't get back to the point she started on if it is important to my understanding of what she had to say. This has been a learned behavior/adaptation on my part.
No one deserves to be talked over and silenced, freedom of expression (especially in a relationship) is a basic human right and communication is a cornerstone of a successful and respectful relationship. Some people just need to learn to listen with more patience, and the habit of talking over others can be unlearned with practice and the willingness to do so. Unless you are prepared for even more disrespectful and controlling behavior, you need to let him know you won't tolerate it, and go from there.  "
1622,isfj,"Just chiming in to add another confirmation that yeah, that was ridiculously rude and you have every right to feel however you want about it. I'm maybe a bit harsh, but that's the kind of thing that would turn me off of a person completely and probably permanently, especially when there seems to be no explanation for it. Personally, I'd wait for him to apologize and just move on if he doesn't, but if he's really worth it to you I guess you could reach out. "
1623,isfj,"Sounds like my ESTJ ex.
Was this a one time situation or does he usually not have patience for your conversation?  Maybe he had a stressful day?
Even though my ESTJ always cut me off to get to the point he eventually saw how much it meant to me to express those details, so he would try to sit through it on days he was feeling sweet and adoring.  He made it clear that the additional details he sat through were a compromise or an act of love to bridge our different communication styles.  Yeah, he was an asshole and he doesn't deny it."
1624,isfj,"It’s rude but you also have to learn why someone would do this. It’s unlikely he doesn’t respect you but rather that he is not able (yet) to communicate his preferences in a nicer way. 
My ISFJ mom does the rambling on about a lot of factual details (often people at work) that I don’t care about. I’m a bottom line, big picture person and want to know the main point and then fill in details later, if needed. I notice S types, especially sensing dominants (ISxJ and ESxP) like to build a picture detail by detail, often chronologically. This is excruciatingly dull for people like me. 
ESTJs can be “get to the point” people because they like efficiency and may not be deeply interested in details about people. 
So with people like that, don’t build up to the main point. Just get to the heart of the matter and then they may he more patient with the extra details. 
That doesn’t excuse his rudeness though. I wouldn’t assume he knew there is a problem. ISFJs expecting people to “just know” often compounds their problem because they get hurt waiting for people to change who don’t know there’s a problem. Figure out what you’re feeling and what you need. Then communicate that with “I feel” statements. Avoid “you” blaming statements. "
1625,isfj,"I'll begin by saying, hello Reddit. 
I am a 24 (very near 25) year young female (newly found out) ISFJ. My entire life I have been labeled as:
1) social butterfly
2) ray of sunshine 
3) [flat out] extrovert
After working as a florist in an upscale grocery store for a little over 2 years, I've suddenly become very unhappy. I feel as though I need to be doing something ""bigger."" Last Saturday my husband (ISTJ) wanted to get a book from Barnes and Nobel, so I happily followed along. I had the sudden urge to get some sort of aptitude test in book form (being the type that likes things I can handle), and was directed to ""Do What You Are."" I read it through in two days and was very upset. Almost threw the book at the wall! I had originally came up with ESFJ as my type, and the careers didn't suit me. I explained my frustration with my husband, to which he responded with, ""thyme4vin, you're an introvert."" I seriously laughed at him. Then he told me introverts get exauhsted working with people for periods of time; well as a florist in a busy grocery store, that's all I do. I re-read the book and took the actual test online and voila - he was right. 
I shouldn't have to explain how floored I am. Still. I honestly feel like I've been lying to myself my entire life! I've worked retail and food service since high school, and never understood why it was so difficult for me. Now I have clarification, and I can understand myself on a level I never did before. My issue is that I have no idea what to do with myself. I don't love my job like I thought I did. My immediate manager doesn't do half the amount of work I can do in a shift (I work shorter shifts than her), and I leave almost everyday feeling like I didn't do enough. Not to mention there is never a ""thanks!"" Or heaven forbid a ""Wow! You worked your ass off!"" I'm not looking for it all the time, but when I obviously busted tail and got shit done, say SOMETHING! 
Anyway, after discovering my type, here's some things I've realized I want in a job:
1) part-time - my husband is my main priority. I like to keep a clean house for him along with having dinner ready. 
2) no travel - I hate driving; it stresses me out. I can make it to work and home, but not to different locations in between. 
3) creative - at least slightly. I have a need to be artsy. 
4) no interruptions - it infuriates me when I'm in the middle of doing something and someone wonders up with some stupid question! 
5) minimum ""public"" interaction - I hate retail. I am a people pleaser by nature and only want to work for those that appreciate and acknowledge that I am doing something FOR them! 
Things that shouldn't need detail: I'm hand on, very efficient, highly organized, and reliable. 
I've considered many careers, but I don't know where to turn. Something that has piqued my interest in a Visual Merchandiser for floral boutiques, home decor stores, or something in the realm of design (not fashion though.) the only issue is the high possibility of site-to-site commute. 
I don't have any formal degree due to my lack of understanding in who I am (until now) and where I want to end up. 
Any advice is appreciated, but keep in mind that I'm sensitive to criticism (:  
Edit: first post; fixed format (or tried to. On mobile, sorry!)"
1626,isfj,"INTP here. It's common for us Fe-Ne-Si-Ti types (you and I share the same 4 preferred functions, though in different order) to be the introverts most successful at extroverting, since we have the tools in place to harmonize with other people (Fe) and show nigh endless interest in them (Ne) as well as being able to remember details about them (Ti and Si). That competence in extroversion can in many cases for ISFJs, including yours, be mistaken for preference. That's what you're going through now and learning about yourself, and it can be an amazing journey.
Here's a really good article about the ISFJ:
http://www.truity.com/personality-type/ISFJ
It includes a detailed section you can click on near the top about good career options for you. 
I'd be happy to discuss this more; if you have anything to ask, feel free. "
1627,isfj,"Thanks for the support. I think there's a general feeling of chaos in the place I'm at (from all departments and levels of management), and I know for sure I hate anything unsettled. 
I will meditate on your advice and keep pushing (: "
1628,isfj,"I'm usually a bit more talkative and just more relaxed in general. I'm usually with people that I enjoy being around so I'm also a good amount happier than I usually am.  Overall, weed really helps me in being more ""normal""."
1629,isfj,"I think it depends on several factors like weed strain, the mood I have, or if I am alone or not (and with whom). Sometimes I feel energized and very talkative and I feel like ""thinking out of the box"", or at least different from my usual line of thought. Some other times I am chill and happy, I may be quiet but in a very good mood. And sometimes, if I am in a company that I am not very close to, or I am stressed for work, I can get a bit paranoid, very selfconscious and ""trapped in my thoughts, like my worries get amplified. But this last situation I would say is the least common. I luv weed. "
1630,isfj,When I get high I just start relaxing and chilling. If I smoke enough I definitely get couch lock and the munchies. I usually become pretty quiet. I love weed sometimes I’ll smoke a little before going to bed so I can fall asleep 
1631,isfj,"The last few times I took the online tests I got typed as INFJ. Only recently I realized I am actually ISFJ. It affected me more than I like to admit. First time when I got INFJ, I read the description and it all felt so relatable - for the first time in a long while I felt understood. 
The thing is, the online description of types doesn't help too much - there's significant overlap in the way we interact with other people, and both IXFJ types share those little things that make you go ""omg, it feels so good to not be the only one who does that"". The difference is that INFJ seem to be portrayed way more glamorously, while the ISFJ are often described, to put it bluntly, as being boring gullible sensitive introverts. It's a stupid stereotype, and it's only natural for those first attempting to type themselves to fall into the trap of confirmation bias - minimizing the undeniable clues of Si and trying to find instances of Ni using.
What helped me convince I'm actually ISFJ was this insightful post on tumblr. It's about INTJ/ISTJ, but I feel it applies also to the INFJ/ISFJ dilemma.
As I said, the realization of being actually an ISFJ affected me a lot. Not necessarily because it's a less ""cool"" label, but because I realized I am actually an unhealthy ISFJ and I was trying to lie my way into INFJ to cover the issues I seem to have. You know, being the weirdo of the MBTI classroom somehow absolved me from doing some serious introspection. But this big knot of negativity and emotions is still there inside me. I still have no idea how to deal with it, but it's certainly better not to bury it deeper by lying to myself. 
Sorry for venting. I had in mind writing an even longer post on /r/mbti about these online tests and descriptions but somehow I didn't find the time yet."
1632,isfj,"Yeah, I usually get INFJ and ISFJ with equal frequency on tests, which I guess makes sense since they're so totally unreliable. It took me a while of reading up on cognitive function theory to figure out which I really was, but I'm definitely Si-Ne; Ni is a strange and foreign creature to me lol. "
1633,isfj,"I think tests often ask questions like: Do you often think about the purpose of human life? and deep questions like that aimed towards intuitive types, though sensors seem just as capable of thinking about deep issues. A more accurate question may be: Do you prefer to get all the facts before you see the big picture, or see the big picture before you get all the facts? This is an INTP saying this, so maybe you have totally different ideas on this."
1634,isfj,"I’m married to an ESFJ but she has been feeling more introverted as we’ve grown closer. Been three years now with several years of dating.  We’ve talked through a weeks routine and it works really well. Monday is a reflection day after work to chill and be together. Tuesday evening is all to me. Wednesday is our clean up the house day, Thursday is her night. Friday is date night, social gathering or another chill night. The weekend is for family and having down time.  I’ve grown to appreciate the social aspects of being with her and building great friendships with our circle of friends but I do know when my battery is low and I need my alone time. "
1635,isfj,I don't know about you but I feel really uncomfortable talking openly about my emotions. Even to some people that are close to me I have hard time opening up and talking about deep stuff. For example someone in the group of friends starts talking about how they feel and it just makes me uncomfortable. I would rather talk about other pointless stuff rather than emotions and how we feel. But it's quite ironic since I'm pretty emotional and I'm just hiding it from others all the time. I don't know if this is isfj trait or is it just me?
1636,isfj,"I am totally the opposite. I hate constant chitchat. I don't mind it occasionally but constantly I really get bored. I do enjoy discussing my emotions, but with friends. And I love hearing out their feelings. "
1637,isfj,"When it's with people I trust, oh yes! I love talking about emotions. It helps me to better understand them in some cases and get input from other people about what it might mean, or seem to mean, on their end."
1638,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I can be really selective about who my close friends are, and sometimes I feel like only talking to them and them alone, or only hanging out with them and them alone. I also tend to be selective about the friends I make in general, and have a bad habit of burning some bridges. Is anyone else like this?"
1639,isfj,"This is absolutely me. I tend to keep nearly everybody at an arm's length, until I've determined that I want them in my inner-circle, and then I spend most of my time talking to/hanging out with them.
Everybody else is considered a distant acquaintance, to me.
They don't really know me for who I really am."
1640,isfj,"Yep. That whole introvert thing, I think. I always hope to find people who will really click with me, and when I do I keep them close, but everyone else is just kinda whatever. They're fine, but I'm not gonna bother hanging out with them, since what's the point if I'm only kinda gonna enjoy it? It sounds cold to say it this way, but it's a lot of energy to expend if the benefit is minimal. "
1641,isfj,"yeah, i do that too. though it's become a bit of a problem with me because i feel so strongly about who i want to spend time talking with, i end up being kind of cold to acquaintances. like i won't even talk with them or have a casual conversation with them if they just happen to be in the same room with me. instead im focused on whatever i'm working on or thinking about. and i do this to the point that i'm really rusty at casual conversations. and i need to relearn that skill. so, i'm practicing it all again."
1642,isfj,I guess that's normal for me at least. The reason is because I tend to care alot more if I have more friends. More friends means more people to know. I may sound evil when I think it's a waste to invest a friendship that may not going to work. That's why I have a small circle of friends. Any opinions on this is gladly appriciated.
1643,isfj,"I'm like this too. I have 5 close friends and 3/5 are like me where we are basically each other's only friends. 2/5 have other friends outside our group and I don't really like hanging with them with their other friends around. At parties we just hang out with each other which some people get annoyed about. One of my friends boyfriends calls us Fort Knox. Not that we do it on purpose, we just don't care to make other friends "
1644,isfj,"Hi guys!
My younger ISFJ brother just turned 17 and is due to finish high school in November (I know it's weird, we're Australian lol). The thing is, he has no idea what he wants to do with his life and I can tell it's really stressing him out. Our parents are big pushers for a university education, which means he has just under 5 months to pick a course. He wants to pick a career he really loves, something that he's passionate about and doesn't feel like work every day. The thing is, he's struggled in the past with depression and he doesn't feel passionate about anything. He has considered doing teaching, design, nursing, and carpentry but he's decided against all of those. 
I'm currently working towards a career in healthcare (hopefully I'll be a doctor one day! Or maybe I'll go into research or something I have no idea yet lol) and I consider myself lucky because I always knew what field I wanted to work in. I feel really helpless towards him in this situation. I've suggested he go into a field like counselling because it would utilise that Fe but he's super introverted and says he doesn't think he could deal with people all day. I also suggested to him doing an Arts or Business degree because he's really creative and Business and English are his two best subjects, but he's worried they might lead him to a dead end job he hates. He's really big on the passion thing. 
Anyway, I need some advice from fellow ISFJs because I just do not understand you at all, you think so differently to us! Even if you can't offer advice I'd also love to hear what career you are currently in and how you came to be there.
tl;dr 17 yo ISFJ brother needs to pick something for his uni applications in 5 months. Help! "
1645,isfj,"I'd recommend something tech based. If he studies computers, programming, digital systems or something ICT, he will have many more opportunities for success. It is a big emerging field - there will always be progressive opportunities to keep things fresh and challenging, but positions where you can grow and built loyalty. Also, it's something that can be use in many other industries, which means he can deside which ones he's interested in later on. Tech skills are very adaptable. Many ISFJ friends studied graphic design and are just doing business tech now. Being a ""tech guy"" means he gets to be helpful and useful, but also work on his own a lot. This gives him flexibility I think. I know several ISFJ that are fulfilled in these roles."
1646,isfj,"I second the idea that tech is a great idea, because there are so many doors that will open. Web design is one that would integrate his design interest. There is also UX/UI design, which is user interface design.
If he's not into the tech side of things, I'm a graphic designer and can say that the career has so many branches. That's good for someone who doesn't know exactly what he wants, because you can feel it out as you go. Corporate design, advertising, packaging design, print production, editorial design, marketing... The list goes on. Some even turn to photography or environmental design (eg, wayfinding, amusement parks). And you can work in a variety of fields, because they all need designers.
At least in Canada, you don't need a university degree for graphic design. You can still get one, of course, and I did. I did university first, and then a diploma to get practical skills, but most of my classmates went straight from HS to graphic design, and they're all employed. 
If your parents pressure him into a university degree he isn't passionate about, he can always do a short diploma or certificate after in something that interests him, design or not. Good luck to him!"
1647,isfj,"I’m a software engineer.  It’s fun to have a technical component where I get to solve problems, and then I get be creative after hours by playing instruments in bands and other musical opportunities.
I do something I don’t mind spending hours at each day, and get to truly enjoy my creative interests as a hobby, where my day job can support me financially, and I’d always in demand."
1648,isfj,"I'm pretty sure he's a 9w1 (not sure about his tritype though). 
Probably should have mentioned this in the OP but he's also kind of lazy - he's really smart and has just breezed through school picking easy subjects that he doesn't have to study for. I reckon he could definitely do something like that if he actually put some effort in but I doubt he would. Could be tied back into his depression struggles as well, heh."
1649,isfj,"Librarian here.  It’s a great career, and  his background sounds ideal for library science (get some good grounding in tech if so inclined - it’s where the profession is going).  Be aware that the number of jobs is a bit limited, so have a backup plan, if possible."
1650,isfj,"I'm a 9w1.  I've been good at being a dispatcher, a data analyst. Made a fair warehouse supervisor. 
Great at creating excel reports and working magic with it. Depression is so hard. Makes you not want anything. 
I tried this assessment. Not saying it's 100% accurate. It told me I'd be a good accountant, but I know better. Sure I'd be good at it, but I hate it. Too boring.  LOL https://www.assessment.com/"
1651,isfj,"No problem! Technical writing is another career path I considered, and my spouse, who's in IT, works with business analysts who write requirements for tech projects in banks and stuff (but don't do actual tech stuff). Other ideas that merge business/english. All best ☺."
1652,isfj,How do you think that would compare with a Computer Science degree because my school doesn't offer Computer Engineering. I'm going to be a junior in college this upcoming semester and I'm still confused on what I want to major in :(
1653,isfj,"For a software engineering job, I think they are about equal.  Computer Science degrees will focus a lot more on algorithms and software design, while Computer Engineering degrees focus a little bit on the electrical engineering side of things with circuits, the design of the computer (like making a processor, how operating systems work, ect.) while also covering programming.  It's a lot more of a ""general"" where I could get a job doing electrical engineering work, work on processor or computer components (more commonly Embedded Systems - but SE's do that too), and also software engineering.
​
So no worries!  A Computer Science degree is perfect for software engineering!"
1654,isfj,"I recently entertained my mom for her birthday. Spent pretty much the entire day with her, driving to places, eating at restaurants. So exhausted the next day I stayed in my room the entire day & basically didn't interact with anyone."
1655,isfj,"My husband and one of my two best friends are both INTJs. The (female) friend really ""gets"" me and knows how I work, and values my warm, loyal and giving nature. My husband... is still working on figuring me out. Sometimes, he doesn't quite understand my actions as they may defy his logical expectations for human behavior.  That causes communication problems. 
Strangely, my other best friend is an ENTP. "
1656,isfj,"I love 'em. 2 of my closest friends are INTJs. I've noticed we usually have similar/complementary view son the world, but how we got to that point is usually different, which makes them really easy to work with/plan with/talk with."
1657,isfj,"My dad and a few of my friends are INTJs. I feel like they don't understand me, but they at least respect me and my way of life. I definitely don't understand certain things about them and they me. More often than not, I feel like they are so much further along in life and on a higher plane of being than I am. Regardless, I really respect them despite not always agreeing with them. "
1658,isfj,"I have a lot of fantastic INTJ friends, including my younger sister. I'd say I probably get on better with them than with any other type. 
Edit to add: it does seem like our brains work in different ways, but in a complementary way rather than a conflicting way. "
1659,isfj,"I find them fascinating. The way they view the world is so different from mine that it keeps me entertained for hours just asking questions about how they see things. I also find amusing the way some of them think they are so different. They make me curious.
When talking with them I enjoy our complementary views on the world, although sometimes it's really hard to understand each other."
1660,isfj,"I only know one person who is INTJ and this is my personal experience with her. I find her quite stubborn :) She has her own opinion and she sticks to it faithfully, even if we present her with facts. She can be a little harsh sometimes. If she disagrees with you, she has no problem saying bad things about that. Kind of bums me out because it's a little disrespectful. Just because she doesn't like it, doesn't mean she should put it down. "
1661,isfj,"Besides the stereotype, what traits do you think deserve to be seen? What sorts of strengths or weaknesses or misconceptions exist? I would like to gain a more realistic understanding of the mindset so I can do it justice. I love playing with different perspectives.

If anyone's curious about the character in question, it's for a D&D campaign - a shy elf, a survivor of a largely hunted species in this world. He has grown up alone in an abandoned, overgrown church in a forest, studying old books and relics, and becoming a cleric for a god, too, long forgotten and alone. 
Serving his god and his friends give him a sense of purpose, as well as stability, protection, and distraction from an underlying fear for his safety."
1662,isfj,"It depends a lot on the context.
Something written from his point of view (as a main character), in first person, will vary greatly from the way he may be perceived by other characters. ISFJs lead a rich ""inner"" life, even if they don't show it.
If you're writing him as a NPC encountered at some point in the campaign, his relationship to the player character(s) matters a lot. He may be just a regular silent figure, wary of others, with a hint of stoicism. He may warm up slowly to others, if they gain his trust. In a closer entourage, he will be loyal and caring and he may seem even a merry and light hearted fellow, always ready to crack a stupid joke. Under pressure or new stressful situations, he could be overly worrying and wishing he hadn't left the comfort of his church's library. Prone to cowardice - I don't see him engaging in perilous adventures for something he doesn't strongly care about."
1663,isfj,"we do lots of little efforts that add up. so we're detail orientated. all of this is internal. look there, check this, check that, does all of that stuff work together?
and we do so with an eye open for group emotional dynamics because we care about people. he/she had this tone or this expression ,what does that mean? and we'll connect that with previous things the person said or expressed that we stored away in our memory to connect and analyze with new things we notice. and the goal is often toward wanting the best for people we care about.
but yeah, all internal.
what comes out are actions that seem to take into account a lot of stuff, it's almost as if we had a big picture view. but it's just because our actions navigated through a sum of tiny things in our minds first.
many times we are quiet, observant, and thinking, and storing things we notice, and making plans. then we act. and if we get overwhelmed we'll start panicking and either waste time with overplanning, or running in a panicked circle in our minds trying to plan more but getting nowhere, or think we're plan too much and have to go the opposite route and ACT NOW while trying to squeeze in panicked planning as we act."
1664,isfj,"I just re-ran the MBTI test on similarminds.com (on a side note - is this a good test?) for myself and my partner. I'm posting here as I was an ENTP, and she appeared to be an ISFJ (I answered with what I hope was a healthy mix of 'how she would answer' and 'how I think she is' ).
I checked out her 'profile' and she seems a good fit to that.
I read a few posts on /r/ENTP: 'Who do you fall for where two people mentioned they were with ISFJs and Caring for your ENTP... which looked dubious and had no mention of an ISFJ at all.
So is there any advise for me, from ISFJs ?"
1665,isfj,"I'm dating an ISFJ, and I'm deep into ENTP territory. The match seems to work majestically, but we're exceptionally communicative and VERY verbally appreciative. Way more communicative and appreciative than I'm used to. We got into the habit early, and we talk out absolutely everything. I feel like this is a requirement for this pairing, on both sides. When their are issues, we HAVE to talk them out or they simmer. I couldn't see the matchup working if I had major secrets or wasn't really gungho about the relationship, she'd be able to tell. I would not suggest the pairing to an 18yo dipping their feet into the dating pool, but it's making for a great serious adult relationship. "
1666,isfj,"isfj like being appreciated. they will go really really out of their way to try to legitimately make people's lives better, people they like that is. saying things like ""wow, thank you so much. i love it"" or stuff like that is great. also let them know that you understand them. try to see from their perspective and when you get it, let them know you are.
think of isfj as a flower that wilts when it lacks affection and appreciation. and your actions and words of affection are like you watering the plant.
so do these things: show appreciation, understanding, affection. and reassure a bunch."
1667,isfj,"All I've got for you is these paragraphs paragraph from this [article](http://www.personalitypage.com/ISFJ.html]
When I dated a ENTP, we had some communication problems because we are such different people. Because of our differences, there were a lot of things that he said which made me unhappy, but I just didn't say it because I felt that there was no point and because I don't like to argue. However, because of this, I slowly realized that we just didn't work as a couple and that I couldn't see myself being serious about him, so we broke up."
1668,isfj,"As an ENTP (male) being with an ISFJ (female) for five years now, the best advice I can give is to KNOW that you are both very different people, and use that knowledge to both explore each others' differences and find things you really enjoy. Additionally, because our attitudes an approaches are very different, remember this fact is key when it comes to communications. Miscommunication can be the source of hurt feelings and arguments, but it isn't bad at all if you are just straightforward without being hurtful. Try to really understand one another.
It's also an excellent way to bolster your tertiary and repressed functions. I had virtually zero inner sensing capability (what I would call lack of empathy) but being with her forced me to work on those things. 
While I generally advocate for playing to your strengths, learning how to perceive things from a completely different perspective is often very interesting if not world-changing."
1669,isfj,"Hey, just wanted to say that you've been shadowbanned by the admins. All your posts went straight to the spam filter, people won't get notifications that you replied, and your profile isn't visible. I approved everything you posted here and infj, but you'll have this problem on every subreddit you go to."
1670,isfj,"I'm a super cautious person, and it's very slow for me to build trust with someone, so love doesn't happen very fast for me.
I was still waiting for red flags for the first 4-5 months of my current relationship, and once I realized he was a good guy and I could trust him, the love came a little while after that. "
1671,isfj,"yes, I do. But also, It’s hard for me to tell if we’re both compatible for each other because I over-empathize, and to the point where it is hard for me to realize the flaws in our relationship (until it’s too late). My relationships have mostly been bright but haven’t lasted long, because of that."
1672,isfj,"I'd say so? It doesn't take me long to bond with people platonically and otherwise, and with my boyfriend I realized I loved him pretty early on, but with both friends and my relationship it took a long time to be able to fully connect with them, if that makes sense. I have an ISFJ friend who seems to be the same way, but she's a bit more open than I am."
1673,isfj,no because it can be tricky . I mean you have to get to know that person really well in terms of personality and compatibility if you want an long lasting and successful relationship. I really really despise short term relationships
1674,isfj,"I have never really been in love, (for real) I have found several people attractive and such, but never fallen in love. Take notice that I am only 14(15 in December..). I am not stressing the whole love thing. It will come some day, and that's enough for me."
1675,isfj,"Yeah, it's pretty scary.
The early stages of a relationship aren't very fun for me, I'm usually filled with anxiety, overthinking everything my partner does or says, and I have my guard up.
The bright side is, once I do start to love and trust someone, it tends to be worth the wait, and I love them quite deeply."
1676,isfj,I don’t think so because you use the same functions despite your gender. But there are differences in how ISFJ males and females are perceived. I do think ISFJ females may have an easier time developing their Fe due to male stereotypes about us needing to be tough and thinker like. 
1677,isfj,"i dont really think so, but nurture; the gender and religion ETC.  affect us too. we are about 60 percent human nature, and 40 percent human nurture . 
so I guess it does affect us, but not human nature..?
hey, correct me if I'm wrong."
1678,isfj,"I love how warm, kind & supportive you guys are. Usually smart & funny. Seemingly knows what people need before they even know what they need. You guys are so friendly and approachable. Most days you make people feel good.
But yes its irritating when you guys insist on helping when its not needed and we tell you so. Or giving unsolicited advice. Ya'll can be stubborn & set in your ways....."
1679,isfj,"Would you say negative experiences in your childhood from watching too much T.V and absorbing too many things about the world that make you upset give you a sense of desire to change the world?
It's a common thing that ISFJs don't really like abandoning their experiences, but what if it was a negative one? Also what would you say your political orientations are?
And yes I'm ambitious like that."
1680,isfj,"I think my main motivator is a desire to help the disenfranchised, the sad, the lonely. This might be shaped by my own personal experiences, but I usually think of others when I think of changing the world. I want to change the world so that others can live better lives, and be happier in their lives. But, when I say change the world I do not mean by becoming a politician and actually forcing real change. I mean a more person-by-person experience. I want to make one person happier, then the next, then the next...
What do you mean by ""abandoning experiences""? Like, forgetting the experience? I doubt I could ever forget a truly bad experience. They probably shape a lot of who I am, because I feel so many things about them and they affect me a lot.
I'm not sure exactly how to define my political orientations (just never looked much into what defines them). But I'd say democrat/liberal/progressive-ish (which was not easy or fun as I am from a very conservative state and family). I am rooting for Bernie Sanders this election. "
1681,isfj,"My mom had to take an old TV out of my room when I was like 4 because I found CNN and started asking her why unemployment was such a problem in Chicago. Also, seeing all the mentally unhealthy kids in my family and community was part of what led me to go into psychology.
Edit: Conservative vs Liberal depends on the specific issue. Socially, I tend to lean liberal. However, this is the first election I can vote in and it's become such a shit-show that I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore."
1682,isfj,"An INTJ here but I thought I would throw out my opinion. I think the mind fears the unknown, pain, and annihilation. Annihilation means disappearing. The fear of death, insignificance, and being ignored fall into this category. Out of those three the fear of the unknown is the highest in my opinion.
While it makes logical sense that if you have a bad experience that you would avoid that and try to change that, but become to familiar with it, and the mind will have a hard time giving it up. Self sabotage is generally because of this factor. It is summarized in the following poem rather nicely:
Vice is a monster of so dreadful mien
that as to be hated needs but to be seen.
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
we first endure, then pity, then embrace.
For those of you that want to rise from the negative experiences that you may have had and help and change the world I laud you. It is not an easy thing to do. Please do not beat yourselves up over it if you find that you are trapped in a destructive cycle."
1683,isfj,"That's actually interesting... I think it's really great you want to help people on an individual to individual way, making lives better while doing it, because it actually happens. I think that the ability of a politician or something like that to do such a thing to prevent the problem from existing is all theoretical and is limited in that.
Ultimately though, I don't think power is necessary to create change, just public opinion is powerful enough to elect someone great into the seat to do great things.
By abandoning these experiences I mean going outside of them, so for instance, moving to a new city from where you grew up as a child. 
And thus debunks the myth that SJ = conservative. But isn't the fundamental core of SJs to be some-what attached to their past?"
1684,isfj,"I can see a lot of ways an ISFJ could be conservative. For me, growing up in the south I just equate conservatism with racism and hatred. I couldn't stand how it just seems conservatives hated poor people and anyone who didn't look like them (white). That was my initial reason (when I was young) to be different and not conservative... which meant democrat bc I thought it was the only other option.
As for moving away etc. I was able to move on from an abusive relationship and I've left my home town as well. So I was able to abandon that I guess?"
1685,isfj,"I tend to be really disgusted with the thought of talking about myself. I don’t like to boast about my accomplishments, because I feel like I’ll be coming off as narcissistic and trying to compete with another person. I like to hear what others are thinking and how their days are more often than discussing my own. I just want to listen rather than talk about myself. It’s hard for me to even think about what I think about myself. I think It’s just something I have to work on getting comfortable with, but I don’t feel comfortable expressing who I am in this world. "
1686,isfj,"I actually like talking about myself but only if I know the person is for sure going to be interested or already knows about the topic
Its a way to connect with people and if sharing things with someone and trying to talk about something new to them theyre clearly going to be uninterested in or even obviously dislike I dont see the point. Dont want to start any convos that would lead to a topic they wont care about"
1687,isfj,"I used to be very shy and wouldn’t open up at all as a teenager. Then when I was around 17 or 18 I realized I really enjoy talking about myself to others if they are interested. I realized I have nothing to hide, and I will answer just about any question about myself truthfully. My thing is, I won’t boast about my accomplishments unless it’s to a friend that boasts about theirs as well. For example I never talk about my relationship to my coworkers because I don’t want to make them feel bad since they don’t have that experience. But there is one coworker who opens up to me about her relationship, so I feel comfortable opening up to her about mine as well. I enjoy that kind of bonding a lot, but only if it goes both ways."
1688,isfj,"I couldn't have said it better myself. Sharing trivial thoughts/things about myself is no big deal but truly opening up feels impossible. Sometimes a few things unconsciously slip out when I'm with close friends (which is a good thing) but once I realize what's happening, I tend to feel anxious and uncomfortable. Not sure if this will help, but maybe try writing in a journal? I've tried doing it myself but lost motivation haha. Self-reflection is a good thing but for ISFJ's, I think we need to be careful not to ""fall too far"" into that type of mentality."
1689,isfj,"I feel very much like you most of the time. I do enjoy doing a lot of stuff but I can't help but feel that I would come off as a ""show off"" if I talked too much about myself. I only usually do it if it's related to something the other person mentions or if it can be helpful to them. I think that as long as it doesn't affect your state of mind, that should be ok, right?"
1690,isfj,"Same here. If someone starts a conversation with me about science, games, music, and other stuff I'm into, or ask questions about what I think about a certain thing, I'm not sure we can stop talking about it (or about me). If people are genuinely interested in hearing my side, I'm happy to oblige, but me talking about hobbies or making small talk as a conversation starter always feels awkward."
1691,isfj,"yes! i can see something like sharing details if they relate to the conversation... but what i really find hard to is if someone asks me just, the direct question “What do you think about yourself?” i get incredibly uncomfortable no matter the person, even if i really trust them, and I’m just scared I’m gonna come off like i’m boasting about myself. it makes me feel horrible and I have no idea how to answer it completely. it doesn’t always feel like there’s a definite answer since I don’t really completely know what I think about myself. "
1692,isfj,It's great that you have people who you can share your thoughts with/to! It's definitely more engaging and helpful for us when others are interested in what we say. Having a journal on the side would still be good though :) 
1693,isfj,"I don't know if it's an ISFJ thing, but I almost never have dreams that I would classify as good or enjoyable. I have a LOT of what I call stress dreams...not necessarily a nightmare (although I have those too) but a dream about something that should have been innocuous but instead is fraught with stress. I recently had a stressful dream in which I was making a sandwich. 
Honestly if I could sign up to never have dreams of any kind ever again, I would do it. Waking up from dreams like that leaves me feeling residual stress/anxiety and makes me feel less rested. 
Edit: I have had really intense dreams like you described too...waking up crying is awful. It doesn't happen to me super often, maybe a few times a year. "
1694,isfj,I have always had really intense and weird dreams. I just woke up from a nap and had a stressful dream that I woke up in my dream and was late for work and someone was in the house but I couldn't find them. They always feel really lifelike and I can only tell they're not real because I can't scream. 
1695,isfj,"Most of my dreams are stressful and unpleasant, with some bordering on becoming nightmares. I can rerember the few dreams that I've had that have ended well (tho getting to that ending was very stressful).
I used to always remember my dreams, but once I started smoking pot I rarely remember them other than a few small bits and pieces and knowing that it was scary. Flashes of my dream will come back to me or things will remind me of what I dreamed about throughout the day as well."
1696,isfj,"Actually, I rarely have dreams. At least, those I can remember. Today was an exception (I just woke up from a generally okay dream), but it's been weeks since I had a decent dream. Some that I do remember involve sex, or some really weird things."
1697,isfj,"I typically remember my dreams.. In addition to that I can be lucid and control them occasionally. 
Last night I had a bad dream (i'm not sure it would be classified as a nightmare) about me pulling out a rotting tooth.. To be fair I had a really shitty day. But most of my dreams aren't pleasant. "
1698,isfj,"I have some pretty novelic dreams. My dreams extend for hours and hours in the dream world and a ton of stuff happens in one continuous, honestly logically flowing line. I mean wacky stuff happens every now and then, but for the most part my dreams are pretty realistic. Like most of my dream scenarios could totally happen in real life. When it is supernatural, it's usually me doing something superhuman. (I'm a dude.) I also have deja vu a crap ton."
1699,isfj,"A really memorable dream of mine (I had more than once) is of a monster chasing me into this scary abandoned house and I run upstairs to this long hall with a bunch of doors. I run to a door, open it, run in, and I'm on a diving board with nothing but spikes below. I look behind me and the monster is there about to get me. I jump. Right before I land the spikes turn into popcorn and it's just a field of waist-high popcorn forever with 3 doors I can choose from like they had on Lets Make A Deal. Then some weird happy purple monster comes out of one door and a car is behind another. The purple monster doesn't care about anything though and is just happy walking around so it doesn't scare me. I don't remember anything after that. "
1700,isfj,"Really warped dreams.  My brain puts together people and situations that don't have a chance of being in the same space or time and sort of just runs away with it.
I have actually had layered dreams before, where I ""woke up"" within the dream but did not actually wake up.  Not quite lucid dreaming, because I had not realized until after the dream that the waking up was also a dream.  (damn, that was confusing.)
And of course stress dreams - I was in charge of planning an event that was to take place the next morning, and had a nightmare that I didn't wake up in time to get to the event on time.  Woke up in a cold sweat half an hour before my alarm went off."
1701,isfj,"I have really vivid dreams and when I have nightmares they're truly horrifying. When I was little I felt pain from one.. It was awful. They almost always wake me up and bring me to tears regardless. I tend to dream about things that are present in my life. For example, I have huge anxiety about school. I do online schooling now but sometimes I have dreams where I'm back at school and I'm sitting there freaking out because I know that I'm not supposed to be there heh. Other times I'll dream about something that's more of an underlying issue. Like a friend I really miss but haven't thought about for a long time. 
But like others have mentioned when I'm feeling a lot of stress in my life I'll end up having stress dreams and wake up feeling like I hadn't even slept. Sleep is incredibly important for me so when it's lacking I fall apart."
1702,isfj,"Does emotional count as stressful?
Because every night I had a lot of those. They are always filled with intense love, fear, sadness, happiness, etc.
For example, I dreamt that my mom was sitting in a grassy field, I came over and rested my head on her lap, and I started remembering when I use to always fall asleep that way. Then I started crying because I was so scared that she'd have to die someday and I'll never get to experience something so safe again. I woke up in tears, and I had to call my mom right away. Even now I'm getting kind of emotional because I remember the dream so clearly"
1703,isfj,"I don't know about everyone else on this sub, but I have a very interesting reaction when playing a game with a frustrating part. Instead of getting upset and crying about it... I get hysterical. I'm laughing hard as ever over how absurd the challenge is, and I keep attempting it. Possibly if it's pattern based repeating what I need to out loud so i can remember what i need to do.
Anyone have any similar reactions? Or just unusual reactions when at a frustrating spot in a game? "
1704,isfj,"I don’t get hysterical. I usually get frustrated/annoyed and leave it for a bit to come back to it later, when I’m ready to try again. But there’s one Gameboy Color game that I’ve basically given up on.. after 14 years. I haven’t gotten the nerve to come back and work at it!"
1705,isfj,"Same. I got a funny look just a few days ago because I was cracking up hard after dying in Mario. I think it was just the absurdity of the death that got to me. I promise I was trying to win but to the casual observer it would have appeared that I jumped in a hole for no reason. But usually it's two or three laughs, being frustrated, then quitting for a while when I start failing at the same spot repeatedly."
1706,isfj,"I really think one of my favorite musicians, Marit Larsen, is an ISFJ. Her songs are very Si-Fe heavy. 
Example:
""I Can't Love You Anymore"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBdJSTPRifs
""Coming Home"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzfkxexhcQg
""What If?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R18ypD_de_Q 
What do you think?"
1707,isfj,"I thought her voice sounded super familiar, looked her up, and found out she was part of M2M.  They were my jam when I was younger, haha.  I heard Marion on another album a few years ago, but I didn't know Marit was still making music.  "
1708,isfj,One thing that upset me about M2M was how in their last album the producers totally fucked Marit Larsen over by making Marion the center of attention in the band and oversexualizing her. Tbh I think that's the biggest reason why their album flopped and the band fell apart. The label went on to give Marion a solo deal while Marit walked away with nothing.
1709,isfj,"ENTP girl here. Recently had a big falling out with an ISFJ friend (also female), and I suspect it was, at least in some part, due to our differing personality types. Just wondering what your experiences have been with ENTPs.
Thanks!"
1710,isfj,"Can I discuss a couple guys I knew who were these personality types?
They seemed to be activity partners more than anything, other than that they appeared to me to get along more in groups than hanging out together. 
The ENTP guy thought of his ISFJ friend as one who was uptight. 
The ISFJ thought of the ENTP as one who was kind of odd, a stoner, and sometimes arrogant. 
I'd say they wouldn't get along otherwise if it wasn't for their mutual friend groups. "
1711,isfj,"I married an ISFJ and let me tell you, it's been one heck of an interesting ride. But the differences have made us grow as people in ways I never imagined. Pm me if you want some details. But it's been a lot of hard work for both of us."
1712,isfj,"My brother is an ENTP, and growing up with him was a living hell. He was always bullying me and hitting me. I would scream. He would threaten to beat me up. I would cry to our mom. She would tell us both off and sometimes ground us. It wasn't a pretty relationship and I'm pretty sure he's the reason why I have a hard time sticking up for myself. To be fair, I did my own share of fighting. It was always him who started it though. 
One nice thing he did though, he told me to go to 7/11 to buy him something and said I could buy myself a slurpee with the extra money. He then said, ""leave now before I change my mind!"" 
He was always ordering me to do stuff for him, and for some unexplainable reason, I'd follow his orders without thinking... I was like that with everyone though. My closest friends were usually bossy.
Aside from his behavior towards me (which possibly isn't ENTP-related anyway), he had some sort of superiority complex where he was ""always right"" and a know-it-all. Constantly arguing and dismissing others' opinions, usually with insults to their intelligence. I remember one time our mom made him help me with math (my worst subject). It ended with him calling me an idiot for not understanding because ""it's so easy!"". He was a straight A student, and had tons of friends. Teachers thought he was so smart and brilliant, which probably just added to his superiority complex.
Now that we are adults, we don't talk to each other at all. I only see him at holidays but even now, he's stopped coming to family gatherings (long story short he's ""disowned"" my mother for things that never happened, in addition to being an overall jackass to everyone else. tbh, I think he's been in ""the Grip"" for the past few years, if you've heard of that).
Of course, I'm aware that not all ENTPs are like him, and I'm sorry to all the good, mature ENTPs. I wouldn't let my experience keep me from having casual friendships with one, but I imagine a romantic relationship would not go well."
1713,isfj,"This sounds pretty spot on (besides the stoner part).  
I think we mostly became friends because of our mutual group, and we are interested in the same things, but when we actually got alone together it always ended up badly. "
1714,isfj,I'm an ISFJ married to an ENTP - I hear you! It can be super difficult sometimes but more rewarding 
1715,isfj,"Sorry to hear about your brother, he sounds pretty rough. 
As for a romantic relationship, I like to think that my (ENTP) relationship with my wife (ISFJ) is pretty good proof that it can work. (and we were best friends before we started dating, as well) We compliment each other very well and as long as communicate well with the other we get along famously."
1716,isfj,"Its really hard for me to objectively look at my own behaviors, but I'd rather ask you all because I think most ISFJ descriptions online are really off the mark. They lack a lot of the depth of character I see on this subreddit. "
1717,isfj,"I am glad you are enjoying this subreddit! I love the community of people here, and I agree that their descriptions are deeper and more personal. 
Anyway, regarding the topic- Well, no, but actually yes. 
As a basic participant- a person on the bus, buying coffee, or asking for prices over the phone- I have the social schema necessary to be a harmless, mostly blameless member of society. 
As a friend, I’ve accepted that a huge part of my personality is being accommodating at the expense of my own beliefs and smoothing things over in groups- and a lot of people find that easy to accept. I think if people don’t like it, they probably keep it to themselves because they don’t want to be the one who says “stop being nice you faking faker” to my face. I don’t give them the conversation option to lash out at me for this.
But I can’t really deny who I am, even if Fe is bomb. I will never be able to blend in without occluding a lot of what I stand for. I have antisocial and distinctly unpalatable beliefs that inform my actions and kind of make the nice part that denies them, like the darkness in chiaroscuro. 
I have a lot of Fi friends, and they just lay it all out and let people accept or reject it. On one hand, they face a lot more real rejection. Scary af. On the other, I have to reject myself every day. It’s a trade off. 
Edit: sp"
1718,isfj,"I do find myself feeling that I don't fit in sometimes - I feel that many people just don't want to be decent to each other.  I feel like I'm viewed as ""fake"" sometimes even though I find myself to be a very genuine person.  I feel like my attempts at reaching out to people are sometimes stepped on.  I feel like some other people don't care about what I care about, or make an effort to understand my feelings, even though I try my best to understand theirs and be supportive.  
I have been hated by people before, and by hated, I do mean hated.  A girl hated me for giving off a ""bad vibe.""  I've often found that I have trouble making close friends when introduced into a new environment, partly because I'm quiet, and partly because I don't always have the same interests as others.  
I've been loved by people before, mainly older people - when I was in pre-school, I apparently liked to sit around the teachers and talk to them instead of going out and talking to my peers, which is something my parents enjoy telling me about.  I'm typically described by others as a ""nice"" person.  "
1719,isfj,"Yes and no. 
Two constant descriptions of me im often told by others are that im “nice/kind” and “quirky/totally myself”. Both can alienate me or accept me. Get a good reaction or bad.
I think everyone want to be accepted and often I’ve always struggled with being accepted by large groups and people. Social anxiety also plays a part of it so it can put me at a higher frequency. 
I love to please and see people happy. Like I love seeing my friends, family, classmates, and even strangers just living their best life and having everything just flow. However, if you’re constantly bending yourself to always please other people they can see it as fake, take advantage of you, and burn yourself out. 
On the other hand, I can’t do it say something I don’t believe in or my actions aligned with my beliefs to some extent. I can’t compliment just to compliment. I can’t say I believe in certain beliefs just to feel accepted or not be attacked. My actions and my words will always be from the core of who I am. However, I can alter the output or play around with it to keep things harmonious in groups. Though when extremely pushed I will stick to my bottom line. it gets me in trouble at times.
I think all the types struggle with this. Just, in the ISFJ’s perspective it’s trying to keep a balance of being happy for your loved ones and others and bending over backwards from them till burnout. Also, doing what we truly want and what we truly are even if it seems selfish to us when it’s not. 
The middle way is both. I think ISFJ’s have a natural talent for social situations and understanding people’s feelings. Also we are all extremely different and people are often surprised/amazed of the personality behind us past the social faux. 
I feel the strongest and the most accepted when I  can accomplish both. I can stand on my own two feet and be an individual person and I can help those I care about without burnout. "
1720,isfj,I feel like I am not belong to Society because of my flaw. I am just on verge of being in society. I just living here to fulfill needs and offer my servises. I really dont care what random people think over me. I feel really shit when I disappoint coworkers or anyone from my tribe like yesterday when I couldnt find carrot juice in store for my coworker he really wanted. Yeah it is this level of crying over irreveleant shit.
1721,isfj,"Yes, sometimes I do.
I'm pretty shy but my face really lacks emotion, so most people just assume that I'm a heartless and quiet person. I love agreeing with other people, so much that I'll pretty much change my opinion about something just so I can come onto agreeing terms with them. Another reason why my opinions are so easily changed is just because I don't want to get made fun of or anything like that.
Sometimes I feel like I don't belong in society because I feel so invisible. It's so easy for me to be overlooked. Most of the time when I leave the room or something like that no one really notices my absence, not even my friends. Plus, my voice is really quiet, so that doesn't help. 
I also don't think I quite fit into the mould of a usual ISFJ. I wouldn't say I'm that nice of a person and I tend to put my happiness over others. Plus, if others are sad, it doesn't really influence my mood that much. ....These things don't really sit well with me.
I feel pretty relieved that there's someone else out there that feels the same way about the ISFJ descriptions online. How are you typing yourself?"
1722,isfj,"I don’t think people have a strong reaction to my personality since I tend to keep to myself a lot and do my own thing a lot. I do sometimes feel alienated from society especially when I fall into an Si-Ti loop. I know high school can be a rough time and I felt alienated in high school. But not as much anymore, I do see myself as an individual with my own desires and passions. "
1723,isfj,"I know I have introverted sensing for sure, but I was having a tough time determining whether I use Fe or Fi. I knew, no matter what, it was high in the stack. 
After listening to some podcasts, I'm pretty confident I am typed correctly as an INFP. However, I can see why the two types can identify with and as each other. "
1724,isfj,"I think a lot of people think:
Intuitive: Smart, but probably a weirdo or nerd.
Sensor: Normie party animal or basic bitch.
They act like it has more meaning than it does when really its just this: One is a preference abstract/future oriented thinking and the other has a preference for concrete/present and past oriented thinking. Personality traits/cultural preferences/hobbies apart from that are extra."
1725,isfj,"Ah, the dreaded stereotypes.
""Omg you like parties? Must be a sensor.""
""Wow that person's weird, must be an intuitive.""
I've lost count of the amount of times when people have made those kinds of conclusions, it's almost funny. There's also people correlating interests/skills with certain types, like someone who's good at sports must be an ESTP, sort of thing."
1726,isfj,"Do any of you guys become instantly socially drained and develop a headache after talking to someone who talks a lot? 20 min into the conversation and I’m ready to end it so I can retreat to a quiet place to recharge. This didn’t use to be a problem for me but I feel like as I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more and more itnroverted. "
1727,isfj,Might sound a bit harsh but if I'm not really interested in what the other person is saying then I definitely do.  In fact I have to hide yawning as it saps my energy. Also find it hard when the person doesn't give you time to speak and talks over you (not always in a rude way but it just feels a bit suffocating).
1728,isfj,"If I'm really comfortable with that person, I wouldn't mind listening to them talk. Awkward conversations/conversations with people I don't like are a different thing though. Sometimes I'm the one who talks too much because I'm just too naggy and I overexplain everything!
I do feel drained after being with super enthusiastic and talkative people though, just that it usually has to involve me hanging out with them for 4/5 hours before I feel tired."
1729,isfj,It depends on the person and the conversation. Deep conversations are great. Fluff conversations are draining. Though recently I met someone who I had a deep.conversatiom but she uses... Fluff talking points. Or something. I'm not sure yet but something was not completely genuine in how she talked. And that was draining as well.
1730,isfj,"Hey guys, ISFJ male here. Does anyone else get a really big social confidence boost after they’ve “done well” in a new social situation and immediately after it feel like they can talk to absolutely anyone in the room? I’m the kind of person who has to gear up in a big social setting by slowly making my way through the room or a table, so if the first few interactions with people don’t go well then I will naturally lose interest in talking to more people and end up wanting to leave. But if it goes well inside i am actually gleaming! I think I get very happy when people are friendly back and must take it badly/personally when not. "
1731,isfj,"As a female, it's totally me as well. I'm always cautious in social situations and then I'll retreat if I feel like an interaction didn't go over well. But if I feel confident and good about an interaction, I feel on top of the world. . Like I could talk to anyone in the room "
1732,isfj,I personally dislike when people constantly get mad at other people for trivial things such as their physical appearance or some other small but personal thing they choose to do in their life. Do other ISFJs also feel strongly against harsh judgment on individuals? 
1733,isfj,"Good question Sharpes_Sword!  
My ISFJ Wife never backbite and is very mercyful with people even if they are bad.
In my point of view its wasted time to backbite about people. Usually I neither do it or feel offended when others do.  
When I am very angry, the worst thing is a little rant about somebody, but after some minutes its normal again."
1734,isfj,"I commonly hear people talk about other people, both people they know and strangers, and say damaging things about them for just about every little reason they can find. I find this very annoying and its something that comes up often. For example, a stranger may come by, and one of my friends will talk about how ugly their socks are, or something to that effect."
1735,isfj,"I am an ISFJ, been with my ENTJ boyfriend for 4 years now and I can concur this is accurate
He thinks so logically that he also sees it as a waste of time.
Personally, I just don’t like when people are bitchy for no reason so it works out lol"
1736,isfj,I totally agree. It more so bothers me bc it’s so petty. I hate petty people who just say shit just to say something. I also dislike people who are pessimists and complain constantly. The sock comment for instance....totally pointless and does not need to be said. Brings nothing to the table except negativity 
1737,isfj,"Fellow ISFJ's, I lost my perfect-for-me best friend (also an ISFJ; someone FINALLY understood me!!!) in February, and my heart feels torn to shreds. I don't want to give up hope that someone else can fill that spot in my heart, but it felt so perfect that I don't know how it could ever happen again.
Anyone here looking for that soulmate kind of friend that so many of us crave so much? It seems like every time I try to get close to someone, they're too busy or they already have that friend and don't need another one.
Thought I'd come here with some hope to see if any of you have been looking for someone to connect with. Who knows? Maybe we've been looking for each other the whole time!!!
(If this post breaks the rules, feel free to delete.)"
1738,isfj,I'm from a small town and attend a cliquey University - I too have found that it's really hard connecting with others when they're already in established friendships! There are people like me that are still searching though :)
1739,isfj,"Hit me up! I’m always up for deep connections and as someone who has also lost her best friend of ten years, I appreciate making new friends. I don’t believe that anyone can fill the gaps people leave when they leave as everyone is unique and we never really forget them. But we move on and meet other people to share life with and create new memories."
1740,isfj,"Yep. I haven’t had that super comfortable, together all the time kind of friend for almost 5 years, since I had a falling out with my former best friend. I have a nice group of friends but I miss having that one person who’s always there and always gets me. "
1741,isfj,"I found my soulmate friend in college.. I don’t know what her type is, but conversations with her are the most rewarding. We live in separate states though and don’t talk more than once a month. I haven’t found any girlfriends in my new state that I’ve connected with on the same level. I have met some cool people, but I wish I had a best friend out here. I have it better than my boyfriend though.. it’s so hard for guys to make friends."
1742,isfj,"Yes, I know this feeling deeply. Still putting myself out there and trying to meet people -- have not met my ""friend-mate"" yet, but she must be out there. Here are two of my previous posts:
Don't Want to Bother People
Revealing True Self
I have acquaintances and people I talk to from work, my boyfriend's friends, ladies from my Zumba class... but no one I can talk to deeply.
Good luck, and do not give up. I have not yet and it is not always easy but you just have to keep going.
You can message me if you ever need, and best of luck to you!"
1743,isfj,"Yes I’m looking!!! I had a falling out with my best friend/roommate a few years back then moved 2,000 miles away. We recently reconnected and I love her to bits, but long-distance just isn’t the same:( I haven’t made any real friends since being here- just coworkers and acquaintances. 
I did meet a guy that I’m currently dating but he’s an INTP and the connection definitely isn’t the same!! (BFF is an INFP) I’m hoping to meet someone I can connect with like I did with her, but I’m not counting on it tbh. "
1744,isfj,"My boyfriend is an ISFJ and has extreme jealousy. I love him so very much, but I feel like his jealousy is tearing us apart.
He is very insecure about his smile and I think that affects his confidence significantly. We’re working on it, but it takes time to do a lot of dental work.
I don’t know if that’s the root of his confidence issues, and if it was fixed that his insecurities would improve. 
I do things that make him jealous, not on purpose, but he’s uncomfortable with so many things. He’s very suspicious of other men. I went out my a female friend of mine, and we happened to go out to her friends house, who is a male. There were other people there, but he went insane with jealousy over me being at a man’s house.
I just don’t know whether things will improve. I want to stick it out because I adore him, but I’m tired of arguing. I just want him to trust me."
1745,isfj,"yes. red flags.
Jealousy over other men instead of trust in you is a red flag and in no way your fault. you are not doing things to make him jealous. he is jealous of you doing normal things. please remember that. his emotions are not your responsibility.
you need to get out. please. for your own sake. please."
1746,isfj,"I’m sorry but this isn’t ‘ISFJ behaviour’ this is ‘bad behaviour’ that isn’t your sole responsibility to fix. He needs to work on that himself, and soon. What’s next? You can’t see xxx friend as he doesn’t like it? You can’t go to xxx place as he’ll cause a fuss... ?? I expect you’ll soon hear “If you really loved me you wouldn’t do xxx” ??? 
Before long you’ll be watching every word you say for fear of his mood and temper. Please please please lay down your boundaries now before it’s too late xx"
1747,isfj,"Jealous ISFJ's are dangerous and fragile. That jealousy will turn into destruction eventually. I have dated two EXTREMELY jealous ISFJs in the past. They falsely used the woman card on me to get me arrested for domestic violence(have never laid a hand on any woman). 
Imagine what a man would do. Get out now while you still have a chance. There is no hope. He will eventually cheat on you to make himself feel justified. He is also probably getting attention from other women but not acting on it. Check his facebook. I guaruntee you that I am right."
1748,isfj,"It might sound tough and irrational but is it even possible for you to avoid going to places where there are other males.
You do it for a month or two, make him realise that you can do it for him,  then as he calms down between that phase, try to dig deeper, reach that root cause of his jealousy.
Mostly theres an insecurity, try to find that.
But 1st if you truely love him, dont go to places where he gets jealous. 
Coming from a psychologist..."
1749,isfj,"I’m sorry but I think this is really bad advise. I don’t think this will help at all. Won’t he just expect this to be a permanent solution? Isn’t this just a band aid which will enable his jealous insecurities? 
He needs to some work, for himself, to get to the root of his insecurities. Because let’s face it, feeling like this all the time must be horrible for him as much as anything. If therapy isn’t an option, there are probably some good self help books he could try. 
I find the line ‘if you truely love him’ so troubling here. I would say, if you really love him, support him and get him some help but absolutely don’t enable his jealous behaviour because that will just breed more and possibly worse problems, not help anyone. Avoiding males is nearly impossible, so when it does inevitably happen, he’s going to blow up big time.
Your reddit history states you’re about to study to be a psychologist...not that you are one...."
1750,isfj,are you serious? you're a psychologist? what? this is the advise you for give to another psychologist who is trying to figure out someone or to someone figuring themselves out. but this is not the advice you give someone who is in a controlling relationship where they are being emotionally manipulated into blaming themselves over their other's behaviors toward them.
1751,isfj,"Well, if he does, then the option to walk out always exists. 
Everyone has advised OP to walk out immediately, for that is the preferred solution among Reddit's age group. So there is no harm in trying this for a month, and then walking out."
1752,isfj,"I feel the same way... Reddit’s age group will literally tell you to walk out on any person because of a flaw. I have plenty of flaws. I’m selfish, lazy and indecisive. I can name plenty more. I don’t think that makes me a terrible person because I have plenty of good qualities as well. 
I didn’t really come to hear the obvious advice that I should leave him. I know that’s an option available to me. I’m wondering what I can do to show my ISFJ that I love and care about him, while at the same time retaining my freedom. I still do what I want, and I don’t let him hold me back. Do the arguments stress me out? Absolutely.
There’s something to be said for sticking with a relationship and building trust. It’s not absolutely irrational that someone wouldn’t trust in the beginning, only to develop trust over time."
1753,isfj,"Ah, you're the OP! I'm so glad to hear your thoughts, because I was close to deleting my comments here since I was feeling like an idiot :-/ 
Yeah, I think the best way is to do what he wants for a couple of weeks (maybe a month at max). Then talk to him. Tell him that you love him, and that you are willing to do this much for him, but not forever. In the early stages of any relationship, people tend to be anxious, and if you can help him cope with his anxiety, I'm hoping that over time, he eases up. 
I completely agree!
Tldr: Be supportive now but if things don't improve even after a few months, then you may need to cut your losses. Right now, it's too early to tell."
1754,isfj,"I'm 21 and have a memory so good it is holding me back from moving on. I can remember things from when I was three years old. But the memories I have when I was 13 years and up really hold me back. I Have constant ""flashbacks"" of the past going back to the 7th grade. It's like watching my memories on TV. To be honest, most of these memories are of vacations with family, trips, middle school, high school, and even driving down a random street or eating at a random restaurant with my family. I'm never ""alone"" in these memories/flashbacks. Some days they don't happen at all and some days they happen every minute. Anyone else have these?"
1755,isfj,"After poring over this for the last two weeks, I've decided to come to Reddit and get this issue out of my hair once and for all.
I met an ISFJ guy a couple weeks ago through a mutual friend. I was instantly attracted to him, but refrained from letting anything escalate because I am currently in a long-term relationship (almost 6 years now). However, a series of strange things happened and I am still trying to figure out if I had misread his behavior or not. Let's call the ISFJ guy, Tim.
I sincerely didn't think that I would see Tim again. I had invited him to come out to my church, but didn't think he'd actually come. However, he did end up coming twice, and the second time he came, I was the only one available to host him and his friend both because my boyfriend was away that weekend. Tim said he had to leave by 6pm, so I figured our time together would be short. From 3pm-6pm, we hung out and ate with a large group of people. Some of my friends teased him about me and I remember him blushing a lot. But I didn't think much of it because he's a very shy, nervous, reserved, and quiet guy. 
When it became 6pm, I invited him to come to a going away party with me and everyone else. Despite having said he had to leave earlier, he came and stayed the whole time. We ended up talking the whole 3-4 hours. We started to get playful with each other. I said I was going to go to a bookstore after the party and I invited him to come. He initially declined because his home was very, very far and the bookstore was in the opposite direction. However, I pushed a little and said he should come since he was leaving the country in two days. He relented and ended up coming. We stayed there until closing time (10pm) and had a great time just talking, getting to know one another, slightly teasing each other, etc. We had such a good time that he invited me to another hangout the next day (granted, with another friend). 
When we hung out the next day, he seemed nervous all over again. He was smiling a lot and a little red, but like I said - he tends to be a nervous guy. While we were all shopping (him, me, and one of his female friends), I swear I saw him glance at me a few times very discreetly. When I opened my phone to check my texts, he was right behind me and I swear I saw him glance very briefly at the screen. Also, this is a bit random, but I was carrying a giant finger toy absentmindedly. While I was looking around, he came carrying the same giant finger toy to poke mine. It seemed kind of flirtatious. However, the minute after I started talking about my boyfriend (our other friend was asking a lot of questions), he immediately became... different. He was noticeably more ""tired"" and ""bored."" He became less active. He seemed to shut off. I should mention that whenever I mentioned my boyfriend, he seemed to do this.
I was pretty certain that he was at least a little attracted to me. He didn't really know what to do with his hands. On Sunday, he was extremely nervous and flushed bright red upon seeing me. By the end of Sunday, he was laughing, smiling, and confiding personal things to me. He spent practically the whole day with me that day too. On Monday, he seemed to show all the signs again.
However, our mutual friend did mention that Tim tends to be very laid-back about time and probably felt a little lonely because all his friends had already left the country by then. He said that at the most, Tim probably just genuinely enjoyed my company and thought I was cool. Also, Tim tends to hangout with a lot of girls. He's just that kind of guy. He's genuinely nice and tends to just go with the flow.
I did confront Tim after Monday. I asked him nicely if he had done all those things because he was interested in me. He said no and said he was sorry for making it seem that way. 
I'm going to admit that I am hoping he was attracted to me - at least a little bit. He has reasons to lie. He knows I have a boyfriend that I love very much. He was leaving the country in two days. His feelings probably didn't gain enough traction for a confession of any sort. It was probably a brief infatuation at best.
I have told my boyfriend about the whole situation and we have dealt with it as well. I am ready to put all of this behind me, but I just want to know if I was wrong to think that this guy might have been crushing on me at least a little bit. 
Oh, I should mention - Tim told me he was an ISFJ. I am wondering if it's typical of ISFJ men to just go ahead and do things like this or go this far without any feelings whatsoever. What do you guys think? 
Thanks for the help. Like I said - I'm going to move past this as soon as I get an answer. And no - nothing happened at all between Tim and I except conversation."
1756,isfj,"I'm an isfj guy,  I think he handled it in the way I would have.  Wants to get to know you ""deeply"",  eventually he falls for ya (although he probably started out that way). In the end he can't bring himself to say he had feelings (it would complicate things).  Thought it better to cut his losses and let go.  From the info you provided I think he liked you,  but he knew you had a boyfriend and his morals don't allow him to intervene. "
1757,isfj,"Isfj guy here too. I used to have a crush on this girl for a long time. And my social behavior was almost exactly how you described Tim's. Every time before I saw her, I would get nervous and flustered. But whenever I would be hanging out with her in groups, over time I would slowly adjust and get more comfortable in interacting with her. If I were Tim and this whole ordeal was just over the course of like a week, and I knew you had a boyfriend, I would've done the exact same thing.
I think it's just in the isfj's nature to not want to hurt you/ cause anything disruptive to happen in your life. 99 times out of 100 they would rather suffer themselves than see that they caused pain in the life of someone that they care about."
1758,isfj,"I would see myself doing this kind of thing.
ISFJs and ENTPs are in the same quadrant. We share the same functions.
I would be more in the lound and brash tsundere end, but all the rest may be in common : 


Blushing


Nervous tics :


Twisting hands


Nervous laughing


Stealthy looks


Following even if it means having my sleep schedule screwed up (It's a bigger sign of interest from me personally as I'm pretty rigid about my sleeping time, as I'm autistic. No sleep means not picking up social cues, means being screwed hard.)


I think there is nothing surprising in how he behaved. Clearly crushed.
Just the phone thing that make me uneasy as it happen to me to read other people's phones above their shoulder, when I know it's not respecting their intimacy. It's a curiosity reflex for me, and I snap out of it when I remember what I'm doing.
I'm a bit ashamed of it, though.
There is one thing that kept my attention : the church.
Christian ?"
1759,isfj,"ISFJ guy here, all that has been said from the other commenters is true, I can see myself doing some of those things to an extent. 
It seems that he was definitely attracted to you. It happens to us easily if you are our 'type'  (sorry not the greatest word), it's really quite overwhelming and we might do things that may be contrary to what the norm is for us. I suppose that is the way we handle it. 
He definitely would have thought about the day a lot and that's why he apologised and feigned the truth about liking you. It is not our intention to seem deceptive or sneaky but I think we do this to preserve how others might perceive us. You handled it really well, you were very nice about it. We are a little fragile sometimes and  things which may seem small have a lasting impact."
1760,isfj,"I can say this very thing happened to me recently.
In addition to what everyone said above, you probably didnt mean to lead him on but after hanging out and giving the impression you had a mutual long term interest (with how flirtatious it seemed) then suddenly bringing up a boyfriend after makes it seem like all the effort he put to giving you attention was a waste.
While he was being nice, he was probably disappointed and likely beating himself over it for thinking he even had a long term chance with you."
1761,isfj,"Thanks so much for your insight. I think the reason why I doubt things a little is because he seems like the type of guy who'd just do things without thinking. Maybe he just genuinely enjoyed my company and thought I was cool, you know? Aren't ISFJ guys known to go out of their way to do nice things for other people - sometimes, going above and beyond? How can I know for sure if an ISFJ guy likes me or not?"
1762,isfj,"Hey Grumble-Cakess, just wanted to thank you for your input. It was unbelievably helpful. While I don't think he had very strong feelings for me at all since we are practically strangers (and at best, acquaintances), I think you're right about his behavior. He does seem like a peacemaker. 
Question - let's say that I read his behavior all wrong and he just tends to be a nervous and awkward guy in general to everyone. Even with that factor gone, do the other signs seem to indicate that he was interested?
Thank you once again."
1763,isfj,"Thanks so much for your reply. For naturally shy people, isn't it normal to be nervous and have nervous tics around most people? 
And yes - Christian! But having questions and going through some doubts. "
1764,isfj,"Hey Nicobadass, thanks for sharing. I really appreciate that you took the time to respond! It was a lot to read through. Thank you for also affirming the way I handled the situation. I didn't want to hurt his pride.
It's crazy to think that there are certain commonalities across many, if not all, ISFJ men. All of you seem to be saying the same things. 
Question - is it true that ISFJ men are intensely private and reserved? How does this affect the way you handle a crush?
Thanks!"
1765,isfj,"Depends. Some learn to hide that.
I would be worried if you weren't walking your road.
That doubt is opendmindedness. The only way to lose is to totally adhere to dogma. Some people are ok with that, finding it secure, but it's not my case.
That's what I was thinking about to check, anyway. You're perfectly fine to me."
1766,isfj,"We are intensely private and reserved but it totally depends from person to person who we are private to. I think if I really trusted someone I would tell them anything and everything. If it was just an acquaintance they wouldn't know much about me.. I've been called aloof before but I that's not my intention.
In terms of how we handle a crush, I would say once the floodgates are open and I trust someone I will confide in them completely. For better and for worse. I think I've ruined things with a girl I loved by wanting to share deeply, they probably saw too much of my soul!"
1767,isfj,"I should mention that this ""distraction"" came at the worst time. I was extremely devout - almost fundamentalist in my convictions. However, I've recently been reading through some literature and listening to some lectures on the controversies of Christianity. As a result, I've been experiencing rather intense existential insecurity.
Your words come at a good time. It is interesting that you say that. Releasing dogma and habit have been devastating me inside. However, I know that it is the inevitable byproduct of truth. Here's to hoping that the truth will expand in me."
1768,isfj,"That the world isn't perfect don't mean there's no god.
It just means that god made us to his image. Flawed.
I don't believe in truth. I believe we can be at best honest in our thinking. That's how I've understood what you meant by saying you're searching for truth.
I rarely discuss spirituality, because it remains hidden under the polemic subject of religion.
It's a shame : I like to discuss beliefs and philosophy."
1769,isfj,"To be clear, I  refer to infj as put forward by that article. The infj who gives Big Brother a run for his money in the surveillance department.
So I am sure you're excellent.
With an ISFJ as well. I'll be in an old folks home when I finally decided if that was a good idea or not."
1770,isfj,"I am an ISFP (male) and one of my closest ISFJ friends is really funny, nice, supportive, etc. and I am NOT saying this applies to all ISFJ's at all, this is the only one that I've gotten close with so I am wondering if she is just an exception.
The one thing that I dislike about her is that while she CAN understand when I am annoyed or frustrated or sad (most of the time), she won't have any clue what it's like to experience what I am experiencing, if that makes sense.
I know she is Fe and I am Fi dominant, but still, I feel like ISFJ's are good at listening to someone and understanding why they feel how they feel?  She will feel sad when I am sad, but she won't know what to say or understand unless I explain it over and over and over (but still won't know what to say).
I am not trying to stereotype, I just want to know whether this is her problem specifically. Don't worry I still love her and all you ISFJ's "
1771,isfj,"I'm ISFJ... and I'm a little bit like this.. we are emotional, but not exactly good with verbalizing emotions.. 
I do everything to help my loved ones feel understood or feel better - through actions, gestures or just sticking around doing things for them or comforting them with my body language.. but I tend to fall short verbally. I've improved a lot over the years, but I struggle very much to speak up during emotional times.. Sometimes I don't say much when my loved one is very upset, because it would look like I am trivializing the issue with my words that would seem superficial for the way they feel so I render a silent shoulder to lean on.
I hope this answers your doubt? :) Does she comfort or support you? "
1772,isfj,"INFP here requesting help with ISFJ mother...
My mom tries... HARD. But she has a number of shortcomings that have been difficult to ignore as of late. 
For instance:
-She will work herself to the bone and spread herself so thin that she barely takes any time for herself. And on top of that, she never asks for help! 
-If nobody offers her help or foresees her needs, she gets very upset. 
-She places blame on others even when she is at fault herself. 
-She is paranoid, quick to defensiveness, and suspects that people are talking negatively about her when, in fact, they are not.
-She is often in denial about issues in the house (for instance, the dogs keep going to the bathroom in the front room creating an awful smell and ruining the carpet) and things are very cluttered
-She is paranoid about her food habits. She pretends like she eats Keto but then turns around and eats rice or bread or something, but is like legitimately afraid of carbs. She tortures herself over food!
-She complains all the time. About food allergies or general aches and ailments. But she NEVER DOES ANYTHING ABOUT IT. She would even offer to share a dish with you that she might have a negative reaction to, unless you realize what is happening and change your mind about what you want.
-She goes to church and is a deacon, even though she complains about going all the time? She victimizes herself over church all the time as if she's Jesus Christ or something.
-She is oblivious to the world around her. She is addicted to stupid phone games. She runs into people at the grocery store.
Okay, so this has been quite venty. I'm aware that these issues might not necessarily be ISFJ things, but more individual problems. And I haven't mentioned how loving and dedicated she is to her family. She is very well-meaning so it's hard to get mad at her. But, I'm asking you ISFJ folk, how do I get through to her with the self-victimization and the repression and the retreating from reality?
Edit: After some thought, I think I should add... My ISTJ father does NOT give her the kind of support she needs. So a lot of these problems may stem from marital stress..."
1773,isfj,"Oh wow. Yeah. I can see some isfj traits but it sounds much more like there's an underlying mental/emotional health issue going on here. And the non-supportive family isn't doing much for her either. It's apparent in the lack of spousal support that there's a marital breakdown. You can't do much about that. That's between the two of them. But I mean, you clearly can see that your mom needs help. Don't wait for her to ask you to help her. Did it ever occur to you that at some point she got tired of cleaning up after the dog and just said f' it! If no one else cares about cleaning up the dog piss why should she? But seriously, she sounds exactly like someone else's mother I know. She hasn't seen a doctor, a dentist, or an optometrist in years. I'm certain she can't see yet she continues to drive a car. She talks smack about people in the room under her breath yet loud enough for others to hear then pretends like she didn't say anything. I have no idea what type she is but at this point I believe it's irrelevant. She's clearly dealing with some form of mental illness but her family ignores it or puts up with it. I'm not sure which is worse. If you all continue to allow her to continue this type of behavior it will only get worse. I'm no doctor but if what you say is true regarding her behavior she sounds like she needs to see a doctor. It's definitely not normal isfj either. I wish you and your mom best regards."
1774,isfj,"I see a lot of these traits in myself -- but I am also depressed. I'm hoping that with therapy and medication I'll get better.
Sounds like she is really embodying all the worst parts of being an ISFJ and not reaping many of the rewards...
I think honestly you should try to be gentle with her right now. I cannot imagine the guilt she must be under -- because trust me she knows that the house is not as clean as it should be, etc. But sometimes you just get into a mindset of ""Where do I even start, it's pointless, I'd rather just keep distracting myself...""
Maybe you can offer a way of tackling problems together. You say she does not ask for help and spreads herself too thin; I think a great way to help and motivate her would be to offer to tackle a problem together. ""Mom, I think if we both tackled cleaning the kitchen counter it would only take 15 minutes. I'll grab some clorox wipes and why don't you start from that end and I'll start from this end?"" Do you have siblings? You can also get them involved.
I think she is probably really overwhelmed and just does not know how to express it. It's honestly how I have been feeling lately but again I at least am in therapy and on medication now and it has been helping some.
Best of luck to you and your mom. Please try to help her out if you can, it means a lot to me when people do small things for me and your mom might be the same. Even just a ""Mom, I love you and I hope you had a good day"" when you walk through the door after getting home or something."
1775,isfj,"Lol this is sad, but I've always joked that my family is a ""hotbed of undiagnosed mental illness"". I suspect my parents have problems because they have both succumbed to the pitfalls of their respective ISFJ and ISTJ personalities. But they stay dutifully married to each other even though they aren't quite happy.
As an INFP my mom and I both share in common our concern for others' feelings. My dad doesn't really consider others' feelings. So he doesn't always notice when my mom needs help, or maybe is tired of the way she tries to manipulate people into helping her. 
I hear her talking under her breath all the time, like ""Oh well, I guess I'm not going to get xyz done after all"" or some negative comment, just loud enough for someone else to hear that she might need help without actually asking for it. It's like she's floundering in a swimming pool, flailing her arms without saying ""somebody help me!"".
Dude, about your acquaintance's mother... my mom can barely see, too! She's legally blind without her glasses for sure, and not much better with them on. It really affects her driving and I hate riding in the car with her. It's also partially why she bumps into everyone in public, she has bad peripheral vision and poor depth perception. But she is also in her own little world and needs to pay more attention.
The funny thing is... my mom is a social worker! She deals with mental illness on a daily basis. Oh, and I think she's the legal guardian for my bipolar aunt who ran away to the opposite side of the country and is now in a mental facility. So... I think my mom has a bit of denial about her own problems. SHE is the social worker, after all, so she ""has to be strong"" or something.
I really think my mom needs to seek out a therapist. But as her 24 year old daughter, that sounds inappropriate to suggest. Plus, I spent my childhood in emotional neglect due to my mother spreading herself thin and my father being distant, so I resent her a little. I even once mustered up the courage to ask her if I could seek professional therapy of my own. Did that ever pan out? Nope! We don't communicate well at all... ugh.
Thanks for helping me vent and process through this!"
1776,isfj,"Mostly just offering to help out. The biggest example I can think of is household chores and the dogs. I never see him doing any cleaning and he never walks the dogs. He never cooks or helps with dinner and he barely does dishes. He has his projects, like working on the house or in his garden... but he doesn't realize that those don't directly assist my mom or enrich her daily life. Plus he monopolizes the TV with his ultra-boring taste in cable TV programming and alienates anyone from joining him. (Hence the phone games.) Also my dad doesn't talk about emotions at all, so I imagine she often feels emotionally neglected. Once my mom accidentally cut herself making dinner (her knife technique IS dangerous and haphazard, but that's beside the point) and basically yelled at her. In front of the whole family, including my brother in law. It was pretty fucked up."
1777,isfj,"Offering to tackle things together is a good approach. It will be easier for her to accept help that way.
Thank you for your kind words. It means a lot coming from someone in a similar headspace as my mom. Opening up is not something that happens often in my family, but I will try!"
1778,isfj,"Yikes. That's enough drama to write a screen play for a movie. You are an adult. Do you drive? (And/or have a car?) There are free and/or sliding scale health clinics you can go to for your own counseling. And I strongly suggest that next time you're in the car with your mom that you tell her that you'll do the driving. Tell her that it will give her the opportunity to sit back and relax or something. Don't say it's because she can't see. She'll just deny it. Ugh. I totally agree with your insight regarding your parents duty to staying married. On one hand I feel like I want to applaud them but on the other I want to say wake up! You've both just wasted most of your lives being miserable. Get up and get help! You'd be so much better off! But like you said, your mom is determined to remain the one who helps others not the one who needs help. From what I've seen through the experience of the other mom, your mom will only get worse. She'll become someone you no longer recognize and then you'll be sad for her and probably feel guilty though it will not be your fault. At some point you will have to say that it was their choice to live their life the way they did. Your mom refusing to acknowledge her own needs. Your father refusing to see to her needs. That is not your responsibility. You are only responsible for yourself. You've already accomplished the first part - knowingly there's a problem. Next - you need to understand where the problem stems from and it sounds like you've pretty much got that, too. Now that you are aware of these things do the best you can with what you've got. It would not surprise me if you elected to step up and help her with something and then she still complains about not getting something else done. It's what they do. They get lost in all the anger and all the bitterness they carry with them. They rarely ever see anything good even when they're being helped with out asking for it. Just don't ever feel like it's your fault. It's not. She needs help. Your dad needs help and you could use a few encouraging words yourself. I really hope you'll be okay. It's not fun watching your parents be miserable when they don't have to be. Just don't grow up to be like them if you can help it. Pay close attention to who you are as you go along. If you begin to see similar signs of behavior acknowledge it and seek counseling. You deserve to live a happy healthy life. Don't fall into the same abandoned well that they did. "
1779,isfj,"This is a really good way of phrasing it: It's like she's floundering in a swimming pool, flailing her arms without saying ""somebody help me!""
I think a lot of the time, ISFJs want help and want to be noticed but do not want themselves to be a burden. I made this post a while ago because it was something I had learned about myself... ""I don't want to bother people, no matter how much I want someone else to care."""
1780,isfj,"Wow! Thanks so much for your diligent responses :)
Yes, I'm fairly certain my mom would make a decent character in a novel! Actually, I think you could write a story from the perspective of any of my family members. That would be a REALLY interesting idea for some kind of self-help exercise, actually... hmm! 
This is slightly irrelevant, but I realized last night is that my two siblings and I all share a lead Feeling function. My brother and I are introverted Feelers and my sister is an extraverted Feeler. Everyone in my family takes everything so damn personally.
I do drive! But I don't have a car at the moment. I moved back in with my parents this month (and hopefully will move out again after another month or two) and it's like my childhood all over again. Luckily I have access to my mother's car when she's not working. It would probably put my mom at ease if I could just run errands for her, honestly. I should offer that more because it would be a win-win, lol.
My parents are very honorable for committing to their marriage, I agree. Both seem to have strong senses of responsibility toward each other. But it sucks that they have both reached their 50s without a lot of personal growth. 
Tbh, my dad is the source of many of the emotional problems because he has become a bitter person. Even my grandma (who lives with us and is provided for by my parents) said my dad has changed over the years. He is prone to these ISTJ outbursts of anger that make him intolerable at times, so everyone walks on eggshells around him. I've seen him yell at my mom a lot. But somehow, someway... they always seem to make up. It's like my mom has Stockholm Syndrome or something. Well, it's just a typical codependent relationship, I s'pose. 
When I was very small, I remember I wanted my parents to separate because it hurt so deeply to see my mother crying! My whole family is scarred, like...""You get emotional issues! You get emotional issues! You get emotional issues!"" Lol! Unfortunately, I don't think I want children because I couldn't handle ever making them feel as bad as I felt as a kid. I ended up self-harming from like 11-16 over it. Sure, it's my fault, but at that age I didn't know that things would get better. I have a lot of visible scars that I have to live with now. Ugh.
I hope one day I will get to a point where I can afford some serious Therapy, lol. First thing's first... I gotta get out of this house! I think putting so much thought into this will help keep me sane. Plus my boyfriend, an INTP, understands me but helps me look at things rationally rather than just emotionally. 
I've been rambling in this reply, but I really do appreciate your help! :)"
1781,isfj,"Whoa man! '""I can do it, because I have to do it.""' may just as well be my mom's mantra, too. That sounds... exactly like her. Must be the ISFJ's burden.
I think what I've realized about my mom the past two days is that what she really needs is someone to open up to her first. If I tell my mom why I'm upset or having a bad day, I see this expression wash over her like ""Oh boy, somebody needs me!"". I think this might help my mom, in turn, to feel as though she can rely on me as well.
I will try being honest with her more often, even though I hate it because my feelings are very personal to me, and honestly I feel misunderstood a lot of the time because... that's the INFP's burden. I will go through the motions if it makes her happy, though, lol."
1782,isfj,"If someone were confronting y’all about something you were doing, how would you want them to do it? For example, would you want them to start with a question and sort of lead you to their conclusion, or would it be better if they just told you outright? Is there another way that would end in the least amount of tears? Thanks!"
1783,isfj,"Appeal to my Fe. 
For example, instead of saying something like ""You're loud. Stop making noise!"", say ""The noise is giving me a headache. Would you lower it down?"" 
​
The first approach, I'd be like, No. 
The second approach, I'd be like, ""oh shoot sorry about that (he's getting a headache!). I'll tune it down."""
1784,isfj,"I always prefer when someone starts with the problem that arises from my actions, rather than the actions themselves. It feels more pragmatic that way.
Idk, I’m an ENTP, we believe that confrontation never has to be personal"
1785,isfj,"Mm okay that makes sense, but what if it’s something that you’re a little more emotionally invested in? It’s about our friendship and the way she’s been acting around me mostly, and I’m not sure how to broach the subject without overwhelming her."
1786,isfj,"Would you prefer for someone to just tell you what you’re doing wrong off the bat, or would it be easier if there was a slower lead-up to it? 
One of my ISFJ friends is treating me really weirdly lately (“worshipping” me, as an ISTJ friend described it), and I just want her to treat me like any other friend.  I would normally tell her bluntly and outright, but I’m workin on that Fe and trying to be more gentle here."
1787,isfj,"What would you want in a breakup letter? 
We've been together on and off for 3 years. I care deeply for her but we're just too different for things to work out, we argue too often and see the world too differently."
1788,isfj,"keep in mind that no matter how well or how isfj-friendly you wrote that letter, it's not gonna go well. you just have to make it go as best as you can.
keep it civil: tell her what you need her to know about why things aren't working out but make sure it's nothing that will unnecessarily hurt her. 
keep it clean: make sure she understands that there is no going back. 
make it clear: along with the clean break up, make it clear. isfj are all about emotion and crap. and it is possible that we hear or understand things differently from how you are explaining or saying things. this will happen especially if we're in a highly emotional state (like during a break up). do the best you can here. it'll be of great help to her to understand the reason for the break up for her next relationship. and make sure it's not too long (keep it to a single page at the very least). too long and it's too much to go through.
good thing is that you've been dating on and off so that means that there probably was some understanding on what doesn't work between you two already. and i'm assuming that you two try to communicate problems with one another instead of ignoring or hiding them from each other.
you can write a letter or do it face to face. whatever works best for you. it's all about getting the message through as clearly as you can. you being an intj i'll assume you're better at it with letters or email or chat. isjf will probably prefer it face to face, but her preference isn't the point. the point is the long term effects of the break up. a letter allows for rereading  and more clear headed comprehension. and if you mess up the face to face, it's a permanent mess up in history. so, i'm suggesting that unless you happen to be very good at face to face talks."
1789,isfj,"Just be honest, but when wording your letter take her feelings into consideration. It's almost impossible to have closure when you don't know why things are over. If it was me, though, I would appreciate being told face to face. Long-term relationship break ups are hard enough to get over, but to get something like a letter ending it seems very cold."
1790,isfj,"Thanks, this was a good read. I did write a letter and checked it over a few times. In the end it was just a medium for me to get my thoughts out and begin to rehearse how I may flow the conversation, I just had a talk with her, it went over well, she was somewhat having the same doubts."

1792,isfj,"Hi ISFJs!
I'm an ENTJ and my Mom and one of my best friends are both ISFJ.
Other than those two I've met some other people that I thought were ISFJ but I was never sure.
Now let me tell you something.
You are AMAZING! 
I feel like you always know what is going on inside my head (sometimes I don't like it but in general it's nice to know).
My good friend and my mom are the most generous and nice people I know. I love them a lot and I just really wanted to throw this on your subreddit bc I felt like, some of you maybe need to hear how AWESOME you are!
So basically this is just a random ENTJ, telling you guys that you're great (Obviously every healthy type is great in it's own way, but the ISFJs I know just ROCK!).
Okay so.....this was my little speech that had basically no meaning except ,,I love you!"" 
Hope you enjoyed! 
Byyeeee 👋🏻"
1793,isfj,"Does anyone experience this ""freezing"" when in an argument or otherwise tense social situation?
I find that my brain goes on lockdown and I can't really say anything to defend myself.
(And of course I come up with great things to say after the situation has passed...) 
This really annoys me and I was wondering if its common for ISFJs and if theres any ways you've been able to make it better? "
1794,isfj,Yes I feel this.. especially when being criticized by authority figures in my life. I get overwhelmed and panicky and then go too deep inside my own head and can’t comprehend what the other person is saying anymore.
1795,isfj,"YESSS. My biggest problem.
When confronted, when in tense situation, when someone throws tantrum, when someone has an outburst, when I'm asked to speak up in tense situations, when criticized, when I'm hurt, when someone flirts with me too (sometimes, like when IDK them properly) or gives me too much attention and IDK them that well.
People close to me get very annoyed with the way I go blank
​"
1796,isfj,Yes this happens. Or when I’m in an argument I feel not only the blood pressure rise but my sub conscious wanting to say something hurtful but bite my inner tongue. Then yes the recourse of going shut I should have said x and done x or a combination of both.
1797,isfj,"Yep. Happened to me today. Usually I have a response, but it's a picture in my head. There's no time to translate to words, especially when the other person uses words so effortlessly. I end up looking and feeling very dumb. "
1798,isfj,"Yep totally experience this. I too end up feeling stupid (which is the worst feeling), and then get mad at myself for that, and then just get mad in general. 
My advice is to just try and walk away, not let whatever it is bother you. It’s very hard to do, but I’m working on it "
1799,isfj,"Ive found that taking a small break from the situation, even 2-5 minutes, can really help me gather my thoughts and articulate my problems better. Often walking away isn't that easy though, trying to keep that in mind though. "
1800,isfj,"ISFJs are stereotypically viewed as being motherly, nurturing types.  I can definitely see those traits in myself, but i have very little desire to actually be a parent.  Does anyone else experience this?"
1801,isfj,"I know the feeling too.  I have motherly tendencies, but they manifest in a weird overly-protective, loving relationship I have with my best friend and in my relationship with my dog.  I actually dislike kids and being around them depresses me hahaha.  I've dis-wanted kids for my entire life."
1802,isfj,"Same here. I would love to hear ISFJ perspective on this, but here's mine:
Take notes about some of the chores that she does every day. Does she make the bed every morning? Is she incredibly picky about how it is made? Learn how she likes it done and then do it for her. She will appreciate it.
Is she always the one to clear the dishes from the dish drainer? Put an alarm on your phone to remind yourself to do it for her.
Does she waffle on decision-making because her specialty is implementation and not theory? Go ahead and give a strong, clear opinion about what you think is best.
Does she hog all the sheets at night? Sorry, can't help you with that."
1803,isfj,"Hello, I am an INTJ in a relation with an ISFJ partner and we have been together for 10 years. Sorry just wanted some context to be established.
Now then, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to get her to trust my intuition more. She usually will reply with things like “you don’t know that” or my personal favourite “booshit” haha.
Intuition is just so abstract and I guess sensor types don’t like that? I’m don’t know.
Thanks for your time and input."
1804,isfj,"That stinks. I'm an ISFJ and all about that shit. That being said, don't try to use MBTI or psychology during times of duress, it usually never works on ISFJ's. 
As far as getting her to trust your intuition more. It just has to be perceptually right more than not. Relating your intuition to something concrete will be a load more helpful. Lastly, don't overdo the conceptual thinking, meet in the middle. 
Hope that helps."
1805,isfj,"Isfj's usually have a really high intuition of our own, but because we're heavily logic-based, we tend to dismiss others intuition because we don't think they're as observation as us. I know it sounds contradictory, but ISFJ's are this weird grabbags of juxtpositions. "
1806,isfj,"So, my best guy friend is an INTJ and I'm an ISFJ female. He thinks that way too, but one thing that really helps me ""get"" what he's saying is that he always backs up his thoughts with logic/facts. Just explaining why you think something is the way it is really helps me understand. 
Often, INTJ and I have similar conclusions, but go about our ""thought"" processes in very different ways. When he says something very vague, I always ask him why or to explain what he means in further detail. "
1807,isfj,"Pick-up an orange, and ask her what's inside and then ask her how she knows that even though she's never been inside that orange.  Same thing.  INTJ shows a strength in 'Introverted Intuition' which basically means that you pay attention to and draw from past experiences, but usually the little things that most people miss.   Her equivalent is 'Introverted Sensing' which does the same thing only with memory instead. 
My wife is an ISFJ and she can tell me how many dogwoods are in my neighborhood and what color everyone's door is because she loves real estate.  It's just how her brain works."
1808,isfj,"Haha it’s really hard for me not to think conceptually that’s just my default. Also I try my very best to not use psychology (or at least out loud) during inappropriate times but alas I am human. 
Sorry could you elaborate on “perceptionally right” please? Thank you.
I’d like to add that I love her to pieces and just want to maximize our relationship."
1809,isfj,"It’s okay, intjs can be walking contradictions as my friend reminds me all the time. I’ve noticed her intuition peak out from time to time, usually about people and she’s usually right there with me. However then other times she speaks as if I don’t know what I’m talking about."
1810,isfj,"Haha, I know you would think after my intuition proves right after the hundredth time that they might trust it more. I understand your pain. 
Do you also have a hell of a time explaining your intuition to your SO? Words are just so limiting. :D 
Also now she knows my “I told you so” face, she can see right through me when most cannot. Oh and her nickname for MBTI is “Psychobabble bullshit”, she’s adorable."
1811,isfj,"Yea, I completely get that. But is there ever a point where you would trust it without an explanation? Explaining usually means I have to think about it and research to find out what I already knew. It’s weird."
1812,isfj,"I can imagine! As for being perceptually right I mean that convincing the ISFJ of your argument point. How you deliver your point will get you far. Also being cognicsent of the ISFJs emotional state can help. If they are upset or otherwise emotional, it may not be a good time to bring up arguments or touchy subject. "
1813,isfj,"It can definitely be difficult to put intuition into words and requires me to think on it usually. I guess I’ll just have to observe her moods more to figure out the optimum time to bring it up but then that kinda goes against the use of intuition hmm. I say “use” but it really is more of a subconscious you all of a sudden have clarity kind of phenomenon, for me at least as I cannot speak for others."
1814,isfj,"I don’t really consider my claims as dramatic. 
An example might be when I say for example: Anything involving psychology or new theory’s in science and/or new technology. (Ie.. new eye drops that improve your vision.)
I’d just like to add that not everything can be explained through research because humans don’t know everything."
1815,isfj,"Don't use tones or sentences that they could take offense to and especially no acusitory tones like ""you did"" ""you said"". Use I statements. For instance, ""I think it looks like this, what do you think?"" As opposed to ""it's definitely this"". A better example would be during times of deliberation on a the relationship. ""I feel like you're too impatient with me"" as opposed, ""your too impatient"". I hope that makes sense. "
1816,isfj,"Yes, that makes a lot of sense! Sort of like displaying to the other person your subjective viewpoint on the situation, instead of saying ""this is reality, deal with it."" Maybe presenting it as something you're working toward together, instead of an attack on them."
1817,isfj,"I don't know if you guys can relate to this or how you got out of this 'funk'.
Lately, I've just avoiding people like crazy, particularly strangers. My family and absolute closest friends I'm mostly okay with, however.
My mother hosted a party last night with people from her work, and I had absolutely no desire to socialize.
I was acting like my brother, who I believe is an ISTJ: hiding indoors and just doing my thing. I had to eventually force myself outside and barely listen to others so as to not embarrass my mother and appear ""rude"".
A sorta friend-sorta acquaintance but much older woman called asking for me, and I told my mother to tell her I was in the bathroom and would call back (lol).
I'm internally groaning at the thought of work tomorrow. I thought it was cuz maybe I'm starting to hate my job, but it's not that. My job is interesting. But putting up with the people, and having to interact, constantly watch what I'm saying, put up with whatever it is they throw at me and act as polite as possible, is just... ugh.
Funny enough, at yesterday's party, at one point one woman started discussing literature she enjoyed, and immediately my energy perked up. Maybe it's cuz I finally felt like I could contribute and have a discussion with her, rather than simply ask her questions about herself and be attentive to her needs.
Edit as of 8/6: Just letting you know, the funk improved. Happens occasionally. Just take a break from people for a while, and you'll be back to normal lol"
1818,isfj,"Yes,  it's the needless small talk that I dread sometimes too.  Mostly because I know if I tried to steer it a bit to something I would want to talk about, I wouldn't get that same energy/effort. Mainly because as you said they're aquaintances. You picture the boring conversations ahead of time and wish it could be different. 
As for getting through it, this ""funk"", I really don't know myself. Hope you can find it 🙂"
1819,isfj,"I personally don’t need the daily interaction with coworkers or even friends everyday. I’m an introvert and while I enjoy spending time with my friends, there are days where I am in deep thoughtful planning phase and I enjoy my time alone. That constant planning, just happens in my head as I run through different scenarios of what my life could potentially be. Those days are draining and so I enjoy those days/weeks just by myself and my dog. I think wanting to be alone for days/weeks is totally normal."
1820,isfj,"i recently broke up and my Si and Fe are absolutely destroying me. My Si keeps on bringing back all of the bad times and my Fe is only making me feel worse for all the bad things that happened. School is about to start and i don't want to go in feeling like crap. any suggestions, much appreciated"
1821,isfj,"This is not type specific, but go on dates with new people! It doesn't have to be serious or long term, just go on dates. Look for people on the internet or whatever you like. Doing that will force you to think about new possibilities, and you'll start having better perspective on your ex."
1822,isfj,"Find something else to do, think about, and care about for now. Something positive to do with your life, time, and mind. And something to achieve. And wait as time will move on and change will happen, and you will heal. Keep up the hope.
This video helped me and a few friends with break ups.
https://youtu.be/9mbp0DugfCA"
1823,isfj,"I went through a breakup recently too, it was pretty hard, my advice is to find something else to concentrate and spend your time on, whether its the gym, a small project, work or just going out with friends, it will all help distract you and concentrate on the important things. Remember this is just a blip in your life, theres more to life than this. Try not to wonder 'what if', or blame yourself for mistakes, think of the positive outcomes of the relationship ending now. And surround yourself with people who you can talk to about this, they'll be your confidence boost. Hope this helps :) "
1824,isfj,"Hi. I am trying to reach out to people about MBTI. I have found a lot of disinterest and even prejudice from people that don't even know what MBTI is. Some people even think I'm trying to sell something or that that this is some sort of cult. Since ISFJ is one of the most common personalities out there, I'd like to ask you for tips, how to bring this wonderful tool to more great people such as you.
My question for you is:

How did you get into MBTI? Were you reluctant / hesitant? What tipped you over...
What / why do you like about MBTI? What would you like to say to someone like yourself to inspire them to get involved?
Any extra information related to this or ISFJ in general may be of great help.

Any sort of information will help, Anyone's opinion is highly valued! If you know about any articles or posts about this topic, links are welcome. If you are not ISFJ please state that you are not one, or optionally tell what your personality is along with your contribution. Thank you for your help, I wish you all the best."
1825,isfj,"I wanted to understand others better and know why disagreements happen/why people think differently. It has helped me understand why there was so much disconnect with alot of the people around me. 
Now I don't tend to think ""He/she is doing this to upset me"", I think ""He/she is an xxxx and so that's why they are doing this"". Then it makes it easier for me to see which behaviours are personality differences, and which are just toxic behaviours. 
I've made 80% of my close friends take it, and every single person took it without hesitation (to my surprise), and even made their spouses/others take it too! They even enjoy talking about it with me, and allow me to ramble on about functions and what it all means (I love talking about mbti).
If anything, this has strengthened my relationships somewhat, and give me more understanding about how our relationships work. I love it!"
1826,isfj,"That's ok! Yes I'm isfj, what are u? :) I guess it could depend on age range and where you live....I'm in my 20s and live in the West. Generally I've found mbti to be quite accepted amongst my friends, but it could also be to do with how I explain/present it too!"
1827,isfj,"I like jokes that are a mix of silly and not making sense or clever but not too forced in either direction
My humor is probsbly also more mean/savage than youd expect from an ISFJ, I just have to hide it outside close friends or else not many people would like me"
1828,isfj,My humor can be a combination of silly and dark lol. I like sitcoms when the characters do things that don't make sense One of my favorite comedies is South Park for the reason that the humor is silly and dark like I enjoy. 
1829,isfj,"I really like Ricky Gervais for instance.
He has a great sketch where he's telling this super offensive Father/Daughter joke. It's unexpected but the delivery is killing it."
1830,isfj,"Hi, fellow ISFJ here. I have recently met a girl, and after a couple of dates I would place her as an ISFJ too. She seems very nice and I am interested in giving it a chance, although I am a bit concerned with both of us leaning towards Introverted. (My score was about 55% Introvert). 
Does anyone have any experience or thoughts about this? Will it be a problem with both of us wanting the other to depend on the other, can it get ""quiet"" when both are social, but lack the natural conversations that are typical for extroverts. Or do you think it can be a peaceful and fulfilling relationship? 
I'm really curious to hear your thoughts, thanks."
1831,isfj,"INTJ here with an ISFJ wife. Both of us being introverted means we love spending time with one another, which is good for any relationship. However, I am more extroverted than her (I can turn it on when I need to) which means sometimes we do go into social situations and I can guide the process which is quite uncomfortable for her. I'm sure this doesn't help you a whole lot, but it works quite well for us."
1832,isfj,"My parents are ISFJ and ISTJ and they've been very happily married for over 30 years. They don't really have friends outside of our family, but they're truly content with that because they're each other's best friend and find their relationship very fulfilling. Your relationship could potentially get stagnant depending on the two of you and your particular circumstances, but two introverts can definitely get along just fine!"
1833,isfj,"I suppose you're right. I'm always afraid of getting too involved and then realising she's not the one. It has happened a few times and it ends up being painful for both parties. I think I am very picky when it comes to finding a partner (or making any choice in particular). 
Is there anyone else that bases their decision mainly on the ""gut feeling"" when it comes to finding a partner?"
1834,isfj,"I'm a fairly social guy, and I get lonely without social input, so I always arrange to meet my friends whenever I can. That being said, I like it when I'm around someone that initiates conversations, so I don't feel under pressure for having to ""entertain"". That's probably why I would like to be with someone who carelessly takes the role of the ""initiator"", so I can participate without having too much pressure on myself. That's perhaps my biggest concern, that in an ideal world my partner would pull me out of the shell, rather than me being the most social one in the relationship. "
1835,isfj,"Nothing wrong with being picky man. But if you never take the shots then you'll never know. If you can enter into it knowing it might not be right but willing to try you can learn a lot. Don't overextend yourself before you're ready, and you can save both parties a lot of pain. "
1836,isfj,"Perhaps it would be a good idea to share these thoughts with her, as a way to be more upfront from the start. I'm always trying to interpret my gut feeling when I'm hesitant as either ""knowing it's not right"" or if it's ""fear of trying something new and rejection"". In the end I usually leave the relationship if the feeling persists. "
1837,isfj,"Absolutely. Be completely honest. It won't work if you have hidden agendas and don't share how you're really feeling. It leaves the floor open for her to do what she wants and you to do what you want, which will be the healthiest way to be together. "

"
1839,isfj,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) - I actually like this book a lot. It's very tangential and erratic, but that is what adds to the character to the book. It was a very enjoyable (and fast - I finished in a day) read, and I highly recommend it.
A song of Ice and Fire (George R. R. Martin) - I know. BUT it is a hugely engrossing read, some of the best story lines I have ever seen. The plots are so twisty and turny you never know what happens next, I loved it. I could never go back to YA fiction after finishing the five books. 
The Roar (Emma Clayton) - Speaking of YA fiction, this book was surprisingly good. It takes place in the future where humanity lives in the northern third of the world. Very big themes about class conflict and exploitation of mutation. I immensely enjoyed this novel.
Congo (Michael Crichton) - A journey deep into the heart of Africa that only gets more and more interesting. I love Michael Crichton, and have read a large number of his books. The writing is fantastic.
Next (Michael Crichton) - Another book that I recommend by MC, this one follows a several people who are tied together by their relation to a man with a special immune system (I may be wrong but I haven't read it in a while). Very big discussion on genetics and the increasing focus businesses are giving them. Great novel.
Endar's Game (Orson Scott Card) - The book follows a boy called Endar (:P) as he slowly rises to the top of a space cadet school while facing serveral issues along the way. Very interesting.
And last but not least...
SAT Prep Guide 2015 (Kaplan) - Oh. My. God. Cannot recommend this book enough. With such helpful advice like feeding your ego until you get the answer (Literally it says if you ever get stuck or nervous, just remember how well you prepared using the Kaplan^^TM SAT Premier Review), how can I ever give this epic novel anything but a shining A++? I couldn't put the book down. Seriously guys, check it out."
1840,isfj,"My favorite book which I frequently recommend to people is Cloud Atlas. It encapsulates so much about humanity in a rich tapestry of environments, narratives, and prose styles. And although it has some low points, it makes you realize that they are beautiful in their own way, and necessary for the book to convey its ultimately uplifting message. "
1841,isfj,"Favorites and recent reads so I share a variety:
Carrie and Pet Sematary - Stephen King.
The Trial - Franz Kafka.
Tropic of Cancer - Henry Miller.
Alice in Wonderland and Through the looking Glass - Lewis Caroll.
Lolita - Vladimir Nabokov.
Anything by V.C Andrews because I'm a suck for that sad drama and messed up family life thing."
1842,isfj,One of my personal favorites is actually a book I had to read back in highschool called The Good Earth. It's a story that explores the lives and family dynamics of a Chinese working class family through two to three generations.
1843,isfj,"The Storyteller by Jodi Picoult
I know it's not everybody's type of book.
But I enjoy it tremendously.
It has a little bit of World War II stuff happening in there, which is a huge interest to me, but it also has enough of a story and character development to keep me interested.
It's realistic, well-researched and quite depressing, which appeals to my morbid side.
There's also a love story involved, which appeals to my sappy side that doesn't feel fulfilled unless there's a happy ending."
1844,isfj,"Thank you. I try to give each book credit where it's due, so when it came to Kaplan's SAT review (a book that truly changed my life) there was no way that I could give this book anything but a stellar review. "
1845,isfj,"I forgot to write the description! :S
So, I'm sharing the link for a friend. She wants to find more ISFJs and talk to them, and as you can see, she likes Telegram and the chat format. We are nice people. We won't bite. Promise! :3"
1846,isfj,"In Chapter 13 of Gifts Differing, Myers and Myers go into how Learning Styles differ by type. Laying out the ways in which Sensors learn differently to Intuits.
Are there things you find particularly difficult when it comes to learning? Are there any tricks you've found in overcoming these problems? Have your experiences put you off learning particular things?"
1847,isfj,"For me, I've always found many of the hard sciences pretty challenging. Getting into Computing, I've realized that I just don't have the same aptitude for immediately grasping things as other people do, and this has left me feeling a bit dumb at times.
I would say I can be pretty logical, but anything to do with transformations/relationships with things are really hard to me. Even simple things like reading a map upside down, where I have to flip directions in my head and all that kind of thing. I suppose it all boils down to very poor spatial reasoning.
Learning itself has always been quite practical in a way, and by practical I don't necessary mean it has to be tactile. Rather, it's heavily directed towards examples of things... and in many ways I feel like when I'm answering questions I have to ""translate"" it in my head, so I can map it to real things that I can grasp.
There are many branches of mathematics for example, that I will take hours and hours to learn simple parts of, particularly in the field of abstract algebra, just because I cannot conceive of what kind of thing it is.
I guess how I've worked around these things is getting very good at explaining things in terms of what I already know, so when I'm faced with a very abstract problem I can focus on what the real and particulate things are, and then try and understand it from a sensing point of view.
Of course that leaves me being accused of lacking generality by intuits, but at least it gives me the chance to tackle the problem."
1848,isfj,"I'm very fortunate in that I was naturally really precocious and smart. It was tough as an ISFJ in school -  everyone wanted to pigeonhole me as an INTP because of my intelligence, so trying to make friends was really hard. It led to me not pushing myself as much to excel scholastically to instead focus on my peers. (My Fe hated that I was ostracized, so I had little choice but to figure out how people/communities worked - even with Ti trying to tell me I was, like, super independent and didn't need other people to care about me!!)
I have trouble with the abstract and theoretical as well. I was exceedingly good at algebra and precalc but confused my teachers as to why I was bad at geometry/trig, and then when I got into college and calculus I got really lost. 
I would recommend an Si-dom focus on their strengths to improve learning. We can become experts by focusing on what we're interested in because once we get interested, we stay interested for life. Identify the domains you want to focus on and as long as you're comfortable and enjoy it, keep grinding at it. The key part is to not let others shame you for not trying to be the best at everything - know your limits, know your what you like, and prove your worth there. It can be hard since school wants you to learn every field, but keep in mind: you don't have to be the best at every field. Just competent. Focus on what you find enjoyable and don't stress out about not measuring up in the rest."
1849,isfj,"learning is slow for me. i find when i learn something new i have to reflect on it and measure it up to a lot of other things i have stored away in my head. they're like...rules i made up from my observations or previous things i've learned. i believe this to be what makes isfj cling so much to tradition. these rules to me just seem right and constant. and straying from them is often emotionally felt inside as a dumb move.
and when something new i learn clashes with these rules i have, i need to diligently force myself to go through everything i knew that made those rules in the first place, and find where those rules break apart/are wrong in order to accept the new thing i learned.
before i used to be more stubborn about it. i could even deny real true facts in order to keep the ""facts"" i've worked so hard for. these facts that i have used to keep me safe and help predict outcomes. i can't just...throw them away! but i got over that. now i'm prepared to break them apart.
but i still don't have a solution to speed up the process. it's all meticulous and grinding through details and finding connections."
1850,isfj,"Math was definitely the most difficult subject for me in school. Even trying a pretty wide breadth of math courses (statistics, calculus, linear algebra, trigonometry/math analysis...), there wasn't a single branch of math that I was able to understand or excel in. I was always that kid that would use way too many steps to solve a math problem to try and make sense of it all, in the end overcomplicating every problem. I still get flack from people for using long division, but it's because I can't do any of those calculations in my head. When faced with a ""real world"" math problem,  I have to write it down on paper and work out each step to find an answer. I cannot figure even basic math out unless I'm able to work the problem out with pencil and paper. One thing that always frustrated me about math was that there was always one exact answer, and so many places where some small error could throw the entire result off. I still thank my lucky stars that my miraculous 3 in AP calculus tested me out of all math in college...."
1851,isfj,"I'm more of a hands-on learner. I definitely don't learn from being told what to do or reading notes or instructions. The only time I would prefer reading notes and instructions is when it's sort of a self-help thing that I initiated for myself to get through an emotional obstacle. 
With regards to the map commentary, I'm in the same boat. I can't read a map upside down. It was hard for me to navigate the streets of Chicago when I went there for vacation so I relied on my ISTJ sister to do it. I simply gave up and felt no need for stress so I relied on Uber to get mostly everywhere when I was on my own. All my sister had to do was screenshot the map on my phone, and off we went with no hitches; distance and orientation of the map was not an issue for her at all. 
In terms of school, if I can't relate to the subject at hand, for sure I struggled. And my worst subjects were History and whatever sine-cosine-tangent math is; I think thats trig? Anyway, I failed that math course (35%) and scored a 98% in business mathematics. I can't relate to angles, I guess? If anyone is curious, I ended up with a HRM and Operations Management diploma. And now currently working in the Finance industry so it all worked out."
1852,isfj,"It's interesting that many ISFJs have struggle with math. As an ISFJ, numbers have always come natural to me. I have the gift of doing basic arithmetic in my head. I have also excelled in almost all math courses (stats, pre-cal) only math I struggled with a bit was Calculus but still got a 4 on the AP Exam. I'm an accounting major in college  right now and have tend to gravitate towards subjects that are practical and have applications to life. In college, I tend to struggle with subjects and courses that are too abstract and theoretical and that's hard for me to apply to real life. I really think the key for us ISFJs is finding something we love, once we find that we're good because we have the work ethic to be able to do. Like me I'm studying accounting and I love it and know I have the work ethic to do well in this field. Also as ISFJs, avoiding  courses and college majors that are too theoretical and abstract. "
1853,isfj,"It's funny for me that you mention maps/spatial awareness - I'm actually really good at maps/spatial awareness because it was something I got very interested in from a young age. I bought maps and read atlases and was twice in the National Geography Bee state finals, used to post to misc.transport.road (aka roadgeeks) back in the day. So I'm great at it, but not because of N, just because I've found geography/roads fascinating all my life!"
1854,isfj,"I LOVE INFPs! 
I know three personally; one is kinda an SO, one is like a mentor, the other a distant friend.
With all three, I love the emotional honesty and similar values. We have some similar interests, and have the same sense of humor. 
If anything, INFPs are some of the most selfless people I’ve ever met. They really care, although this can make them super stressed out. They hold true to their values, yet at the same time are really good at compromising. And they also are EXTREMELY smart. "
1855,isfj,"I also love INFPs. I’ve known at least two infps during my life, both my friends. One of them is my childhood friend and I feel like we’ve always got along so well. We have never really fought or had arguments, it’s been smooth all this time which is rare for someone like me who is likely to start arguments. Then the other infp, we had our ups and downs, but I think I personally found her so attractive, because she was so sweet and friendly to everyone. And we could definitely understand each other because we’re both introverts and had the same kind of humour. "
1856,isfj,"They are very deep people, at least the ones I've known. They are always learning and growing. They are kind, warm, gentle, giving people who want to make the world a better place. I feel like they thrive on deep conversation and thinking deeply. They aren't shallow people or self absorbed. "
1857,isfj,"I have to agree with all of that, I'm together with an INFP. It's a double-edged sword, though.
Learning and growing make them isolated from the rest because most people are retarded Instagram drones.
Thinking deeply makes them depressed."
1858,isfj,"Just started a relationship with an ISFJ, kinda. He works with me and I like him a good amount. He was always the person who is quiet and to themselves but after one night out as an office we got touchy and one thing led to another and we slept together. I was clear that this is not a hookup and that I prefer long term things. The ISFJ seems to like me back and anything I ask we do together they do very willingly. 
So my question is, they seem to very distant. Thinking about something a lot. I carry most of the conversations, which I’m fine with and am used to but I’d like them to start some convos. I know eventually I’ll get tired of that. They always talk enthusiastically once I bring up something. 
So do you guys open up eventually or all of you very distant all of the time. I have a good read of people’s emotions and I can tell he’s not distant because he doesn’t like me but he has stuff on his mind. We Havnt talked about where the relationship is yet and quantified it. Does he need that? I don’t want to scare him but I don’t want him to feel like I’m moving too fast. "
1859,isfj,"Just be natural. ISFJs go with the flow as should you. You can't force feelings or people to like you. If they do, they do. If they like you because you put more effort than you needed to, good luck keeping it up because you won't. If you try, you'll develop a high level of resentment for them. You don't want to resent someone you originally liked. It's not worth it. So just relax and go with the flow."
1860,isfj,I think this is definitely reflected in this subreddit as compared to some of the other MBTI subs. We almost never post topics on our own. It seems like most of the posts are made by other personality types (ahem...ENTP lol) and then we pipe in in the comments. :)
1861,isfj,Also can you tell me how you act in a relationship? What is too much? I don’t want to come off to strong but also don’t want make him think I’m not interested. They don’t give a lot of feedback around that. 
1862,isfj,"For me, I'm just not sure what to say! It's like, what can I say that's relevant that this person might be interested in? No point in just saying ""hi"", that's asinine and boring and the conversation will fizzle out within a couple of messages guaranteed. So if I want to talk to someone but I'm not sure what to say, I try to send pictures of my cat or something on Snapchat or whatever, or I mention something funny or stressful that happened to me that day (depending on my mood), or ask them about something they mentioned... etc (although I'm bad at that last one!)."
1863,isfj,"I think this is due to our weak Ne, however I do also think it could be not wanting to say the wrong thing.
An important need for ISFJ’s is to feel comfortable & safe, so I’m sure if you create that kind of environment he will eventually open up to you!
I hope this helps! :) 
ISFJ Cognitive Function Stack:


Si - introverted Sensing
SiFe’s naturally use Si to catalogue experiences and information they deem important. In particular, they remember their impressions of experiences they’ve had. They have an organized internal world and their mind can easily put similar pieces of information into appropriate categories. They learn straightforward, practical systems, rules, and strategies with ease and grace. Si gives the sense of the SiFe being grounded and having a linear, black and white way of thinking about things.


Fe - extroverted Feeling
Fe is the primary way SiFe’s interact with and understand the people in the world around them. It is not emotions, but “gut instincts” they might have about a person or situation. This function is focused outwardly and reads or “takes in” information about other people. It picks up on their vibes and what their thoughts and feelings might be. Fe also helps SiFe’s relate back to and communicate with people in a way that people are comfortable with.


Ti - introverted Thinking
Ti analyzes information and seeks truthful answers to all of life’s questions. When Ti serves Si in an SiFe, it analyzes things in a categorical, organized manner, and seeks truth about experiences and situations. Because Ti is right after Fe in order of preference, SiFe’s can be very balanced between their stoic analytical side and the side of them that values people.


Ne - extroverted iNtuition
Ne is the SiFe’s last function. Ne is the small part of the SiFe that craves simple new experiences and ideas, but because it is their weakest function, it can only be used in simple ways or for short periods. For example, when coming up with an idea to execute a project, they can take a lot of details they’ve gathered from previous experience and put them together to form a really great concept, but coming up with an idea about a project when they have no relevant practical experience catalogued away can be very difficult. Ne can also fuel sudden “lightbulb” moments where an idea strikes them out of nowhere as they’re talking.

1864,isfj,"This. Ask me specifically about my favorite shows and I can tell you funny parts all day, ask me what I like to watch and I'm very vague, ""idk... movies... comedy... stuff..""
​
I am not afraid of saying anything wrong, I just... don't have anything to spontaneously say. It actually drives me crazy, my mom will go, ""tell me something."" And it's just like... if I had something to tell you I would be telling you? "
1865,isfj,^ Yes.
1866,isfj,Like asking about what they’re thinking or opinions to much. I feel like I have to do a lot of asking to get him to talk. What annoys you. I feel like certain type I can annoy by asking to much while others like that. I am very upfront about who I am and what I like and stand for. I’m more curious about what annoys your type. 
1867,isfj,"Oh, well... first, I will say I have no idea whether anything about me is because I am an ISFJ so I will just answer about myself but maybe not all ISFJs are like this.
Asking about things doesn't really annoy me unless I say ""I don't know"" or ""nothing"" and you keep asking. I have actually noticed this in therapy, not relationships. My therapist will ask me something and I will say I don't know or no or something, and then he will just look at me or ask more and I get really irritated because I wasn't lying, I didn't know, and if I don't know, what am I supposed to say beyond I don't know? 
I prefer to be asked questions than to be expected to think of things myself. Like, ""tell me about yourself"" stumps me, but ""what's your favorite color?"" Seafoam green followed by pink. ""What kind of shows do you like?"" Well I like comedy but I also like drama but dramadies are good of course... I really like thrillers too but only some types... I will watch horror...etc. ""What is your favorite TV show?"" 30 Rock and Arrested Development are tied, but my favorite that is still airing is Brooklyn 99 or The Good Place.
It's really not what you ask it's how you ask it that will determine whether or not I am annoyed. Personally, if you are asking or talking too much, I will tell you I don't feel like talking or I am tired or something. I won't just be fuming inside that you won't shut up unless you're being really rude like I'm on the phone and you're talking to me. I obviously wouldn't yell ""stfu Im on the phone"" because I am on the phone, LOL! 
I know I am a quiet person so I don't really get bothered when people initiate actual conversations. I do not like small talk though, probably for the same reason I feel frustrated when I've already answered and someone asks for more. Like... if you ask me how I am when we're both getting on an elevator, am I really supposed to tell you how I am at this exact moment feeling? No. Of course, ""good, how about you?"" is the answer. Like wtf do you WANT FROM ME is the feeling it gives me. But, ""hey, I heard your mom was sick, is she okay?"" wouldn't bother me in the exact same situation. That seems genuine like you are actually asking me a question and want to know the answer.
Also, don't talk to me while I am doing things and it's clearly not the time to talk to me. One of the best example I have is that I get filled with rage when neighbors stop me when I am walking my dog for small talk. If you legitimately have something to say to me or my mail got delivered to your house or something, that's fine. But stopping me for, ""oh how are you...this weather, huh?"" while my poor dog pulls at the leash and wants to, oh idk, walk on her walk pisses me off. That could just be me. Also, when I am coming through the door with hands full and stuff, just wait. Let me put my stuff down, take my shoes off, and take a breath before you come at me. It's like ""don't talk to me before I've had my coffee"" but don't talk to me if I am clearly freaking occupied. Sure, get my attention if I am occupied, but wait and make sure you have it or you're just talking at me and I can hear it but not process it and it frustrates me. 
(See how I had to say, like what and you had to super explain what you were looking for before I could answer, though, and my answer is way too long? lol)"
1868,isfj,"Yes! This is also why I sometimes have trouble holding conversations with people if they just message me ""hey"" or ""hi"". The conversation invariably goes like this:
Them: hi
Me: hey!
Them: what up
Me: just chilling, you?
Them: cool
Then... nothing else happens. It's like they message me expecting me to carry the conversation and I'm sorry, I don't have time for that, and very likely if you're expecting that you're also boring as a rock (seriously, I once had a mutual friend get upset that I wouldn't respond to his messages but it was literally ALL THE SAME. He was so boring, he had literally nothing to talk about so I had nothing to say. So I muted him so I wouldn't have to feel guilty when he messaged me and I didn't respond to him lol)."
1869,isfj,"Hey everyone! I'm from a Discord server focused around personality typology, emphasis on MBTI but with lots of talk about Jungian theory, socionics, and enneagram as well. We're over a year old, have a nice bot that does things for us like channel and role management, and would like to open the gates to newcomers so we can all have fun. What makes us different than most other Discord servers is that we're more focused on actual discussion and conversation with minimal shitposting (we keep that in the #nsfw channel). With that in mind, please join if you want to discuss Jungian theory, get people to try to figure out your type, want to debate the merits of Socionics vs MBTI, discuss the deeper meaning of your Enneagram, or just want to have a good talk.

1870,isfj,"Edit: I MEANT ISFJ AND ISTJ!!!
Okay, I'm confused.
I'm very particular who I choose as friends, who I let into my ""inner world"" or ""core"".
To the ""others"", that would be everyone else, I'm this logical, high and mighty, and withdrawn ISTJ. Although deep inside I care too much what they think, I still try not to let it affect me. Like, I lowkey try to be ""above"" everyone else, because I can be above them, also so they'd be too intimidated/uncomfortable to even think about putting me down or something. Oh and frankly, I fucking hate others and only respect them to avoid conflict.
But, to the people I'd die for, I'm this clingy, needy, impulsive, turbulent, and very protective ISFJ. I'm so protective it's hard when a friend requires me to ""give me some time for myself"" because being unable to know what they're up to is so hard for me. Like, I don't trust they'll be good on their own without me. Sometimes my desire to help them exceeds boundaries, it's hard for me to be content when friends don't tell me the reason why they want to be treated a certain way.
Someone help me decide."
1871,isfj,"Ok you should look into taking a cognitive function test like at 
http://similarminds.com/classic_jung.html
ISFJ Functional Stack: Si Fe Ti Ne
ISTJ Functional Stack: Si Te Fi Ne
Basically the difference is ISFJs when making decisions are going to consider people and values before impersonal analysis and logic and with ISTJs it’s vice versa. So do you find that I Ti ally make decisions more based on people/values or on impersonal analysis/logic. "
1872,isfj,"Also, I think I read that post as ""I'm unhappy one way. I'm also unhappy another way. Which one am I""? 
You're both. And I hope you try to resolve your unhappiness. I thought maybe you'd want instead to focus your question around that."
1873,isfj,"have you taken a test focusing on cognitive functions? as someone below mentioned, we have all 8 functions. you aren't just a feeler or just a thinker- you have the ability to do both, just in different order. 
do you more-so make decisions more so based on rationality/order order or compassion/empathy? e.g. if you were a judge, would you be more so by the book and follow the law no matter what, or would you be willing to give some leeway based on the individual's situation?"
1874,isfj,"Series:

Angel Beats (mostly satire, but entertaining)
One Punch Man (satire again, but funny)
Kuruko no Basket (I love playing bball, so it's entertaining)
Psycho Pass (1st season is good, but not excellent)
Clannad and After Story (for those who like their heart strings pulled)
Code Geass (aboslutely love this one, but it's not for everyone)
Cowboy Bebop (if you enjoy episodial series)
Death Note (Epic beginner anime)
Fate/Zero (for those who like fighting/action anime)
FMA: Brotherhood (Pretty good intro to longer animes)
Haikyuu (biased because I love playing volleyball)
Kino's Journey (again episodial series)
Steins;Gate (if you like time travel/sci-fi)
Sword Art Online (1st season is pretty good, but tailors off heavily)
Hunter x Hunter (for those who like DBZ-type series)

Movies:

The Girl who Jumped Through Time
Summer Wars
Studio Ghibli (really anything of theirs)
"
1875,isfj,"As I get older I have been watching it less moved away from anime series to anime movies. 
Besides all the Ghibli greats some nice movies are, The Boy and the Beast, Wolf Children, 5 Centimeters Per Second, and Garden of Words. 
Attack on Titan was the last good series I found."
1876,isfj,"Off the top of my head:
-Fullmetal Alchemist (All time fav)
-My Love Story (Super light hearted)
-Fruits Basket (Honestly, skip the anime and read the manga. They stopped the anime at like volume 7 and theres 23 volumes)
-Haikyuu!! (Characters are amazing)
-Nichijou (Super funny)
-High School Debut 
-Say ""I Love You""
-My Little Monster
Basically I'm a sucker for sweet slice of life romance~
Movies... Basically all of Ghibli
Wolf Children: Ame and Yuki has a special place in my heart."
1877,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and feel I'm moody. And it doesn't seem to fit the bill. When I miss things I suddenly become saddened, like I'll never see it again. But I try to re-assure myself by saying I'll miss a lot of things, and be happy with what you see, hear, etc.
But then again, I could just be an unhealthy ISFJ"
1878,isfj,"I think for the most part, I'm only moody if I'm going through some kind of crisis. In which case, I'm basically an emotional wreck, and I pity anybody who has to be near me. 
But that's really only happened a couple times in my life so far, and the circumstances have to be pretty bad for me to end up like that."
1879,isfj,"Hi everyone. I have had a difficult time confidently figuring out my type. When I tried taking function based online tests, I would get ISFJ as a result. When I went to the MbtiTypeMe subreddit, the responses I got there said that I was probably an ISFJ. I've tried looking at descriptions, stereotypes and examples of ISFJs, and a good deal of it doesn't seem to click with me. It seems like there are a lot of aspects of ISFJs that I don't express, and I was wondering what everyones thoughts on it were.
​
For example, I'm not very expressive. I tend to usually have a neutral expression on my face. I do laugh and smile, but only sparingly for short intervals. I fake smile a lot to be polite, but even then, I don't hold the fake smile for longer then a few seconds. I've been referred to as a robot and android by friends in the past. 
​
I'm not very altruistic either. I will help others with tasks, but only if they ask or after I ask. I've never just started helping someone unprompted. If I ask if someone needs help and they say no, I might ask again if I'm still worried about them, but will leave them be if told no again. I am usually good about asking if people need help. 
​
I've heard that ISFJs are the most extroverted of the introverts, but I am the most introverted person that I know. I don't start conversations or take the initiative in meeting new people. I appear standoffish and distant. I also don't try to contact friends or most family. I do make a point of visiting my parents on occasion. I also tend to be quite quiet in any group larger than two people. I can be talkative on occasion. 
​
I'm not a gift giver, which is another ISFJ stereotype that I've heard. I don't care for receiving gifts, so I generally don't give them either. On the rare occasion that I do decide to give a gift to someone, I end up anxiously trying to decide what to give them. 
​
I've also heard that lower functions tend to be unconscious, and I can sometime find that I am using FE without realizing it. When talking to people, I can have different mannerisms and vocal tone depending on who I'm talking to. This happens automatically for me. I notice that when I am talking to someone who speaks in broken English, I will start speaking in a similar way. 
​
I am also a shut in. I don't spend much time outside in nature. I prefer to spend my time inside, unless my friends are doing something outside. I've been called a homebody. 
​
These are most of the reasons why I question whether I am an ISFJ of not. I do fit some stereotypes, like being polite and nice. I have always been well behaved, stubborn and averse to risk. I am a picky eater and can tell if what I am eating tastes different than usual. I also use to be very sensitive and would state if my feeling had been hurt. I'm also very indecisive. 
​
Thanks for hearing me out. I'm sure that this wasn't helpful in figuring out my type, since stereotypes aren't indicative of type, but I was wondering what everyone thought. Are these things that ISFJs express, and is the uncertainty of type common in ISFJs?"
1880,isfj,"Like you said, an important thing to remember is that stereotypes are stereotypes - you don't need to fit them all, or even any of them! The most extroverted introvert isn't /really/ a technical thing regarding MBTI - that varies for every person, it's just in general.
I was looking through your previous post, and noticed you're a guy. ISFJ's are mainly seen as women on many MBTI sites (since there are more ISFJ women then men), which could also play into why you don't fit the stereotypes so much! Upbringing differences can play into how you interact with your environment."
1881,isfj,"INTP here.
There aren't any tests that you can take without bias. You might answer the questions with what you'd ""like"" to be, thus creating bias. You might also have answered the test in other state of being (unconcious, subconcious or superego). 
Either way it doesn't matter so much, the MBTI test is flawed and requires a lot of filtering to actually get to some truth. Same with all other tests. If you really are on a quest to self discovery, i'd suggest taking a panoply of other tests and combining your results for a fuller picture. 
Mental illness (i'll put emphasis on depression because it seems like everyone is depressed these days for some reason) can also have a major impact on results. I read another comment saying that type stereotypes are just stereotypes; very true. The type descriptions are based on the most common reported experiences from the various types but fitting them exactly is more than abnormal.
In the end, knowing yourself is a life long quest. Tests can trim it down a little but you'll have to do the bulk lf the work. I'd recommend trying to ""separate yourself from yourself"" to further understand your emotions and where they come from. (I realise this may sound cryptic but by taking a step back from your thoughts and observing them come to you instead of ""having them"" you can further understand why they manifest themselves) By analysing your thoughts and emotions, you can figure out if your cognitive function stack matches the ISFJ one or if you were mistyped. Mistyping happens all the time, face to face typing with an expert will reduce the chance though."
1882,isfj,"I feel like I'm pretty opposite of the stereotypes you've mentioned, but I'm pretty sure I'm an ISFJ. My SIL also tests ISFJ but is much more stereotypical and far more extroverted. Each of the 4  spectrums of MBTI are just that... spectrums. When it comes to the introverted-extroverted spectrum I'm sitting on the ""I"" and she's very close to the middle. Also, I'm an Enneagram 9 and she's an Enneagram 2, which accounts for some of the differences. MBTI can account for a pretty wide array (it fits every person into one of 16 categories after all), but I think it helps a lot to research and look at cognitive function stacks. That's where the commonalities really shine through."
1883,isfj,ISFJ have Si hero. Si hero means they always recall what's in the past and words is an important things cuz Si hero loves certainty. I think that's why you said ISFJ is the most extraverted introverted. You can google either are you have Si/Fi/Ti/Ni hero.
1884,isfj,"If you don't like this you don't need to say that this is dumb. This things (the true one) is not a stereotype (for me, as far as i learn), it's more like a mind pattern or decision making. I hate that people streotype isfj as a traditionalist and i hate being type cuz i now i am unique. But i like this mbti things cuz i learn many different patterns of mind. If you don't like it you can leave anw, no need to say negative about something you don't like."
1885,isfj,Wait a min. What do you understand about Si? I think you got the wrong understanding. Tbh i dont like to ISFJ/ENTP/blabla 16 personality thing. I better rely on 8 cognitive function. Cuz introvert/extrovert/sense/judge doesn't explain anything clear thats why 16 thingy looks like a stereotype. I learn from Si/Se/Fi/Fe/Ti/Te/Ni/Ne. Cuz i'm done with 16 types things that's too streotyping in my opinion
1886,isfj,"Ohh I see. I don't really care for the functions, I think they overcomplicate things. I just looked at the letters and picked which ones sounded more like me. I'm I, s, F, j. I get it on the test too. (well first time I took the test I got ISTJ but it doesn't sound like me :P)"
1887,isfj,"You only need to know what is your dominant and parent function. Si hero people are based on past experience, attention to detail, recalling, noticing similarities and mismatch, etc. It is not just like Introverted and Sensing. Cuz it's totally different. If it's not your primary function then you're not ISFJ/ISTJ. It's that simple.
If you don't care and think that this is not accurate then why are you still here?"
1888,isfj,"At the beginning, i was thinking like you and thought that simple way to type. But the more i know, that's is not the accurate way to figure out what type. But i know you aren't interested at this cuz you think this is complicated and not accurate. But it's okay, no one is forcing you to learn about this. But it's sad that you think this things is kinda stupid just because what do you think your type is not accurate. You don't need to reply to my replied cuz i now i can never help you"
1889,isfj,"Hi! I’ve previously posted on this thread and yes, I’m still in the motions of moving on from her! Background: ENFP male confessed to ISFJ female and was rejected.
Short update: She said “let’s be friends for now. I’m unsure if things will change in the future but yes, that for now”. Another redditor has pointed out (in a separate subreddit) she may be using me as a safety net.
Here’s the more important question: We’re still texting daily however. I still treasure her as a friend so it is unlikely I’ll go completely cold on her. But a lot of the times, she would call me “Annoying” when I tease her about stuff. For example, I’d lightly tease her about her obvious grammar mistakes when we’re chatting and she’d say “annoying”. So, when she says that, does it mean she is truly annoyed, or that she’s just bantering?"
1890,isfj,"I am an ENFP with an ISFJ boyfriend, I pretty much try to refrain from any teasing or pointing out when hes made a mistake because it usually hurts his feelings, wether he voices it or not.
The first year or so in my mind, I would playfully ""roast"" him or poke fun at little things, and although he never said anything then he waay later confessed that it felt like I was making fun of him and that I was putting him down. 
Now if I have a comment I'll keep it to myself unless it's extremely obvious were both goofing around. 
So yeah if shes literally telling you it's annoying you should probably stop lol. Us ENFP's tend to be a little too playful sometimes haha."
1891,isfj,"Personally, as an INFP I feel like I annoy anyone and everyone around me. In your experience has this been true? What do you like and dislike about INFPs? Is there anything you admire or envy? Is there anything you're incredibly glad you don't have/experience internally? Because in my small experience with ISFJ people, you're all wonderful and I kind of want to latch onto you and never leave you alone, but I also feel like that might totally suck the life out of you. "
1892,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ who married an INFP. We seem to help balance each other out in terms of our attitudes towards life. I'm very focused and determined to accomplish my goals, sometimes too much, and can be a realist to a fault. She admits that she often gets caught up thinking and fantasizing about her goals and ambitions but never goes beyond that. She helps me to stop and smell the roses once in a while and I help her turn her daydreaming into action and results. We seem to bring each other closer to the middle on the work-play scale of life.
I do have an artistic side that she brings out of me once in a while and I appreciate that. She also helps me realize that a little bit of clutter in your life isn't the end of the world."
1893,isfj,"No way! My dear friend and girl I have affection for is an INFP. It always feels like she’s trying to overflow and hold back at the same time. I say, if you know the person well, go for it! Show them your world. Granted, try to do it gradually. It can be exhausting, but don’t think that we don’t care. We really do care, even if it may not always seem like it. At least I do care about her thoughts. She’s always telling me these wild ideas she has and then she looks over at me and gets embarrassed for them. I assure you, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about. 
I also think we can help one another. You with your heads in the clouds and us with our heads towards the ground. Together, we can help teach each other to look forward. She always says that I’m smart and “wise” compared to her, but it’s just because she thinks her ideas are silly. I think she may be going a little far by calling my more rational views as “wise.” In the end, we can really get along well. Just don’t be afraid to open up, but do so at a good pace. "
1894,isfj,"Two of my best friends are INFPs, and I get along with them quite nicely! I have to say, I am a little envious of your artistic abilities. Most of the time I'm not very creative, and I wish I could find the inspiration to come up with cool works of art or creative writing like you guys do!"
1895,isfj,"This made me smile a lot. I needed a good smile. You get a thumbs up from me. Also- you know, I'd send some cookies to you or something, but the internet isn't that advanced yet. It helps to know that when the xSFJ I know is giving me suggestions, they're not trying to trash my idea, they're just trying to give me tangible ways to do things. My head is definitely in the clouds and I change what I say I want to do every three days. Having someone there to help me stop and think about things in a practical way is always good! "
1896,isfj,"Wow! Thank you so much. Also, while I understand that, I find in my experience that almost all of my creative energy comes from an extremely dark, scary place. It's not so fun to go there to rescue the ideas. Though, I'm not sure that's the case for everyone! The Sensing is what throws me off about ISFJs. Do you all go off of your first gut reaction? I've heard that trait attributed to both Intuition and Feeling, I've never really been able to figure which it is. Because my mom is an ESFJ and although she sometimes trusts her gut instincts, she almost always wants some concrete reason to back up that instinct. If that makes any sense? For me, if I'm driving down the road and my gut tells me to pull over and turn around, to stop going the route I was going and take a different way, I do. No questions asked. My mom would want to know why she had that instinct to go a different way. I am perfectly content never knowing how or why the instinct came. How do you experience things in that sense, if you're willing to divulge. I'm very curious. Part of the reason why I enjoy all this personality stuff is because I've always been a bit of an outsider and never really understood that way other people thought. I knew why they did the things they did, I could just pick up on that, but the actual thought process stumped me. So by studying all this, I can kind of get a bit of a look into other people's brains and it's kinda beautiful. Anyways, that's a lot of writing and a lot to read. Sorry about that. Sometimes my fingers go faster than my brain! "
1897,isfj,"Absolutely. Also, you’re not an annoyance nor do you get on anyone’s nerves. Have no fear. Your passion is infectious and refreshing, at least it is to me. I, as an ISFJ, can get so stuck in my ways. Having someone keep me on my toes is refreshing, so don’t feel bad for it. I like hearing new, broad ideas. "
1898,isfj,"Yes this is true of me! Largely because in the past I've opened up accusing others of something due to ""gut feeling"" and they start pushing asking me for concrete evidence that they're thinking that and I usually stammer ""I-I...well I just know."" Then they tell me I am way too judgmental and I end up letting the thought enter my brain about the possibility of them being right, and I am just assuming things out of paranoia. So nowadays, I still have the gut assumption but push it aside to just wait for concrete evidence of something and then I jump on the person like a hungry bear. ""Aha! I knew it!"" Most of the time, people have such strong cognitive dissonance that they'll make excuses to put me in the wrong and at that point I give up on a clear put losing battle"
1899,isfj,"I think the need for concrete facts is driven by the SJ part of my personality. I'm very aware of my surroundings and the information I'm taking in via my 5 senses. If I get a gut feeling that something is wrong, my first reaction is to evaluate the data coming from my senses and compare it to past observations/experiences in my mind. If I can identify a specific cause for this bad feeling, it will help me determine how to effectively respond to a problem. It's all about making decisions based on past experiences.
Hopefully that makes sense."
1900,isfj,"Well, I'm sure I get on someone's nerves, but it makes me glad to know that I most likely don't get on most people's nerves! Especially ISFJs. I admire ISFJs quite a bit. I don't know why, I just do. They seem very warm to me. I know that's maybe an odd thing to say. They just seem genuine when many others don't. I see right through people, usually. The people who put on the fake smile and pretend like they care are the worst. Any xSFJ I've ever known has never done that to me. Although, I think I tend to lean more towards ISFJs because E's exhaust me! "
1901,isfj,"I’m curious what that would be like! I feel like I don’t fit into a lot of the mbti discords since it’s mostly nt conversation that dominates. 
And it’s like, I get to read about how people low key hate SJs all the time, and it starts to make me feel bad about being there. 
Anyway, I thought it was worth a shot to ask if this exists already. "
1902,isfj,"As mentioned in the moderator signups topic I made a few weeks ago I was looking for people who look like they can do some fun interesting things with the subreddit and based on what they said I'm excited to have them!
I personally choosing to step down as a moderator myself soon since I've been busy and haven't done as much with the subreddit as I want."
1903,isfj,"Hey everyone! :) Thanks for the welcomes and I'm super excited to be a mod!! 😊
A little bit about me: I'm Canadian, I love cats, I'm in the EST time zone, and I work 7 AM to 3 PM, so I'll generally be around in the evenings (although I'm at work as I type this out! 😅). Also, I mostly browse on mobile and I love to use emojis.
I have some ideas for discussion topics and making this subreddit more active. I've noticed that a lot of other MBTI type-specific subreddits have a lot more activity than we do. Maybe some weekly threads, or weekend threads could help with that here!
I hope y'all bear with me while I learn how to be a mod. I've never done this before, and I don't exactly know what to expect!"
1904,isfj,"Hey everybody. Thanks for the welcome and I'm stoked to be a mod. I'm really excited to make this subreddit more active. I have a few interesting topics that I want to implement such as ISFJ Handling Care Manual and a sub on the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. I live in California so I'm in the Pacific Time Zone. I'm new to be a mod, so bear with me. If you guys have anymore interesting ideas to add to this sub feel free to PM me. "
1905,isfj,"Yes ? Not only a single, even, and even only as ISFJs, not counting their individual unique qualities.
I mean, I can grasp that being their polar opposite. How shameful is it that you can't ?
Why the loaded nearly rhetorical question ?"
1906,isfj,"I'm very confused as to what clickbait means to you and as for the rest I'm not sure what place would be the most appropriate, I just realised there are subreddits for individual types.
I mean it's not like any answer's coming. But being thorough is bad."
1907,isfj,"I do my best to be engaging and somewhat personnable. This kind of smug monosylsbic stupidity just sickens me.
It makes me think I should keep on my smug bastard ways, as it's the only thing that is understood.
I'm beyond pissed."
1908,isfj,"It's not an innocent question, and OP's dismissive behavior confirms it. It's ill intentioned.
When I ask for a clarification, I want to be answered, not ridiculed.
It's long I'm on the Internet. I find your advice rather patronizing in hindsight of that.
Yes, I'm overreacting. But I'm also right ."
1909,isfj,"Hello friends, ENFP here. I have a friend who I can't type perfectly.
What's the main differences between you two? Maybe you can help me out, I'll tell you a bit about him. He doesn't show what he really feels when he's sad or upset, but I can tell. He still won't tell if I ask him. He always thinks of what's logical, yet he is very very considerate of the people he cares about. He measures his words. He also is very afraid of confrontation, and would avoid it even more than myself. I don't know, if I can think of anything else I'll tell you. Thanks in advance"
1910,isfj,"Main difference will be Te vs Fe. 
Te prioritizes logical execution of external tasks. It gets shit done. 
Fe prioritizes doing what Si (the worldview function) deems as best for the group. It is an accommodating and harmonious function. 
In other words, ask yourself if he prioritizes being in harmony with those around him (Fe- ISFJ) VS.  getting stuff done (Te-ISTJ). 
From your description, sounds like ISFJ. "
1911,isfj,"Thanks a lot! I have trouble with functions yet you made it quite simple, now I'm most sure he's and ISFJ. He has a great need of getting things done and being productive, yet it seems like he proritize harmony rather than getting that stuff done (although he hates not being able to). Thanks again!"
1912,isfj,"I just read the ISFJ description and it fits him greatly, you've been of great help. I always though he was T because he's very logical and tends to think in a very organized way. I forgot what I was going to say so thanks again!"
1913,isfj,"No problem man. So you'll notice that ISFJ has Si
This tells us that above all else, he is most committed to staying loyal to his worldview. Si is a very traditional worldview where comfort and security are highly valued. Sometimes you'll see them in bad situations, but they don't change it very quickly (if at all), because it's comfortable and its better than the ""unknown"". 
Follow that with Fe, which we already went over. You'll see them basically using their people skills to relate to others who have similar worldviews as them, and they use that to form connections. 
Now it's important to understand the difference between Ti and Te. T represents logic. When logic is applied externally (Te), it leads to accomplishments and results. These people tend to be very successful and live a very ""no bullshit"" kind of lifestyle. Ti focuses the logic internally, which means rather than getting shit done, it figures shit out. For example, Einstein was a Ti dominant. Ti doms can appear very pensive and analytical. I think this is why you thought your friend was a T. But as you said, as soon as someone shows up, he has to turn his Fe back on bc it is higher priority according to his functional stack. So naturally, he does his best thinking either alone or around people that he doesn't have to use Fe/accommodate (i.e. best friends)
Lastly, the inferior function is Ne. People struggle with inferior functions and tend to avoid them bc it clashes so hard with their dominant function. Ne is very heavy on exploration and uncovering abstract patterns. As you can imagine, this does not sit well with Si who is very tradition and security based. "
1914,isfj,"Yeah I get it, as an ENFP I have Ne Fi Te Si, so I understand the conflict between Ne and Si, but the other way around. And as he is my best friend, I get why he shows me his best thinking, as you said, cause he doesn't have to use Fe. That's most probably why I thought he was an ISTJ, but the definition didn't quite fit. 
Also, this is another question, maybe it's the Fe kicking in, but do you, as ISFJ, tend to overlook your personal desires? Like it gets me forever for him to say what he really wants, i.e., when we must decide where to eat. I push him for him not to accomodate and state what he prefers rather than what I suggested first"
1915,isfj,"I am actually INFJ, but the dumb flair thing isn't working lol. Either way, it doesn't matter, because I have Fe too and the answer to your question is yes. 
Unfortunately, while Fe is nice, too much of it can lead to self neglect. I mean picking a place to eat is not a big deal but in other aspects of our lives, it can mean that we are putting others before us when we don't necessarily have the resources or the mental stability to cope with that situation (basically need to focus on ourselves first). 
The good news is that you don't really have to feel bad about always picking a place, because he genuinely doesn't mind where you guys go "
1916,isfj,"There's an obvious pattern of me going places, meeting someone, becoming their friend, and then realizing they are an ISFJ. I think they like me because of my ability to give them intuitive insight that they simply cannot derive from a situation themselves, in addition to other aspects of me such as my work ethic. I feel a bit bad that ISFJs are so trusting because the ones I've known have gotten into abusive situations in the past and continue to make that mistake as we speak (despite me saying that the person is terrible and predicting their behavior accurately, oof). I also appreciate the quality immensely however, because a lot of people are weary of me and INTJs in general I imagine.
Those are my reasons, what are yours?"
1917,isfj,"I have an interesting relationship with my INTJ friend. We have known each other for almost 20 years. She simultaneously intimidates and impresses me. I look up to her and I think she looks up to me too. We get along very well and enjoy talking about the people in our lives. Like some other old friends, I am nervous to impress her when we meet after it’s been a while. But then talking with her is effortless as usual. I don’t know why I get nervous. "
1918,isfj,"My INTJ friend makes no judgements, but has high expectations of me - and as an ISFJ, it makes me want to work that much harder to meet them because I know that he believes in my potential. And for me personally, that’s the kind of pressure I need to push me to be better. 
You’re dead on about the intuitive insight - something I know that I lack, but his point of view really helps when I need to remove emotions from decision making and in turn after reviewing the situation, I’ve made better choices. It’s a quality I’ve found truly invaluable!"
1919,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INTJ. I have a tremendous amount of respect for his work ethic and even though it’s super annoying when he works on something for hours because it has to be just right, I admire him for it. I’m sensitive and want to have my feelings validated, which he doesn’t always understand - until I directly tell him I need him to validate my feelings. He doesn’t understand why I get wrapped up in my clients cases but I have a tender heart and he knows it. I think that’s what he values in me. I think he understands that the need for me to help others is just gonna be there no matter what. He’s quiet too, which allows me to babble on while we’re together. He’s the one I spill everything to. Mostly because he sits there and listens intensely and absorbs all of it.
I’ve just learned to get straight to the point and be semi mechanical when I need him to understand something. I’ve also learned to pay close attention to what he does for me to show me he loves me instead of what he says because he’s awful at the sweet compliments. But man when he does get one out I value the hell out of it."
1920,isfj,"I've got rules that I live by, but most of them are determined by what I think is the most efficient/effective in practice and not on what someone has told me.
Then again, I'm 50/50 on the thinking to feeling scale."
1921,isfj,They were actually pretty bad in the beginning!! It was really hard to get him to open up! I knew him from school some years ago so I knew that the fight was worth it but I honestly don't know if we both would've kept at it had we not known each other a little bit already. Now that we're past the beginning stages I love being with him. It's so comfortable and he has this sneaky sense of humor that catches me completely off guard sometimes! I love it!
1922,isfj,"I just found this thing, but it describes experiences that I've definitely had, like seeing someone or something and that bringing up something from my memory so strongly it warranted an actual response. I generally keep from ""blurting"" things out, but when ever this happens I often feel it's worth sharing the experience with those around me, especially if I think they might be able to share that experience or clarify it... Or even just help me nail it down.  
So... This thing
To be honest though, the 16 personalities website is pretty spot on from everything I've read. One cool site I found in the past was the respective ""hells"" for each type. Should just be a short Google away. 
Sauce: Isfj, at your service."
1923,isfj,"My boss is a very busy lady, and I recently took an admin job under her.  It wasn't my ideal job, but I needed a job, and she offered.  I really like the work I have been doing, but I'm human (and clutzy) so I make mistakes.
I thought this was normal, but I have learned to dread emails from her, because almost every one of her emails/texts are telling me I did something wrong.
I don't want to sound like a whiny baby, but how do I tell her that I need encouragement, as well?  I understand mistakes should be pointed out, but she only focuses on messups, instead of acknowledging things I do well.  
It's really getting me down, but every situation I can come up with in my head about approaching her makes me sound like a cry baby.
TL;DR: My boss is a negative person and is getting me down, how do I approach her?"
1924,isfj,"Well, you definitely have a case of bad boss. So you're in the right to call her a negative person. If she were to really help you out with your mistakes, then she would physically come to you and help you with whatever that's messing up the job, and show you what to do, or even work with you on it for a while until you get it again (that's the way a boss should work, work with the employees..of course they have other tasks at hand though). Not email you, that is the worst. I know it's hard but, there should be some free time you can pull her aside where you can share how you feel about those emails and the general pressure she's giving. A good boss will listen. They are there for you to do the job and get it done, not to pressure their employees to the extent of high anxiety sky rocketing to where you won't even be able to do the work."
1925,isfj,"I think the best thing to do is to ask lots of questions. If she is critical of you - ask how you can do better next time and or how she would like things done and just be as friendly as possible. It's less likely for her to be critical when you're actively trying to learn. 
If the criticism is quite regular - probably the best thing to do is to look for another job. I'm sure it doesn't have much to do with your capabilities and more with her personality or something going on at home. 
I've been in a similar situation - give it a good go but really - you're just going to reach breaking point trying to please someone who can't be pleased and end up feeling negative about yourself for not being able to live up to her expectations. Not worth it! "
1926,isfj,"Your boss sucks.  If she's demeaning you, she's most likely insecure and worried about her position and status.  Higher ups see this most likely and will keep her flat careered.  Find the persons you admire and are uplifting to socialize with. Give her more than requested and she'll be horrified you want her job.  When combined with your new social group, she will FREAK and destroy herself.  Always be detached, logic centric.  From an ENTJ friend.  "
1927,isfj,"Hi ISFJs. I would like some advice or input from your perspective.
I (25F, INFP) have had a best friend for 19 years (25F, ISFJ). We met in school and stayed close through college. Our differences in personality seemed to grow stronger near the end of our senior years, but at this point the two of were essentially family. She is like my sister, and I can't ever see not having a relationship with her. 
I moved away from home after graduating and met my current boyfriend (28, INTJ) a year ago, who I now live with. My best friend has met him twice. The first time was over lunch in my home town, the second time was when she came to visit for the day in the city I live in now. 
The problem is, I don't think she likes him.
Over Easter, my boyfriend visited with me again and I asked my best friend if she would want to try having a double date with us. I had already spent several days with her to catch up (her boyfriend was with us at that time). I really like her boyfriend. I want her to have a similar relationship with mine, but she never seems interested in spending much time around him, even though I have told her (we had a big fight about it a few months ago) that this really hurts my feelings.
She completely skipped the opportunity for us to go out on a double date by not committing or acting enthusiastic about the idea at all. I am pretty sure she spent the evening with her own boyfriend as a pre-Easter couple celebration (they were apart for the actual holiday). I know the two of them are in the honeymoon phase and I want them to be happy... but I don't understand her behavior. This was her one chance to show some initiative and support. My boyfriend and I won't be back in town for at least another 6-8 months.
I don't know if she just feels really protective of me or if this is some other issue. Can any of you shed some light on this for me? I'm tired of being angry at her. I want to make sure we can maintain our friendship without me winding up hating her. But any time I bring it up she never gives me a straight answer (I assume to prevent hurting my feelings). I want to know what she's thinking or figure out how to fix the situation.
TL;DR: Don't want to lose my 19-year friendship over my best friend disliking my boyfriend. What is her thought process here? What do I do? "
1928,isfj,"One question that you might want to ask, and it might be a painful one, is whether she's avoiding your boyfriend or avoiding you. 
Have there been any times in the past when she really needed someone and you weren't there, or have you ever left her in a position where perhaps she felt stranded? 
If you try to force her into something, I don't think that it will ultimately end up how you want it to, because she will probably begin to resent you for it. Do you feel like you're putting in a lot of work in the friendship and she doesn't reciprocate? Or has that perhaps happened in reverse where you were unreliable, or just generally absent when she was trying to make things work between the two of you?"
1929,isfj,"Sometimes I do not like people. You might love your boyfriend, but that does not mean everyone necessarily will. It is probably rude she handled it how she did, and I expect if she is not taking the time to support you maybe she is having personal troubles?
Especially with an INTJ -- my ex is an INTJ and he was very hard to read at first. Sometimes they can be tactful, other times they are too blunt (for my fragile feelers to handle lol).
I'd try to explicitly ask her about it. Have you asked her if she does not like him? Tell her to be honest and let you know why. Tbh, it might be a silly reason -- for me, my pet peeve is attention whores. So perfectly ""nice"" people who come across as needy for attention really bug me. She might have another silly reason like me. In my defense, I know the reason is dumb but I can't help to just not like those people because of my past experiences with being ignored/over-shadowed."
1930,isfj,"Thank you for your reply. I don't think she's avoiding me, because our few days together we spent w/o my boyfriend were great. We like planning things to do together. 
I hope that I've never made her feel that way, but she may dislike the amount of focus/attention I give my boyfriend when a lot of my spare energy used to be communicating with her. By nature she is very competitive.
Should I put my hurt feelings aside and try to put 100% into our friendship? I am holding back because I don't want to resent trying too hard and not getting much back (example: I set up a skype date and she missed it, I have sent her cards and she doesn't send them back). But maybe she feels the same way. "
1931,isfj,"I think a large part of it is that she is currently enamored with her current boyfriend. It's her best relationship to date and they are still in the honeymoon phase. I have a feeling she's trying to ""protect me"" because every time I mention issues about living with my bf she replies with something along the lines of ""I just want you to be happy, you should never have doubts, my boyfriend and I never have issues""
I want to shake her and say ""You're still in the honeymoon phase you have no idea what it's like to actually see him as a real human being that FARTS."""
1932,isfj,"Ok I see, yea that could potentially be it as well. Perhaps she feels as though she really tries but doesn't get much in return because of the time you spend with him. 
I think what might help would be to just make it very clear, in a loving way, how you feel. Like, you don't necessarily need to get mad at her (she probably doesn't want confrontation), but just tell her exactly how you feel and why you feel that way. You can put the ball in her court without giving her an ultimatum. And I think that you're right in your last sentence. If both of you are holding back on each other it's bound to feel strained and tense, which is why I think that just being completely honest with her is important.  "
1933,isfj,I'm an ESTP. The only women I have ever clicked with on a very deep romantic level have been two women who had the ISFJ personality. I could even see myself marrying one of them but distance and/or relocation got in the way for both scenarios (plus I was younger then too). I don't know much about MBTI so I was wondering if the ISFJ and ESTP match is a good one romantically. Why or why not?
1934,isfj,"http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFJ_rel.html
That site says they are natural partners. 
My personal opinion I think the ISFJ and ESTP have a lot to offer each other. I think the big question is is the ESTP ready to settle down. Cause ISFJs tend to take their relationships seriously. On our part we need to learn to relax the J a bit and the ESTP can help with that. The ISFJ could also introduce some structure in the ESTPs life. We also share the same judging functions (Fe and Ti) just flipped between auxiliary and teritary. So the ESTP can help the ISFJs Ti and the ISFJ can help the ESTPs Fe. "
1935,isfj,"Most websites say ISFJ and ESTP are made for each other.. I admire an ESTP man, but he doesn't even know I exist. No personal experience, but here you go -
https://www.personality-central.com/ISFJ-ESTP.html"
1936,isfj,"They are in ""mirage"" relations in socionics, which is one of the better relationships types: ISFJ relationships & ESTP relationships.  
  Mirage aka illusionary relations are sometimes described as relations of psychological relaxation, which sometimes is too much. Mirage types find it easy to spend time together and enjoy each other's company, but on the down side they don't take each other very seriously and have trouble completing tasks together.  
Mirage type is very similar to dual type, which is ENTP for ISFJ and INFJ for ESTP, thus mirages are very commonly attracted to each other."
1937,isfj,"My first ex was an ESTP - I loved how he took me out of my comfort zone without forcing me into doing anything or making me feel boring or bad if I didn't.  I felt safe with him and he would keep me close-by, he wouldn't pretend he didn't know me or didn't like me like some young guys do, he made it clear to his friends and other girls that we were together but still let me be me and have my freedom - protective, not controlling!  He was a really popular, funny guy but we broke up because his ""recreational"" drug use was becoming more of a habit (he wasn't dealing well with some issues in his life) and he sadly passed away (non-drug related) a few years ago, "
1938,isfj,"As an ENFP, I find that ISFJs spend lots of time attempting to appear perfect to society, and will go great lengths to maintain their image. 
My mother is an ISFJ, and countless times she has told me that the things I say are inappropriate and that not everyone has to know my business, and that I need to appear a certain way because of XYZ reasons and XYZ perceptions of me from others if I don’t do so. While I care about what others think, my perfectionism appears most in creative works in which I immerse myself, particularly poetry and other creative outlets as I’m always striving for poetic meaning and imagery and prose that accurately and poetically explains concepts, ideas, symbolic elements, relationship dynamics, emotion, etc.
Why do ISFJs feel the need to impose their expectations of perfection onto others instead of trying to understanding differences?"
1939,isfj,We expect perfection for ourselves but are very accepting of others. We are very ordered and aware of societal perceptions. If she is worried about how you are perceived it’s another manifestation of trying to protect you from societies judgement and not because you are lacking. 
1940,isfj,"I think you're right, ISFJs definitely try to maintain their self-defined perfect image. And everyone's image is different, but I know that I always work so that people will only see me in the way I want them to see me. 
That said, I don't think projecting that image onto someone else is a part of ISFJ. I think that's just your mom. "
1941,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I struggle with this a lot. And it’s brought to my attention often. It isn’t that I don’t accept others but it seems to stem from having found the most efficient way to do things and those methods have been proven to yield success. 
As caretakers, we have a subconscious need to “save people from themselves” and to protect others from harm. The downside is that we don’t always see the other path or we are not fully confident in the outcome of said path. We also tend to forget that there is more learning in failure than there is in success, sometimes. 
It sounds like your mom is genuinely trying to give you advice, but going about it in the wrong way. I suggest being clear about who you are and your preferred methods. I also suggest reminding her that sometimes she needs to let you fail so that you can learn from your mistakes. Us ISFJs need that reminder every now and then. "
1942,isfj,"You're talking about ISFJs (plural) while reporting a single example. The sampling is insufficient, there is also a precise kind of relationship between you and said ISFJ.
Other types can impose their views as well, that's not an ISFJ thing - but you're going to find this case particularly bothersome because Si is your inferior and there is a Fe vs Fi clash.
Si is not necessarily close-mindedness and vice-versa."
1943,isfj,Call outs like this to ISFJs annoying qualities always make me think “shit....yeah I do that. “ I just feel like apologizing cause like yeah no one should do that. It’s just like some weird compulsion we have to control things. 
1944,isfj,"Not necessarily, but a lot of them are. Or at least the ones I ‘ve met unfortunately. Also I think its a Sensor trait to be close minded of a lot of things due to their tendency to follow traditions and culture taught to them by their families. This I’m sure you’re familiar with or read too many times as I have. So it’s not just an ISFJ issue, it’s an SJ issue. Isfjs just to impose themselves in Fe related matters as opposed to other things like excessive logic. 
Btw, I’m not biased in my opinion. You think because I’ve listed only one example that my opinion isn’t valid. It’s well-known that Fe-users expect perfectionism from others in terms of social appropriateness.  I don’t appreciate your condescending tone, furthermore, because it illustrates my point. Isfjs tend to be stubborn in the face of any sort of view that differs from theirs (in terms of how open someone is). "
1945,isfj,"It’s pretty rude to come to a sub dedicated to ISFJ and blame an entire group for how your mom treats you. I’m truly sorry that you have a strained relationship. But, please don’t impose that on us. 
I appreciate your point of view. I really do not appreciate your delivery 🤷‍♀️"

1947,isfj,"I literally just settled into this type! It took a lot of researching and introspection though. Before I had been consistently getting either INFP or INFJ in quizzes, and never really identified with either, so I just brushed off the whole MBTI concept. It's only in the last couple of days that I finally learned about the cognitive functions underlying the types, so I spent a lot of time trying to understand them, and took a couple function quizzes as well to supplement my understanding of the functions. What ultimately solidified it for me was this function guide because it broke down how each function operates in each level of the stack. That's when I clearly saw how ISFJ is the most accurate way of describing me!"
1948,isfj,"I've tested as INTJ, ISTJ, and ISTP. I was settled on ISTJ after typing myself with functions but my friends who are super knowledgeable in MBTI and Socionics said that I had way too much Fe to be ISTJ. So I humored them and considered ISFJ. Now I feel a relief to admit I'm a feeler, lol. "
1949,isfj,"This is really good stuff. Thanks for posting the link.
I've been reading up on the cognitive functions too. Trying to grasp at understanding the Ni/Ne functions in particular (and how they differ from Si/Se) has been challenging.
Still, it's been kinda fun learning about this aspect of psychology overall though. A few of the sudden epiphanies I've had were rather energizing!"
1950,isfj,"I've been to a few dates and been talking to a few guys but they just don't seem anywhere interested and as much as I hate it, I always take more initiative to reach out and they don't even realise it, and it's so easy for them to take it as an advantage for being too nice. I even went out with an ESFP and thought we were compatible but it turns out he didn't make up his mind, so I'm hoping to find someone out there. Dating, as a whole, is tiring for introverts and I'm starting to think maybe it's due to me being an ISFJ makes it more tough because others look at us as being too emotional and even whiney. Any thoughts?"
1951,isfj,"I found my husband when I finally was able to see that my life as a single was a good life. (We met while he was visiting a mutural friend about 12 months after my realization). I think sometimes it's easier to meet 'the one' when your not really looking, if you know what I mean. 
My advice - join a group doing something you love (if you like singing, join a choir. Like reading - join a book club.. kind of thing.) That way you expand your group of people you know in a way that is less tiring. At least I find that doing something I love (while getting to know people) gives me energy. "
1952,isfj,"I don't have any helpful advice because I'm in the same boat as you! All of my relationships have been with people I already knew pretty well as friends before we started immediately dating each other exclusively. I had gone on some dates with a few guys I met on dating apps, but it felt too draining to try and sell myself to people I don't know, so I'm just taking a break from dating altogether. Either way, I hope someone wonderful comes along, recognizes all of your wonderful traits, and makes the process easy for you! "
1953,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ, interestingly enough, married to an ENTP.  This is a marriage of nearly 30 years, FWIW, and we’re remarkably compatible ( although my natural reticence drives him a little nuts, as does his willingness to chat anybody up).  What I learned was to not spend a lot of time reaching out, as it’s not a natural thing for us, and may come across as false, however well-intentioned.  Something that introverts tend to do is worry about and talk about how exhausting interaction (i.e., dating, parties, gatherings of all kind) is. I know—I did it too.  Really accept that it is so, and don’t marinate in it so much, if you find yourself doing that.  Let people come to you and realize your wonderfulness.  I don’t know if this is helpful, but I just learned to let go of worrying about all the stuff that comes with introversion and let the right person come to me."
1954,isfj,"People in general are depressingly non-serious when it comes to dating.  It took me a while but once you're ok being single until you find the right person, you're more ok with accepting that 90% of the dating pool is more interested in looking at their phone than they are in seriously pursuing a relationship.
My ISFJ SO was pushed by her mom to try online dating (thankfully, because I love her and her ISFJ nature to death).  I highly recommend that people who actually want a serious relationship use dating sites with pay walls.  Paying for access sucks, but it deters a lot of people who are just dating to ""kill time"" and mitigates some of the ""meat market"" aspects to dating apps.  Specifically, eHarmony has found me 3 of my last 4 relationships, and they seem to offer better deals to people who create an account but don't activate (or who de-activate) for several months."
1955,isfj,"I found my fiance through work. He's an INTJ and I made the first move by just speaking off the cuff, I walked past his cubicle and declared bluntly that I found him interesting and stalked him on Facebook! He said that was very endearing for him because it was an obvious cue that made it easy for him. Sometimes being awkward can work in your favour. I find that being reserved does not help as much with dating. 5 years later we are very happy together and more in love than ever. He's taught me how to be more direct and confront issues that bothers me. I'm now much more assertive and confident than I used to be."
1956,isfj,"Yes, I absolutely agree with you on not looking for anyone and then he will come along. Thanks for your advice! I'm actually looking out for clubs but I don't have many interests at all. I've tried signing up for some volunteer work and i never got any news back, which is super annoying as well. I guess i have to find other groups that maybe i can be a part of. On my part, I don't really like a lot of things so it's tough."
1957,isfj,"I thought i could at least find someone on dating apps but it turns out i felt way worse after using them. I'll be taking a break from them, maybe even permanently. I just hope someone will see me for who i am and actually invests more in me. Thank you for your nice comment, I really appreciate it so much. I hope you find someone likewise. Cheers!"
1958,isfj,"Especially when it comes to a person I take special interest in. Is this just me, or is it an ISFJ thing? 
I'm fine with the ""getting to know"" phase, however, I cannot move beyond that. Conversations end up dying/become less meaningful, then I inevitably come off as boring. I know it may just be lack of common interest, but I find this happening repeatedly especially when seeing people on a day to day basis at uni. Also (most likely a ""me"" thing), I find it difficult to hold long conversation, even among my friendship group or my closest friend who I've known for 10 years. "
1959,isfj,"I don't know if it's an ISFJ thing for sure but I relate with you. 
I can talk to someone and get to know a little bit about them but it kind of just dies from there. I come off as boring to someone that doesn't take the time to be patient with me and the fact that I can't immediately share everything about myself. 
When going to school there would be people who'd ask my name, about an article of clothing or something. I'd ask their name and be polite but nothing ever came of those exchanges. I don't know if I was doing something wrong or what the person was wanting to get from the experience though.. 
I also find it pretty difficult to keep a conversation going for a long time unless the other person is able to drive it. Ask questions, lead into new topics and such because I find it difficult to do that. My closest friend is an ISFJ as well, our conversations don't really last that long and one of us usually just stops replying. I don't take an offense to it, just seems normal. She has a hard time connecting with others as well. Perhaps it is an ISFJ thing heh. We are for select people who take the time to understand our quirks and how we are. I don't think you should feel bad about the conversations not working often, eventually you'll come along someone who you click with. "
1960,isfj,"Omg, I was quite certain it was just a ""me"" thing. I can't carry a conversation to save my life. And when I try I'm boring as hell. I can always tell when their eyes start to glaze over. Ugh. It's frustrating. I've never tried to cultivate that side of me but have realized that being a listener was the way to go. However, that's only good up to a point. Eventually the other person runs out of things to say or expects a dialogue not a monologue and becomes equally frustrated. I haven't been able to fix this though so I've got nothing to offer in a way that would be helpful. :-/"
1961,isfj,"I feel this way to some extent. It is very hard for me to open up to people.
But the very few people I have opened up to mean so much to me. I honestly feel like I could tell these two people almost anything.
I think for me it is just harder to be open in person and so my two best friends I have found online... one I flew out to meet a few times and he has flown to visit and stay with me too... the second became my boyfriend as we went to same university and started talking through facebook and a videogame we both played.
I think for me it's just so tough to find someone... but once I do they became the people I would do anything for -- and I love to remind them of that.
Best of luck."
1962,isfj,"Be soft.  Do not let the world make you hard.  Do not let the pain make you hate.  Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness.  Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place.
-Kurt Vonnegut
I have to say, as an ISFJ I have to remind myself of this pretty frequently.  I just thought it might be good to remind you guys, too.  I hope all is well my fellow guardians."
1963,isfj,"Nice quote.  I appreciate the sentiment, thanks for sharing.
All the bitterness out there is awfully contagious, isn't it?  Misery loves company I suppose.
The world certainly is still beautiful.  At least if you know where to look.  Heh, I blew off work for a few hours this morning to go take a walk with my wife in the park where she works, because reasons.  Life is too short to not do irresponsible crap now and then."
1964,isfj,"I'm [ENTP] part of the Intuitive Integration [INTJ, INFJ, ENTP, ENFP] page on Facebook. Recently, someone posted, asking if anyone has ever cheated. I was wondering whether the answers would changed, based on someone's N or S function. She here are the questions that were asked:
Did you ever cheat on your partner? If yes, how does it feel the moment you actually let someone start to undress you? Update: Guilt / no guilt? Can you actually really completely enjoy it?"
1965,isfj,"I have. On a guy I was dating for a year during my junior year of high school. 
In the moment of it happening I didn't feel really guilty. Kind of the opposite actually- like nervous excitement? It also wasn't a one time thing.. I did it several times with the same guy. Afterwards I'd feel guilty but not as much as I expected tbh, and that was surprising to me. 
I learned I didn't feel as strongly for my boyfriend as I thought I did and I should have ended it. 
I chalk it up to being young and naïve because I don't think I could do that to anyone ever again. That has been the one and only time and it was a long time ago. "
1966,isfj,"No. It's the worst possible thing in a relationship to me. My husband cheated on me, and although I was thinking about leaving him anyway, that did it for me. I was done. He accused me of wanting someone else, but I just didn't want him anymore.  And he tells people that I was horrible to him which couldn't be further from the truth."
1967,isfj,"You don't have to have your shit together all the time. It's okay to vent, go crazy, have a nervous breakdown, or have a cathartic release. More importantly, it's okay to share how you're feeling with other people. You're not letting anybody down. You're some of the most kind, caring, and responsible people, but even you should get to be human sometimes. Nobody will judge you if you need to let everything out. It's good to set a good example for others, but it's impossible to do so all the time, because you're human too. It's okay to have flaws and insecurities, and holding them inside you is a lot more harmful than confiding in your loved ones about how you're feeling. "
1968,isfj,"Tell her that you are concerned that she is overworking and overloading herself and that you want to help her. Bring it up in a gentle way though by giving reassurance. Also, listen to her too because we appreciate being listened to when we do speak. Tell her that everyone is their own individual and that you can’t always take care of everyone. Hope this helps!"
1969,isfj,"I'm an INTP girl. I broke up with him in a rash decision when I was feeling particularly overwhelmed and insecure. Immediately regretted but he stood firm on the decision. The relationship lasted little over 7 months, and while it had wonderful moments, our personalities differences created some communication issues through out. However, I love him, want him back and am willing to work on our problems. He expressed that he wanted us to remain close friends, confidants even, and when asked, he mentioned that he was open to get back together if it happened ""naturally"". However at the time he didn't have anything else to talk about. We both cried. I was determined to go no contact for a month (it's what all websites recommend to get an ex back), but was kind of shocked that he unfollowed me on social media. I did contact him to ask him for a favor he agreed on before the break-up and he's not responding. Also, he left a few things at my place he said he would pick up but so far he hasn't arranged a time to do it. It's only been 4 days since the breakup, but I want to know what's the best strategy to get him back and start working on it. I would also like to avoid any further mistakes that would push him away him for good. I'd like to at least have him in my life as a friend. Please help!"
1970,isfj,"My wife is ISFJ and as an INTP can feel your pain so-to-speak. I was given forgiveness once and in a moment of clarity/truthfulness my wife, in no few words, said I wouldn't get a second. I've taken that to heart and have learned that ""loving someone"" isn't enough and there is more to a relationship that just showing up and existing.
Your opening statement causes me a little alarm. I understand impulsiveness, and definitely feelings of insecurity, but maybe using this time not with anyone can help you analyze why you felt overwhelmed. As others have said, the romantic may (but most likely won't) surface but if he is still willing to be your friend use that to learn, both about yourself and the different aspects of your relationship. 
I'm not sure if you visit r/intp but behind the self deprecation, memes, and trolls there are some pretty cool people that can offer advice or an ear if you need it. "
1971,isfj,"I'd hate to say it...he'll probably still remain a friend but anything beyond that is gone. It depends on what the breakup was based on. It is not my business but whether he will consider it will be based on that more than anything else. We're not the most forgiving types when we are crossed out on a whim. 
Edit: a word"
1972,isfj,"Thanks everyone, I really appreciate all of your responses. Today my ex and I talked for a while. He said he needs more time and space, that he wants to be friends in the future and if we're meant to be, we'll be together again, but only if it's destined. I don't believe in destiny so to me that last statement means nothing at all. As much as I love him and want him in my life, I know that our relationship had bad timing and was always challenging. I recently divorced someone who cheated on me and in my opinion has Narcissistic personality disorder (he's an ENTJ). This explains my feeling overwhelmed and insecure when I see even the smallest resemblance of situations in the new (now former) relationship to hurtful events that happened in my marriage. I'm also starting a new life and trying to figure out myself and my place in the world. My ISFJ ex-boyfriend is also trying to get somewhere with his career as a musician. I thought that we could be a good match since both needed our own time to work on our own paths, but I probably brought unresolved issues from my marriage to the new relationship, and he always felt inadequate in his role as a boyfriend because he didn't think he was in the right place in life to give me what he believes I need. Our communication styles were very different at times, I always wanted to analyze our problems in order to solve them, but too many times he couldn't vocalize his feelings or make sense of them. So even though I really miss him as a lover, I believe we should start as friends once he's ready and see what happens. Either way I grew very attached to him, he's such a wonderful man with the kindest soul, I would hate to not have him in my life. I believe our friendship will rekindle, hopefully soon. I'll keep y'all updated! Thanks again. I'll head to the INTP forum now to try to figure out my convoluted mind."
1973,isfj,"[I JUST GOT MY WIFE BACK IN 48HOURS]
My ex wife held it against me that I didn’t want to be married anymore and therefore she tried to get the kids to turn against me as well. I had a terrible relationship with all of them and most of it is because she either will not let me see them or she is filling their ears with a bunch of lies about me. We tried mediation, nothing seems to get through to her. I met Dr Akim who helped me cast a love spell, now there so much love and happiness in my family. Dr Akim's email is uniquelovespellcenter@yahoo .com [Remove the space from the email before sending it]"
1974,isfj,"This is sadly the case, as far as I can tell.
My wife is ISFJ, and she has shared some stories to this effect. She moves on, and that's the end of it.
However, she has shown incredible patience in her interactions with others.
You should move on."
1975,isfj,Really? I've always felt I forgive a little too easily if someone apologizes in a sincere manner lol. I might be weary to get back in a relationship with OP tho just cuz there's a fear in the back of my head that they'll easily break up with me again/we may be inherently incompatible 
1976,isfj,"Not at all.
We are stronger than ever. Patience is the key. 
However, I feel like we are a special case. There are a lot of external pressures that keep us very close.
My advice to you is to just fucking do it, man.

So what are you all up to on this fine Saturday night? I'm just driving around playing Pokemon GO a bit, then I'm heading to bed. xD
Any plans for tomorrow?"
1979,isfj,"Following up on the music threads we have all posted semi-recently, I was wondering what all of your favorite movies and movie genres are. I'll get the ball rolling by going first:
My favorite genre tends to be sci-fi, but with a dystopian twist. My favorite movies are Children of Men and District 9. I also like comedies a lot (but most aren't very good imo), the best one I've seen in a while was What We Do In The Shadows, a spoof on Vampire flicks. 
What do you guys like?"
1980,isfj,"One of my favorite comedies is Idiocracy and is somewhat dystopian. District 9 is a good movie and Children of Men wasn't bad either. As far as other dystopian movies go I have seen all the Mad Max movies and have been a fan for a long time. Have you seen A boy and His Dog, THX 1138, or Gattica? Those are also dystopian and not necessarily post-apcolyptic. I'm just an INTP passing buy that has similar movie interests."
1981,isfj,"My favorite genres are drama and action. I much prefer TV series over movies. However, if I were to put together a list of movirs specifically this would be it:

The Man from Nowhere
Black Hawk Down
Gladiator
I Saw the Devil
Kingdom of Heaven

I really like violent/war movies, but that is the complete opposite of what my philosphy is, in reality..."
1982,isfj,"I'm really really into war movies. Especially WWII. I also love mobster movies.
My all-time favorites are probably Goodfellas, Saving Private Ryan, Flyboys, Pearl Harbor and Lone Survivor. 
If a miniseries counts, then definitely Band Of Brothers and The Pacific."
1983,isfj,"If you liked Kingdom of Heaven, there are a couple of movies that are currently on Netflix I think you might like: ""Centurion"" and ""Ironclad"". They're not spectacular movies, but if you like the war/violent type movies I think you'd enjoy them.
""We Were Soldiers"" is an absolutely fantastic movie. If you liked Black Hawk Down, I think you'd like it. It's also on Netflix right now.
Although not technically a movie, rather a mini-series, Band of Brothers is a must see for anyone who enjoys war movies.
""Master and Commander: Far Side of the World"" is a great movie. It would place 6th or 7th on my list.
""Zulu"" is a classic, also a must see for anyone who enjoys war films.
There are probably more that I'm not thinking of, but these are some good ones, from my perspective, if you like war films."
1984,isfj,"Hey all, Im an isfj and Im wondering if any of you have similar experiences. 
So Im definately a hugger. I always try to get as close as possible to people I care about, but then I am constantly over-analyzing and wondering if I am making them uncomfortable. I have this deep desire, almost hunger, for someone to prove they care about me through a hug or something similar, but normally Im the one who has to initiate things if I need support. As a guy, its especially hard becuase they way Iact or wish others acted are not seen as masculin, and this plays in the with overanalyzing. I would love nothing more than to just relax with a friend and snuggle in a platonic way, but nobkdy really does this.
All of these factors cause me to be kinda clingy with people, which can push them away and this has really cut my confidence down. Its definately gotten better as I have learned where the line is, but I still have a need for closeness in a non romantic way.
Can anyone relate? "
1985,isfj,"Ugh I'm the same, I'm suuuch a cuddler lol.... I've been lucky enough to find some friends who are fine with me being as snuggly as I am or will at least tolerate it for a while, but if people let me I'll literally just lay on them for like an hour at a time. You are not at all alone on that front. "
1986,isfj,"Yep, I'm a hugger, and I know I make some people uncomfortable with it. I'm fortunate enough to be dating an ESFJ who loves hugs as much as I do.
I always feel so awkward when I go to hug a friend, family member or acquaintance and they immediately cringe away. :( I love hugs from everyone, even people I don't know well."
1987,isfj,"Like a lot of other ISFJs, if you look in love languages threads under this sub, your love language is probably Physical Touch.
To actually answer your question, yes, I can relate. I love physical touch. There are some people I just want to be touching (in the most innocent way) all the time- leaning against them, taking their arm, holding their hand. I have ended up pushing people away because of this, though. 
Also, for me, it definitely depends on the person I'm giving/receiving touch from.
~~when talking about this sort of thing it can sound so pervy ugh but i mean this in the most innocent way D:~~"
1988,isfj,"Yes, yes. I'm the same way. I feel like there's always a barrier when making a decision whether to smother a person or not. I view it as a case-by-case basis. If anything, it's good to verbalize boundaries. It may seem awkward and maybe uncomfortable for the other person, but I think it's better to know and not overstep boundaries than to not know and overstep. As a male, I do feel judged for wanting to cling onto other males. I just want to feel close to them in a non-romantic way. "
1989,isfj,"So many people are following infj or infp, most of them just took a personality test got infj searched it up and found some similarities.I was the same, still I doubted that I actually am the rarest type, so for several days I kept researching this.So many times I saw isfj but somehow ignored it, but than I actually read about it and realized that I am one, everything was corect.Unlike with infj or infp where I had few similarities.I know it's not like every person with this type is exactly the same.But still there is an easy way to find people that are similar with you and you can find out more things about yourself.I always had a hard time finding out who I actually am I thought there was something wrong with me so I just tried to be what others wanted.So I feel good to have something that I can call me.At first I was pretty sad when I found out that I'm isfj, I had so many similaties with the popular ones so I kind of had my hopes up that I am one of them.But now I am alright with what I am.
Sorry if I made any mistake I'm not too good at english."
1990,isfj,"Ray795 if being with a ISFJ has taught me one thing, it is that they are being   misunderstood. An ISFJ might feel quite isolated without knowing about his type and realization that there are many people out there that function similarly.
I needed a manual in order to understand ISFJs and I'm not proud of my many blind spots. ISFJs that have opened up about  personal experiences have helped a great deal without even knowing it.
There is a lot of harm being done due to miscommunication and with the necessary information at hand, it could be avoided.
They are great people."
1991,isfj,"Yeah. Once you learn about the cognitive functions, things change dramatically. To be frank, the SJ's I know in real life (not counting myself, because my anxiety really messed up my cognitive abilities lol) are really smart and could probably outwit NP's in many cases. "
1992,isfj,"Noises. So many. Eating, tapping, chewing, clicking, anything repetitive, any mushy/wet noises especially mouth noises. Breathing. Sniffling. 
Earplugs or earbuds w/ music playing or just loud music. White noise, like a fan, if I can. Or I leave the situation/area. 
It's way worse when I'm irritable or socially exhausted. I try to prevent those as best as I can, like recognizing my need to rest or be alone. "
1993,isfj,"Manipulative people get to me, or hinting at things instead of asking straight up come to mind first. I really can't stand when people complain about things, like a back problem that they refuse to get checked out. ""My back hurts so much today"" ""You should get it looked at then"" ""Yeeeeah, I dunno.. It just really hurts"" It gets old for me and I don't want to hear it. "
1994,isfj,"Messiness. Clutter drives me insane. I'm in college and my busy schedule causes my room to get really messy during the week...Fridays are really relaxing for me because I am able to tidy up. Obviously, I lead an exciting life. /s
Tardiness. People who don't demonstrate respect for others. Excessive loudness. Too much physical contact from people who aren't close to me. The classic #humblebrag or just narcissism in general. People who don't keep to their word or who lack loyalty."
1995,isfj,"I can't stand when people act a different way around certain people.
I dont like whining...nasty attitudes and people who don't show appreciation. 
I don't like loud sudden noises...like someone coming home and tossing their keys on the table....it makes me feel mad for some reason.
And I can't stand for someone to treat me different when certain people are around. "
1996,isfj,So I met a girl who I'm almost certain is ISFJ and she started treating me differently around 2/3 into the day (in a small group). Of that I have no doubt. I just don't know why. Do you guys approach those two ways of showing affection differently?
1997,isfj,"Can you give a little bit of an example? I definitely want to take care of babies and also want to take care of men that I am attached to, but I will approach it much differently since one is a baby and one is a man. That caring/fixing thing is definitely there for both, though, and definitely, like, keeping track of your stuff and anticipating your needs as a mom would do I usually do for SOs."
1998,isfj,Switching from playful group focussed to more muted conversational one one one. Moving closer. Asking me to do stuff like hold something. Asking me more questions. Waiting with me. It was all very obvious which I'm  not used to at all. I didn't want to put it in the post because it sounds a little strange but it almost felt like pity in weird way. Though in context pity wouldn't really make sense but that's why it's bugging me so much because pity is the last thing I want.
1999,isfj,"I don’t think it’s pity at all. I think it’s their first response to liking someone, tending to them. To me it seems like “oh I like/love you extra, so I’m going to sit here and fill all your love buckets up.” "

I think i'm a true ISFJ, except for the fact that I want to be a business owner. I'm currently a manager of a restaurant that I would like to someday own. In the past, I've been an Administrative Assistant, and I did not like doing things for other people or being told what to do.  However, I also feel uncomfortable delegating tasks or telling others what to do.  
You may wonder, how do I do my job right as a Manager if i'm an ISFJ? 
I've been a manager for over a year now and I'm actually very proud of myself for being able to delegate tasks to my employees. It does make me uncomfortable because I have that mindset of ""If I want it done right, I better do it myself"". However, I know that these people are getting paid to work and this is their job to clean, work, etc...  I have to put on that ""Manager cap"" and that ""I shouldn't care what others think of me"" mentality.  
Sometimes I feel that I am too considerate of my employees because my closers have alot to clean already and I feel that if I ask them to clean a few more things, that I may be overworking them.  So I dont even bother to add certain things to their closing list and just have the morning/midshift employees do it instead.  
Also, i'm not sure if this is an ISFJ trait or not, but I feel so bad whenever I get a feeling that someone doesn't like me! Of course I understand the fact that not everyone will like me, but I can't help but feel that way!"
2001,isfj,"I was a manager ( still have manager in my title).   My main strength was in helping people, either directly or indirectly (delegation of someone to the task to help out).  I also ended up doing more mentoring .   I was process creation driven as well. 
Delegation helped get around the i part as well, in that if it was dealing with an e team, I could send my closest to e type  out "
2002,isfj,"I was the project manager on my final engineering design project in college. It was a team of 5-6 of us. I took it on as a year-long role. I was good at keeping organized and making sure everyone had a task to work on. I was happy to be the kind of leader with a positive and encouraging attitude, but I found it tricky to let others do the detailed work and stay at a high-level. I really didn’t want to make my teammates feel like they were doing more work than me, although I had extra duties managing the project. I think I would find this easier at a job with a more obvious hierarchy. But I’m sure I would still struggle with imposter syndrome and guilt for not “working as hard” to get whatever more I was paid. But that’s also the nature of being a woman in a technical field.. I wonder if it is common for other ISFJs struggle with imposter syndrome as well."
2003,isfj,I am about to become a manager of my department and I’m definitely worried about letting people down or not being able to delegate properly since I have a tendency to take on too many things at once due to the mindset you mentioned. I want to step up and help my team but I’m nervous about it for sure. 
2004,isfj,Office Manager Here - former administrative assistant...I report only to the owner who takes my input seriously. I know it wouldn't work if I had more people to report to and less flexibility. I can work from home. I do have to answer the phone which I don't love but shrugs necessary evil. I do share the same sentiment about doing the work best by myself...BUT with empathy and patience I've hired people who do their jobs well...this helps. 
2005,isfj,"I speak only from my limited knowledge of falling into the ISFJ category as well as long experience of QSR management, so take what you will from it.
I don't believe we are natural leaders, but we are natural managers due to our high compentency, attention to detail and observational skill. As such, we often find ourselves gravitating towards those positions even though we may not actually see ourselves as 'managers' or meet our own critera for what a 'manager' should be.
I believe it takes a long time to learn and adjust at this level because its more personality and character based rather than anything theoretical; however, once you're over the hurdle (you said you've been manager for only over a year) - and it could take anywhere from 2-10 years to get this down - the rest is plain sailing ahead. I am certain that other more extroverted personalities adjust far quicker but from my observation they reach a ceiling much sooner that they are less likely to break through.
Your soft people skills will completely detract from anyone not liking you - so you should ignore that erroneous thought - as employees and teams will generally respect the organisation, composure and integrity that you bring to any given situation.
You need only focus on your own mindset:


You say if you want it done right, you better do it yourself. If you want management done right, you better do what you are paid to do, otherwise you are just a very expensive team member and ignoring your responsibilities. When you fall into that trap; ask yourself: Am I being paid to do this? What should I be doing instead?


Within the confines of your personality, you are probably supportive. You may think your position as the Manager doesn't synergise with this trait; perhaps you think you'd function better as a Deputy or Assistant Manager. Wrong: Think of yourself as supporting the Area/District Manager in your capacity as Store Manager and you will feel better about your role and function.


Choosing a Deputy/Assistant Manager. Develop someone who has your aptitude and attention to detail, but not your personality. You need someone that complements you, perhaps a more extroverted/energetic personality. In a restaurant or other 'busy environment', an ISFJ needs a strong partner(s) and needs to create equals. Other types do not need this, but in my experience, we do or we are prone to burn out.

"
2006,isfj,"When delegating, I look for those whose strengths align with the task. I make sure to explain why I am delegating this to them specifically. 
The other issue sounds like you’re concerned with the fairness aspect. Have you looked into listing everything out and having a list of open/mid/close duties? Then let those on each shift decide who does what amongst themselves? Just a thought! "
2007,isfj,"Seriously, in the past month I've had two redditors come at me and tell me ISFJs are sadistic and sociopathic. Currently engaged in an argument with a guy who INSISTS everyone in our personality type gets off on death porn. Wtf??? "
2008,isfj,"I can see some unhealthy ISFJs becoming manipulative bitches, but there are some sociopathic traits that most ISFJs don't have:

A general lack of shame or remorse. This is really not an ISFJ thing. We always seem to care about how others perceive us. We wouldn't do things that would reflect on us negatively (not in public, at least).
A huge ego and sense of entitlement. Most ISFJs I know have self-esteem issues and are always doubting themselves.
"
2009,isfj,"I could see where they would think ISFJ might be a little sociopathic, considering I've been called a Sociopath before (I am an ISFJ) by friends that I've hurt, but I think it stems from my need to please everyone and how good of a liar I am, and I don't think that's an ISFJ thing I think that's a ""I've been hurt before and now my walls are hurting others"" kind of thing.  "
2010,isfj,"that's weird, i've never heard that one before.
what i've heard is: ISFJ girls are ""literally the best there are"". that person straight up thinks they're better than ALL OTHERS.
also, judging by all the ""how do i get with this ISFJ person""? posts, you'd think we're not sadistic sociopaths. and reading them all from the poster's perspective makes it sound like we're just too shy to initiate dating. that doesn't sound like sadistic sociopaths to me. though obviously those posts are super biased."
2011,isfj,"I think they'll say these kinds of things about any type. Go into INFJ forums as an ENTP (I did this), and many will tell you they think ENTPs are predisposed to narcissism or psychopathy because they've had really bad relationships with these types.
What's interesting though is that those people I've found the story out about seem to have relatively few relationships and have stuck with the bad relationships for a very long time even when they knew they were bad."
2012,isfj,"I mean that I can see. I can see people mistaking the desire to please others for being ""fake"" or ""phony"" or ""manipulative"" but some random guy is arguing with me right now and telling me how a core trait of ISFJ is to get off on child porn and death. Kinda uncomfortable rn. "
2013,isfj,"Hahaha
Haha
Haaaah …
Realize how much I fear ESTJs
Glup …"
2014,isfj,"I love INTP's!  Okay, now let me answer your questions:

What makes you tick?

Being lied to makes me feel sad and angry.  If you lie to me and I find out about it/have a feeling about it, I will just never trust you again.  I'll try to because I don't like to hold grudges, but it's like my memory and the feelings just won't go away.  Lying to me is on my list of the worst things a person can do.  When I'm feeling stressed out, I really, really hate loud noises.  Don't like it when people make me go outside if I'm really just not in the mood.  I hate it when I feel that people are ""teasing"" me, even if they're doing it playfully - it makes me uncomfortable.  Something I've really learned to dislike after cutting off some old friends recently is people assuming my intentions, or making presumptions about me before meeting me.  I hate it when people act like their assumption is a fact.

What do you do with ease?

In terms of school, English has always been my best and easiest class.  Words just make sense to me - math gets more complicated because I have so many knowledge gaps in math, and I find certain formulas difficult to remember.  I'm not actually bad at math.  I've always taken advanced math classes, it's just that I have to study more extensively more math than I do any other class.  But English just comes to me - show me a word, or a word in a sentence, and I can define it for you.  Ask me to write an essay, and I'll enjoy it!  Really!  In 6th grade, I was that one tryhard who wrote the 13-page narrative.  I really like English class, and it's easy for me.  I also like helping people who need help with English. Outside of school, I don't really know what I do with ease - I watch TV with ease.  I read books with ease.  I don't know if that's what you're asking for, though.  I'm actually very good at letting go of stress when I need to - I've learned to calm myself down from an anxiety attack, for example, by analyzing the situation to myself and reassuring myself that everything will be fine... which brings me back to a good mental place.

What are your struggles?

I think I really struggle with my identity vs. what other people think of me.  On some level, I know exactly who I am.  If you asked me to describe myself, I could do it for you... but I'd probably describe to you what others have said about me, as opposed to what I think of myself.  I'm not suggesting that I need constant approval and praise or anything... I actually hate that.  But I really struggle to do well in an environment if I feel that I am not liked by the people I'm surrounded by.  I'm able to get over it and come back from it if I realize that a person or group of people don't like me, but it hurts way more than it should and it has broken me down in the past more than it should have.  I can't control what people think of me.  I know that.  And honestly, opinions are fleeting - I mean, on some days I don't like someone, on another day, I'll like them.  It's just like that.  But even though I know that, it still just hurts and I can't help it.  I want to be my own person, I really do.  I think it'd be healthier for me on all kinds of levels if I just let go of my need to know that other people are okay with me, and felt confidence in myself.  But being confident is so hard.  I mean, there are good things that I think about myself - I think I'm smart, I think I'm mature, I think I'm empathetic and understanding.  Yet when someone insults me or tries to bring me down, my first mind is to believe them... and my second is to reason out the situation and see, from a certain viewpoint, whether or not they're right.
I struggle, like many other ISFJ's, with stepping out of my comfort zone.  I am so uncomfortable in new places and around new people.  I cried on my first day of middle school when I came home... even though nothing bad had necessarily happened, I still felt awful just because the environment was nothing I recognized and the changes for the year were going to be huge.  I got used to it.  But it took time, it really did.  I can do new things, but I often need to be talked into it, which is something I'm working on changing.
I really struggle with forgiving people, like on a genuine level.  I really am trying to not hold grudges now, but sometimes when something happens, I just replay it over and over again in my mind... and then all the feelings come back.  If the memory isn't recent, I have a much easier time forgiving someone.  But sometimes something that happened a week ago just stays on my mind.  And it feels horrible, replaying a memory of something that made you so sad.   It's like I can't even stop the memory, because then the bad feelings come up and it's almost like I'm there again.  I'm there.  I wish that my memory weren't like that.  This is why I can't understand people saying ""just move on.""  I want to move on, but I still remember.  And a memory doesn't just go away.

How is your life?

Overall?  Pretty good.  I cut off some friends, which has been a healthy decision for me... once again, the memories and feelings are still there, because I was friends with one of them for a long time and she ended up siding with her new friends over me when they all started talking about me.  They all refuse to admit that they did anything wrong, even though they cyber-bullied me for an hour in a group chat and I have evidence of that.  It technically happened 3 weeks ago, but now they're lying to people, which only stresses me out further.  My brother is having problems.  I feel, on some level, like nothing in my life can go right for a long period of time.  It's like something always happens.  I'm trying to stay positive about it, though - do things I like, watch movies and TV that I like.  I think that one of the many things that's really keeping me up and going in the mornings is the thing that I like to say to myself when I'm feeling down: ""The bad times will pass, and one day this won't mean as much.""  That's really what I'm trying to say to myself to make myself feel like I can keep on going every day.  I'm young.  I have time.  I can learn, grow, and in 10 years, I will not be the same person.  In life, you can either let your experiences positively shape you or negatively shape you.  I'm trying to look at the bad things that seem to be happening to me right now and remind myself that any situation can be made better.  It's been doing wonders for my mental health.  Thinking about where I want to be in 10 years, or even 5 years, is really my main motivator sometimes.  I mean, some things in my life sucked when I was 8... and yet I'm happy to have not died when I was 8, because even though I was sad back then too, there were so many things that I hadn't done yet.  Friends I hadn't met.  Realizations I hadn't had.  Life-changing experiences, things that really shaped who I am today.  
When my depression started, I always said, ""I'm going to kill myself if I haven't died yet when I'm 18.""  I would imagine doing it right after high school graduation.  I don't know what's happened in the past two years that's changed my mind - maybe a more mature outlook on the world - but I no longer feel that way.  I want to live past 18.  Turning 18 will be scary, sure.  But I want to work on myself and I want to ensure a nice life path for me.  I want to start therapy soon so I can really nip my mental health in the bud. That's also a large part of the reason why I want to live now (among other things.)  I want to fulfill my goals, or at least help people out in the world, no matter how long it takes me to get to that point.  Right now, I have goals of becoming a nurse, an engineer, social worker, or any job that really lets you help people in the world.  Even if it doesn't work out for me, I just want a job.  If I reach 23 and I have a job and an apartment, you know what?  I'll be content.  I want money, yes.  But if I can't have money, at least I'll have something.  At least I'll know that I lived for some reason.  And that's all I really want out of life."

2017,isfj,"Hi intp- my bff of over a decade is one of you! :) 
On my best days I’m playful, whimsical, confident, and sweet. On my worst I’m depressive, insecure, and fear the future. 
I’m great at staying consistent at the things I love. Unfortunately because of fear of trying new things (more often than not), I don’t have a lot of those. 
Life is sometimes disappointing to me- I think it’s me not wanting to fit into societies standards of white picket fence, 9-5 job, kids, etc. It sounds miserable and limiting. On the other hand, I lack foresight (I suppose that Ni future pattern seeking on a confident level), and so I tend to flutter from one job to the next without realizing what I want long term. (Ie event planning, personal training, assistant, and now I’m teaching myself programming). 
Anyway that’s a very brief jist."
2018,isfj,To me this is just a depressed person talking to a not depressed person and has nothing to do with type. As an ISFJ I’ve had conversations the other way around. Anyone can get to a place in life where everything feels pointless. 
2019,isfj,"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
AHAHSHAHASHAHAHAHSAHAHAHASHA
AHAHAHASHAHSAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
ok I didn't read the article but that is FUCKING FUNNY :)
OK I will bite.  It pretty much comes down to the XSFJ ignoring whatever the XNFP says or suggests and XNFP killing himself because this is what life has come to.  Oh, here is an example
INFP:  The sun is up.  It is morning.
ISFJ:  No, it's not.
INFP: (points at window)  The sun is up.  Look at the window.
ISFJ:  I AM NOT LOOKING AT THE WINDOW THE SUN IS NOT UP AND YOU ARE A RETARD.  MUMBLE MUMBLE  WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LISTEN TO ME AND DO AS YOU ARE TOLD?
INFP:  (blows head off with shotgun)"
2020,isfj,"Minnie is obviously not representative of all XSFJs, which is why I wrote ""an"" in the title. However, as an XSFJ myself and looking at many of the posts here, I suspected that many people may be able to relate to Minnie. This has been my typical encounter with XXNP types. They call me very ""defeatist"" and I consider them ""idealistic"" and ""impractical"". "
2021,isfj,"We've been together for 3 years, still going well. The issue that I have is communication - I need to do a huge efforts in order to get him to communicate, that's how I feel like at least and it's making me exhausted because I am introverted as well (I'm an INFJ) I feel like there's times, especially when i start rambling about concepts and different perspectives about things like, love, life, the future, he zones out, or stops talking or completely ignores what I said. Of course I don't mind that necessarily, because I heard pretty often that ISFJs do that, and I learned to accept it and not push it, especially when I can tell they don't feel comfortable. My problem is that sometimes when I feel talkative I cannot shut my mouth, and without wanting it I start rambling again. I always just have feelings about things and I'm pretty open about it, if I get a certain 'vibe' from a certain something I tend to talk about that a lot, I can always tell that he just wants me to shut it, and I do, but then I feel frustrated. 
The only problems that we've ever had in our relationship, is a period of time where we were just toxic to one another & the communication problem. We've been very stable for about 5 to 6 months now, with little to no conflict. What happened before was that we manipulated each other a lot, I was being very pushy to bring our relationship to the next level and I was trying to change his mind by manipulating him, while he wanted to move slowly, and he was constantly throwing blame on me and guilt trip me, he held resentments for some time as well. A year ago our relationship kept being one sided, for me for a period of time, then for him, and so on until we fixed our issues, and now we're stable.
Excepting the 'flashbacks' that we sometimes get about that toxic period of time, the only problem that we have is communication, and It's really hard because we're also into a long distance relationship. A thing I learned about those toxic times is that he has a hard time expressing his feelings, it feels like he just gathers everything and then explodes, and me, on the other hand, as I got very comfortable with him I share almost everything in a instant, which overwhelms him.
The only issue we have now is the communication (and we had it before too but It was overshadowed by the other huge problems we used to have) Our relationship has been a blessing ever since we fixed our issues and we set our boundaries and we're very much in love with each other. I cannot appreciate him more for wanting to work on this rather than break it off. The few questions I have are:


How can I make him feel more comfortable when I want to talk? What do you guys like to talk about and what kind of mood do you need to have to feel more safe?


Sometimes I feel like other people take advantage of his kind soul and I'm too scared to tell him, I used to tell him that in the past when I felt it but he'd just retreat into himself and refuse to talk about the subject. I don't want to push him and make him uncomfortable. I  feel like he sees me as controlling at times, but I really am not I'm just trying to warn him. He once scolded me for focusing too much  on the 'bad side' of people and ignore the good one. He is very altruistic and likes to think that all humans are good by nature, and he gets hurt because of that. He will really say 'there's nothing to worry about x' until the very moment he's being proved wrong. How can I tell him or warn him about certain things without making him uncomfortable?


What should I do when I feel frustrated or burnt out? I don't know if I should give him time or insist or just focus on another thing, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable. 


How can I help him relax when he's stressed out? 


I'm literally crying as I'm writing this because I love him so much and the last few months have been so amazing and I've never felt so safe & secure & emotionally/mentally stable with a person in my whole life. He brings me down to earth when i tend to be with my head in the clouds and that's one of the best things about him.  I have the need and the will to protect him too and to make him feel safe and comfortable but I just really don't know how to initiate this. I've been thinking for weeks and I feel like the wrong step could make him view me as a burden and I really don't want to ruin this stability.
He's not my main focus in life, but he's certainly a big one because I'm very family oriented and I'm never dating anyone just for the fun of it. It's always been serious. I am really passionate when it comes to him because I'm legit fascinated by his way of being,so kind and so positive."
2022,isfj,"I don’t think I can answer all of your questions, but one thing that springs to mind about the communication is: are you talking to him, or talking at him? 
I know that personally, if someone is just rambling at length about something I don’t really care about, I tend to sort of zone out and just tolerate it, throwing in the occasional “yeah?” or “mhm” so I don’t upset them. But if someone is just going on and on about a subject I have no interest in, it’s definitely annoying. It puts pressure on me and it makes me feel like they care more about using me as a receptacle for their chatter than like they want to engage with me as a person and an equal. 
Talking to me involves asking questions, giving me the opportunity to truly respond, and, if we’re interested in talking about two totally different things, at least sharing the spotlight of the conversation back and forth so that we can both express ourselves comfortably. If someone wants to talk to me I’m almost always happy to engage unless I’m really exhausted, but someone talking at me quickly drains my emotional resources and becomes a source of frustration and resentment. It’s all about reciprocity for me. "
2023,isfj,"I would like to know just one thing - are you in a long distance the entire period of your relationship?
If yes, then I think I understand why it is causing you both the problem. I am not verbal, and thus, cannot really pursue friendship or relationship through emails or texting. However, I do communicate well - when in person - because non-verbal communication, my face, my body language, my voice etc comes to my rescue where words fail.
IDK if it's with all ISFJs, but I personally speak even less when emotional or overwhelmed, cannot really bring myself to speak, and when forced to express myself in such moments, it is short, and certainly, it looks like I'm disinterested if it's through a text message. Which is sometimes the same in person, but I can express myself and somehow people close to me understand me, in person.. (not at all times)
So, before answering your other questions, I'd like to know if he's the same in person too."
2024,isfj,"To answer your last question.. not sure if this is true for other isfjs, but I wouldn’t mind being directly asked: “Is there anything I can do for you right now?” This wouldn’t work over the phone as much, but if my INTP partner asked me that (which he rarely does) I would be able to tell him I need a cuddle or a cup of tea or just to talk about something that’s on my mind. Usually I ask my partner this question to no avail but that’s because he doesn’t know what he needs. I guess it depends how in tune you are with yourself too. We tend to treat our partners in ways we would want to be treated, so pay attention to what your partner does for you when you are stressed out yourself, and try to reciprocate that back! I need to work on this myself with my sweet anxious INTP boyfriend."
2025,isfj,"INFJs have a habit of getting a bit abstract or paint a very broad picture when they speak. I'm betting he's getting caught up on a single detail, giving it more thought, and then ""phasing out"" why he thinks about that one specific detail. Then, once he's given it sufficient thought you have already moved on and he's lost.
hmm, have you tried engaging him? Pause from time to time and ask him what he thinks. He's may be uncertain whether you want him to speak or just listen. Alternatively, he may be uninterested in the topic, but will opt to listen anyway because he loves you and knows the topic is something you enjoy.
mhm, I could see this being a problem. At times I feel like I'm talking to a Vulcan when talking to INFJs. Both types are just so cautious with their feelings and that makes it challenging to have uncomfortable conversations. ISFJs have the bad habit of dropping hints about their feelings in a passive aggressive fashion, yet fail to verbally express those feelings.
You've found the ISFJ Achilles heel. We dismiss little things as ""unimportant"", thinking we can take (because we can). This is true for all aspects of life, not just romantically. We don't want to bring it up because it disturbs the peace, ""bothers"" our loved ones, and is all around unpleasant. This continues to build until they detonate like a nuclear warhead and let it out. A lot of times there are little warning signs that you can see in advance. For example, I will almost loose my temper over something minor and then quickly recover before actually going off. It can be solved by someone asking ""Is something on your mind? Anything bothering you?"" The answer is usually ""Nah, I'm good"" or something dismissive along those lines. A followup ""Are you sure? There's nothing on your mind right now?"". Then the ISFJ, if in the mood to talk, will usually go ""Well...<begin epic saga here
It really depends on the subject. Though funny as this may sound, at least for me, an ISFJ's mood is heavy affected by the people I am spending time with. I can ""sense"" the emotional state of the other and either feel peace or extremely anxious. If I can't sense their emotional state, then I feel extremely anxious and uneasy. The biggest indicator that I personally use is body language, primarily facial expressions. From observation INFJs have the ability to seem emotionless, devoid of feeling, cold and detached. In such situations I'll do anything I can to figure out their emotional state. Failing that, I'll try to evoke some form of emotional response to confirm they haven't been replaced by a robot. To answer the second half or your question the topic is going to heavily vary from individual to individual. ISFJs enjoy conversation the most when they know the other party is also enjoying the conversation. In the case of INFJ/ISFJ there is a huge potential for very indepth and analytical conversations on shared interests and such. So I guess the key is enjoy yourself, he will pick up on that, and enjoy himself as well.
ISFJs help others because we get a great deal of enjoyment out of it. We place ourselves in the other person's position, look at it from their point of view, and make our decision from there. It is who we are, we love to help others when they need it. We are very well aware of the fact that others will use us to their own advantage. Yet, we live by example, hoping that through helping others they will see the value in it. A lot of ISFJs are idealists, we care little for the world as it is now, ""we are going to make it better damnit!"" is the attitude we have. If we help someone and they are ungrateful, then we will often grow resentful of that person, and will file away their actions away for the future. We ISFJs rely on our past to guide our future and we can be so very stubborn. You can warn him by saying ""I think it is possible that so-and-so may be taking advantage of you because <reason
You could tell him that you are frustrated or burnt out. As an ISFJ he's probably going to ask you if there's anything he can do to help you. If you are up for his assistance, then accept it and enjoy it. Otherwise just express appreciation for his offer, decline, and tell him that you are burned out and need a break from people in general for a bit. He's an introvert too and should reasonably understand the occasional desire for isolation.
Ask him what is on his mind in a calm and gentle manner. The first response will probably be ""Nothing"", but if you gently push with something like ""Are you sure? We can talk if you'd like?"" should work. This is heavily dependent upon each person though, so it may take a bit to figure out what works.
Just accept him for who he is, tell him that you love and appreciate him and why you do. For most ISFJs there is no burden we will not carry for those we love. And what we crave the most is to feel loved and appreciated by our loved ones. Everything I've said here is my own personal experience. I am just one person and the ISFJ you have likely will be a bit different. Though I do hope this helps you."
2026,isfj,"some isfjs can detect manipulation athough it is not usually an isfj thing. Me as isfj , i hate manipulation and pushy people . Yes , i can detect manipulation haha
here are my points
1.Dont talk about about abstract concepts if it's not that necessary. I as an isfj , can be curious but not all the time. Yes we can sustain concepts bout future for a day but not too longYes we are focused on the present so we like to talk about things such as : tv shows and characters , daily happenings in our life and cooking (haha)
Moreover, we are not interested in the topics that are of no use in the present ( although we see how it will affect other things in the future)

It's simple . Dont be pushy and controlling. You might scare somebody ( just kidding)

We isfjs dont like conflict and yes we do see good in people although they might prove us wrong. We just dont want to prolong the conflict. We are all about harmony. 
There are times when i can already see the negative side of this person for example and yet i just ignore it or we will avoid that person. We might talk or greet one another but i keep it distant and short.


Then cool off. Find something relaxing and later, talk to him about important matters.


by reassuring him and giving your so some food?


That's all "
2027,isfj,"I completely understand! I don't really know if i'm talking to him or at him in all honesty. Sometimes I'm trying to get him engaged by asking questions and sometimes I find myself just rambling, and I get the 'yeah' or 'mhm' since I hear that sometimes from him. Thanks for you insight. I will try to focus on engaging him more."
2028,isfj,"Yes I feel this with my INTP partner. He feels more strongly about things I disagree with and will rant in a way that I can’t necessarily argue with. If it’s not worth it to argue I will zone out and just let him feel what he’s feeling, but I don’t feel as strongly about the topic anyway. It definitely gets to him though because he knows when I’ve zoned out and am not really engaging. But it wears me out if I argue with him because he is extremely stubborn and not always open to another point of view, which is why I zone out instead. When I say “zone out” it’s not that I’ve lost interest but that I’m just thinking about other things that are a bigger priority to me.. for example, planning my day and figuring things out in my head. Unfortunately I do this during sex if I’m not really in the right headspace for it. BTW my partner and I have been together for 11 years (since middle school) and are very loving and dedicated to each other. We just have some different beliefs that can be hard to talk about because we are both stubborn in our own ways. And sensitive in different ways as well! Definitely an interesting relationship. Communication is always the most difficult part of a relationship but worth it when you can be open and vulnerable with each other."
2029,isfj,"He's definitely different when we're together or face to face. The whole relationship has been long distance so far, but when we are together it's usually 1 to 3 weeks at a time and our relationship is definitely different in these moments. I've been thinking if it was a distance problem, but i feel like he doesn't want to break the distance and move in together, not yet at least, and I stopped pushing that for some time now, I don't even bring it up anymore, kind of don't know what to do."
2030,isfj,"Hey, yahgirlamberrr, just a quick heads-up:
neccessary is actually spelled necessary. You can remember it by one c, two s’s.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
2031,isfj,"Yup, I noticed that, him and I can both do that, it was a huge struggle back and forth, I'm really happy it's over and it did have consequences for a long time after it was over. Fortunately, our relationship got so much better after I posted this and got all of your fellow ISFJs advices. I can finally say i definitely got the hang of things and we're doing great! Thank you!"
2032,isfj,"How can I make him feel more comfortable when I want to talk? What do you guys like to talk about and what kind of mood do you need to have to feel more safe? ....I don't really know, but I can tell you that we're not big on talking, we can share silence too.. I usually like talking about anything or everything under the sun. But I am not much of a talker atleast not active one. I'll tell you one thing dear Sag, that in a relationship one shouldn't worry about making another person uncomfortable just through daily banter or conversation. Be yourself. 
Sometimes I feel like other people take advantage of his kind soul and I'm too scared to tell him, I used to tell him that in the past when I felt it but he'd just retreat into himself and refuse to talk about the subject. I don't want to push him and make him uncomfortable. I feel like he sees me as controlling at times, but I really am not I'm just trying to warn him. He once scolded me for focusing too much on the 'bad side' of people and ignore the good one. He is very altruistic and likes to think that all humans are good by nature, and he gets hurt because of that. He will really say 'there's nothing to worry about x' until the very moment he's being proved wrong. How can I tell him or warn him about certain things without making him uncomfortable? ...See, I'm sure he can see your worry for him, but just let him be. This is one of the major issues between me and people I love. I tell them that if the world outside upsets me by taking advantage of me, you(my beloved) are here to hug me, and make me smile by just a welcoming glance my way. You may warn him, but be gentle, don't get heated over it. That will upset him further. I'm sure 8/10 times he knows that he could be taken advantage of, but we really cannot help it if we feel a certain way, can we? Also yes, I'd rather see the good in people. It's also another area where me and my loved ones are at differences.. I'd just say, warn him, tell him your opinions but be gentle, don't get heated over it. On the other hand, make him feel like you'd be the warmth when world upsets him.
What should I do when I feel frustrated or burnt out? I don't know if I should give him time or insist or just focus on another thing, I just don't want to make him uncomfortable. ....tell him how you feel, but yes, don't be pushy or hot. If something causes you frustration, perhaps take some time off by letting him know you just need to recharge and will be back to him.. Infact, tell him how you feel burned out and ask him if there's a solution for how you feel.. 
How can I help him relax when he's stressed out? ....just, be there. IMO. :) ..be the silent rock of stability. Your silent constant presence is just enough, imo... and some love and warmth, like a hug, kiss, making him laugh if you can with that Sagittarius humor/goofiness, ask after him, just show your love, be yourself.. but don't push it lol.
Goodluck, I hope things run smooth between the two of you. May I know his sun sign? :p"
2033,isfj,"Hey Mr. Bot! That word should indeed contain one c and two s's, however, there are several words which correctly contain two c's and two s's, like success, access, successful, succession and accessory. You know just as well as me how many people incorrectly spell ""success"" with one C, and telling people to use one c and two s's as a general rule is a good way to further that trend.
The bot above likes to give structurally useless spelling advice, and it's my job to stop that from happening. Read more here.

^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot, ^^^and ^^^I ^^^make ^^^mistakes ^^^too. ^^^Please ^^^PM ^^^me ^^^with ^^^feedback! ^^^| ^^^ID: ^^^e3adw18.8ef2"
2034,isfj,"He is better in person, yes. I think it's mainly because I pushed it at one point, quite a lot, so he felt pressured. He also told me once doesn't want to deal with the immigration process (we live in different countries). He is currently working, has his license and a car, so I'd say he has responsibilities."
2035,isfj,"Ahh then that's good! :) (by 'seeing a future', I meant coming together physically, btw, just to clarify)
Just be patient okay.. ISFJs are slow, and don't like to be rushed.. but do let him know about your eagerness. All I will say is, be yourself, just on a lower heat :) "
2036,isfj,"Capricorn rising, no wonder you love an ISFJ :p
Aww, I wish you knew his mercury sign at least.. I wonder if he has a Taurus/Cancer mercury, which may have a hard time catching up with Sag mercury.
And having your Mars in Aqua, you do get verbally expressive when inspired.. "
2037,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ that's been married to an INTJ for 18 years.  We have two boys aged 17 and 14.  We've been intensely focused on the lives of our boys for 17 years now and not so much on our own relationship.  The thought of being empty nesters is daunting -- we've been discussing our incompatibilities recently, not sure right now if we're going to stay together or split up.  Very difficult times for us right now.  Ask any questions you like..."
2038,isfj,"Show interest. Not only in the person but their hobbies/likes. Lots of 1 on 1 time helped since we both hate large groups and going out. Be upfront and honest. Honestly, she came on to me. She showed me she cared for my well being and she showed real interest in the things I liked. Then one day she told me she liked me and we started spending more time together. The rest is history. "
2039,isfj,"I think our primary issue has been that we have different goals for ourselves -- I (ISFJ, Male) have been focused on creating a stable home.  From finances, daily schedules and coordinating activities for everyone, essentially taking care of the day to day.  I value the stability of our family immensely and have put my personal needs and goals second to the needs of my children and my wife.  My wife, on the other hand, being an INTJ, has always had a focus on driving things toward improvement -- the stability I created hasn't been satisfying in her eyes because she's always striving for change and improvement.  This situation was tolerable for both of us as our kids were growing up, because I found happiness in creating the stability for them, and she found happiness in seeing the growth and change in them, but now that they're growing up and about to leave home, we're realizing that our conflicting personalities are at odds with each other."
2040,isfj,"Aww, that's adorable. Just coming out and telling someone you like them is apparently an INTJ thing to do too. Another question, how do you like to resolve conflict? I know I can be kinda impersonal/detached about resolving conflict, but I also know that is the opposite of what I know about ISFJs haha."
2041,isfj,"I think this is fixable as long as you guys still love each other. Improvement is also something I’m seeking (I’m intj) to almost all perspectives of my life, stability is vital for a family. It’s compatible. My ex bf simply told me that there’s no longer any fire for us, while he would cry like the world is ending when we broke up, and he wants to be my friend. I don’t understand... so I just decide never talking to him again. "
2042,isfj,We are definitely different when it comes to this! The main reason we are in premarital counseling (which ironically I'm sitting in the office waiting for our appointment) is how to communicate and solve conflict. She is more direct and wants answers right away where I am more easy going and wanting to wait it out. I also do not like saying things I will regret so I take a long time to respond  and I absolutely hate confrontation. We are currently learning tools and things that would help us directly solve conflict. One thing is to slow things down. Ask for exactly what you want out of the other person so if I don't want to talk about it right now give me a time frame so we can both collect our thoughts and talk about it. I have more but like I said I'm about to go to our appointment. Feel free to ask away more questions. 
2043,isfj,"Haiimjeff I would love to hear more about how you communicate within your relationship. I'm an ISFJ female engaged to an INTJ male. He recently told me that he isn't sure we'll make each other happy long-term because I am not as ambitious as he is. I'm coming to realize that we both have different expectations that neither of us have communicated well. As with most ISFJs, I hate confrontation and conflict and am guided by my feelings. I also have a particularly difficult time expressing my feelings. Basically everything you just described, so any advice is greatly appreciated. "
2044,isfj,"Hey I'm happy to hear more couples are just like us. I think it's coming to an agreement that we both have different personalities and accepting the fact that we will have disagreements but as long as we can learn to find a compromise, we can make each other happy. What we have tried to do, is find a medium where she is not so confrontational and where I can have time to express exactly how I feel. I need time and she needs to respect if I ask for it. But I can't keep her waiting because then I'm not being fair to her. So we'll do things like can we please pick this up in an hour. Or at 4pm let's talk about this. This helps us because we can both think about the situation and how it made us feel and how the other person could have felt as well. It helps cool off any potential heated moment. One thing that really helps for us is when we say things like, ""I'm really sorry, that came out wrong. Can we please start over?"" I can't tell you how many arguments were avoided because of the fact that we acknowledged right then and there that it can in fact be avoidable. In all honesty this is really hard stuff. I don't think we are expert at any of this or if we can remember a lot of the tools the therapist has given us. What I do know, is our love for each other will always make us want to never give up. There is a learning curve on both ends. We both have to be willing to give it our all. I'll be happy to answer more questions about our relationship if you are wondering or share some tools we have learned in pre marital counseling if youd like. Good luck "
2045,isfj,"Do you ever feel like your partner is less willing to make compromises than you are? I think my partner sees everything from such a logical and analytical point of view that even when I'm explaining how I feel it is dismissed as ""excuses"". Eventually I give in because I just can't get passed whatever point he is trying to make. "
2046,isfj,"One thing we have learned is when you are asking for something, be clear with what you're asking for. And also try not to be subjective. Example would be instead if saying, I hate when you leave your shoes around try I would love it if we could find a place to put our shoes instead of leaving them around. Another example, which drives me crazy, is do you want to ? That gives me an option to say no when my partner is not really expecting me to say no. So instead she'll try I would love it if you . Or do you think you can __ for me, it would really help me out.
There's also something that we've done where we make a box with 4 quadrants. The top left is dedicated to something that I did positively for her. The top right is something I could have done. The bottom left is something she did for me and the bottom right is something she could have done. You could do these weekly and it gets conversations going. It's not supposed to be a way to bag on your partner but more of a thing to discuss "
2047,isfj,Yes. We just talked about your comment and we both agreed that she can be a little stubborn sometimes but it is something that we are working on together. I think my slow way is frustrating for her because she is confrontation and wants answers right away. But we are finding healthy compromises to solve both of our needs. 
2048,isfj,"I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean. (unethical heuristics)
And even though I do not, for the heavens, want to change that, I now know I won't be able to achieve my dreams of being a good father, or even to live in society, unless I find a way to develop myself around that. I have very good relationships with children and I really care about my little sister. The problem is I cannot turn a blind eye and follow through things despite not wanting to do them or seeing no value for me in doing them. I continually downplay almost all ideas unless they are genuinely near-genius and my skeptical nature makes me see all, even genuine intentions, as something with darkness lurking beneath.
But I really want to learn how to stay focused, dependable, helpful, honorable and loving for a longer period of time, for that it's the only path to hope.
If that makes sense..."
2049,isfj,"Entp here, you sound so edgy lol. Just channel your inner normie and realize it's ok to have feelings, enjoy life. I got an isfj gf, we're very different but you shouldn't try channel being an isfj, just be a better Entp. Empathize with people's feelings, or at least try"
2050,isfj,"Very easy - by hanging out with actual ISFJs. This is the quickest path to developing your own inferior and tertiary functions beyond immaturity. When you hang out together you'll absorb a lot of their behaviors and ideas that will then ""fill out"" your own weaker functions."
2051,isfj,"""I'm a cold, mechanical, spontaneous, reckless, selfish, power-meandering analyst, that believes things only and only if I can do them alone for an abusive mean.""  
How often does this narrative repeat itself in your head throughout the day?"
2052,isfj,Anger. This is what often drives me to do selfless good. Everything is shit anyway so might as well be the one to actually do something about it even at my own cost. Stupid but idgaf because I'll driven by anger and disappointment.
2053,isfj,"Here’s a good article that talks about using your inferior function in nonstressful situations. Maybe this is a good start for you. 
https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2017/10/20/weak-spot-every-myers-briggs-personality-type-strengthen/"
2054,isfj,"I'm an optimistic Nihilist. That's what most ISFJs i think ive seen are like. I believe that you were born in the universe, but the universe does not care whether you live or die. You have to create what your life will be like, and decide how you like your life. "
2055,isfj,"You guys are really awesome.
EDIT: I should probably elaborate...
We can just play off of each other's conversations. I add the philosophy to conversation and we just ponder about life and just everything in general. Open-mindedness and theoretical thinking as well as STELLAR people skills and that introspectiveness that I can only hope to one day achieve the same level of. Thank you for providing everything that I need in my life. :)"
2056,isfj,Definitely going to second that. I'm a ENFJ and I'm also in a long distance relationship with an ISFJ. She's just so open about her feelings and what she's thinking that it allows me to feel completely comfortable with who I am around her. It really makes the long distance situation work despite its challenges. 
2057,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and my husband is ENTP and just let me give you the heads up, sometimes it can be really hard for both of us. We have completely different life views, but if you can master it, it is SO worth it!
Good luck friend!"
2058,isfj,"I am a ENTP who married an ISFJ. It is great, I love my wife, she is my best friend. There are challenges though. Example: I like to accept every party invitation we receive, she would rather stay at home and cuddle while watching Netflix. We communicate and work it out, and trade. I think the hardest thing for her is when she doesn't know how serious I am about an idea. I may come up to her and casually say, I think I would like to do [insert ANY idea here]. She used to always take it seriously, and it took a while for her to understand that I'm not always going to act on an idea, and that a new idea may come into my head at any minute. 
edit: spelling"
2059,isfj,"I am an ENTP who decided to check out your sub to see whether opposites really do attract. So far, I think the old adage stands up fairly well. But, it might just be me. So, how do you ISFJs feel about your duals?"
2060,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ who has been with an ENTP for 16 years, married to him for a week shy of 13 years. I'd say I'm pretty fond of them. I find we work well together and compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses. "
2061,isfj,I have an ENTP friend who I greatly admire. He is so charismatic and likable and wants to go into politics. It's funny how much he gets bored doing repetitive work. He does well in the spotlight. I'm fine being in the background for the most part!
2062,isfj,"I'm ISFJ and my boyfriend is ESTP (I know not quite the same). 16personalities.com actually tell us in both our personalities that someone like the other is a really good fit. And we ourselves think we are a terrific fit. 
Taking a look at ENTP profile, I can tell you that constantly playing the devil's advocate will really push away an ISFJ. We need to feel like we are being heard and would rather have a discussion with you based on your beliefs, not just what you can think of. However, if it's a true debate and you think your ISFJ is open to strengthening their view or considering another, then go for it. A couple more weaknesses of ENTP is being insensitive and intolerant, which will cause a lot of tension with an ISFJ. Empathy is a huge point for ISFJs and we tend to leave behind selfish people who can't see something from someone else's point of view. If you have a good control, or can work on, those aspects of your personality, you'll get much farther with an ISFJ. While they can try their best to be understanding of your argumentative nature, and you better believe they will listen and try to be empathetic, they will 100% ask the same of you. Don't ask them to have thick skin, but do try to be sensitive and remind them that you are trying. "
2063,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ.
My older brother is an ENTP.
Honestly, I really love him, and he makes me laugh like nobody else.
He brings me out of my shell, and he's very good at poking fun at me, and pointing out traits nobody notices that I'd prefer to keep hidden. He does it all in a humorous way, of course.
He also knows when to be more sensitive and compassionate, and I've never felt like he takes a joke too far.
However, growing up, we clashed a lot, and our personalities were like oil and water. We get along better nowadays, but I still can't spend too much time in close proximity with him before we start to argue.
This is a sibling relationship though, so I would imagine it varies a lot in a romantic relationship. Personally, I don't think I could ever date one, just because of my experience growing up with him and seeing all the ways that we differ.
I also find that they have such strong personalities, I feel a little bowled-over by them, and it can be exhausting trying to hold my ground all the time, because they do enjoy debate, and I'm not one to enjoy conflict very much.
I do love me an INTP, though. "
2064,isfj,Yeah I have trouble with being insensitive sometimes but it's usually due to me viewing something from a purely logical standpoint and not realizing that it's a sensitive matter to people. Though I would say that entps are masters of perspective and I've learned that even if I think someone's perspective is wrong that they easily feel the same about mine. My mom is an isfj so she helped me be less insensitive and argumentative. But yeah you pretty much hit the nail on the head with my entp weaknesses.
2065,isfj,"I think I've seen one on /r/ENTP.
I'm not sure people here are really keen on this kind of thing, though, as selfless ISFJs are usually said to be.
I, for one, would support such endeavor. It's just I have serious doubts on it feasibility, from paper. 
On the other hand it just needs a few people to change my mind. In the end, it's all up to the rightful community of this sub. Just like it should be.
You have a mock-up ?"
2066,isfj,"Good point. That's the kind of thing I was expecting. That'd make sense for it to be in a format only ISFJs are comfortable with, then.
I just need to know what this format is exactly, though.
Once I do, I accept to do that for you all, if I can."
2067,isfj,"Terribly.  I try my best to not appear hurt, and I'll take their advice because what they said will often leave a big impression on me - I do want to improve, so it's not as though I don't understand where the criticism is coming from, but I'm a pretty sensitive person, so even if I'll take the criticism and come out better from it, my feelings will still be hurt."
2068,isfj,"It really depends on my connection with whoever is criticizing me honestly. Say it's a random stranger i dont care about, i probably wouldnt think more of what they say and quickly forget it. If it's one of my close friends or family members, i may reevaluate my past actions and consider what they said to me. I trust criticism if I know it's from someone who i know well. "
2069,isfj,"If it's something I feel I can actually improve on I'll just take it as a sign to get better at that thing
If it's criticism I dont think is valid or outright impossible I'll either ignore or avoid the person/people that criticize like that"
2070,isfj,"I'm much better now than I used to be, but I'm still not great at it. I think everyone here will understand when I say that I used to take criticism very personally. Even if I knew the person wasn't meaning to be hurtful in the least, I couldn't help but let it cut me to the bone. I've grown to where it doesn't affect me that way anymore, but it still stings."
2071,isfj,"Depends on the person or what they say, but mostly, it hurts.. on the outside I look good-spirited or sometimes, aloof.. I try hard to see the brighter side, and convince myself that I should be more sportive.. But my instant feeling is that of hurt, deep inside. I also hate the feeling of unease or awkwardness, I like things to stay normal and comfortable between the person and me.
I'm getting better with age."
2072,isfj,"Very personally. 
I shut down and try to think about how and why it happened. And at the same time I'm hurt. I usually feel like I did not do enough. Or too much. I just shut down for a couple of hours minding my own business."
2073,isfj,My ISFJ girlfriend is currently in the finance department of an assisted living facility but wants to move to managing the care aspect of the business.  She says she doesn't really want to be directly involved with caretaking of residents but instead sees herself in charge of the caretaking operations as a whole.  I think she believes that gerontology is her calling and she enjoys what she does!
2074,isfj,"Computer Science major, but I do testing/QA instead of Programming.
Programming is too stressful/difficult, QA I can use my detail oriented, organization, and decent speaking/people skills to better use while still being able to use computers that I love a lot."
2075,isfj,"Supposedly ISFJs are drawn to more traditional careers in academics, medicine, administration. I work in economic development, which is quite social and political. I wouldn't say I thrive in this field, but I enjoy it immensely."
2076,isfj,"There have been several of these asks in this sub. Have a look at them as well. 
User Experience/Web Specialist for me. 
Trained in Lean Manufacturing practices that lends itself well to root cause analysis. Which I really love digging into and coming up with a solution and supporting data with it."
2077,isfj,"I'm at a point in my life right now where I'm interested in almost everything (course, still in school, so haven't decided on a career!) I want to learn computer coding, I want to volunteer at the homeless shelter, I want to speak out for my community, I want to become involved in my city's politics, I want to write an analysis of a movie, I want to intern for anyone, I want to join the track team - I'm just willing to do almost anything safe and learnable.  I really, really, want to expand my knowledge this year."
2078,isfj,"Freelance translator here!
I work from English to French, which is my native language, in the technical and legal fields.
I get to work from home in an environment that I control (apart from the occasional keyboard-blocking cat), without worrying about social interactions and keeping my ""social energy"" for friends and family.
It involves a certain deal of perfectionism, but I don't get to get swollen by it too much because of the short deadlines. 
I enjoy being able to accept and reject orders depending on my capacity to handle work (mental health varying a lot sometimes). 
I'm specializing more and more in legal, so I regularly go to university or training sessions, which keeps the job interesting.
The texts that involve a bit of creativity are the most stimulating and also the ones that get me the positive client feedback. 
The downsides are sedentarity, irregularity of orders (and therefore income), and little to no feedback from the clients, which means I don't get to know if my work was okay-good or okay-meh (but I'm always told when it's bad-bad)."
2079,isfj,Currently working in IT as a tier 1 helpdesk analyst. I'm in school for cyber security but I'm thinking of taking some time off and studying for certifications. I think I'm enjoying IT more than my cyber security but that could just be because of s shitty professor lol.
2080,isfj,"I'm currently a web developer (have been for 10 years) and I totally get the ""Programming is too stressful/difficult"".
I'm frequently hating my job and thinking about changing. Never really thought about QA. Care to explain (just a quick overview) what is it you do?"
2081,isfj,"You Can do a lot of those things! Remember to do whatever you do WELL in your career so choose wisely. Have one focus and a billion hobbies. This is your Ne pushing for more ideas, experiences and learning.
Here's a post I made in another ISFJ career thread:
""ISFJ - Female
Hm. So I had dreams of becoming a doctor in neurology or oncology since I was 15. Fast forward into college where I had traumatic events that ruined my GPA. So med school was out. I'm 24 now and only recently just let that dream go after a practical yet emotional conversation with my INTJ boyfriend. In college, I finished with two degrees, Physics and Criminology. And I also was in 3 different types of research labs: criminology, cognitive science, physics. Now I'm a high power laser engineer in the semiconductor industry. Decided not to go to grad school in cognitive science or physics, last minute. 
I stayed in STEM because I also did a lot of nonprofit work in college, but it made me extremely unhappy. I didn't like the work itself which involved planning events, organizing and leading teams, a lot of emotional workshops. I also didn't like the inefficiency I encountered and in the end, believed that in order to create an efficient nonprofit, I wanted a long term solution to being ""nonprofit"". I liked the idea of having companies create reliable relationships with a specific nonprofit organization, so that there wouldn't be a need to scramble for grants and fundraisers. There also wouldn't be that risk of not having enough money, and it would be better to work on a guaranteed budget. So I thought, why not become the people I would ask for money from and focus on charities farther into my life.""
In my time in college, I was also an engineer director for a radio news station, a DJ, a volunteer on a medical trip to Panama, was published in a cognitive science journal, leader of a nonprofit org, mentor to middle school and high school students, ropes course instructor, team leader in an engineering make-a-thon for the disability community, team member in a robotics competition, team member in a big data analytics competition, and maintained a relationship with my INTJ boyfriend of now 4 years. It was a stressful, yet fun. But I wouldn't say I did everything very well. I did all of them at least adequately and what I did do very well on, it was because i was naturally more talented and more importantly, passionate about it. Those things were more technical related, like my physics research, engineering competitions and medical trip. Oddly enough, I was only adequate or barely did well enough in the more social activities like nonprofit work.
You can do all the things you want to do, just keep in kind that due to time limitations, you can only do so much. I definitely let my Ne take charge for a while there, and learned a lot about myself that I think was very valuable. But I would still do things differently if I could go back to change things. So pick and choose and don't stress about not being able to do everything within the next couple of years. 
How do I enjoy my current career? I've only been in it for 2 months, and had started to think about making careers changes. More specifically, I started thinking of ways I can prepare myself for a career change. I'm always thinking ahead for what I want to make my future look like. And just learning about different parts excites me. My current job as a laser engineer isn't bad at all, I'm actually at a company where many people want to eventually end up in their life. But this is the start of my career and the idea of staying in one place for 15 years suffocates me. The work itself is technical and requires learning a lot about how a pieces of technology works, how the physics works, and applying teamwork (VERY important), coding and problem solving skills. All those things are fun to me for now. I'm also thinking about changing career options because computer vision, AI and data science is fascinating to me. I want to see if I can become a part of those communities.
Now for some contrary thoughts. Bear with me, almost done. After two months, my company sent me last minute to Germany (exciting because my job is in California), where I am now training for a few weeks. Germany is world renowned for engineering and being here gave me a deeper appreciation and look into the history of what I'm currently doing in my job. This gave me the idea that maybe I can stay in my currently career field for a long time. It gave me a deeper insight into how I can grow in a specific topic, which would be new to me and something that's generally extremely important. So that's also now on my mind about my career.
So there's on example of an ISFJ's career journey."
2082,isfj,"Theres different aspects of it but quick overview
-You are basically testing that the program should be working a certain way. If not, you create a mini report and present it to developers so they can fix it
-Most common and easiest part to get into is manual testing which is going into the app/website, looking for errors that show up where they shouldnt, looking for functions that dont work as they should, looking for any UI that doesnt look up to standards, any general improvements that can help user experience, etc and reporting them
-Managing test cases, plans and bugs. Test cases and plans are done before/during a project so the test team can have an idea of what to test and isnt just mindlessly charging in. Having a common platform to keep track of all your bug reports (like Jira) is very helpful from an organization standpoint and a good way to communicate with everyone the issue you see as well as progress if issue is fixed or not.
-If you still want to include light coding in your job, theres automation where you make code that  checks a website/app to see if it meets expectations. Generally used to test UI and simpler functionality that isnt constantly changing
Theres more of course but this is as brief a breakdown as I can make
There are some stress points of course (cant be a job otherwise) but I love analyzing and figuring whats wrong with a project or thinking of waya to improve it as opposed to building the product. Theres much less pressure to do it better/right but of course its a different skillset and you still have to do it well.to get a job
Just keep in mind QA may be the ""underrated""/overlooked job thats kinda needed in software projects which IMO fits an ISFJ since ISFJs like to work in the background to not get much attention but still do an important job to make sure things are working as they should. "
2083,isfj,"I mostly feel like the Si subtype. I'm too shy to relate to the openness and lack of restraint of the Fe subtype. Which is not really a surprise, since I felt stuck in a Si-Ti loop for a long time.
On the other hand, I don't really relate to the ""stylish clothes and accesories"" bit. I mean yeah, I can appreciate it and enjoy wearing something nice once in a while, but I mostly stick to jeans-and-tshirts routine."
2084,isfj,"Wow, being pretty new to this MBTI thing, it just keeps blowing my mind.
Subtype mostly Si, it seems. Description was eerily accurate in some parts. How wonderful.
That said, ""dresses tastefully"" missed the mark lol"
2085,isfj,"I've got a pretty close group of friends and recently it's been bothering me that some of my texts get no response whatsoever. I don't see them as often anymore since we used to work together so I try to arrange things.
I get that sometimes a quick conversation just abruptly ends, but if I ask a question to arrange something that we talked about and you don't respond to that, what am I suppose to do? I might reach out again a couple days later to ask again as a reminder, but it gets frustrating. 
Sometimes I'll ignore that happened and text again a few days or a week later and they'll answer the new question and pretend nothing happened before that.
I'm going to chalk it up to me being more sensitive lately, but how do you guys deal with it, especially with your SO or close friends?"
2086,isfj,"TOTALLY, totally relate. I, and I think most ISFJs, am so responsible and on top of things. Especially when it comes to personal matters. When someone sends me a message, I know they want a response—so i respond. I don’t stare at the message, wait hours on end, see it again, ignore it, and then forget. But tbh, many people do. This is something I’ve had a hard time coming to terms with as well. And not taking it personally when I don’t get a response. But it’s really hard for sure.
I actually recently had this guy I was really interested in call me too type A and said I should “slow down” with my quickness in responding. Like sorry dude I’m just responsible and respond promptly when having a conversation.  I didn’t realize my promptness can be a “turn off” to other people. 
I also get super frustrated, especially if I’ve asked a direct question or am waiting for a respond regarding impending plans. Even though I hate it, I find myself perseverating over my phone and waiting for a response. By the time they do respond I’m mad. Ugh it’s something I need to work on too! 
Just try and keep your expectations low. As much as it sucks. We can’t change other people and you will always encounter those who aren’t great at responding. It just sucks bc we take it personally as sensitive introverts, as opposed to pushing through to get the answers we want. "
2087,isfj,"I relate to you SO much and there is hope!! I’ve gotten a lot better, though I have my weak times too often still lol
I think there’s some people who don’t respond but absolutely can - I wouldn’t waste my time with people like that. They don’t deserve it. 
I think there’s people who just don’t care to look at their phone that often, get busy and forget, etc. I personally thought I was way too attached to checking my phone for responses and such. So I keep my phone on silent, sometimes even do not disturb, flip it face down and I turned off all social media and texting pop ups / notifications (I had to keep work notifications off so I just turned my “problem” apps off). After a couple of weeks I only check my texts and such when it crosses my mind, and it’s WAY less now. It drove me crazy for a couple of weeks but now I’m honestly loving it. I think it’s helping me take a step back from it all. Idk if it’ll work for everyone, idk if it’ll keep working for me, but so far it is so it might be worth a try!"
2088,isfj,"It has been a frustrating experience for me too because I hate uncertainty. If you cannot push through with a plan, at least tell me. In some cases, I just downplay it and tell myself they are too preoccupied to deal with it and I kind of detach. In some cases, I confront them in a nice way. “Hey, we’re supposed to meet this weekend and I haven’t heard from you again. Are we on? Just let me know.”"
2089,isfj,"Well, it depends. Sometimes I panick.. No, rather, What I have problems with is telling the other part no, because I'm scared they will think I don't want to be with them. Once I started crying because I thought I were being too straightforward when telling her no. I need to work on that. What's kind of weird is that this is only valid regarding my best friend. With others, I don't have any problems with saying no.
The reason for that might be the past. "
2090,isfj,"It’s not that it’s a turn off. I tell this to my SO. Some people see that and take advantage of you. Slow down In a sense to know who you’re dealing with. My SO did this and learned very quickly who his real friends were. Some people just want to use you and know you will respond and do whatever they need quickly. For myself, I forget very easily or become distracted and text back later. I feel really bad when that happens but I’ve also expressed this to the person when told why I don’t respond. I hope it works out for you OP! I think you’re sweet :)"
2091,isfj,"I was in this exact position, said it bothered me, and they got pissy at me for being annoyed. I had asked them if we were still on for plans the next day. Got no reponse by the time we were supposed to meet. Said that was shitty of them. They acted like “people are busy” (one was clearly not busy on Snapchat). 
Honestly since that day, I’ve pulled back on trying. I’ve seen them once in the past year now. We text or snap chat here or there. I was excited to have some friends that aren’t family in the area finally, but felt like I’d rather be lacking the friends then have shitty ones 🤷🏽‍♀️ "
2092,isfj,"hi all, so i have been seeing/talking to this isfj guy for around a month now and some gut feeling is telling me he is withdrawling/isnt as interested. this is the first week he hasnt tried to make plans, hes stopped asking about my days/other questions on those lines, and out of no where hes just getting more quiet/less responsive. i am not sure if its just him retreating (as an introvert) or otherwise. i dont want to come out as ask and seem needy (like im not getting enough attention) so im trying to be patient to see if it turns but also dont know if im overly optimistic. sorry i know this prob stupid but,  any ISFJs done similar behavior?"
2093,isfj,"My ISFJ husband and I usually have several hours of quiet time every day after spending time together. It helps us both recharge and do our own thing. So the social introversion might be coming into play.
But other than that, I would just suggest for you to ask him. Strong relationships are built on strong communication. If you can't ask him about something relatively small now, how are things going to play out when more dramatic/serious situations come into play?
I think it's normal/healthy to check in with your partner periodically and see how the relationship currently stands."
2094,isfj,"I think as an ISFJ, we have some things we do that are kinda like mandatory - and that is, asking about your day. But ask him, be direct.. he could be busy or going through a stress.. we also move very slow."
2095,isfj,"I do that when I’m not interested  anymore. But there obviously can be other reasons for his behaviour too. Maybe there’s something going in his life which is why he doesn’t feel like talking much. You could ask him how is he, in case you haven’t tried that yet. Maybe he’ll open up."
2096,isfj,"i wouldn't jump to that conclusion right away- i tend to feel like i am annoying people i just meet and will be less social for a little bit after having some times where i see or talk to them regularly. it doesn't have anything to do with me liking someone any less, it just has to do with me trying to not be annoying and also needing time alone. i say reach out a few more times and see what happens, but if he really isn't responding then let it go :/"
2097,isfj,"I'm in a bit of a retreating stage myself and it may help if you initiate plan(s) or try to see what's going on. It may not work, but it's worth a shot. Showing that you care can't hurt.
EDIT: If it's worth mentioning, my two closest friends are ENFJ. One tends to lay on the ""hey are you ok"" if they feel there's an issue, and the other is a bit more reserved in that sense but he's also known me for 13 years. I like both approaches, but asking if your person is ok is probably a good way to avoid losing ground with him (idk a good phrase for that)"
2098,isfj,"I've seen that a lot on infj threads - they think theyre annoying so they kinda stray - I have no issue in reaching first but also i have that same tendency in that maybe they dont want it/think im annoying. ha, the struggles of feeling"
2099,isfj,its funny bc he had brought up this beer fest thing and we were talking about it for a good 5 mins (he knows ive never been to one) and i was thinking he would say we should go or invite me but nothing happened.. i guess ill have to bite my ego and ask
2100,isfj,"Sorry, I didn't see that. So, you both are strongly Fe, what makes difficult to get into an argumentation, even if it is necessary. In addition, your Ni leads you to overthink little acts, so, is possible that there is something bothering him, but he ratter not to confront this, resulting in this behavior.
My advice is to review what is possible going on with him (not necessarily you are the cause of the issue) and have a conversation about it."
2101,isfj,"ya i think him and i both have a hard time addressing things, we like to wait to see if things adjust on their own - which they can and they kinda did - was just on off day from outside influences and me overthinking. "
2102,isfj,"By nature, I think that ISFJs tend to let people walk over them. I know I definitely let people run me over and bring me down. I had a friend for almost four years and she was basically a sister to me and we had been living together for two years. Then a few months ago we started fighting and sat down to talk it all out. She basically told me she didn't want to be friends after we graduated college. That hurt me unbelievably bad. Since I was graduating a semester early I kind of slipped out of the friendship as quietly as possible. She texted me yesterday that she wants to hang out and be friends again and that she understands how hurtful she has been in the past (she has proven herself a bad friend on multiple occasions such as taking other people's sides against me, repeating confidential information I told her, and being incredibly cruel with things she has said to me in a very judgmental way). What would you do? I miss her and want to be friends again but I'm afraid this is just me letting myself be taken advantage of. "
2103,isfj,"Living together can be hell on a relationship. You know she can hurt you so it's a gamble.
I recommend  having firm boundaries like not sharing confidential material and not being the fixer all the time. People should be entitled to their own struggles so they can mature. Don't be a crutch.
You control how much contact you have unless she's  unstable  (if so, don't you put yourself through that).
Some people are meant to be part of your past. There is no shame in walking away. 
There is really no bad choice if you are prepared for either outcome.
Best of luck."
2104,isfj,"Maybe she has changed, so I would suggest reconnecting to give her a chance and see if she has.
BUT I wouldn't re establish the relationship unless you feel that you can cut it off once again, in the case that she hasn't changed and is still not a good friend.  
Respect yourself, your time is precious. You have the right to spend your time building and maintaining relationships with people who make you  happy and support you properly. "
2105,isfj,"Okay, the title is a bit misleading. I'm mainly hoping for some insight about my ex who is an ISFJ.
So often times when I would talk about an interesting experience or thought I had or something I emotionally was going through, he would barely ask me follow up questions. I often felt like I was talking to a wall. I felt neglected. I would have to say things like ""Yeah....so are you going to ask me what I mean?"" Or ""So are you gonna ask me for more details on what happened or not?"" And when I said this, 1 of 2 things would happen:
1) He would ask a question just for the sake of asking it, AFTER I mentioned it. It would also be something along the lines of ""Oh Im sorry. So yeah tell me more about it I'd like to know"" To which I'd say ""More about what exactly? What do you want to know?"" because I could sense that he was just grasping at straws :/
or 2) He would go into defense mode, getting offended and saying that he was going to ask or that he was listening or that he didnt know I wanted him to ask or something of that sort, to which I would proceed to explain my feelings but instead of realizing it was something that hurts me it would just turn into a big argument because I guess he either got annoyed or felt bad about himself for not being able to (I actually don't know, any ideas?)
So my question is, are ISFJs generally like this? Do you guys find it hard to come up with questions? Are you guys generally minimal conversationalists? And if so, why? If not, why was my ex like this? I know that some of the topics I'd talk about weren't his forte so instead he'd just like listening to me. But I didnt always want a sounding board as much as I wanted a conversational partner who would catch my drift, get on my wavelength, you know what I'm saying? I just feel really bad looking back and realizing there were so many moments such as these. I was left to assume that he just doesnt care and is pretending, which I know was probably not the case.
Another thing that'd happen a lot is that I would tell him to talk to me about something because it would always feel like I was bringing up the topics. And he'd just tell me some sensory details of what happened during his day or something about sports, which wasnt what I was looking for. In the end, both parties just end up feeling bad. 
disclaimer: it wasnt ALWAYS like this. there were times when he was very attentive, curious, analytic even. there were also times where he would bring up cool things to talk about. it was never like suuuper deep and crazy, but still satiated me. "
2106,isfj,"Well this got a little long lol, but I have a couple of thoughts, just pulling from my own experiences. Hopefully they'll be helpful? 
1) Social awkwardness/self-consciousness and the fact that we're introverts. It can be difficult and tiring to keep up with a conversation where I'm not sure what the appropriate reaction is (thank you, dominant Si), and in an emotional situation, I get very worried about saying the wrong thing and upsetting or annoying someone. Plus, sometimes I just get tired of talking, full stop. 
2) Coming up with questions for someone just isn't really where my mind goes in a conversation. I tend to put my focus on making sure the other person feels comfortable and cared for, and is receiving signals that I'm listening to what they're saying/feel sympathy/etc. Questions might come up in some cases, but it wouldn't necessarily occur to me that they would want me to coax answers out of them or that they would be presenting a topic that they wanted me to examine and discuss rather than just telling me their thoughts. 
3) We're usually not good when put on the spot (again, thanks dominant Si). If someone asked me to ask them questions or talk to them about something interesting, I would honestly probably just stare at them. I would feel really off-put and unsure, because half the time my mind just blanks, but also how am I supposed to know what you want from me? What if I ask a question and you think it's dumb, or I bring up a topic that you find boring? For me that would just be kind of weird and embarrassing and feel very forced. 
4) I just don't think we tend to express our affection that way. To me, constantly having to have ""deep"" or ""interesting"" conversations would feel really superficial and like we were trying too hard. If something comes up organically, great, but that's not what's important to me in a relationship at all. I want to be able to talk about mundane things and still be invested enough to want to hear what the other person has to say, but also to be comfortable enough with each other that we don't have to fill the silence all the time. 
Overall though, I think you guys were probably just not on the same wavelength about what ""care"" looks like. To you it's obviously being very conversationally active and generating topics to discuss or contributing questions/ideas, while he may have found that difficult or thought it expressed his care best to listen quietly and just let you vent. I can't say for sure of course, but it seems like a case of you guys just not always connecting on a communicative level. "
2107,isfj,"Yes, oh my god yes.
Speaking from my personal experience, we're just not good at it. We listen and absorb and sympathize and appreciate the experience you extroverts talk about, but it's just not easy for us to come up with things to say.
No need to feel bad though, ISFJs are really good listeners and he probably understands what you're talking about most of the time. 
Please be more patient and try to understand when he's searching for a way to convey his feelings into words."
2108,isfj,I'm not like this. I ask questions and dive deep into conversations because that the way I feel close to people sometimes. I did grow up in a house with all girls though so that may have contributed. And I also grew up in a home where I saw the lack of communication and interest drove my mom to depression and eventually divorce so I promised myself I would be way way more open and honest. It's been a journey but I feel like it's natural to me now. 
2109,isfj,"It seems pretty clear that you both as part of the relationship are needing to do non-preferred communication. You talk about wanting him to ask more questions about things while at the same time dismissing him when he talks in sensory.
It sounds like it's a breakdown of the relationship coming from neither side getting what they need in terms of communication.
ISFJs do ask questions and do all the normal things, but if we're in a relationship where our basic needs aren't being validated, we're likely to withdraw...."
2110,isfj,"But why would he worry about this after 1-2 years of us dating? Is this normal? I thought we were extremely close, but I always felt that I was closer to him than him to me. He would disagree, but little gaps like this is what makes me feel otherwise."
2111,isfj,"Wow, thank you for this elaborate response. I actually really appreciate it.
THAT is the root of the problem. You guys worry about saying the right thing. You shouldn't be worrying at all about what is correct or expected. People want YOUR genuine reaction, response, opinion! I think you guys forget that. If we trust you to talk to you about things, it's because of your personality and so we care about you and what you have to say. Plus, it can become very obvious when you do that and it's very off putting because people can tell you're trying too hard. ISFJs can be absolutely wonderful when they're they let their real selves show through.
That's understandable I guess. To an extent it's not who you guys are but also it's that you guys don't want to interrogate someone. The thing is, though, when people bring something up to someone it's because they WANT to talk about it with you. So they wan't you to be engaged and to ask them questions depending on what the topic is. Obviously there are times when questions aren't appropriate. It's not black and white.
Can you explain how Si affects that? 
Again, too self conscious which I know is a common issue for ISFJs.
Well, that's really really upsetting :/ If it wasn't for some of these main differences, we could have had a great relationship. It just sucks. But that's not the only way I express my care. Caring is emotional closeness and trust. It's being able to support that person through their dark times and to be there. But yeah, conversations and validation about the many unique thoughts I have are very important to me. It's very important to me to be understood, not just to feel understood. And someone who can understand my many thoughts and emotions (through conversation and validation) is important to me."
2112,isfj,"I'm not even an extrovert. Everything I share I did so because I felt comfortable with him which isnt always easy for me :/ It just sucks that you guys supposedly arent ""good at it"" because while I understand, at the same time its something that should come naturally if there's a genuine interest in what the other person is saying. I mean its natural to have follow up questions, comments, etc. Because like how else are you supposed to communicate with somebody who just listens to you but doesnt offer much conversation back? While that's nice sometimes, I hope you understand what I mean :/ "
2113,isfj,"No problem, glad it was helpful! 
I know that we tend to be way too self-conscious haha, and frankly I think that's a big part of the transition from an immature ISFJ to a mature one. It can be extremely difficult to overcome the fear of being yourself and being rejected for it, so we tend to hide behind a facade that we think is the most socially acceptable or take the route that won't hurt anyone's feelings or bother anyone, often at the expense of our own comfort and self-expression. For a lot of us it's a big problem, and gaining the security to risk rejection and express ourselves more honestly is a big step in our emotional maturity. 
And sure! In my opinion at least, Si plays into it because we thrive on the ability to make connections with past learning and experiences to find solutions or project a likely path for the future. So, suddenly being asked to ""perform"" when we aren't prepared for it can really throw us off. It's also worse if the question is very open-ended, since that gives us no data to work with about what an appropriate response would be. I definitely like to know what I'm doing before I enter a situation and not being able to prepare for something makes me very anxious; on that front, inferior Ne comes into play, too. We can use our Si and Ne to our advantage to gather info and find a multitude of connections and possibilities, but since we're Si dom, it can make us pretty rigid when we have no info to work with. Combine that with a fear of embarrassing ourselves, and it's a bit of a recipe for disaster. Again, I think it tends to be a maturity thing. The more mature the ISFJ, the more flexible they're likely to be. 
But yeah, it can be tough when what's important to you emotionally is very different, I'm sorry it didn't work out. I think it's possible to adjust to people who are that different, but it takes a lot of self-awareness, trying to understand things from multiple perspectives, and very good communication. It's a ton of work, and even then sometimes needs can just be incompatible, which definitely sucks :( "
2114,isfj,"I have a friend who is stereotypical isfj and i know how you feel. I think its more of a S vs N communication gap that Ive read about. (Seeing that you are an N puts more weight on this theory for me) I have felt the same way and even thought ""well i guess thats just nit something he cares about or cares to hear."" But if i look a bit closer i can see the feelings almost behind the mask. It seems he's unsure of what to say, but i definately see he cares. I haven't felt the need to push it,  but i think if i did i would maybe ask his opinion or if he'd ever felt the same way or something like that.  Maybe that would get a little more interaction, although i feel maybe not a considerable amount more. Im INFP, so all you ISFJ's can tell  me if I'm way off the mark here. I would really love to know. "
2115,isfj,"Can I just say, you're so well spoken and give such great advice. :) Thank you so much. Si sounds very similar to Ni in a way....I think they both serve the same purpose but get there in completely different processes.
I'm not sure if it will ever work, but deep down I wish it did. Reading your comment, it seems like he would be so much happier with someone like you. "
2116,isfj,"Personally I do think you might be on the right track. Obviously it won't be true for all of us, but I know that after some bad experiences with people I was close to, I tend to hold my true feelings very close to my chest, even more than I already did before. It's always been my childish romantic fantasy that someone will come along who will see something in me and insist that they really want to hear what I think and feel, and who will be relaxed and open-minded enough not to make me feel judged even if they disagree with me :P
Anyway, I think your mask analogy is pretty accurate. As it stands, I'm anxious enough about other people that I seem to filter my opinions to make them as easy to wave away as possible if they cause the slightest hint of conflict or make me seem stupid, and I tend not to mention them at all if I don't already know how the other party feels. It's a really bad habit, but I do always want to contribute and share, because I love to talk and trade ideas. I may be a more extreme example than some, but I don't think that sort of hiding and hesitating is an uncommon state for ISFJs, unfortunately. "
2117,isfj,"Aww, thank you! It's my pleasure, I'm glad you're finding it useful :) And yes, I think that's a pretty accurate interpretation! I think it's sort of that we give weight to different aspects of our experiences, but we're still both collecting and interpreting info and ideas to help us make sense of our worlds. 
I'm really sorry though, I know it's really hard to lose a relationship you had pinned your hopes on like that :( I do find that ISFJs tend work well together just because we're so damned polite lol, but other types like you help us open up and explore, and that's a really valuable thing, too. I just don't want you feeling like you're anything less than perfectly good and lovely because it didn't work out with him, you know? Because I can tell that you're a really kind and thoughtful person who has a ton to offer someone who suits you. 
Anyway, I hope it's not overstepping, but I'd like to say that I have a feeling based on your post and comments that eventually you'll be able to take the experience you had with him and use it to guide you, even if you're not ready for that just yet. You seem like you're really making an effort to examine what went wrong and why, and I think the self-knowledge and wisdom you gain from that reflection will help you find a person that the connection feels natural with and who makes you happy💕"
2118,isfj,"I just thought of something....where most people are like TV or audio books blasting away, you guys are like paper books and need to be read. And i want you to know that i dont mean that in a negative way. I think its endearing. :)"
2119,isfj,"I got this idea from watching Sherlock when John Watson (classic ISFJ) was lamenting how unbelievable it was that he fell for Mary, who turned out to be not what he thought she was. And then Sherlock told John how he is actually attracted to danger: “You’re abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you’ve fallen in love with conforms to that pattern?”
Now of course IRL it’s not as extreme as that but I personally found my self attracted to guys who are not exactly textbook “good guys”. They’re just not as straitlaced as I consider myself to be and I found that pattern can be associated to many things but I just wanna know how other ISFJs are."
2120,isfj,"Not “dangerous,” really, but I definitely seem to gravitate towards people who are very active, adventurous, and/or outgoing. Less straight-laced than me, I guess, but usually more just because of a difference in willingness to try new things than any moral differences; I don’t have a problem with any of the things my friends or SO do, I’m just not comfortable doing them myself. That kind of thing. I don’t like or hang out with anyone I would consider dangerous or a bad person. "
2121,isfj,"it depends, since my dad is an infj, I have come to find people that seems to be somewhat similiar to him attractive. but I'm young, I don't know what love is(like..for real, I'm  turning 15 this December) 
Sometimes I find myself attracted to outgoing.. or adventurous people too. 
It's kind of a blend.. idk"
2122,isfj,"For relationships no im not. Im way to careful for my own good who I choose to be a partner. I dont have a particular type that im looking for but I would like someone similar or close to me as we would have similar values and look at the world in a similar fashion. 
For friends, I like hanging around extroverts since they take most of the social interaction and are often fun to be around. If I didnt I would probably be a hermit at home not talking to anybody. "
2123,isfj,"As an ENFP male, I've found myself attracting ISFJs for this reason. I'm really open, not straight laced by any stretch of the imagination, and I act somewhat spontaneously. I'm not dangerous, though, at least not to others.
The last ISFJ girl I attracted was what I might call a goodie-two-shoes in her actions, but had a much darker sense of humor and loved to talk about crazy things outside her personal realm of experience. 
She had never smoked or done drugs and was more naive and innocent than she even knew. She thought she was sort of a 'bad girl' despite all evidence to the contrary lol. After meeting me it was like she was awestruck that someone could do so many things outside what's normal and safe. We both had a similar moral compass though and despite our differences in experience, we agreed on many things.
She'd get an excited look in her eye and a really sexy smile when I'd talk about certain 'risky' behavior. She also admitted that much of it would be stuff she'd never want to do herself, though, it was obvious hearing some of my stories fascinated her."
2124,isfj,"That's interesting that you can see what I mean by ""dangerous"" I like and dangerous I don't!! I am a 4.0 student always, no criminal record, etc... can't seem to find a boyfriend I actually like that DOESN'T do or deal drugs or have a past like that... but I have never been attracted to anyone with a record, anyone with a hot temper, etc.... there's like... illegal and then there's dangerous. Edit: everyone I find who hasn't got a past like that just seems so... boring and naive and.... just like doesn't know how the world is."
2125,isfj,"ISFJ confirmed! lol
I know exactly what you mean. I have no record and definitely not a hot temper. If I get angry, pay attention, cause something is seriously wrong lol. That being said I've done lots of low level illegal shit especially when I was younger. Basically things involving drugs, alcohol, and stupid fun shit.
I personally tend to find 'innocence' attractive for some reason (or at least as attractive as the opposite). I'd always tease this girl about being president of some honor society (and at least a member of every other society I've never even heard of), having a 4.0, never smoking weed, not knowing a lot of street, sexual, or drug related slang. 
Something about the dynamic was fun and sexy. While still being open(?) to it. It seemed to excite her as long as it didn't feel truly dangerous, like you said."
2126,isfj,"I have the be the goody two shoes in the relationship or I can't stand it. I don't want to be kidnapped over some beef you have dangerous but like... be sexy and fun and interesting. However, I did very much love a lady romantically once and SHE was an INFJ.... however she had a hard life so she was raw and real and experienced.
Guys I date do tend to say they like how ""innocent"" I am but that I'm actually down to do things.... weird!"
2127,isfj,"Yeah, I tend to like it the other way around, I don't want someone who's even more risk-taking than me. It's intimidating lol. I'd be attracted to that for a short period out of simple curiosity, but, it would quickly get tiring and give me anxiety. 
Definitely into someone who's slightly more restrained who I can still coax into do fun things with me. Don't want someone who would simply disapprove of any risk and become a nag, but, I would like someone who can talk me out of anything too risky. I don't need anymore encouragement lol. 
You sound fun!"
2128,isfj,"You do too lol!  ;) LOL I'm sort of joking with the face.
​
Yeah if it's a really bad idea I won't have any part of it and I'll try to make you rethink it. Like, an ex used to go steal from stores... just walk out with a cart full of stuff. I'd just tell him good luck. No WAY I am going to go do that and ALSO mess it up for him because I am radiating nervousness. But I thought the groceries were sick, so I didn't tell him not to. Dangerous LOL!!!!"
2129,isfj,"From what I've researched, the most common crime for ISFJs is accessory. Makes sense. Your anxieties are probably enough to keep you from both engaging in too much illegal activity as well as preventing you from going to the law about a crime someone you know committed. Unless of course it threatened you and your family.
Free groceries sounds pretty dope, but, not into theft myself. I would have probably looked the other way, though, in your position. Good food is expensive! I just like a good time and whatever comes with it. I'm impulsive but not entirely reckless."
2130,isfj,"Yep, accessory or possession would be my only crimes. I'd never be the ringleader. I looked the other way but I hated it and was always terrified he wouldn't come home... but I guess in California shoplifting under $900 is just a ticket... so I've heard but don't personally have experience with lol. "
2131,isfj,"I've been doing it so long I don't even notice it anymore. :/ If I'm ever sitting down across from someone and we're talking, I struggle with trying to make eye contact but I overthink it and it's totally unnatural."
2132,isfj,"Yes. Big time.
Although I worked on cruiseships for a while in a very customer focussed role. As a result I can push through and maintain eye contact... not sure if it looks natural or creepy, but I can do it."
2133,isfj,"I used to avoid eye contact like the plague, but some people see it as a sign of weakness and take advantage of that. So FTS, I will make eye contact with you and hold it from 40 feet away while we pass each other in the hall."
2134,isfj,"My brother (an isfj like me) drives me crazy because he will NOT look at people when he talks. He looks to the floor, the left or the right of the person. Doesn't matter who it is outside of family (except his girlfriend), he won't engage in eye contact except maybe for a brief second.
Edit: His classmates in high school legit thought he was blind when they first met him. This was probably why. 
On the same token, I struggle with making eye contact with people I find intimidating or people I highly respect. I force myself to do it, but as soon as I'm asked a question that requires a thoughtful response, I look to the upper left and squint my eyes to get some relief. I remember having a confrontation with a professor I found intimidating and I maintained eye contact for what felt like an eternity. My heart was pounding so much after that."
2135,isfj,"I use to avoid eye contact. However, since being a physician in training I've had to train myself to look into people's eyes and convey that compassion and altruism. I've kind of learned to do that in my private/personal life. The funny thing is there are a lot of ISFJ in the medical community and some of the outward expressions of care are internal conflicts with ISFJ."
2136,isfj,"Yes, but I try to maintain eye contact for the most part.
I have to look away to focus on what they are saying if it's complicated in any way, otherwise, I read more into their facial expressions and body language and the words become a sort of fluff. So I've assessed their mood, but haven't heard what they've said, which isn't all that helpful!"
2137,isfj,"Yes, this is something I struggle with all the time since I have really strong social anxiety in general. It's something I've been consciously working on over time though, so it's gotten a little easier."
2138,isfj,Well few years ago I managed to get in relaxed position while maintaining eye contact. I didn't even try to change my eye shyness. Now I can take a deep look into any stranger's eyes around and even scare someone If needed :) It's quite powerful thing. 
2139,isfj,"I've taken this test multiple times and each have gotten either this type or the logistician one (isfj more frequently). For the most part I fit inot this category, however one thing I can't relate to is constant timidness. If its an informal or business setting, like one where I might meet someone new, I have no trouble maintaining eye contact or saying a few things. Its afterwards where the initial icebreaker shit is done where they usually realize I'm awkward as fuck."

2142,isfj,"Hello all you ISFJs! 
I'm an INFJ female who is dating a wonderful ISFJ man. What do y'all think of being in a relationship with INFJs? Is it generally a good match for y'all? Why or why not? What are the strengths (and weaknesses) of this pairing from y'alls perspective?
Thanks :)"
2143,isfj,"I saw on one website where the isfj feels fulfilled but the infj not so much. It was one of those charts that shows how all types tend to match up with each other.   I can dig up the chart later, but I’m standing on a train typing with one hand right now on my phone. I have it on my laptop.   Update: Search ""simplified myers briggs type compatibility chart"" and you will see a chart with lots of green, red, yellow, light-green, and some blue squares.  There are a lot of other cool charts there too.  You can do a lot of reading and learn pretty quickly.  I agree with +Huuuligan below, that any type can work as long as both are healthy and willing to make it work.  I, INFJ (M), have been married to an ISFJ (F) for 26 years and my experience is on par with what I have read about this pairing.  Personally, I have female friends who are ENFP, INFP, INFJ, and ESFJ, and I must say,  like the ""NF""'s best.  I have also related well with one female INTJ that I know, but she was a bit of a narcissists.  In general, I get along with most people, but prefer ""NF"" types.  I am still waiting to know an ENTP in real life."
2144,isfj,"I know you posted this a few days ago but I am an ISFJ married to an INFJ. We have been together about 10 years now :)
We found what worked best for us was learning how the other person thinks and how they communicate. We actually looked up articles on INFJ's & ISFJ's in hopes to gain further insight to benefit our relationship. It ended up being a positive experience by changing how we approached one another in our day to day lives.
But something that I am so grateful for in my INFJ husband, is that he always awes me in how much he really thinks about things. I am more emotional and tend to get stuck in my own mindset that I rarely think in terms of multiple view points. And so when we go to discuss something, he is able introduce me to ideas and thoughts that I never even entertained before. I have found myself to be a much more accepting of others and their views and I thank him for that :)
My husband and I are also very introverted, which I view as a food thing. We can be home, sitting in the same room, not speaking, but still enjoying each other's company. He is also similar to me in that he is very loyal in his relationships. Not only romantically, but to his friends ans family as well. He is always there when needed and extremely devoted.
All in l I truly think ISFJs and INFJs can have great relationships together. I just think the key is understanding how ypu both think and communicate because in my opinion that is the major difference between ISFJs and INFJs. But that major difference, as I pointed out, can turn into a positive as it will allow you insight into how another person views the world. 
Best of luck to you. I wish you both nothing but happiness :)"
2145,isfj,"Thank you so much for your reply. I did look up the chart and oh nooooo, apparently I ""better rethink this one"" lol. 
So, as someone who has experience (26 years worth), do you have any advice for me on how to keep this relationship with my ISFJ thriving or how to prevent any issues before they become problems? I really envision this relationship lasting a good long while and want to do everything in my power to make sure this is the case :)"
2146,isfj,"Hi. My Enneagram is 4w5 and tri-type  458.  I am not knowledgeable on E-gram, but consulted with a knowledgeable acquaintance who helped look at my results.  
You and your isfj will definitely share some commonality so don’t bail out based on those charts. Just make sure you both understand your similarities and differences and support each other in establishing ways to get needs met through avenues outside the relationship. For me, I need to be social with other NF’s and other types that like to talk about the cosmos, psychology, quantum physics, and so on. 
Bottom line: know thyself, and then know thy partner. You should be fine. "
2147,isfj,"A lot of my current favorite video games are from series I played when I was a kid (Nintendo and JRPG) and it takes me a lot to try a new genre. I'm very conservative with spending and I keep track of how much money I spend and always try to find ways to spend less and save more. I'm big on having a eating/drinking routine, in particular I almost always make the same smoothie every morning for breakfast. I usually don't like abstract / what if talks. If it's something that can't be applied that could potentially be related to or done on a physical level I just dont even bother taking part of discussions. A lot of decisions I make tend to be present/past oriented and Im not always good at making or thinking about future goals."
2148,isfj,"I've noticed that my Si usually manifests in regards to emotions + memories and when I'm trying to picture something in my head - I might hear a certain song, and then my brain may become flooded with memories and emotions and nostalgia and pictures of exactly what was happening, what I was feeling, what I was thinking, who I was with or who it's directed at, etc. (Sometimes it's really inconvenient actually)
In general, being a visual learner, when I try to picture something in my head, I've noticed I always link it to other things - my thought process will literally go:
""Picture an apple.""
""I've seen an apple on a tree in this game I've played recently. I saw Megan eating an apple on Monday, right? My cousin always liked to eat apples in class."" 
Visual links & all. "
2149,isfj,"I've been planning a story for a couple of years and there is this character who for fun I tested for his MBTI recently. He has come out as isfj. From descriptions he does seem like he is like you guys, although he does want to change a lot of things in his life, and society in general. That's kind of his whole character, but the reason for doing so is because in all his past experiences in life he feels the system he is living in is wrong. (The reason I want to know is because it'll give me a more complete sense of who he is, although I won't change him to fit a certain type. That'll take the fun out of it. I'm an INFP btw) 
Really briefly explaining him, he is wronged by a lot of high ranking people as a child because of the system of his society. He also has a medical issue. When he is older he feels that he can't fix the things that are wrong with him and society until he is told to fix his medical condition he has to change the society he is living in. And therefore thinks he can kill two birds with one stone. Now he meets more people and sticks to a plan that was forged with help from other people to fix society. He is personally and emotionally tested to follow through with his plan but he does so by the end. However he is always struggling with either sticking to his plan and staying away from his family. One side he doesn't want his family to be hurt like they have been in the past and on the other he wants to stay close to his family because of his immense love and need for them emotionally.
This is the basic character and his decisions and reasons. Do you guys relate to this and is there anything striking that makes him completely non isfj? Main thing that confused me is how you guys seem to be traditionalist which I don't think fit my character in the common term."
2150,isfj,"I'm not really a traditionalist at all. I hang on to things that make me feel good sometimes, certainly; Christmas will always be my favorite holiday because it brings back good memories of times with my family, and I still love the Christmas traditions we do have, but I don't reject the fact that they've changed over the years. I like eating the same few things over and over again when I eat out, and new places and people make me nervous, but I also absolutely put my own comfort above any definition of what I ""should"" be. I'm a pierced, buzzcutted, butch-leaning lesbian, so I didn't have much chance of being traditional in the first place, I guess. 
But from a larger, more philosophical perspective, I feel like my Fe is a far more driving force than my Si. I see systems in place that hurt people and take advantage of them, and it infuriates me. I absolutely don't think that we should hold on to old ways that don't work because ""that's how we've always done it."" If it's hurting people, if it's inefficient, if it's just stopped fitting the situation, scrap it and start over. There's a value to history, but circumstances and needs change, and systems and traditions should change with them. 
So, yeah, your character sounds reasonable as an ISFJ to me. The struggle between being with his family and keeping them safe would be very difficult as an ISFJ, but that can make it compelling. And if he feels strongly enough that something is so wrong that it's worth breaking the peace over, then I think it's totally reasonable for an ISFJ to do anything he has to in order to make things right. There are probably ISFJs who would react differently, but that doesn't make your character not ISFJ, since we're all at different levels of personal development and mental health and whatnot. "
2151,isfj,"I am an ISFJ through and through, but I don't identify with being traditional. There's some factors throughout my life which have made me this way such as a lack of a functioning traditional childhood, so I feel I steered my own way and have my own personal traditions and rituals. These are based on what are most important to me. 
Also, each of the traits is graded on a percentage and I typically have high feeling and thinking percentages. (Feeling always being more though) Although I identify in no way to being an ISTJ, but it might impact my decision making. So this could be true for your character. 
Hope this helps a bit! "
2152,isfj,"Thank you for an amazing answer. The more I thought about it I realise my character is ISFJ. And my original plan was for the family struggle to be very hard on him so it makes sense to me. Of course everyone has their different experiences and circumstances and as you said levels of personal development so I think I know what he is. I don't know why but I feel validated, shouldn't matter too much though. Last thing I want is to force a character I wrote to change and fit exactly into a mold of one of the 16 types. "
2153,isfj,"That does help thanks. I always thought of it as ISFJs being traditional and stuck in their ways. Although from a little research it seems more like its just about making decisions based on how your past experiences have made you feel. This sounds right for both you and my character. Although can I have an example of your personal traditions and why you've picked them up, if you feel like sharing. Thanks."
2154,isfj,"I'm not sure if I am just in a place that has a high number of intuitives, but every single person that I have shown the test to end up as one. Currently I know an INFP, ENFP, ENTP and two INTJs, as well as having an ENTJ father and an IN/SFJ (not sure which one) mother. 
Honestly it is pretty interesting, cause while I have learned to communicate better with said people, there definitely feels sometimes (not as much with the first two but definitely with the others excluding my parents) like there is a bit of a disconnect when I'm talking to them. If that wasn't enough, there is a group of people who I'm trying to get to know better who I'm pretty sure are mostly N's also. I'm not even entirely sure how to act around sensors anymore cause I hardly ever talk to any. 
How many intuitives do you guys know? And how do you guys act when surrounded by them? On a side note how different is it talking to sensors?"
2155,isfj,"Yes. I actually love intuitives.
The only sensors in my life are my sister, and a couple of friends.
Oddly enough, I'm not very close to my sensor friends. I feel like we don't have very much to talk about, and things get shallow and stagnant pretty fast.
Intuitives tend to be full of ideas, and they're usually willing to go a little bit deeper with their conversations, which I like. 
I tend to feel like I'm on a different wavelength from my sensor friends, more often than not."
2156,isfj,"from what i read, lots of ISFJ's are attracted to logic puzzles, chess, things like that? this probably helps with Ne + Ti
also i guess forcing yourself out of your comfort zone...engaging in playful banter. stuff like that. (at least, this is what i'm trying lol)"
2157,isfj,"ENTP here, I would recommend to not develop Ne at all. It can cause problems and decrease efficiency, just be yourself. 
But regardless, I think with Ne you have to be in tune with world issues a lot more and suppress your Fe so that Ti can come in which would automatically prompt the Ne. You have to think about society a lot more and be observable and think about the problems they face and how to combat these problems. You also have to learn to hold your ground until someone provides you with a rational justification about why you would be wrong. And even if you are wrong you have to accept the fact that everyone can be wrong at some point and in the end the most rational solution produces the most results. 
In short, just stop caring about what people think. "
2158,isfj,"Hey fellow ISFJ'ers 
I am having trouble in my relationship as I am too considerate and a pushover. I am currently dating  Anyone ENTP male.
My bf says that I can't make up my mind and with that, it makes it hard for him to plan things because I tend to change my mind a lot because I worry about what his needs are too much. 
Anyone else have this issue? How dod you go about stopping yourself from being too nice and being more assertive?"
2159,isfj,"not an isfj, but this isn't actually being considerate. :-)
theres a difference in taking someone's needs into consideration and making decisions for other people based on what you think their needs are.
You choose for you, let him choose for him. Us guys generally like partners who know what they want. :-)"
2160,isfj,"For me it has come with time and in trusting my boyfriend that he will be honest if he truly doesn't want to do something. If I know I can believe him I don't need to second-guess if he is upset or unhappy because he has agreed to tell me if he feels that way.
This means if your boyfriend and you have a plan to go out then believe that he wants to be spending that time with you. Don't worry ""oh no what if he'd rather be doing something else."" And like I said I have struggled with this but as you continue your relationship you should feel more and more comfortable being open and honest with your SO.
In the beginning I hardly ever asked for small favors etc but now I ask him to do small things for me a lot like make me coffee or go to the grocery store with me. I am 23 and have been with him for 2.5 years for reference. When I was 19 and in my first relationship I was way more of a doormat than I am now."
2161,isfj,"I'm male, and I'm ISFJ. 
What I normally do in situations where we're trying to decide is frame in in a ""My preference would be to do ______"" but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're not open to other things. You don't even really need to be assertive, just make it clear what your preference is. I always find it frustrating when people leave decisions up to me because I want what's best for everyone, but if nobody is offering opinions then I'm free to decide. Let him know what your actual preference is. I know that you want what's best for him, but he's trying to take you into account as well, so you've gotta give him something to work with. "
2162,isfj,"I've always had trouble with missing people from my past once they're no longer a part of my life, and I wonder if this is a theme for other ISFJs, or if it's just me.
Even after I form new, meaningful connections, I still sometimes find myself thinking about people I used to know, even if my relationship with them was unhealthy, and I often miss them. 
I've been in a very healthy, happy, fulfilling relationship for just shy of 2 years now, and while I wouldn't change it at all, I still find myself missing an ex sometimes. 
I've moved on from that relationship, and I definitely wouldn't want to go back to it, but I catch myself wondering how he's doing sometimes, and missing the good times we had. 
I don't act on these feelings, and I usually just leave the past where it belongs, but sometimes I feel guilty when I'm lying there with this amazing guy who I love to death, and I feel a pang of nostalgia for times I had with an ex. 
Have any of you guys ever had issues with this? How do you move forward and let go of the attachment to people who aren't a part of your life anymore?"
2163,isfj,"I definitely have problems with this. I moved to a new state about a year ago, and I still frequently think about the job I left and all the friends I had there. In fact, I just finished a rewatch of The Office a few minutes ago and found myself bawling during the last episode reminiscing about the good times I had with my coworkers there. 
I think as ISFJs we can be so selective about the people we become close to, that those bonds tend to be really hard to sever. It makes sense that they would stay in your heart and mind for a long time even after the relationship ends because they took up so much space there before. "
2164,isfj,"Yes, I can identify with this.
The other day I was giving a friend a run down of my past toxic relationship and what kind of stunts my ex-gf pulled. I had story after story and then ended the whole thing with ""but she is a good person"". My friend said: ""it certainly doesn't sound like it"". I still value good experiences with her but I need to watch my thoughts about idealising it.
I am also about to move away from the city I live in and as soon as I made the decision all the positive things about this place are getting overwhelming. I am basically romanticising everything about it.
I think that it is because of the experience catalogue in our head that we base our decisions and behaviour on. I value positive emotional reasons pretty high while negative memories are dropped as soon as they are over. My brain is trying to find enough facts to makes a decision black or white but that rarely works. So I have to remind myself that there are reasons for decisions and ended relationships even if not everything points that way."
2165,isfj,"Yes, I relate. Apart from closer relationships that are over by now, I hate meeting people that I know will only be ""passing by"" in my life, and whom I will have to say goodbye eventually. I also feel sad when I think how my current work colleagues will be part of my past in some future point of my life..  "
2166,isfj,"ENTP here. A good ISFJ friend of mine whom I love and who confessed to me just some days before graduation will now leave to travel the world and go to uni abroad, while I need to stay and finish my diploma. 
Emotional dilemma aside, reading this topic and the reactions makes me ask myself whether or not this feeling means for you that you wish to stay in contact/ hear from the people you miss, or you wish to have your space? What form of contact would you like? I still have some time to communicate on that but I'd appreciate to hear what the more experienced individuals among you would suggest based on your preferences.
EDIT: Thanks for the upfront and quick response. I'm very lucky and happy to hear both that long distance is not too much of a problem and that she is very much willing to stay in contact. (Also made a sarcastic joke about marriage, you guys take sass and make a flirty sport out of it). Enjoy the evening~"
2167,isfj,"It's honestly different with every relationship, for me.
A lot of the people I miss were toxic, and they aren't healthy for me, so while I do miss them, it wouldn't be a good idea for them to be a part of my life anymore.
In the case of my ex, I wouldn't want to reconnect solely because it may complicate my current relationship.
If her feelings for you are strong, she may very well want to stay in touch with you, you may have to just ask her and see how she feels.
If distance is the only obstacle, I can't see it being a massive problem, and even then, you could stay platonic friends, you don't have to cut each other off completely. I have loads of long-distance friends, and my current relationship has some long periods of long-distance, and for me, it's worth it for the people I really care about."
2168,isfj,"As an ISFJ, very high Si + Fe user, AND a hyperempath, I remember and get emotional over things I don't need to get emotional over. It's  awful. Then Ne comes in and messes everything up like ""WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS?!?!? police sirens"" while my Ti is like ""DUDE CHILL"" and it's generally just difficult - does anyone else have this problem? Something similar?"
2169,isfj,"Okay, so I first took the MBTI test when I was younger and I typed as an ESFJ. I was hyper and bubbly and loved people, yada yada. Then I went through a kind of depression and came out of it as an I. Now I'm unsure if I'm actually E or I, because-
1) Can you really change types so easily? 
2) Or is this just having matured more?
3) I do enjoy being around some people; others exhaust me, and even if I've had a lot of fun, I do need some time to recharge. However, at the same time, I am extremely dependent on and need people. 
4) Isn't ISFJ considered the most 'extroverted' (I guess outgoing would be a better term) of the introverted types?
5) I agree more with ISFJ when I read up on it. 
6) My SO tells me he thinks I'm an 'extroverted riddled by anxiety'. And I'd slightly agree with that because I've been overcoming my anxiety a bit more and noticed that I am slightly more positive and outgoing.
A lot of these could type me as ambiverted; in fact, I am probably more ambiverted than anything. But does anyone have any thoughts/things to add on whether I am actually more introverted? "
2170,isfj,"Well, mbti doesn't really account for mental illness, which is definitely a weakness of the whole theory, frankly. So it's hard to say if a person's type can change due to depression/anxiety, or if you can truly type someone who suffers from a mood or personality disorder. But, the best way to figure out your type will always be through the cognitive functions and your function stack. 
It may be easier for you to identify your inferior function? If you're an ESFJ it would be Introverted Thinking (Ti), whereas if you're an ISFJ it would be Extroverted Intuiting (Ne). This post might be useful in figuring it out (and I like that blog's info a lot anyway, although it can be a lot of heavy reading). Depending on your self-knowledge and experiences, identifying your dominant function may be easier, though, so I'll link you to this post as well. If you don't know anything about cognitive functions, that second post may actually be the better place to start, as it provides some brief intro to the concept. 
Let me know if any of this is too confusing, I can try to break it down a bit! "
2171,isfj,"I'm definitely borderline between I and E, but ultimately I'm a solid ISFJ because I need time to recharge and I don't really feel the burning need to be around people like I do when I tired of them and want to be alone. However, I am very social and try to keep my social schedule full mainly due to FOMO - fear of missing out. I'd give up my much needed alone time in order to not feel left out. I love people and always seem to be mistaken as an extrovert (always in small groups though... hm...), almost more now that I've gone through the whole college depression^TM thing.
I think ISFJs tend to be the most extroverted introverts because we're more likely to sacrifice our recharge time because (1) it makes us feel good/plays towards our empathy (it might be the ""correct"" way to be in a situation/society; or all the extroverted emotions (Fe) are riling us up, making us extra outgoing; or we want to help people c: ) or (2) it's a step to build/establish relationships/solutions (we're good at putting in the time/effort/patience for long-haul projects without getting as discouraged as others). Like I know I'll overextend myself with new friends and it's not until I've reached a certain level of comfortableness with the relationship am I okay with telling them ""thanks for the offer/I'm sorry I can't to x y and x, I'm just going to have a me-day and not do anything and just recharge from the week.""
So, yeah. Ultimately I think the answer is: you're probably an extremely social ISFJ who likes people (but gets tired of them eventually) and have the social grace/knowledge to pass as an extrovert (something valued in society)."
2172,isfj,"For the first link, I agreed to most of them, except that I agreed to more of the Ne ones. 
Dominant function though, definitely Si. 
So....I guess that would make me an ISFJ?? that can be extroverted/ambiverted sometimes?? Thank you!"
2173,isfj,"Sounds right! Sociableness isn't really what mbti is looking at anyway, more like where your focus/energy tends to go most naturally, inwards or outwards. Of course, if you're focused outwards then you're more likely to come across as extroverted and vice versa, so there is some overlap, but if you're a relatively outgoing ISFJ that doesn't change your type! And no problem, happy to help! "
2174,isfj,"https://youtu.be/hEdFv0ZDPJ8
Use that video. If you want more dm me and I have more. 
Yeah. 
I thought the specific use of the guys height was Ti
Also, is the fact that he’s a biker, pro surfer, woodworker, and builds a cabin every year a sign of Se?
Also, i know hes switched jobs a lot- isnt that Se looking for new information? 
He also will make noises if reminded of them which is Se. he is also definitely an I. 
He’s friendly but private, doesn’t seem that comfortable with emotional situations, pretty open minded. "
2175,isfj,"Idk really. Maybe just because ISFJs are more worried about others and creating a pleasing environment for everyone. I imagine that they’d put more effort in making the speech more entertaining and relatively brief to satisfy most people. I imagine an ISFJ would be more emotional as well. I’m not too familiar with ISTPs though, so this is just a guess. "
2176,isfj,"He’s not extroverted- but thats just a goal of the talk- its merely logical to do so.
Also, his carefully chosen vocabulary and the contemplation before he talks irl show Ti.
Also, his hobbies- building cabins, woodworking, surfing, biking, point to Se. also, the fact that he will mimick noises when reminded of them is Se."
2177,isfj,"Se takes stimulation in new sounds - that would be Se, the sounds, since that is the here and now.
Also- carefully chosen vocabulary is Ti, Ti values good use of vocabulary and as Ti users get older they do that as well."
2178,isfj,And again- its rather hard to tell functions from a talk he pre planned- which could make him come off differently than he actually is. Do u want me to message you a voice recording of him in real time
2179,isfj,"I think you are the one with the misinformation. Typical Fi users. I asked the best socionics typers I know- and i would trust them much more, considering they’ve been studying this shit for many years.
You haven’t given me any definitions of functions or any good evidence. Emotions has nothing to do with being a feeling type. I know many very emotional thinking types. U have misinformation if u don’t think Ti users don’t valu good vocabulary."
2180,isfj,"Yeah and I’m an expert in socionics, although that is a source, it was not indicative of his type. Have u read the comments? 90% of people think hes an ISTP- why are u so convince ur right? 
Jesus- ENFPs with their blind Ti, annoying as fuck. Ive studied socionics long enough to know my shit more than you. I already told u what was Se, and any other expert would agree, i think ur absolutely idiotic. "
2181,isfj,"My response actually included accurate evidence, and had absolutely no emotion, classic ENFP trying to put shit on others when they are scared their wrong. Read up on TI blind hun- its quite clear in u. And I dont really care enough to link sources cus I’m lazy and i don’t care about you. Im probably more educated than a little shit like you. Learn some real shit or dont say stupid shit in Reddit’s when u know nothing about typing "
2182,isfj,"Whenever I'm on the INTJ subreddit, I'm always stunned by how many people on there profess a great dislike for ISFJs and Guardian types in general. Usually it seems to come from immature guys who have an ISFJ mom or something and are bitching about how she's ""so limiting"" or ""too emotional"" or ""not on my level intellectually."" As for me, my parents are the ""intuitive dream couple"" (INTJ-ENFP) and while they're awesome people, they can be a bit...intense and overbearing at times. I really recognize what sensors do for the world--honestly, without them, nothing would function...Anyway, I meandered a bit, but basically what I want to say is that ISFJs are AWESOME.  
A few reasons why:
-You have unbelievable emotional intelligence. As an INTJ, I have pretty much none. I'm barely in touch with my own feelings, let alone other people's.
-You're practical and know what needs to be done in a given situation (I'm always living in my head and missing details). 
-You're consistent. As someone who values this greatly, but sometimes has trouble maintaining consistency himself, I really appreciate that.
-You're selfless. Objectively a great trait and one which I very much lack.
-You're really nice. Criticisms of ISFJ characters in books and movies usually revolve around something like ""She/he is too nice."" Well WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH BEING NICE?! Certainly nothing last time I checked. On the topic of books, two of my favorite literary heroines are ISFJs (Lucie from A Tale of Two Cities--who sometimes gets hate but I don't understand it--and Sonya from Crime and Punishment). Incidentally, they both try to help massively screwed up INTJ guys.  
Honestly, most of the time I hate people and I can be a cold bastard , but you all make me want to get in touch with my Fi and be a nicer person more than anybody else.  
-an appreciative INTJ"
2183,isfj,"funnily enough a handful of my online friends are NT types (INTP, ENTJ, and INTJ) and I think I'm closer to them than a lot other feeling types 
And they've expressed to me openly how much they enjoy hanging out with me in particular because I stick out in terms of ISFJness (they dont know MBTI well but they basically say similar things to what you did)
And it does feel nice to hear because well compliments are nice 
And yeah when I meet actual mature / non-edgelord/elitist xNTJs, I actually like how honest and smart they are without necessarily gloating while still being fun to hang out with. Sometimes with other feeler friends (of any type) I do feel like I have to walk on egg shells due to having to take into account how sensitive some can be but I can bring out my more honest side around xNTJs
But anyway thanks!"
2184,isfj,"Hey this is pretty nice of you. While I don't always get along with INTJ types, I've met some really decent folks who claimed to be.
However, I am quite curious about this word choice. It could be me being nitpicky, but...
Hate is quite strong, no? I've always thought thinker types were indifferent to people, since you say you are cold and out of touch with your feeling side. I mean, you guys are so focused on your... thinking/non-people oriented goals. I can directly explain why I, a person who uses Fe, actively dislike people at times. Hate, to me, indicates that people actually have some sort of impact on you emotionally."
2185,isfj,"awww
well as an isfj , i can be very limiting to the point of being a boring person and it's true anyways. Emotional? well not so much but it depends on the situation. Oh what about being nice? Yep  Im nice in a polite way because we isfjs choose our battle CAREFULLY . Thus we hate conflict. 
I dont know about you nt types but as for intuitive types, they are generally insightful and intelligent but at the same time ( no offense) , they can be a bit overbearing and somewhat not grounded on reality ( based on experience from my enfj bff and intp friend). Other than that, they have managed to get me out of my shell through philosophies and conspiracy theories which i really like. My intp friend can be accomodating and supportive of me but at the same time, can offer cold logic about some topics especially the ones he doesnt care about. He's cerebral type of person.
I may come off as defensive hahah but regardless, thank you for this 😊😊😊"
2186,isfj,"I keep reading this too. My fiancé is INTJ, I’m ISFJ, and though we’re quite opposite in ways we balance each other out so well in the parts we are opposite. Idk I was surprised to read that when we always get along so well and easily. "
2187,isfj,"Yeah, hate was probably overdoing it. Honestly, people just tire me out. I need the alone time! Also it could be PoLR Fe. There's a part of me that really wants to connect with others, but I don't feel that I can. Sometimes when I see a party happening, I get kind of unhappy because even though I don't under any circumstances want to go, I just feel left out. My ideal circumstance would be to get invited to a party, but then not go. Obviously the world doesn't work like that!"
2188,isfj,"I think that's an introvert thing maybe. :) I definitely can relate to that.
And yes definitely to the last. I don't want my friends around 24/7 but definitely would love to be needed lol. 
Well this has been interesting! "
2189,isfj,"I have learned that ISFJs very much value both honesty and sensitivity in their personal relationships. 
The ISFJ genuinely wants to know the whole truth in situations they are involved in, even if they are aware they may have a strong emotional reaction. 
The thing that appears to be a continual issue is that ISFJs themselves tend to be quite sensitive, and can be very open in displaying their emotions, and this tends to make them undesirable conversation partners when it comes to talking about harsh truths.
Those explaining the whole truth to an ISFJ will likely be hesitant, because they expect an emotional response that is uncomfortable to deal with -- especially if they are divulging this information because they know the ISFJ wants it. They will feel bad regardless, because it is never enjoyable seeing someone become upset because of words coming out of your mouth.
What can ISFJs do to take things less harshly and personally, so that those they are close to don't feel bad about delivering ""hard"" news? And what can non-ISFJs do to deliver sensitive information in a way that is not as hard to bear for an ISFJ?"
2190,isfj,"Tbh, this is very well-put. I want honesty, yet I know I might not like the answer. And what I want others to keep in mind is -- I am never blaming the bearer of bad news, anytime I get upset it's most likely I'm getting upset at myself in my head. Getting upset I messed up and need to be criticized (no matter how nicely it's phrased).
That being said, phrasing and tone goes a long way in helping me not get upset. If it's said in a nice tone rather than a mean tone, and if it's said with nice phrasing versus mean phrasing I won't be as upset because it won't seem like a big issue. But I do hate that I've let you down, so I'm giving myself an inner beating.
I think once I can learn to forgive myself, then I will not look as hurt. It also helps me to do something together afterwards to reconnect so I'm not ending on a ""bad note"" and just going off to do my own thing and be all sad lol."
2191,isfj,"i've come to understand that truth is relative and can be worded different ways to convey the same meaning. what matters in being sensitive is in the framing of the message. like i can convey that something upset me with or without yelling. but that's an extreme example. 
let's say a friend came to visit me and spent the entire time on their phone and after the visit felt that we did not have fun together and says that the reason is because i did not plan enough fun events for us to do together.
a less extreme example is something like being upset at previous behavior:
""you're doing it again. you always rationalize everything after the fact. now you're blaming me for your own actions"" 
as opposed to talking about previous behavior and comparing it to now:
""there are times when you explain away the reasons for your actions instead of dealing with the real reasons why you do certain things. it's happened before and you're doing it now . and it is shitty that you're putting the blame on me."" 
as opposed to choosing instead to talk about the specific incident only:
""do you really believe that is true or are you rationalizing the fact that you spent the entire time on your phone texting someone else instead of being here with me? it hurts me that you're able to do it so easily"".
as opposed to being upset about the specific incident:
""you're blaming me for this when you've been on your phone all this time?""
as opposed to any other way to frame things. they're all true. you can be upset, you can be sad, hurt, and you can bring up true facts of the past, you can tell things slow over a process of revealing behavior, or you can say it all at once. what matters i find is the right frame to get the right message through.
communication is a process of thought, packaging, transferring, and interpretation. because of that, i think the truth should also consider our understanding of the recipient's ability to interpret the message. and i find that we should understand a hurt or emotionally compromised is less able to correctly interpret a message."
2192,isfj,"Hey, I know I don't belong here but, as an ISTJ who has at least three ISFJs in my life, I'm curious if the similarities I see between them are unique to this type. Do you relate to these characteristics, my observations? 
1) Being a dedicated participant in a sport (examples: dancing, surfing, volley ball) that you're very passionate about
2) Prioritizing travel, specifically to work or volunteer in impoverished countries
3) Appreciating music but not sharing and listening to it as much as your friends
4) Likes having piercings, contemplates getting a tattoo
5) Comforts others by sharing personal experiences that involved a similar emotion/situation
6) Hesitant to initiate friendship but will quickly commit to it with loyalty
7) Great at portraying your feelings through ascetics
8) Naturally attracts children 
EDIT: For 2) I know ISFJs who play instruments, and do love music! What I've noticed is that compared to to other types, they seem to prioritize other things more. But I know you got rhythm, okay? :)"
2193,isfj,"Well, I'm an ISFJ, so I'll try my best to answer this based on my experiences.
1) Not for me, no. I've tried basically every sport out there. I hated all of them. I prefer just running by myself, when it comes to exercise. 
2) Nah. To be honest, I actually don't really like traveling. It makes me kind of anxious, and I know I would feel really uncomfortable traveling to a third-world country, especially by myself. I do care a lot about helping the world and those less fortunate, but I would prefer to do it in a way that feels safer, for me.
3) I listen to music probably at least 3+ hours a day. I'm very, very passionate about it. Whether I'm driving, cleaning, reading, running, even just sitting around doing nothing, I have music playing. I also do share it with friends fairly frequently. So I'd say this one doesn't apply to me either. 
4) Yes, I'd say I agree with this one. I'm kind of picky about piercings, but I do want a whole bunch in my ears, and I definitely want a tattoo at some point. The only thing stopping me is the fear of regretting it someday.
5) Yeah, definitely. I'm not very good at comforting people. The only way I know how is to share a similar experience I went through, and how I coped with it, to try and show that I know how they're feeling.
6) Kind of. I'm really shy, and frankly, I don't really know how to make friends very well. But when other people initiate a friendship with me, more often than not, I deeply value their friendship over time, and I'm very loyal to them. It takes me a while to feel close to people and trust them, though.
7) I don't really understand exactly what you mean with this one. If you clarify a little bit, I'll try my best to answer it.
8) Meh, kind of.
I do like children, and they seem to like me, but I'm often pretty awkward and uncomfortable around them at first. Once I spend a little time with them, I tend to warm up a lot, and kids really like me. But when I first meet them, I don't really know how to talk to them or act around them, so I end up feeling kind of stiff and awkward."
2194,isfj,"1) Been dancing for 14 years and i love it
2) I used to want to work at an NGO or international charity and go on trips to underdeveloped countries, but now im pursuing a job as a translator/interpreter which will hopefully allow me to travel more.
3) I have lots of music on itunes but i've noticed that i've never enjoyed it to the same extent as others seem to.
4) I have lots of piercings and i have been considering a small tattoo
5) yes
6) yes
7) not sure
8) for some reason, yes
I also love playing instruments and I own several"
2195,isfj,"5 6 7 8 all the way to the max i do them.
1: used to do some martial arts, now i do lifting. i don't feel dedicated to it though, even if i workout 3-5 days a week. it's more like something to focus on.
2) i'm not into travel. though i'm into being there for people.
3) iono. i like music i guess but i have no understanding of norms when it comes to enjoyment or frequency of listening to music.
4) i have a small tattoo to remind me to enjoy what i have and left go of what i've lost. it's on my chest so i can see it in the mirror in the mornings. otherwise i rather have a blank canvas to draw on than a filled one with tattoos. and i don't like piercings because they feel like accessories and i don't like having extra stuff because that feels cluttered."
2196,isfj,"1) I'm quite serious about working out.
2) I definitely prioritise travel, but always the kind that allows me my creature comforts. I also prefer to help people in a more behind-the-scenes way (e.g. donations, doing grunt work, etc.) because I get overwhelmed easily by other people's emotions and also don't want to fuck up frontline stuff and make a bad situation worse than it already is. 
3) I listen to music a lot, but I don't tend to feel as connected to the artists as a lot of the people I know. 
4) No, that's not really my thing. 
5) Yes! 
6) Yes, if I click with someone.
7) I know what I like aesthetically, but I wouldn't say I'm great at portraying my feelings aesthetically.
8) I'm pretty much the same way with kids as I am with adults - not great at initiating, not great at making conversation when we don't have anything in common, but once we click we're BFFs."
2197,isfj,"I like working out, I hate team sports or any type of group sport
I hate traveling, and prefer a staycation to a vacation any day
Music is good
I can't say I like/dislike piercings, but maybe I'll get a tattoo if I do something that warrants one
Yes
Yes
Kinda
Naturally attracting children makes me feel kinda creepy... but I find I get smiled at a lot by little kids (also kinda creepy). I don't really like kids though, and I don't think I'll have any. At least not biological kids"
2198,isfj,"Male ISFJ. Top notch. I married one.
I need validation of feelings. She needs validation of ideas. I need to be useful to her. She needs intellectual respect and encouragement from me. 
What drew us together was our ease of conversation. It may not be strictly personality based, but we converse on the same wavelength. We ""get"" eachother. Well, most of the time. It's tough conveying feelings and getting sympathy sometimes, and that can be where the big fights happen. But by attacking the problem and not eachother has enabled us to get through those."
2199,isfj,"Ugh! I had a terrible experience with one who claims to be INTP. But he also claims to be INTp/ILI in Socionics which is usually INTJ so who knows if he's really INTP. 
He just dropped me like a hot potato after 3 months and hundreds of hours of talking. We had started to annoy each other. I would have just let the relationship die a slow death. He stealthy unfriended me without any explanation so that I only found out when I accidentally facebook called him one day and saw he had to ""accept my message request."" When I asked for an explanation, he suggested he was helping me to help myself since he was no good for me. WTF!"
2200,isfj,"Female ISFJ- and I can agree with this! My SO is an INTP and for the most part we get each other until it comes from feelings, emotions, and personal space. And sometimes our arguments with feelings is a bit round about because I'm just trying to get my feelings and frustrations out there, while he always tries to find the practical solution in which feelings don't always have. 
Sometimes dealing with emotions and feelings with my SO makes my SO feel confused and overwhelmed so it's a learning emotional curve for him, and a learning curve for me to try to think/understand how his practical mind works. 
But for the most part, I think it's a really nice balance for the both of us. "
2201,isfj,"Hi,
I'm currently working as an elementary teacher's aide and my day consists of starting work at 8, being exhausted by around 1PM and struggling to get through the rest of the work day to go home and ""recharge"" until bed. I'm currently in school for Family Studies/Human Development because I have a strong interest in family dynamics and how people learn as well as helping others. However, I am lost as to what career I can have from this degree when I don't want to work in the traditional ""education""/public school environment and need time away from others to ""recharge"". Any help is appreciated!"
2202,isfj,"Maybe you could continue after a BS or a Master's to a doctorate, and possibly be hired by a university or company to conduct research on family dynamics and the such.
Don't take my word as truth though, I'm not even in college yet :/"
2203,isfj,"I was planning on going the clinical psychologist route. I can handle one-on-one or small group interactions for a decent amount of time, and I believe it'll progress beyond small talk, so I'm hoping it'll work for me. We'll see though!"
2204,isfj,"I know that this is an older post, but I recently subbed and have a chance to read through some posts.
I am ISFJ and I am an Occupational Therapy Assistant (COTA) working with pediatric population. It is a great fit for me because I am one on one with kiddos all day, an hour at a time, helping them become as independent as possible in all aspects of their lives regardless of disability or diagnosis. It is challenging, but oh so rewarding when the hard work and dedication pays off when a patient progresses. I am surrounded by FJ personalities in my co-workers and my fellow COTA co-worker is also ISFJ, which is awesome. I just wanted to throw out that Occupational Therapy is a great fit for the introvert :)."
2205,isfj,I've actually been thinking about getting a Master's possibly in Educational Psychology/Learning Psychology. I'm hoping to find a cost-effective Master's program if I pursue that route :) Thanks for your advice!
2206,isfj,"This is one of the career paths I was considering growing up. The idea of knowing I'm getting to know and help people with their problems sounded very fulfilling and interesting
Unfortunately I didn't have too much confidence in that (since I was socially awkward/shy for a while) so I ended up going for a Computer related position which I still like."
2207,isfj,"Good for you. I wish I could have had someone come along and just say ""this would be suited for you"". As it is I'm lowest-level finance with no career goals to speak of, and absolutely no room for growth. "
2208,isfj,"Right now the ISFJ type resonates with me (38/m) the most. I believe as we evolve, we associate ourselves with different personality types. Previously I thought I was an INFP, but that no longer resonates with me. Maybe I'm answering and understanding the personality type questions more clearly and answering with more awareness now. Does anybody have a similar experience? Either way, it's good to communicate/connect with ISFJ's."
2209,isfj,"Hmm, for a long time when I was taking the quizzes I would bounce back and forth between INFJ and ISFJ, but after reading up on cognitive functions, I can say pretty certainly that I'm ISFJ. I've had moments where I've questioned if maybe I'm INTP since it's the same functions in a different order, but ISFJ definitely resonates most overall. 
Personally I don't really believe type changes over the course of a person's life, but you might grow and change and become a more or less healthy/mature version of your type, which could make you appear to be something other than what you are. That's just my personal opinion on it though, other interpretations of MBTI are totally valid! "
2210,isfj,"Yeah, as we become more authentic with our self it seems our real personality shines through. I'm just not sure if there's more authenticity to come or if I'm at my final stop of the personality types! So far I'm really enjoying finding out that I'm an ISFJ (as of today) and appreciating the opportunity to communicate with others who identify themselves similarly. Now I have friends to commiserate with! :)"
2211,isfj,Thanks! I think I was answering the questions with an ideal in mind rather than being aware of who I really was. The description at work for ISFJ really seals the deal for me! Interested to find out more about myself as an ISFJ. Would love to learn more from everyone here about how they find this personality type accurate for themselves!
2212,isfj,"Oh, sure! I learned about them mostly via the mbti-notes tumblr blog, actually. Last I checked they seem to get a lot of the ""what types are ISFP compatible with??"" asks lol but they actually have a lot of interesting, well-researched articles if you look through their blog a bit. Even if you don't enjoy their take on the subject, you could probably find plenty of books to check into through them. "
2213,isfj,"is it weird that i frequent this subreddit but i hate that i fall into categories like these because it creates an illusion that i am a solid unchangeable person and not a constantly changing being that can be whatever i want to be as time goes by? and somehow falling into two categories upsets me because i now have two things that have identified me for a long time. and every few years i look up the personality profiles again and think ""shit. that's still me. in fact i've unintentionally leaned a little harder into these descriptions""."
2214,isfj,"What is it about the work description that makes it so accurate for you? Just curious!
For me, I think is the way I care for others and how I usually put others' needs before mine. It is something I am working on improving, to not overwhelm myself with responsabilities. I also think I have a good memory and like to retain all kind of details (about people, places, etc). I enjoy giving gifts based on the information I have of that person and I think I am pretty good at it. At work I am more comfortable when I have specific steps to follow or I have had the time to have a plan, I am not quite an improviser. I hate witnessing others people incompetence at work too. 
I am very aware of my sensory inputs, for example regarding intense lights or loud sounds,  being hungry or sleepy, I can get irritated easily if I am not comfortable. These are some things that come to my mind. "
2215,isfj,"I find it refreshing to finally find a type that explains where I'm at right now and so now I can be honest with myself about why I am where I am. I am close to 50/50 in 3 out of 4 categories, so I feel there are about 8 different types that can apply depending on where I am internally in that given moment. I also believe there is more to us beyond all this so we don't necessarily need to feel limited by any of it, only enhanced and guided about our strengths & areas that we can improve on."
2216,isfj,"Pretty much everything in Chp 4 on work of The True ISFJ kindle book by Truity! I can't stand incompetence/indifference from people I work with either. No patience for insincere or undedicated coworkers. Now I'm seeing why I struggle! Hate conflicts! Very much a perfectionist! I'm so happy there are others like me, I had given up on these personality types being accurate because I couldn't relate before."
2217,isfj,"Generally as ISFJs we're only super loyal and open with people we've come to really trust otherwise we can be softspoken or more conservative with how we present ourselves.
If you don't mind sharing, what's the general personality you share with loved ones vs acquaintances?
With various acquiantances I'm usually pretty quiet/softspoken but I'll speak up if I feel like my input is important enough or doesn't cross anything someone else has already said. I generally try to keep the peace and do what I can so no one dislikes me.
With people I'm super close to (which isn't that many) I act really silly and sarcastic. I'll more openly talk about my personal feelings about things and people that I wouldn't dare bring up to most people."
2218,isfj,"Around strangers: confident and assertive, organised, calm, reserved but friendly. I can start up a conversation with pretty much anyone, and people tell me it really seems like I have my shit together.
Around acquaintances/people I don't really know well yet but have to regularly spend time around: shy and anxious, either mostly silent or talking too much, watching everybody else almost warily. Apparently I give off a standoffish and overly intellectual air? 
Around casual friends: somewhere between 'strangers' and 'acquaintances', depending on the situation. The older the person is, I've found, the more comfortable I'll be around them; I'm twenty but I get on best with those over forty, and particularly well with those over seventy. 
Around immediate family and closest friends: goofy, enthusiastic and excitable, non-stop talking, paradoxically both meticulously organised and scatterbrained as hell, cynical and sarcastic at times. 
The one exception to all of this is when children or animals are involved. That's when I get goofy, enthusiastic, and friendly, regardless of the situation - people who know me joke that Dad mode comes to the fore.  "
2219,isfj,"I am constantly taken advantage of by friends, family, and work.
My biggest issue right now is with my parents who are going through a messy divorce. I have pleaded with them to communicate with each other but they always fall back to using me as a messenger. My therapist tells me to push back but it's like they know I will eventually give in, so they just keep asking me to do things because they know I'm a good kid and will do it.
With work, I am stuck on a project from hell and I am not even getting paid. I asked my dad (boss) to pay me but he says because I'm a contractor, and the client isn't paying his company, that's not how it works. We're doing work for free for this guy because we don't want to burn any bridges and if he's successful he might have more paid work for us down the line. But it's too stressful for me to work on a project that's always up in flames and having to do damage control.
Friends-wise I have one I'm very close to but it's so clear he's taking advantage of me and I'm in some crappy codependency loop where I wait for him to screw up on drug/alcohol binges then accept every apology he gives me.
This is more of a rant I guess. You know how we bottle up our emotions? I feel like I'm at that breaking point and want to run away from my life and cut off contact with everyone for my own sanity.
What strategies have you used to avoid getting into situations like these? Especially when you try to have a serious conversation (e.g. my parents) but it seems like the points you try to make are ignored because everyone is used to you giving in?"
2220,isfj,"Sometimes you do need to take time for yourself to reflect, so your decisions are not influenced by guilt or irrational emotions. If you know it's a unhealthy co-dependant friendship, or that you are clearly being taken advantage of you need to weight out the negatives and positives and cut ties for your own good if that is what you think is the best solution.
I find it hard to give up on people but sometimes you are just not healthy for each other. Only because you were compatible once doesn't mean this is the case now, people hold on to a state of permanency but it's not realistic.   
I know ISFJ are known for being altruistic, but sometimes you need to be selfish for your own sanity. We can't help everyone. Mindfulness has helped me deal with reflecting a lot.

2221,isfj,"I used to have this exact same problem, then I started taking DBT therapy, it's amazing for ISFJs. The Dear Man technique changed my fucking life, I seriously use it all the time. http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/html/ie_handout_8.html"
2222,isfj,"Wow, that's a lot to deal with at once. Rough deal. :(
Here's the thing: they don't keep asking you to do things because you are a good kid. They're asking you to do these things because they're bad parents.
You're working three jobs right now. One as a mediator for your parent's divorce, a service which can be valued as high as several hundred dollars per half-hour. The second is this contracting job, which you already realise is a scam. (And yes. If you are not getting paid, that is exactly what's happening.) 
The third, insidious job you have is the one keeping you trapped in the other two: the role of the ""good kid"". The value of what is lost performing this role cannot be measured in currency. 
You need to decide what you are worth. "
2223,isfj,"I just ended a relationship with an INTJ and I agree with the previous post - he was incredibly smart and was able to see the big picture and have great insight on almost everything in life. He always had ideas on how to improve our relationship and was adamant on making it work. 
What annoyed me though was the constant discussion about abstracts and theories, about everything in life including our relationship. We just did not understand each other and the constant discussions to try to improve our relationship were draining on me. I think there lacked a true connection due to our fundamentally different personalities. "
2224,isfj,"I'm an ENFP who just started dating an ISFJ. Our matching 'F's are clearly the saving grace in our relationship, and we are constantly meta-ing about our relationship and how to make it better. We both really appreciate each other's emotional vulnerability. 
The S/N difference is causing a lot of conflicts though. I find that I'm often frustrated when a theoretical conversation I'm trying to have is ""concretized"" by a personal anecdote that I feel doesn't do service to the 'point' of the conversation; I believe she feels like I am not appropriately giving credit to her life experiences. We're still trying to work through what to do about this, but because we're both strong F's, we talk through it a lot and it's lovely."
2225,isfj,"For a long time I tested INFJ, and it resonated with me. More recently I've repeatedly tested ISFJ, and it seems like maybe my personality has evolved. I've tried reading the differences and I'm getting lost in the details (is this my INFJ talking?), I truly feel it goes either way and it depends on the situation. 
How do I best figure out which I am? Are there key questions I can ask myself to determine my N/S type? I have a leadership training activity this week and it's going to focus on MBTI personality types. Any help is appreciated!"
2226,isfj,"I (21 Male) am yet to be in a relationship only because I’m waiting for the right girl in my everyday environment to pursue first. This obviously isn’t very productive since generally guys are the ones who initiate contact, be it at a bar or random settings, but I guess I’m not comfortable in a random pickups, for fear of rejection and since I need to warm a little to a person. As for when I do meet people I like I’ll be reserved a little at first but when I’m sure I really like them, then I would put EVERYTHING into it. (I am fully aware it would hurt more in this case to be rejected than if I asked them straight off, but it’s just the way i am I guess)  I think ISFJs are more one person at a time kind of people, where they plan to stay as life partners i.e. we are suckers in finding the one and we’re all potentially fucked "
2227,isfj,"i am satisfied with my current relationship.
i met a girl and i thought she was really cool. she said something that really clicked with me and that was why i noticed her. normally i observe people but few catch my attention enough to be attracted to or want to spend time with outside of just as friends or acquaintance. dating isn't the most important thing in my life. i have my goals (personal and financial), i have gym, i have boxing. but she won me over.
i got to know her and felt like she liked me too. so i asked her out. when we spend time together i talk about things that matter to me and she talks about things that matter to her. and i feel like over time we know each other really well and that feels good. so we started dating officially.
us easily understanding each other and feeling that kind of connection and belonging and safety with one another gives her an extremely important place in my life. i cut out a large space for her in my time and efforts. and i can't stop thinking about her.
i love her to much and i want to be there for her and help her with her goals and support her because i am happy when she is happy and i want the best for her, in whatever form her dreams/goals/idea of success may be. i want to nurture her and help her and grow old along side her. and all my actions regarding her fall along those reasons/direction. now she is part of my goals.
all she has to do, all that i want and need, is that she loves and cares about me.
that's how i see my relationship. 
the closest thing i have to a strategy is:
i understand that the initial puppy love wears out after 6 months to a year. and for a relationship to last we have to be also very close, loving, supportive, honest, open, exclusive best friends with benefits."
2228,isfj,"Let's say if you're not interested in even being friends with a girl, would you then put in effort to at least have small talk or be a gentleman to her? Can I assume that if an ISFJ male is being nice to me, he at least wants to be friends with me?"
2229,isfj,"Holy fuck. You're my perfect clone. Absolutely mind-blown.
Bro, how do you deal with the sadness? I sometimes fear I might never find that girl. I'd spent my whole life waiting and longing... for nothing. And the fact that one previous friend just royally fucked me up emotionally and psychologically doesn't help me form new relationships at all.
How do you cope with it? "
2230,isfj,"Do you and your girlfriend have the same hobbies or like to do the same things? I believe that being in a relationship also means having to share your lifestyle with another person and if those lifestyles don't mix well together it's pointless to even try being in a relationship. I've yet to find a girl who is similiar to me that I could get along with and at this point I think I'll probably never meet one. I'm glad you're happy, did you guys meet at the gym or something?"
2231,isfj,"Really productive strategy, makes the relationship last a lifetime (which is what all of us here want lol) Btw do you know your girlfriend’s personality type? I am interested in seeing what a fellow ISFJ compatibility is like in dating. "
2232,isfj,"Hmm... In my eyes not really. I like to think am generally just nice to everyone (and even nicer when they are friendly back) and give anyone some time of day to have a chat, but it doesn’t mean I want to be friends in particular especially if it’s just only small talk when we meet.  But if the conversations are really interesting and fun (I.e. we ‘click’ ) then I will really enjoy that persons company and would love to be friends."
2233,isfj,"Ah damn I am sorry that happened to you bro. Honestly, just strive to be the best version of yourself while you wait. Focusing on things like gym, work & close friendships for me keep me sane. Heck even listening to happy music seems to help. Even though I would love to be in a relationship right now, life has more to offer and I don’t want to count on a relationship to be the only thing that makes me happy as that would put way too much pressure on my partner (i.e clinginess which is somethings we ISFJs can do lol). 
So yeah focus on yourself for now, definitely take time to work out your emotional and psychological issues since that will likely hurt future relationships. I find talking to a close trusted friend helps and usually the weight of things drop. Otherwise a therapist could be a good ear? I’m also here too lol!"
2234,isfj,"we connected on our love of board games actually. specifically bluffing games. and we share a lot of life goals and approach those the same way.

2235,isfj,"I don’t feel like an ISFJ would even word things this way. “Getting”, “keeping”, and “strategy” sounds reminiscent of a game, not building a relationship with a human being. An ISFJ would be more likely to “find and win over” a girl."
2236,isfj,"I see, I'm an ISFJ myself and while I still make the effort to reply and be nice to people I'm completely uninterested in, I'd mostly just listen and not initiate further interaction on my part. I guess I shouldn't be generalizing his behavior based on just mine! Any tips on how to encourage more conversation though? He doesn't seem to understand when I try to engage in banter, and I'm pretty passive myself so his reactions to my banter are slightly discouraging. Maybe I should focus on getting to know him better and finding a common interest? Would it be too intimidating if my replies to his questions are too long? I tend to be somewhat naggy in my descriptions (as you can tell here...) and I don't know if that would help in continuing conversations?"
2237,isfj,Honestly I can only tell you be yourself. You could be naggy to one person but to another be really detailed (ISFJs have that trait when answering). Since he’s ISFJ he’s likely the kind that listens more than talks. It would be a good idea to take some interest in what he likes to find any common ground and go from there. 
2238,isfj,"""Wait a minute, this doesn't belong here!""
On the contrary, yes it does! I'm conducting an experiment to see if there is any correlation between the types and their handwritings. They say that handwriting is one of the keys to your personality since your brain controls your hand right?
Anyways, I would really appreciate some samples! Thanks! Don't forget to mention your type (if you are a person lurking on another type's sub of course!)"
2239,isfj,"Here is both me trying to write nicely and scribbled notes. I just found them around the room so it should be unbiased like I didn't write them just for this. For more reference I'm female, 23, and ISFJ."
2240,isfj,"I have a horrible physician-type handwriting (quite the opposite of ""typewriting-like""). I don't even dare to send you a sample   :-)
But I'm doubtlessly ISFJ (male, 40).
Will send you anyway if you insist"
2241,isfj,"Why do ISFJ's feel so justified in holding such contradictory views such as being compassionate, loving, and understanding AS LONG AS those receiving the benefits of your personality are ""deserving"" of it?
Do you not see the ways you are manipulative?  Masquerading compassion and understanding so that you can ultimately get something in return (usually relating to feeling needed, receiving validation, praise, attraction, etc)?
Why do ISFJ's allow themselves to be taken advantage of and then cry ""victim"" so easily?
Why do ISFJ's adopt delusional narratives about others and themselves so long as they get the approval, attention, and validation they desperately need but typically on a superficial level?
Why are you even attracted to ENTP's?  You like the misunderstood one, the quirky one, the one who needs to be included in the short term but in the long term the ISFJ can be surprisingly shallow.
Why are you so shallow, yet, so capable of depth?  How can you live with yourself?
Why do you take advantage of our openness and flexibility but then decry those traits to ""them"" when engaged in gossip?
Do you not see the value in how the ENTP's capacity to predict and anticipate events before they happen and how the ENTP in a big picture way kind of has the potential to save you from yourselves, save you from a shallow, robotic, meaningless life?
Do you not value the countless hours we sit by and listen to you tell us about all the little events of your day, the trivial conflicts you were presented with, and then have very little patience when we want to share with you something relating to a theory or a concept or a principle we learned during our day?
Why are you so intolerant of theories, principles, and abstract intellectual conversations if they don't lead to something immediately tangible and concrete?
Why are you so predictable?  Are you really oblivious to your predictability or is it a matter of willful ignorance?
Why are you so obsessed with the way a message is presented and makes you ""feel"" when the content is valid?  
Why are you so quick to shut down anything that resembles an ""argument"" when in reality we are just verbalizing ideas?
============
I've been married to my ISFJ for 13 years...we got married as 18 year olds and it's been quite a journey.  Things in our marriage were great when I was an MBA/Corporate Salesman and all that comes with it (Traditional gender roles, stable and consistent paycheck, beautiful home on the lake, social status).  When I left that world in search of intellectual and artistic meaning and pursued my Ph.D. in Neuroscience, she really struggled with that, but was ultimately supportive.  She struggles with the questions she gets from her patients (she's a dental hygienist - a PERFECTjob for the ISFJ) relating to ""so, what does your husband DO"" - she liked it when she could give a one sentence answer that was easily understood and placed in a box for others to relate to.  The conflicts of ambiguity have been very hard for her.  She has also had to be more of the provider for our family as I invest more time and resources into all that goes with student life.
The conflicts in our marriage have arisen when she started listening to ""them"" - the social norm police.  It seems that for SJ types, the transgressing gender roles and social norms are grounds for justified criticism, judgment, and even hatred.  She used to be the defender of my quirks, but now she's slowly joined with ""them"".  So I need to vent.
​"
2242,isfj,"All these traits you described are the stereotypical worst traits of an ISFJ, which is unfair. We could certainly make a list of those for ENTP as well....(insensitive, unaware, disorganized, argumentative). 
Sounds like you two just have an unhealthy relationship. I dated an ENTP for almost two years and I loved hearing him talk about crazy unsubstantiated ideas, theories, concepts about the world and beyond. In general I feel that ISFJs love to listen and love to see people in their element. So if we are chatting with someone we care about and they are passionately discussing something that matters to them (that we may not quite understand), we listen intently! Just don’t expect us to debate you back. 
In your case though it sounds like you two need to have a conversation about your differences and find a way to rectify them, or at least cut each other some slack when you disagree. Are the benefits you get from each other’s differences greater than the frustration? "
2243,isfj,"I can tell you that I don't identify with how you last describe your wife: I don't identify as someone who is changing to accept the criticism and judgement of others for differences. (Edit addition- And that is the last thing I think I would do. We are weirdos and those of us who accept and embrace that seem to be happier for it.) That seems to be your problem because I can see how the rest of it may be somewhat reasonable criticism of the personality type. If you don't think you can get somewhere constructive talking to your wife about it, then you should look into involving a third party, like a couple's counselor. "
2244,isfj,"

I think we tend to try to be fair, this one might be specific to your wife.


Again, I don't think we purposefully act in manipulative ways. I treat people how I want to be treated, so yes, I expect the same in return.


I think a lot of times we give and give without realizing how much of ourselves we've given away, and then we feel like we've been taken advantage of. It's one of the ways ISFJs self-handicap.


This one doesn't resonate for me either.


Being an ISFJ is often uncomfortable as we don't always feel like we fit in and spend a lot of time in our own heads. The energy and charisma of the ENTP can be really captivating.


We mold ourselves to what the situation demands. I think of it as cognitive flexibility, not shallowness.


I'm not your wife


Predictability is comfortable, ambiguity is terrifying. I would rather settle for what I know than risk everything I have for something that might be better.


I'm much more interested in what's real than what's theoretical. I want to relate to someone on a really real level, so I want to know what they do and think and love. I want concrete, not abstract.


Talking in the hypothetical or theoretical realm feels, to me, like putting distance between myself and the other person. I want to know who they really are.


Again, predictability is comfortable. I like a routine, I like to know what to expect, because I fear the unknown.


We take things personally; we are sensitive to a fault. Paralinguistic cues and body language are part of the message you're sending me. If I feel like you're frustrated or angry with me, regardless of the content of what you're saying, I'm likely to shut down.


See above. I'm highly likely to interpret an argument as a signal that you're unhappy with me.

"
2245,isfj,"You need to accept your isfj & all her quirks just as she accepts yours. She is grounded in reality, tradition & the past - the complete opposite of your type. Sensors have a hard time understanding/accepting intuition"
2246,isfj,"hmm...this is an eye opening post. 
Thank you for sharing all this, it gives me a lot to think about.
​
That sense of being ""turncoated"" on (unless you just outright feel betrayed) is one of the most painful experiences for an ENTP (and an INFJ).  
Why did she struggle with your choice to pursue your Ph.D?
​
There are so many questions that I would like to ask you (being a spouse) about ISFJs as a spouse. I know they aren't all ""the same"" but I am quite certain that the fabric of their minds are all cut from the same cloth.   
​"
2247,isfj,"Good post. I agree that these are many of my weaknesses that I am working on. I am definitely someone who isn't the healthiest of my type, mentally. However, for this:
I see our predictability as both a positive and a negative. I have an ENFP friend whose biggest weakness is her inconsistency. The reliability of an Si-dom is one of our strongest features. We work hard everyday towards our goals, and through sheer hard work do we eventually ensure that they are accomplished.
The negative is that we struggle to get out of our comfort zone. Isfjs purposefully stick to what we know because it is comfortable. In uncomfortable/unknown situations, our inferior Ne can run wild. 
I don't know much about the two of you, but it is what it is. I think, perhaps, you can learn a lot more from an ISFJ because our strengths are your weaknesses. Instead of just brushing her off as intellectually inferior and ""different"" I would suggest you try and understand her better (as you are doing by being here) and also little by little try to engage her in your world. It's actually strongly possible there's a lot going on in her head, but she feels intimidated because she respects your smarts so much. She probably fears getting into a discussion and making a fool of herself."
2248,isfj,"Given that the ISFJ makes up a significant majority of the population, I run into your types everywhere.  Don't tell me that many of the things I described don't apply in some way to you.  I know I should have buttered you up more and appealed to an emotion that gives you motivation to feel validated in some way, but I'm just too pissed off right now and am at that point where I just can't do that.  Not today."
2249,isfj,"It was unfair.  When things are healthy, the ISFJ/ENTP relationship is fantastic.  To answer your question, yes, the benefits of our differences are much greater than the frustration.  But like I said, the conflicts started to surface (after 9 years of bliss) when others started criticizing me and she felt like she was carrying more of the load and started to question me as a person.  When she's exposed to positive people, who ""get me"" and support marriage in general, there are no problems.  Can you relate?"
2250,isfj,"You are welcome.  Thank you, INFJ, for being an INFJ.  You are right, the experience of being ""Turncoated"" from someone who you have relied on for understanding and appreciation of your authenticity...to have them turn on you...it's just such a painful experience.  INFJ and ENTP are VERY loyal and idealistic in their serious commitments and to have a lover, spouse, friend, etc turn on us has to be the worst.  It makes me wonder how many people are capable of actually having TRUE friendships.  This is something the INFJ stands with me in facing that conflict.  
She struggled with my choice for the Ph.D. because it was right after our first child was born and I had a severe mental breakdown that put me in the hospital after I almost committed suicide.  The decision to leave the security and completely disintegrate my ego and identity and map of reality was so scary.  I didn't know if I could do it, or if I would lose everything in trying and the thought of being a parent and a dad was just so heavy.  So that took a lot out of her from the get go, but then it took a few years to even realize what I wanted to do.  Lots of trial and error.  Lots of sleeping on couches, staying in hotels, separation and travel.  We went from complete financial independence at the age of 27 to poverty.  It's been a lot to ask, but she has stayed by my side for the most part."
2251,isfj,"lol.. compassionate one.. you needed to vent and that is all I could offer.. :p reading all those questions and lines made me feel bad.. I really wish I could say something more but, I'm too young to say anything to a married couple. I really hope it's just a phase and will pass soon.. :) "
2252,isfj,"Oh gotcha.  Yeah, that's what I said in my OP....you have the capacity to be so deep, quirky, weird, understanding, tolerant....and that's what I CRAVE.  It's like...when the ISFJ regresses to the mainstream norms in their behavior and attitude, I want to just SCREAM!  Like...Come on! You are better than that!!  But I know when the ENTP gets too confrontational and argumentative the ISFJ likely feels like we are not being our best too and is inclined to want to snap us out of it."
2253,isfj,"Hi!
I am an ENFP and my best friend of 3 years who is also now my roommate is an ISFJ.
We have truly been through ups and downs and she is the most loyal person I have ever known and I couldn't ask for a better friend. But living with her is kind of maddening because we are COMPLETELY different. I am messy, she is neat. I'm laid back and don't really care about little details, and she is all about the little details. I am always looking for new ways to do things, she already has her mind made up most of the time. She is also very skeptical and reluctant to trust people (I don't know if that's just because she was raised that way, though), and I immediately put 100% trust into everyone.
It has honestly been kind of hard for me to live with someone so different from me, but it kind of just hit me that it is probably just as hard or actually probably more hard for her to live with me.
What have your experiences been with ISFJ/ENFP friendships, and have you found any good ways to work through the obvious differences other than just being passive aggressive like us?"
2254,isfj,"I have fantastic experiences with ENFP friendships. Generally all of my best friendships have been ENFPs. Although, I do admit to often having trouble keeping up with them. They're either all over a ton of friends which I can't grasp, or  they're very hyper personalities that runs circles around me.
However I've still found them to be the best people I can have long and thorough discussions with, and when they have their downtime and such they're the most amazing people to be around. I wouldn't trade my ENFP friends for anything."
2255,isfj,"I'm an ENFP dating an ISFJ. We have the same differences you and your roommate have. 
There are two times we get into fights:
(1) when I am telling her about a new idea I have and I feel like she ""isn't asking the right questions"", and
(2) when we're working on a project together and I feel like she ""isn't asking the right questions.""
Basically, in both situations, I see it as this big grand thing that deserves high-level analysis and thought, where she sees it as a lot of logistical steps that I super don't care about. So her questions aren't things like ""how will that change the state of the world?"" or ""how will people interact with this bench we're building within this space?"" It's questions like ""what time will you start the data collection?"" and ""how will those hinges work?"" 
When I'm not checking myself, that drives me CRAZY. Over the past year, though, I've been working harder to see that her asking questions that I'd never ask is an asset to me. It wouldn't be helpful if we saw things the same way. Someone on another forum said ""an ISFJ won't give you the ground-breaking insight you think you want, but they will be able to notice all the details that you are jumping right over. When you learn to let that help you, you'll be happier."" It was true!
We ended up talking about it really explicitly, and now she'll say things like ""hold on, I need to S around for a second"" and it reminds us that we're just different and it works out perfectly. :)"
2256,isfj,"Well, my best friend for 4 years and boyfriend for 1 was an ENFP. Him and I definitely had our differences. However, we definitely had a deep connection. I really do care about little details and such.. I am also reluctant to change or the moving of things around the house heh. So. Just be patient I suppose. You've gotta have communication, without it chaos will ensue.. I'm the same as her with having my mind made up the majority of the time. Just keep in mind that she's probably content with how things are a lot of the time. 
Sorry if I rambled. ENFP'S are lovely but sometimes I get overwhelmed by them."
2257,isfj,"I'm an ENFP, and my girlfriend of almost 3 years is an ISFJ.
Going into the relationship, we both just took our own pace for things, and worked everything out before it became an issue; Meaning we focus heavily on healthy communication.
I respect her ways of doing things, and she respects mine; At times we might cross eachothers boundaries, but we talk about it and fix it-- The only way to make things work (in any relationship) is for both people to want it to work, atleast in my experience."
2258,isfj,"So one of the biggest problems I've been facing all my life is a lack of motivation.  I like to jump into new things, but my motivation to follow through with it usually is lacking.  I am currently about to graduate with a degree in Computer Science and I've always wanted to learn new languages or delve into new areas (Android development as of now), but it's really hard for me to buckle down and devote the time to learn.  Maybe I'm trying to force myself to want to learn, I'm not sure.  Are any of you guys like this?  Any advice?"
2259,isfj,"For me, a lot of procrastination is:
1) seing a large project and getting overwhelmed with the sheer amount of time and not knowing where to start. Because we tend to be more comfortable with the details than the bigger abstract ideas, sometimes I find that once I brainstorm or break it down for myself I can start doing it.
2) Over the summer a coworker pointed out to me that I can be a perfectionist, which had never occurred to me. As far as my personal items go, I don't need order (i.e. my room) but as far as thoughts/processes go I definitely feel more comfortable. Because I can be a perfectionist, I find starting essays to be a big pain because I never feel like I am prepared or have enough information to do it justice. I then procrastinate and have to do it at the last minute due to time constraints. This paired with a subpar work ethic and it all goes to shit. However I do really like breaking large tasks into smaller pieces and creating outlines before writing my essays.
This was a little ramble-y but I hope it made sense/connected to what you were feeling."
2260,isfj,"I feel that way a lot.  One of the things that keeps me from getting excited about learning a new language (also computer science) or starting a new project is the scale of it and not knowing what to do first.  
For learning a language, I'll go online and look up tutorials.  This means someone else makes the decisions of what to learn and how to learn it.  
For projects, it's a little more difficult.  I'll try to brainstorm stuff that I can do (a process that takes far longer than it should) or I'll talk with people in the field, and ask them what good projects are.  I've only got a couple standalone things such as a tic tac toe game, or a simple sudoku solver.  Otherwise, I'll go back to my school projects and make them more robust."
2261,isfj,Wow! Yeah I really like the idea of looking up tutorials.  My buddy just messaged me to simply go onto stack overflow and simply ask for any good tutorials.  One thing I keep forgetting to do is utilize the large community that programming provides.  Do you think its associated with isfjs to not ask for help?
2262,isfj,"I don't know if it's a characteristic of isfj or if I am really proud, but yes, I find it hard to ask for help.  Lately, I'll trick myself to get help by not asking for help, but asking people for their thoughts or if they have any advice.  The buzzword ""help"" never comes up, but I'm getting tons of tips, advice, and thoughts."
2263,isfj,"Do any of you feel that sometimes you are passively listening to someone when they are telling you something important, even though you are usually an active and engaged listener? Is it because strong Si and our brains are just taking in so many things in that moment and can’t help getting distracted from what the other person is saying? 
I hate when I realize I’m doing this bc I’m usually so good at listening and remembering what people have said. Hate to have to ask them to repeat themselves later when I realize I wasn’t listening at all. "
2264,isfj,"I traced the origin of this for me, and I found that when I do that is because I am not doing a good job organizing my mind in a daily and constant basis, so everything becames a mess, a vicious cycle of disorganization. So the result is your mind working constantly trying to fix the mess. This gets in the way of paying attention in the informations to be collected, not only in a conversation, but also when you walk on the street and doesn't pay attention in your surroundings for example, becouse you are inside your head. So, what I try to do when I realize I am in this loop, is to try to relax, calm down my mind, breath, think ""everything is going to be ok, I trust myself"" and just do things normaly, trying stay away of these improductive thoughts."
2265,isfj,"I [27F] ENFJ met my so called bf [29M] ISFJ three weeks ago on Tinder, and we decided to date exclusively -his idea!
We both deleted Tinder app and decided to try to make things between us work!
Yesterday we were watching a video on his phone, and Tinder notifications popped up, he lied and said it is the phone problem and he does not know why the App still there, I asked him immediately to open the f***ing app, was 22:00, and found a conversation that started 21:00 while he was on my bed after a great movie night out, he was sending 'hi' everywhere to random girls!
I felt stupid to be in that situation! I felt hurt and I feel shit now! if someone could cry until die; I would be writing this from the grave!
What to do?
TL;DR; :
Do you think if I continue with him he will do it again? or it is just 'mistake' as he said frankly!
Do you think once a 'Tinder' user you would not quit and settle ? cause you know 'the sea is full of fish'!"
2266,isfj,"In my (potentially unpopular) opinion, Tinder is not even remotely the kind of place you should look for exclusive relationships.  This guy says he doesn't feel safe in a relationship unless he's having sex within 3 weeks which is just ridiculous.  Based on the little I've seen in this post, I think this guy just wants to get laid with minimal effort and only asked for exclusivity in the hopes it'd move him towards that goal.
I say dump him and Tinder if you're looking for something meaningful."
2267,isfj,"He lied and he isn't willing to be open with you. That's not something that can change right away. It is serious stuff rooted in who he is and what he sees in you. And it is clear he doesn't respect you or see you as someone worth being honest/direct with.
Let him go. He isn't interested and will only drag on juggling between not respecting you while wanting to find someone else and lying to you to avoid conflict.
Find someone better and better for you."
2268,isfj,"Either he feels you're going to break things off with him at some point, or he hasn't been open about how he feels about you. I suggest talking it out. As an ISFJ, if I feel safe in a conversation, I'm more willing to share thoughts I typically keep to myself."
2269,isfj,Tread lightly. Think about it this way: They thought you were going to break up with them. So what happens in 2 years from now when you guys have a fight and leave town? Sounds like he will seek a replacement. This relationship will result in heartache. Cut your losses now and find someone who won't hurt you later on down the road. 
2270,isfj,"Well, everyone is different, but ISFJ will want to show appreciation through intimacy whether sexual or not. For example, I love my ENFP friend, and she lets me randomly massage her (I think she just loves random affection), but had she turned it down the first time, I would have taken it as a sign of distance and wouldn't be as close as we are.
Now, will he do it again? Maybe, he is a guy and from the sound of it with a healthy libido. Again, everyone is different, and normally ISFJ are supposed to be committed. In my case, sometimes distance or hearing ""no"" translates to ""I don't need you"" or ""You did something wrong"" and I will take it on myself to give space or do what the other person won't do, in order to make the other person happy.
We're odd creatures."
2271,isfj,"Truth to be said, he felt so bad when I confront him about how that made me feel! He got a bad headache and I could tell from his face! he regret it! (the lie, the texting, the other girls! I do not know exactly) I do not think he meant to hurt me! he is a sensitive nice guy! 
I do not know why he felt bad? Cause I knew what he was hiding, or cause I called him out on his shit? or cause he knew he hurts me? 
I highly wish for that being the last reason! "
2272,isfj,I've recently become unemployed and I'm really hurting for a new job but most things in my area (NE Arkansas) is mostly factory work and I just can't do it. What type of jobs do you all work best for ISFJ type of people?
2273,isfj,"All of the above suggestions are suitable for an isfj but none of them are anything you can just jump into without some sort of degree or certificate. The real question is, what jobs are available near you that you would be interested in doing and if you're not yet qualified would they offer training?"
2274,isfj,"I'm a professional data nerd, which plays into the S/J quite strongly.
I've also done quite a bit of volunteer work with the local Humane Society, so that's been a great way to get out and do something helpful while avoiding some of the burnout factor of professional caretaking."
2275,isfj,"A rather old post so this may not be helpful, OP (I hope you've sorted something out?), but here's my comment all the same. 
Jobs I've done or still do:

stacked shelves - hell. on. earth. avoid at all costs.
worked tills - alright as I got to talk to a lot of people and it's pleasant enough, though can get rather boring after eight or so hours.
president/manager of a political group at uni - even worse than stacking shelves, do not recommend management roles at all. (Admittedly, a lot of that may have been related to not liking the people, the group, or the politics involved.) 
police officer - British, though, so I get the feeling we're a little gentler as a general rule and more into the talking than shooting :P Kidding aside, the culture in the police here is definitely different to that in the US, so this may not be relevant to you at all. My experience is that it's great for people who can follow rules, think fast on their feet, and who have good people skills and observational skills. The job is really 99% talking to people and listening to what they have to say. 
admin in a GP surgery - absolutely love this! A bit chaotic and always busy, but there's a good mix of jobs to do and I work with great people. 
first aid (for events, e.g. triathlons, festivals, etc) - also really enjoy this, although standing around waiting for somebody to be injured can be a bit dull and stressful. I like the quick-fire problem solving and the patient interaction and care, but I'm knackered after a long shift.

I'm planning on training as a teacher after I graduate. FWIW, I know a lot of ISFJ teachers and trainee teachers. "
2276,isfj,"Now the real question here is, what is your type? Your flair is ISFJ on the INTJ subreddit but here you say ENTP. I'd say since you seem to be a shit disturber (not hating, just observing), you're not ISFJ. Probably not INFP or INFJ either. I don't know enough to tell if you're introverted or extroverted but I'd guess you have high Ne and, based on what I've seen around the Internet, I'd guess you're either ENTP like your flair here OR INTP. For some reason I'm getting Ti/Te vibes from your post. Am I right or am I totally off?"
2277,isfj,You are correct! ENTP. https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/ayak3z/why_do_i_do_the_things_i_do/
2278,isfj,"​
​
Hello Reddit! Here is the 3rd installation into the MBTI podcast I've been experimenting with! Let me know what you all think and please share some honest feedback on how I can improve this series along with questions that we can explore for future episodes! Thank you all for your support :)
​"
2279,isfj,I know as ISFJs we have Fe and sometimes we need to vent to others to understand our emotions better. But I also like to write my feelings out when I’m alone. Both ways for me are helpful when it comes to processing my emotions. How about you guys do y’all like to write about your feelings 
2280,isfj,"Not at all, I kind of hate writing journals and I don't express my feelings clearly. Apart from the cringe it produces to read my own words, it makes me anxious to know my thoughts are physically written and someone could read them. So I prefer to go through my feelings mentally and ruminate them endlessly. "
2281,isfj,"Yes, in fact I vastly prefer writing to venting. I've journaled since I was a little kid. Not every day, just days when I feel like I need to. It helps me sort out my thoughts and sort of mentally ""file away"" feelings that are weighing on me. It clears my head, and I notice that on nights when I journal before bed, I sleep a lot better.
Often I will use journaling as sort of a filter. If something is bothering me, I will sit down and get it all out on paper. Then, if there are still pieces bothering me after I've written it down, I'll talk to someone about it."
2282,isfj,"Yes!! I started journaling regularly a couple months ago and it’s really been soooo helpful in figuring out what’s going on in my head. Even talking out loud can be too ephemeral, but having my feelings properly written down, on paper or digitally, is really really helpful in looking objectively at my own feelings and spotting negative thought processes and ways I make myself anxious. I never felt like I was “good” at journaling because my memory is shit, but just having that record of my stream of consciousness is really nice. "
2283,isfj,"I have always thought about it, but in the end, I could never bring myself to actually compose anything. I just feel that I cannot simply put what I'm feeling into words. I do talk to myself often, but it feels really different from writing. I guess I ramble a lot and that itself makes it hard to jot down anything. Or perhaps it could be due to me being unable to put my feelings into words. "
2284,isfj,"Yes, I have been writing out my feelings for as long as I could write. My journals start when I was about 5 years old.. and I wrote more and more as I got older. I still do as an adult. I need to put them somewhere, there are so many feelings."
2285,isfj,"I've tried it multiple times and each time I found that I would just journal my day rather than writing down my issues and concerns. Saying that, my friend is also an ISFJ and she swears by it. So I probably haven't helped at all! haha."
2286,isfj,"I do.. but I feel I cannot express myself much especially about emotions... I am feeling too much already, that I somehow cannot put them into words - when I do, it's short and simple, almost indirect, can never directly put it down on paper."
2287,isfj,"Yeah, I agree! Whenever I start a journal I just write down what happened that day but I can't get myself to write down any feelings or emotions. It turns out to be almost a bullet list of activities...ugh "
2288,isfj,"Hi! I'm designing a self-care app for FJ types in the Myers Briggs system.
I'm an INFJ myself, and I really care about doing this project right. If you could share your thoughts on this survey, I would appreciate it immensely: https://goo.gl/forms/witvsfsiwK7rsMJz1
Just fill in what you feel like answering. Everything is anonymous & I don't ask for any personal info. Any little bit helps. Thanks so much!!"
2289,isfj,"I know that self-care is something that's really important to a lot of INFJs, but I have to admit, I can't really relate to the questions on the survey. I have a feeling that the way INFJs relate to self-care is a Ni-Fe thing, and personally as an ISFJ, the way it's described in the survey is a little foreign to me.
While sometimes I do the things you listed... they are never for their own sake, and never primarily have myself in mind when I'm doing it. Honestly, my own self-care is about other people... someimes I'll write poetry because I have someone in mind, and something I want them to hear; sometimes I'll go for a walk, but only because that is one of the times I work out my faith, sometimes I'll read, but only because I'm searching for the answer that will make someone's life easier; free them from a burden they've been struggling with.
Most of the time, I find the idea of doing things for myself just to make myself feel better almost repulsive, and even though I totally understand that it's important for other types, for me it's absolutely heartbreaking.
When I'm feeling run down, what could I possibly do but talk to my colleagues about it and share in that feeling... build our relationship so that we can relate more strongly, and be better for it.
When I'm feeling like life has knocked me down, what could I possibly do but help those in my community, and tell them that I know how it feels to be totally bereft of hope, and be there for them just as they're there for me.
When I'm broken hearted, what can I do except share what I'm feeling with the lonely, and tell them that despite what has happened... I still have hope, and I know good things can come.
All my self care is about others, and I just can't bring myself to do anything that helps me, but doesn't help others or brings me in closer to them. I swear the day that I have a problem that can't help someone else... throw me in a ditch because I'm done.
So yeah... sorry, but the way the questions were asked... I just couldn't relate to it."
2290,isfj,"/u/reinventwisdom Hi there, thank you for this perspective. I appreciate it! Actually, doing self care in order to better serve others was a common theme on the surveys I received, so you're certainly not alone."
2291,isfj,"INxJs often will receive flashes from the subconscious especially when they zone out while taking in sensory data in the moment. What about you? I would suppose that for most ISFJs Ni (visions of the future/aha! moments) feels difficult to consciously use. For me it feels like infinite imagination, other times I will lay in bed awake not knowing why while someone I care for deeply would like help (coincidence?)."
2292,isfj,"I don't really have visions of my future. What I do have is confusion and anxiety about the future. I look at the classic landmarks of success/adulthood/rites of passage in our society and question if I am capable of achieving them, or even wanting them. When I think about the future I have this internal war between optimism and pessimism, where I think ""is it even morally right to seek a relationship and bring a child into a world with so much suffering?"" vs. ""if I act like a recluse and refuse to participate it's not helping the world become any better..."". I try to tell myself there's a middle path, but it's hard to find. Mostly when I think about the future, it's about how to simplify my life and pare it down to the most meaningful things, making goals and holding myself accountable. Sometimes I will daydream about a future where AI solves all our problems and humans don't have to work any more than they choose, so they are free to fill the future with anything that brings them joy instead of being driven by survival needs and status symbols."
2293,isfj,"I agree with this. Whenever I envision my future, I don't usually have a perfect paradise or life. It's usually about how hard it's gonna be and how much i feel the pressure and responsibility. Like, owning a child, job, being responsible for another life... It's a lot and I stress myself out with it. "
2294,isfj,"Am I you. This is exactly why I don't want to have kids but as a woman, especially in North America where birth rates are decreasing, there's so much pressure to have them. I don't even have my own shit together yet. I like to daydream about AI as well but I might've seen too many Terminator movies. Most of the time I think about society working together to defeat them."
2295,isfj,"I'm sure my dating life would be fine, if I could actually find somebody to date.
I've noticed that when I'm in public and a guy actually starts looking me over or giving me attention, I freeze up and get all awkward, and I tend to act like he isn't even there. Which obviously isn't very welcoming behavior or body language, so it doesn't tend to get me very far."
2296,isfj,"I have had issues meeting people. My first two bfs I met online thru mutually playing games together. Third I met irl at a party but after that initial meeting we did a lot of flirting/talking on facebook and on league before meeting up in person again. I find I am very awkward when first meeting people (in person) but if I am able to get to know someone online then I am more comfortable hanging out with them in-person afterwards.
As to how you are too quiet and cold, I think that I can come off this way as well. Especially if I am in a large group who is all chatting and I'm too uncomfortable to say something. So I just kind of sit and listen to everyone else talk, but later on everyone might be thinking ""woah Gretay never said a single word... Wonder if she was in a bad mood... blah blah"" instead of just realizing that I was just sitting and listening comfortably. I might have a resting-bitch face as well. People just don't know the sweetheart I am on the inside!!!! :p
In addition to these relationships, I also had a lot of FWBs and a few ONS during college. I think ISFJs are usually considered to be less ummm promiscuous but I had some bad experiences with sex and I also didn't have many friends in college so I used sex as a way to feel the touch of another person and just feel needed for a while."
2297,isfj,"I have an INTJ best friend whose logic determines his emotions, and thus, at age 24, he has never dated anyone. 
For him, it has not yet been practical, and he refuses to lead someone romantically if there are too many impractical reasons to do so. "
2298,isfj,"I make a great friend I guess. Girls I like generally don't want to date me but want to be friends that hangout all the time platonically. Which i'm OK with since they're cool people. But it makes me feel like something is wrong with me that makes me undatable.
The only girl I liked that was attracted to me as well was in an open relationship and then it became exclusive due to them getting an sti and not wanting to spread it."
2299,isfj,"I've never been on a date. I got a lot of dating apps (Tinder, POF, Zoosk, Match and OKCupid). I've matched with some girls but I'm always afraid to send them a message. I wouldn't have the balls to go up to a girl in public that I might have in interest in either."
2300,isfj,"I've just finished reading Helen Fisher's book ""Why Him, Why Her?"".
My question is, are you a Builder/Negociator or a Negociator/Builder?
It's a fascinating book and she explains the type of person we gravitate towards.
I'm an ENTP, Director/Explorer in her personality quiz. She says that the best matches are the following:
Explorer-Explorer
Builder-Builder
Director-Negociator
I noticed many ISFJ's on this forum saying that they gravitate towards ENTP personality type. Are you a Negociator or a Builder? Are we a good match?
Take this quiz:
https://theanatomyoflove.com/relationship-quizzes/helen-fishers-personality-test/personality-test-1/"
2301,isfj,"NEGOTIATORS are philosophers. These women (and men) express traits linked with the estrogen system in the brain. These people see the big picture. They are imaginative and intuitive. They have superb language and people skills. They are also emotionally expressive, as well as agreeable, trusting and compassionate. Negotiators seek someone with whom they can make an intensely intimate, deeply meaningful, inspiring and spiritual connection. But Negotiators, like Directors, prefer to go out with one person at a time and to explore the depths of this potential partnership. They dislike wasting time on irrelevant, trivial or boring socializing. When they find “The One,” Negotiators are superb at generating and maintaining intimacy with this partner. They avoid conflicts with a mate, and make major personal adjustments to strengthen this cherished bond. They give thoughtful gifts, such as a treasured book or photograph. They share their most personal feelings. And they want their partner to share his or her feelings too.
Negotiators are often attracted to their opposite, Directors.

Pretty interesting quiz. "
2306,isfj,"Why don't you take the test? That would be interesting. I'm also skeptical that ISFJ personality type would be attracted to us. We like to talk more abstract, we have a philosophical outlook and we certainly like to change the environment. That would not sound good to an SJ."
2307,isfj,"Very interesting. Fisher's theory is based on MBTI (more exactly on David Keirsey's book on Types, a great book also). Are you sure you're not an INFJ? Because SJ's are the equivalent of builders (NT-Director, SJ-Builder, NF-Negociator, SP or ***P-Explorer).
Go on HumanMetrics.com, it's one of the best MBTI tests out there.
To be honest, the best girls I've got along so far were NF's (Negociators). I have an ISFJ girl in my class who was a crush on me and I was just thinking how well we would go along. I've had some awkard conversations (she was very nervous), and some good ones. I don't think I have many experiences with ISFJ's, so I can't conclude anything (not that ENTP like to stick to one point of view anyway lol).
I think one of the reasons I got along very well with NF's is the same reason I got along very well with iNtuitors: they're high on Openness to Experience (a personality dimension that gives curiosity and makes you derive pleasure from philosophy and knowledge in general)."
2308,isfj,"I'm an Isfj and I feel like I have a deeper thought process than what my personality ""calls for"". I love feeling like I figured out something most people don't pay attention to. I'm not sure if it's what I want to think or if it's actually true, yet I find myself looking for friends who can talk about in-depth things with me and looking for music that lyrically has a lot of hidden meanings and depth. I also really enjoy writing poetry, which is strange because I hate being creative and writing in any other form. I feel like I can express myself through poetry and I try to make it very symbolic and vague, so that of it is ever read, only people with depth would be able to analyze what it means to me. Most of the friends and family that I'm very close to are intuitive thinkers, so maybe they taught me to think in this way. Maybe my definition of in depth thinking is inaccurate. I'm just wondering if any fellow ISFJs can relate to this at all."
2309,isfj,"YESSS! I can so relate! It's almost like your drawn to intuitive people because of how interesting they are. I think it does have to do with the intuitive people around us, and how we have been brought up. I have always had a thing for poetry, but I am lacking in imagination, so instead I prefer reading poetry. Anyway, I think everybody tries to appear deep in some sense, but it doesn't necessarily make you any smarter than the norm. Personality only plays a part in intelligence, the rest is up to your environment, background, childhood, etc, and pushing yourself. 
Anyway, do you find Sensor people boring now? I got to a stage where I felt like I was changing from a sensor to an intuitive, always looking for a deeper meaning in everything, and I tried to talk to other Sensor's about deep things, but they never really seemed interested, so I ended up preferring to hang out with Intuitives, and taking on their way of thinking. As ISFJ's, it seems to me to be us trying to develop our inferior Ne"
2310,isfj,"i like dissecting things if that counts. doesn't really make me feel like i have depth or anything though. i just like digging for meaning in movies and poems and art, it helps me understand how other people think or how other people communicate. plus i find it interesting how there are so many ways to express things and how there are so many ways to understand things.
when i write poetry, i try to find ways to accurately express my emotions through vagueness? or in a way without having to detail every thought? so people can feel what i'm expressing even though they think differently than i do, even though they lived completely different lives and have completely different experiences than me. so, i'm trying to be more accurate to a wider audience. which is guess might be different than your trying to appeal specifically to those with depth, but i feel like there is a similarity in how we're trying to...do things. maybe they stem from a similar interest in expression and analyisis but differ in how we view other people?"
2311,isfj,"My sister is a sensor and I am always trying to share my thoughts and things that blow my mind with her, and she just says it hurts her head. Most of my friends are intuitive so she is really the only one who i think is ""boring"". Yet she can talk all day about what happened at work. Drives me crazy. 
I dated an INFJ for a very long time, and I absolutely loved the way he thought. I feel like he changed the way I think for the better and made me appreciate intuitive people that much more. "
2312,isfj,"Digging for meanings, I think that's exactly what I've been trying to say. I grew up with a father who took everything and made it into a discussion or a debate. I was the only one who gave it back to him. 
I started thinking that going ""in depth"" was an attractive character trait, making you smarter than everyone else. As if deep thinkers are in a higher class than the rest of the ""shallow"" thinkers.
But all I REALLY am doing is digging for meaning, like you said. It's just analyzation. "
2313,isfj,"Yea my sister is an intuitive, so it's kinda the opposite for me. I think that she finds me boring, and I try really hard to be deep and I actually do find an interest in intuitive people, and what they have to say, like it's a nice break from hanging around sensors all the time. I just don't think I have anything to offer intuitives, it's more what I can learn from them. Haha yes, my sister often tells me how sensors drive her crazy too. 😉 And INFJ's are definitely eye openers to seeing life from a different perspective.. So would you consider yourself an intuitive?"
2314,isfj,"I relate so well to the ISFJ personality so I wouldn't consider myself intuitive. I would say I'm just fascinated with it, and almost wish I was intuitive. But I also like where I'm at now so I'll just consider myself an intuitive leaning ISFJ. Whether that's just how I wish I thought or how I am learning to think. "
2315,isfj,"Yes it's funny how some sensor types are more fascinated by MBTI more than others. I am in the ""intuitive learning"" development stage as an ISFJ too, I believe. I feel like it's because we are more self-aware than other ISFJ's or sensors maybe, and that could be due to the intuitive people that we associate with. "
2316,isfj,"Aka our extroverted counterparts.
Surprisingly despite how common these types supposedly are I don't have much experience with them.
That said I feel like they could be good friends and partners since we essentially have an understanding of how the other works, one's just more reserved than the other."
2317,isfj,"I've been dating an ESFJ for a year.
Prior to him, I didn't have very many positive experiences with ESFJs.
The ones I knew where very emotionally immature, bossy and spoiled.
My ESFJ is lovely, though.
He's extremely kind, he's funny and goofy, and he brings me out of my shell a lot.
He's always trying to take care of me, which is oddly pleasant, as I'm usually the one trying to take care of everybody else and not receiving much reciprocation.
He shares a lot of the same values as me, and we're very similar in a lot of ways. He makes me laugh harder than anybody else can, and he brings out my silly side, which is pretty rare.
I feel very very comfortable around him, and our communication is great.
He's pretty sensitive and gentle when it comes to my feelings, so for the most part, it's rare that he ever hurts my feelings. However, if he does, he notices immediately, and wants to talk about it. He's very good at communicating about emotions, whereas it's a bit of a struggle for me, so it's been really helpful for me to have someone who's naturally open with their feelings, and able to listen patiently while I try to share mine.
He's very observant, sometimes to the point where it makes me uncomfortable. He's acutely aware of my emotional state, even if I may want to hide it. I'm oversensitive, and sometimes if I get offended, it's better for me to slap a smile on my face until I can be alone to process my feelings. He's the only person that doesn't fly with, because he notices immediately if I'm upset, whereas with most people, they can't tell.
Overall, he's an incredibly warm, kind person, and he has a wonderful sense of humor. I can relate to him easily, and he honestly brings out the best in me. He's one of the few people I feel almost entirely comfortable being myself around, and I'm ashamed that I thought poorly of ESFJs before I met him."
2318,isfj,"My best friend's an ESFJ. We just... understand each other. We think the same way, have the same opinions, same mindsets, same morals, same values, same politics... And he's frequently told me I'm the only person he can completely trust. Ditto for him; we find it easy to just be ourselves together and understand each other's thinking."
2319,isfj,"My best friend used to be ESFJ. We used to get along really well, almost like we were the same person. But, then we had [several] fights and are longer friends even though we are still civil to each other if we happen to see each other in public. "
2320,isfj,"My best friend is an ESFJ! We understand each other a lot and I think she is the kindest person I have ever met! I just love her! Moreover my very good male friend that I have always been seeing as a great person turned out to be ESFJ. My grandmother is one too and I enjoy spending time with her. I also have a great contact with two ISFJs that I adore as they are the cutest at times!
According to me these two types are very likely to be good friends, as the level of understanding is huge between them -"
2321,isfj,"I guess for me, I find that just generally being in her presence usually helps if I'm feeling down or anxious.  I might try to talk at some point, but usually not until I've had time to process my feelings and figure out why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling.  Until then, cuddling up quietly on the couch and watching tv or reading is usually a good start.  I hope this helps!"
2322,isfj,"I've been with my SO (an INTP) for nearly 3 years. I often get anxious when faced with uncertainty, but he's a great listener and he always offers a new perspective whenever I feel overwhelmed. He'll even help me think of new plans, and he contributes when he can (ex: he helped me with some coding for my thesis when I ran into problems). He also knows when to make me take a breather from work, so we'd often go out to eat or watch an episode of one of our shows. Even just making me laugh helps a lot.
Now that we're long distance he can't do much in terms of doing activities together, but I think the most important thing that he's done for me has been giving me the peace of mind to know that I don't have to do everything on my own.
Hope this helps!"
2323,isfj,"Honestly, the best thing he does is just give me lots of hugs and let me vent/talk/cry it out. 
Once I'm feeling a tiny bit better (or when I'm a snotty, tearful mess), he starts cracking dumb jokes, and that always works. He can make me laugh even when I feel awful."
2324,isfj,"Rubs my back, asks me about how I am doing while giving me the space to talk and emote, offers to do household chores for me that I am anxious about (I do all the emotional labor in our household), allows me to be lazy, maybe gives me some space to relax and do something I enjoy. For me that would be watching TV/movies while crafting (needlepoint, embroidery, etc.). Of course my SO rarely does these things when I am in a bad mood because he is often also in a bad mood (INTP). ;) Just wishful thinking! "
2325,isfj,"So many SOs here are INTPs! My husband tested as one too, even though he seems to me to be the more ambiverted ENTP type :) Still, I think that is really interesting.
I had a bad day today. He brought me ice cream (also I'm pregnant with cravings) and cuddled me as we watched a movie. He's funny as heck, a large reason why I married him. Cuddles, humor, helping me see the other side of things, and ice cream are the ingredients of best hubby and a bad day turned good :) "
2326,isfj,"Generally sit next to me and listen. Maybe hold my hand and rub/stroke it. Her being an INTP makes understanding feelings difficult for her. She would rather solve the problem, which I get. It's just not very calming, and she's really good about that. Sometimes it's good to get a grounded perspective, too. I think being there for me is largely that. 
Coddling me doesn't make me feel any better. It makes me feel like the person doing the coddling is either feeling guilty or condescending. In either case, the comfort they are attempting is insincere. Being sincere is big for me. I'm so glad I have that with her."
2327,isfj,"I have a tendency to bottle up negative feelings because i feel guilty for sharing them, but my ESTJ has been encouraging me to open up about them more. When I'm feeling down over something unreasonable (worrying about what other people think, being scared to change jobs, etc) he helps me work through the anxiety by talking through it.
If it's just a bad moodswing or if that doesn't work, he just holds me and listens.
Depending on my mood he'll hug me until I feel better or he'll encourage me to go on a walk or drive with him, or even just to go home, take a bath, and curl up in bed. Idk how he picks up on what I need so quickly, but he always seems to know how to help and I'm honestly lucky to have him. He's amazing."
2328,isfj,"My partner (INFJ) is wonderful about actively listening to me as I work through my problem/day out loud, if I am worked up or feeling frustrated. More often than not, I am able to coach myself through hard times that way, and reach a good resolution/conclusion basically by myself, but it means to world to me that he is willing to be a sounding board. He is also always willing to give his honest take on the issue, so I know he isn’t coddling me, but treating me and the situation with respect, which is also crucial. 
If I’m feeling particularly depressed, his Ni picks up on it, will ask me what I need, and always respects my answer. If I need quiet, time to myself, a walk, his help with chores, whatever. He is always game to give me the kind of space or time that I want/need. 
Sometimes he picks up on my down feelings a little too much, that it actually affects how he is feeling (that INFJ sponge...). Sometimes that ends up working in our favor, though, because I am able to provide some nurturing/caregiving that makes me feel so useful and needed, which in turn can take me out of my own head and make me feel productive and helpful. =)"
2329,isfj,"If I’m up for chatting, they will let me vent. Comfort and reassure me, but also help me to move on from the issue/take my mind off from it. 
Support me in whatever I feel like doing to get my mind off things but might not have the motivation to do (ie go workout with me). 
Snuggle me, kiss me, generally give me love and affection (I swear this is a cure for all things. It’s like a safety/happy blanket). Give me a massage. 
Make me laugh, help me to relax and chill out. 
Tell me I am wonderful, appreciated and loved. "
2330,isfj,"We are similar in a lot of ways. We can enjoy doing activities together.  
But, we hate rules, while you guys love them. We don't care about feelings, and it's all that you care about. So, talks can be boring unless it's about something to do. "
2331,isfj,"I'm an ISTP(f) and my crush is an ISFJ(m).
I'm a ""go with the flow"" kind of person and I hang out with different sets of friends and he is more of the serious perfectionist type. Sometimes, his friends tease him as ""boring"" and ""not fun"". I don't think he is boring, he just takes a lot of things personally. 
We are pretty similar in terms of principles, some of our characteristics, etc. but we are actually awkward if we are left alone together."
2332,isfj,"I (ENFP) haven't really ever had problems with my mom. Growing up, she was always emotionally supportive of all of her kids, she never pressured us to try anything, she always knew how we felt, and she always knew what to say. Basically you could insert any cliched good-mom adjective and she was that. Since starting college, though, I can't stand to be around her. Anytime I get into a conversation with her, even about the most casual of topics, the way she communicates completely stifles any sort prior excitement I had about talking about it. She just sort of sucks the energy right out of me. It's exhausting.
So here's some backstory: growing up, she would often say that she felt her one true purpose on Earth was to be a mom. She's also a nurse, and to add to that, we always had a ridiculous assortment of pets at my house (e.g. dogs, cats, horses, birds, rats, hamsters, ferrets, skunks... the list goes on). Basically, she's an ISFJ caregiver at heart.
Here's the catch:
Throughout her life, she's had a string of bad relationships. My alcoholic dad cheated on her twice until she left him, she started dating another alcoholic (who actually treated her alright, but hated my older sister) and shortly broke up with him. Since 2011, she's been in a relationship with arguably the worst of the worst: a controlling, suicidal alcoholic who is fifteen years younger than her. Their relationship has been absolutely toxic; he has threatened to kill himself multiple times if she leaves him and he even put a tracker in her phone without her knowing so that he could see everything she did/everywhere she went. Totally insane, I know.
Anyway, all us kids hate him. He's unintelligent, fake, and just outright awful. But she's stayed with him because of her insecure attachments, low self-esteem, and fear of loneliness. It's truly a bummer. She deserves so much better.
Anyway, after my twin brother (also ENFP) and I left for college, she officially turned into an empty-nester. I think this must have been traumatic for her because she sort of went off the deep end a little bit. She stopped calling us, was super emotional and vulnerable anytime we tried to talk, and was overtly resentful of us for not ""appreciating her"".
Subsequently, I've started resenting her, too. It's not really anything I can help her with, either; I feel like she just doesn't understand me anymore. For example, I'll bring up a topic (say, open relationships) and I'll try to spark up an interesting conversation with her about it. What inevitably ends up happening, though, is that she assumes that I'm in an open relationship and then freaks out and questions my sense of morality and her own parenting. It's so frustrating. Literally, one time I told her I was OK with smoking weed, and she cried. And I never know what to do in those instances.
It goes deeper than this, too. What sparked this post was our conversation about sex (we're pretty open about that stuff) and she just went off about how my dad cheated on her and how he messed her up permanently, etc. This sort of self-victimizing behavior happens ALL the time, and once it starts, it just sort of spirals out of control. She'll stop listening to any logical input I have about the situation and quickly assume everything I tell her stems from the self-imposed belief that everyone thinks she's worthless and nobody cares about her. Even when I'll literally say, ""We all love you, nobody thinks that, you're being unfair to yourself,"" she'll interpret that as me saying ""you're crazy and delusional.""
Basically I need some help in how to communicate so that she'll feel validated. She won't listen to anything I say, she won't go to therapy (even when we've talked about how transformative it can be), and she spins anything my siblings and I say into this negative, self-deprecating idea of herself. All of us siblings are super open with each other, emotionally stable and intelligent, and get along great. We love open discussions about a bunch of different topics (all N's) and we have the same sense of humor. And we all have talked about how our mom has gotten to the point that we can't even have a normal conversation with her without being on our toes the entire time.
I just want to be able to have uninhibited conversations with my mom again, so if anyone could offer some advice or even just some reassuring words, that'd be great.
tl;dr: My ISFJ mom goes on shame spirals when I talk to her and I need help validating her while simultaneously feeling like I'm authentically communicating my ideas to her."
2333,isfj,"Honestly, this doesn't sound like an ISFJ specific problem, but more of a depression/self-esteem type of problem.
If she won't go to therapy, I'd advise you to tell her about a tool I've found useful when I'm low on self-esteem or being self-depreciating: Write the negative thoughts. Write out contradictions to these thoughts. (example: I'm a bad mom because my son is okay with smoking weed/I've done the best I can and my son makes his own choices etc. etc.) 
It's hard to force yourself to do but very worth it."
2334,isfj,"My ISFJ mom is also prone to assuming the worst of everything (which might include everyone). That said; my ISFJ partner is not like that at all.
A little cough? Disastrous. Daughter had too much to drink? It's the end of the world. Menopausal? All her daughters fucking hate her. Said ""fuck!"" about something? Her daughter is rude as hell and will be swallowed alive in the working world, haha.
I think A LOT of patience and validation will be good for both you and her. Don't argue with her. Let her vent. Let her nag. She's a great mom isn't she? Doing this for her should be nothing compared to what she's done for you, EVER. Thankfully, I'm good at this. 
However, there was once where she pushed and pushed my boundaries and had tantrum after tantrum. She could not stand up to my (narcissistic) Sister and was projecting all her anger on me. I was tired of being thrown around and I yelled at her to stop it and get a grip. She was extremely hurt, but she got the message.
Would I do it again? Never. I hate hurting her. That was a very rare exception because she was so so SO blind with anger and really hurting me, her main form of emotional support.
ISFJs are very very delicate people. The fact that she treats you this way is good, because at least she is sharing and opening up. You should REALLY be worried when she clams up.
Conclusion: be endlessly supportive and validating. Do not ever dismiss, belittle, hurt her — a shock is not warranted unless she is acting completely out of character and being self and other-destructive."
2335,isfj,"Have you actually told her how you feel? In words? I obviously don't know your mom, but as a fellow ISFJ I generally pick up on how those around me feel, especially if they're lying or being insincere. I can't always figure out why, but I notice it. It would kill me to know my behavior was making those I cared about crazy. If you tell her I bet she'll be motivated to make a change. Best of luck to you both. "
2336,isfj,"I'm not sure how useful this'll actually be, but one thing that stuck out to me is her feeling unappreciated. I know you tell her you love her, but do you go out of your way to make sure she knows that you appreciate the things that she does for you? Not to say that the changes in her behavior/your relationship are your responsibility at all, but if you're looking for ways to boost her self-esteem/open lines of communication a bit, that might be a good place to start. It doesn't have to be over the top, just make sure you're sincerely saying thank you for any little thing she might do for you, or thank her for something she did in your childhood, that kind of thing. My mother and I are both ISFJs and we're best friends, and that's one of the things that I'm always conscious to be doing and which I think has helped our relationship a lot. My (probably INTJ) brother rarely says thank you for things and often talks down to her/rejects her input, and their relationship is a lot more strained, so I do think it's something that's genuinely very important to ISFJs because we're so service-oriented a lot of the time. 
That being said, it sounds like her latest relationship is a hugely toxic influence on her life, so that may be effecting her more than you know. People who are in abusive relationships can get very defensive and take those stresses out on other people in their life, so that may be part of what you're experiencing (and she is in an emotionally abusive relationship, just to be clear). "
2337,isfj,"It's definitely a depression/self-esteem issue, but I wanted to get some feedback when considered through the lens of MBTI. Mental illness manifests in different ways for each personality type, so I thought you guys might have some interesting insights.
And that's a good idea, I'll talk to her about it. She used to journal when she was younger, but she doesn't really do it all that much anymore."
2338,isfj,"For me, I don't really notice I'm being self-depreciating. It takes a huge amount of effort for me to go ""Wait, no. That's not the reality."" 
Or I cloud it in humor, but it doesn't sound like she's doing that."
2339,isfj,"My ISFJ mother does the shame spiral thing too. She also told me multiple times growing up that her main desire in life was to be a mom. I'm in counseling, and the very fact that I've been in it for over a year makes her feel like she did something wrong. 
She and I have definitely had issues communicating, but I'm seeing it has much less to do with me than with her, and possibly her relationship w my dad. I think her shame is exacerbated by his reactions to certain things she says, e.g., responding to her ideas and input in a way that makes her feel bad, which is, of course, fueled by his own unresolved issues.
But I think my point here (lol) was supposed to be that I wouldn't try to get into anything deep with her. There's not really anything you can do, because it's not about you. As somebody else said, her husband's interactions with her probably have a lot to do with it, and as long as their relationship stays the same, she will continue to act this way. And the reason I responded to this reply of yours is because I liked the advice in the comment above.
(But also, I wonder if validation of her feelings and worries could help. ""I can see why you would feel that way, it feels bad to... such and such."" And then, at some point, if it feels like the right time, say your piece about why everything might not be all bad. My own ISFJ experience has been that validation of my bad feelings helps IMMENSELY. When my counselor ""joins"" me in my feelings and/or shame, then I don't feel like my feelings are crazy or pathetic (even when they are pretty silly :). And (this is the most amazing thing) I then feel stronger and more equipped to change my own patterns of thinking, because I feel like somebody is on my side.) "
2340,isfj,"If you're familiar enough with the functions, then there's a pretty good way of knowing - I've never had either one of my parents take the test, but I recognize inferior Fe and aux Se in my dad, leading me to type him as an ISTP.  As for my mother, still thinking INFx for her, simply based on the types I've ruled out and what I know about MBTI. "
2341,isfj,"My dad is an ESTP, my mom an ESTJ. You can see how they would be frustrated with an extremely introverted and emotional daughter lol. 
​
Edit: I just changed my flair because I just realized I'm actually an INFP. I will always have ISFJ close to my heart though."
2342,isfj,"A lot of ways, but it still sucks. Your mind will get you stuck in loops of dumb logic. You will have less compassion for emotional leeches. You may think it was the best time ever and fantasize the heck out of her good qualities (throw in a lotto win for extra drama, it may not seem out of place.) Other times you may feel weak for not breaking sooner or for being so affected.
Write a list of why she wasn't good for you. 
Write another list of your deal breakers for anyone. 
Take time to do things you like to do. Take it easy, binge on tv, workout... find a new balanced day. You are investing in yourself.  What would you advise your best friend to do? You're worth it, dude. Your world needs you."
2343,isfj,Keep yourself from still obsessing over them and block them on social media - not for their sake but yours. I know it's easy at least for me to get stuck in a loop and feel tempted to see what they're up to. I've found though that completely cutting yourself off from seeing anything in their life helps me forget about them more quickly and move on. I took a week to completely mope when my boyfriend broke up with me. When I felt like crying I went into a bathroom and cried and then picked myself up and went back to work. You can get through this! Let me know if you need anything or just someone to talk to
2344,isfj,"I had to cut someone out of my life in December, and I still struggle with it. I think what's helped the most is when I've felt the worst, I gave myself permission to put my needs first. If you're like me, you tend to put others' needs ahead of your own, sometimes to your detriment. Take a break from taking care of people other than you. Spend a night doing whatever makes you happy. Or, hell, a week!"
2345,isfj,"everything everyone said here is gold. this isn't super direct advice, it's kind of like a side bit.
focus on something for yourself for a while. for me and a bunch of my friends, it was working out. it doesn't need to be exercise, it can be any hobby really, but it's what we do. 1st big heartbreak? you gotta work out buddy and you get a work out buddy. 
1) I/we do this to kind of force the friend to hang out with us to they don't spiral in their sadness.
2) they now have an activity to do that they can focus on. giving them breaks to their sad times
3) the activity comes with both long term and short term goals that are achievable. that stuff sticks with you, you can obsess about them outside of the gym especially like counting protein and cutting calories or carbs.
4) hitting goals feels good and exercise releases happy hormones.
it's all about finding new outlets for happiness and hope. friends, goals, self improvement instead of that one person. doesn't have to be working out it's just gotta be something that you can dedicate yourself to for a while with friends and hit goals or achievements."
2346,isfj,"Thanks so much for your words. I feel solace in knowing that I can find comfort and advice from fellow ISFJs. My ex is an INTP and we dealt with the breakup so differently, I just felt so hurt. But thats the life of an ISFJ being with an INTP I hear, while both parties have a lot to learn about life and themselves because of each other, in the end its far too tough to get over the core differences they have. "
2347,isfj,"Thats exactly how I feel, like no matter what I can't get over my obsession with them. For the first 2 weeks we still had each other on all social media, and all of our pics up still. And wow, that made it impossible for me to not constantly think about her. It'd be nice to talk to someone to talk to that can relate with this whole thing, I've been in relationships before and dealt with breakups but this is the first time I'm experiencing real heartbreak. "
2348,isfj,"I've been doing what makes me happy, and I really am feeling better day by day. I realize right now if I'm not looking out for myself and my own happiness, nobody is, and that fact is carrying me through right now. "
2349,isfj,"I'm an INTJ and I don't usually get the whole flirting thing. So it's especially hard to catch when a girl is flirting with me. So a few months ago a new girl got a job where I work (small pet store) and I was instantly attracted to her. She's really cute but also I tend to be attracted to more caring types and this girl just cares about everything, it was adorable. She's super nice to everyone and just all the great qualities that come with an ISFJ. I always just assumed she was being nice when talking to me and was just one of those types of people that just want to know about people and so they ask you a bunch of questions. Anyways I brushed off a lot of what I know think was flirting, after finding out her type, or at least signs that she liked me. 
   Asking if I wanted to help her restock shelves and the whole time asking me about what I dream about or talking about our personal lives and laughing at really bad jokes and saying how funny I am while calling me a dork or saying how sweet i am.
   Finding out I've taken LSD and I smoke and then saying multiple times how we should ""go halves"" and go the beach together. 
    Coming over and asking if I need help with something that's clearly a one person job and admitting it was just an excuse to hang out with me.
    Mentioning many times that she like my beard or hair and then the last time adding in ""I like your face, you're cute.""
    Always asking how I'm doing the first thing when she sees me at work and then the second being ""are you closing?"" (she always closes).
    Inviting me over to hang out sending the text at 8pm saying ""just finished showering and smoking and and thought of you. I wanted to see if you wanted to come over and hang out, maybe watch some tv or something, i just really need a friend."" and then actually telling me to come over at 10pm and then tell me she has to sneak me in. When I get there she says ""sorry I'm not cute"" while wearing what i can only describe as a lingerie type robe kind of deal (tied) with just the top of a black lace bra showing. Lets me pick a movie and we smoke on her bed while she's laying on her side, so that the curve of her body is accentuated with her ""lingerie"" draped over her. The movie ends and she says I can put another one on and since we basically just looked at her tumblr and laughed and talked the first movie then it was a good idea. We end up watching a scary movie and shes getting fidgety ie. feet start squirming suspiciously close to mine and hands are doing the same to my hands. she asks if I want to cuddle and then immediately lays her head on my chest and her arm across me to stop on the other half. she then made her body flush with mine draping her leg over my crotch and down my leg and began playing with my beard. 
Now until I got to her house I admit I had suspicions but nothing really shot out. When i got there I immediately started to think about reevaluating her feelings for me. (Friends don't usually where what she was wearing as something to hang out in). But it wasn't until I felt the foot wiggles i thought she was into me. then the cuddling and the beard playing basically confirmed everything. 
As an INTJ i dont do intimate situations like that unless I'm prepared. I thought we were friends up until 12:30am that morning so I was extremely nervous and had to concentrate 35% on not getting hard 40% on keeping my heartbeat steady 15% on not getting distracted by her hair smelling nice and then 10% on the actual movie. By this point I was trying not to fuck anything up  and so after the movie ended I left @1:30am.
Her interaction with me definitely changed with me after that. Still asking how i was doing or seeing if i closed but everything else cut back significantly. I can tell when I have to put more effort into a relationship to compensate for the lack of effort from the other party. After I tell her I think i fucked up that night because I'm actually into her she tells me she doesn't like me like that and just wants to be friends. She then pulled away significantly more to the point which I feel like shes avoiding me now. (Could be the copious amounts of hickies on her neck and arms and she doesn't want to make it awkward, but idk). 
   It seemed like she was interested but has now stated 2 times she just wants to be friends (the second being unnecessary) and that shes sorry for the misunderstanding. I'm just really confused but hey thanks for reading this far. any insight would help  "
2350,isfj,"Sounds like she likes you and took the initiative to let you know via hints and sexiness. And felt like it wasn't reciprocated in the same fashion of which she's accustomed to. 
You saying you are interested isn't the same to her as you reacting with interest to her cues. And now she feels like she exposed her interest to you and you didn't respond in kind, which hurts, so she's denying initial interest in order to save face.
Or maybe she realized that you aren't who she wanted you to be, someone who can react to her the way she likes. And possibly doesn't want to chase you like before and is backtracking and saying she isn't interested from the beginning to save you face from rejection and save her the discomfort of having to reject you.
Could be one or the other. Probably it's a little of both."
2351,isfj,Well I'm glad to know I'm getting a little better at telling if someone is flirting with me then. Sucks that  she feels the need to backtrack all the way but one good thing definitely came from it then. I've learned that being direct is always better. Thanks for your input 
2352,isfj,"But why would she have then in turn rejected me when I confirmed that I liked her. A couple times after she found out, I guess she felt the need to relay again that we should just be friends even though I wasn't saying anything to try towards being with her. And now she all but completely ignores me. I stopped even attempting to be her friend now or make friendly conversation because of it. Basically once she found out i liked her she flipped and did a 180 on how she would interact with me "
2353,isfj,"Well damn. I wish I had just gone for it. The situation now, not being together, ended just like I thought it would if we were together and then broke up. At least then I would have actually dated her. There's no way it's happening now. Hopefully I get this job somewhere else on Monday. Thanks for the input "
2354,isfj,"Well she's definitely worth it, but she's made it quite clear she doesn't want us to be friends either. Any time I'd bring something up she would either ignore it, have the demeanor of just trying to be polite, or say ""I really just want to be friends"" as if everything was me trying to hit on her. After a month of putting more effort into a would be friendship than I've put in to most other relationships I've had Its time to throw in the towel. "
2355,isfj,"Can anyone relate to this feeling?
These past few weeks I have realized how truly alone I am. I have a boyfriend, I have family, and I have a few people I talk to at school. But I have no one I can tell the depth of how truly unhappy I am sometimes, I have no one I can tell 100% of my issues to... I have no one that I would feel comfortable admitting I sometimes feel crazy or bipolar just because of how my emotions/feelings work...
I just wish I had one person. One person that I could call up the times I honestly feel like I have no one else -- the times when I am so alone, so alone and knowing I have no one in the world but myself -- and call them and tell them how sad I am and have them tell me they are there for me.
As I told someone else... ""i just want a friend. i want ONE friend. one friend i would know wanted to be there for me. and instead i have myself and a shitload of baggage and no one to help me carry it all""
My boyfriend tells me I've idealized the person I want, and it's true. I keep waiting for the friend that will appear out of nowhere and hug me and tell me ""Look, it will all be okay. I am here for you, I am not going anywhere. You won't be alone again."" That person doesn't exist. How do I accept this? How can I accept never having a friend like this?
I know people from my school. None well enough to tell them how truly sad I am, no one to tell that I think I might be struggling with depression and haven't been eating, no one to tell that sometimes I don't think I can do it all on my own and if I thought there was a way out I would take it. I came up with a motto for myself when I was stuck moving boxes from my old apartment to new apartment by myself: ""I can do it, because I have to do it.""
This motto helps me deal with the day-to-day stuff, knowing that I can do things alone just because I have to do things alone. But at the same time,... I just don't know.
Sorry if this is a bit rambling, but I just wanted to post it and see if anyone has anything to say about it maybe..."
2356,isfj,"I think it's good that you realised that such a friend is truly a rare thing. I also think it's cool you can talk about that with your boyfriend. I have no way of knowing, but are you sure you are giving your boyfriend enough credit? That aside, it's my current motto as well: I live, work eat and sleep because I have to. 
I'm probably the least practical person timezone wise (I live in Holland) but you can always drop me a PM if you need someone to bounce ideas off or vent."
2357,isfj,"I understand this totally. I was unbelievably lucky to have this person right under my nose when I was so deep in depression I didn't see it. My housemate identified my depression (having experienced it herself) and made sure I got the medical and mental health help I needed. She let me tell her all my crap and simply listened, even though she had her own stuff to deal with (chronic illness). Wow on writing this, I realise I really need to tell her how much I appreciate what she did for me.
I don't rely on her so much anymore (we live a few hundred miles from each other now), but we are there for each other when the chips are down.
I will keep on trying to pay that forward. So while I can't be there for you to visit or call (the ""z"" in idealised makes me think you're in the US, I'm in the UK), if you ever want to write things down and have a fellow ISFJ internet stranger read it, please do feel free to PM me any time.
On reading the comments I see other have offered the same thing, I love this little community! :much love to you all:"
2358,isfj,"Please read:
My ex-girlfriend was like this. I don't think you should listen to the people giving you external answers (go meet this person, go talk to me, go do this, etc). Because I think the real answer is in YOU.
I think you need to find a way to open up to the ones you love. This is a major struggle for ISFJ's but try to find a way to ease yourself into this. Don't go searching for other people, because eventually they will get close to you and then you will be afraid to tell them how you feel.
You need to learn to let your loved ones into your mind and heart. If you push them away or won't let them in you will lose some very valuable people in your life."
2359,isfj,"I've definitely been where you are. Like for me, in college, I felt like I had a ton of acquaintances, but not people who truly knew me. I never really had a best friend for most of college, and that was really hard. I was in many groups of friends, but never was I the best friend. I was blessed to have a friend, a super popular ENFP, who I could just be myself with. He encouraged me by simply being there to hear my struggles.
I guess the point of this is that it will get better. I can relate to how you feel. I wish there was something I could tangibly do to help, but just know you're not alone in wanting to have someone who you can be your true self with. Chin up. :)"
2360,isfj,"Web friendships are great - PM if you ever want to talk :)  Also, I've found that for me it helps a lot to have different people to talk to about different kinds of issues/things that are bothering you.  I have a friend I talk to a lot about petty stupid things, and we do that for each other.  I have another friend I talk to about deeper life things.  It depends on how well you compartmentalize, and it doesn't solve the problem of finding someone to talk to about deep life things, but by spreading it out over multiple people, it is possible to not overload one person but instead give each person a smaller portion of your ""burden"", if that makes sense?  Also, there are some things it's just hard to talk to other people about.  I find that writing about those, in a diary or as fiction, helps a LOT if you can't find someone to talk to about it."
2361,isfj,"Honestly I am probably not giving him enough credit. I can talk to him about many things, and I have explained to him the depth of my emotions, and how I feel that my emotions are ""wrong"" and ""stupid"" and I should just not care -- he always tells me that no, my emotions/feelings are very valid.
The issue though is that I still feel wrong to feel the way I am feeling. And sometimes I will cry in the other room while he is doing homework, and I will just think ""no, this is not worth it to bother him."" So then I am faced with the predicament -- I can't bother him, I can't bother my family, so who do I really feel like I can ""bother""?
Another compounding factor is that I often will get sad just at the thought of a past problem (ex: My bf and I could have gone to a concert together, but because of miscommunicating he did not get me a ticket and later when he found out I did want one, they were sold out). Now every time I hear the mention of that concert, I will become sad and I think it's very unreasonable. My bf knows how upset I was, we talked about it, I became adamant about clarifying things to be sure no more misscommunications etc. And still if someone brings up the concert, sometimes I will want to just go cry. How can I keep harping about this to my boyfriend -- I want to just be past it already! And to be honest, it doesn't get brought up that often just when it is I become so sad even if a minute before I was happy.
My boyfriend is an INTJ we are pretty sure (and no, the INTJ subreddit is not a good representation of them). We think so differently. I sometimes feel that he would be much happier with someone who is more ""rational"" than me, but he assures me that he finds my emotions/feelings a really pleasant change from his own thinking style. And I believe we do complement each other well (but sometimes we are so good at thinking in ""opposite"" ways that we are totally on different pages without even realizing it).
It feels really good to type this all out.
Thank you so much for the offer about PMing you, I might take you up on it -- if I can get over thinking I might be bothering you! :P"
2362,isfj,"Thank you for the advice. I am working on it, but it is difficult.
I do have a few people I know, like you said it is just a matter of opening up to them. There are so many people in my classes, a couple that I feel okay texting -- but it's hard to take a step towards getting to know people better. Sometimes I will try (""Hey, want to have dinner after class?"" or ""Hey, want to study together?"") but if my efforts don't work, it's a big let-down because I don't know how to open up to people if they don't want to see me outside of class...
And I am trying to be more open with my boyfriend. He usually knows when something is up with me so I can't hide my worries forever.
Just wanted to let you know I read your msg."
2363,isfj,"I often beat myself up about stupid things I did. I wallow in shame, sadness, etc., for a little while and then I decide to accept/acknowledge how I feel and stop thinking about it (easier said than done, but it gets easier with practise). 
One of the techniques I use is to think ""what was the worst thing that can/did happen?"" to gain a little perspective.
In your case, the worst thing was that you missed out on an event. Really, in the grand scheme of things, that's not so bad! There will be other concerts. Every time that familiar sadness crops up, just repeat in your head, ""yeah it sucks, but it's not so bad in the grand scheme of things"", the new perspective might just sink in to your brain :)
It's doubly hard when you blame yourself cause you think you did something wrong and caused a problem, but you didn't ""fail"" in your communication, there were just crossed wires! It happens all the time!"
2364,isfj,"I agree on you're not giving your boyfriend enough credit. Good boyfriends always give support. And it sounds like he does. He's right- there's nothing wrong with how you're feeling. You can't help the way you feel. Unless you're taking your negative feelings out on others, there's nothing wrong. 
I find your story kind of funny, because I'm dating an INTJ too (I agree, INTJ subreddit is a terrible representation of them!) and I totally see that kind of miscommunication happening with us. Similar miscommunications have already happened. Like you, we talk it out and work on making sure it doesn't happen again. I don't know what else you can do about it. Of course you're allowed to feel upset, but at the same time if that incident still has you crying, you probably should try to find some way to get over it. I don't know how you can though, but maybe someone else here does?
You sound a lot like me, tbh. All I have is my boyfriend (who I go to with everything) and family and a few people I talk to at work/school. I used to have a BFF (ENFJ) who I used to go to for everything- which was nice when there were things I wanted to talk to her that I couldn't really talk to my boyfriend about. But then one day she just stopped talking to me, not even to tell me why. It's been a year and I'm still bitter but have been slowly getting over it. I'm getting off topic...
I wish I could tell you how to find a best friend you can go to for everything, but I don't know how. I met that particular friend way back in junior high and we stuck together all up through college. I think best friends just sort of happen. Maybe you can try hanging out with your acquaintances more. Try to get to know them better? Or meet new friends through them?
Judging by this sentence, it sounds like the best thing you can do for now is get a journal or personal blog (like Tumblr or Wordpress), and just write everything out. Write out your feelings and anything that has been troubling you. I used to do that all the time, and it helped tremendously. That's my biggest advice to you.
Good luck!"
2365,isfj,"So I am a pretty much a textbook ISFJ- caring and sensitive, pretty much 90% of the time. But sometimes I go through periods of feeling very callous and cold towards even the closest people in my life...Almost on purpose? Like I consciously choose to act and feel that way. Sometimes I say things that I know will hurt someone, purposefully. 
I know it sounds a bit sociopathic almost, but has anyone else experienced this? Is it a symptom of feeling too much like a pushover and wanting to regain control? Just a part of being a human? Something else? Or am I just weird? Hope this makes sense"
2366,isfj,"this used to be a scary part of me. i used to always feel like a victim (to others, to life in general, to myself even) and that somehow, being on the other side of it makes me not a victim. 
it felt good momentarily to know someone else is the victim. though i didn't understand that that was the reason back then. i just did it and it brought minor emotional relief and a lot of problems and lingering negative feelings i'd carry as a result.
but after a years of soul searching i've realized that hurting others is still me being a victim. i was still being effected by my hurt. i felt the hurt so much that i had to act on it instead of acting free from it for my own interests. 
in a way i was a slave to my hurt and my victim hood. it didn't matter if i sat in it and felt bad or if i was proactive with it and made others feel bad. the only escape was to let it go so that i could be free to do what was best for me."
2367,isfj,"I get this way sometimes too. I find this happens on a few different, but specific, occasions:


I'm irritated at internal circumstances so I lash out externally at the person I care about.


My friend is making obviously bad choices, I give advice when they ask, they act like they will listen and then they complain their life sucks when they don't follow said advice. My last resort: brutally cruel honesty.


Pent up anger. I got walked over for too long with sly insults and stabs at me so it built up and I'm clearly upset.


With that being said, on these rare occurances, I almost always feel instant regret. It isn't ME speaking and even if it was true, I know there's a more loving and helpful way to say it. My brain just decides in that moment to skip filtering out emotions and to just go for it. Then I feel crappy afterward."
2368,isfj,"Sometimes I get this way as well, so you're not alone. It usually happens when I get very anxious, or when my boyfriend (or someone else) does something that upsets me but I know it's stupid to be upset about it so I just shut him out completely for a little while. I know this is wrong and I know that it really upsets him (and others) because he wants to fix things immediately, and I just can't do that sometimes.  I think this is partly just because I value not arguing over arguing (For the most part, there are some things I will argue about till I am blue in the face).
But the person I am most awful to when I am this way is my mother. I hate that about myself, for the record, but she is the person I am closest too, she raised me, so she knows all my buttons just like I know a lot of hers."
2369,isfj,"Yes. I have been told I have a victim-complex. With the person I am emotionally closest too (my S.O.) I can even exhibit this even more-so, to the point of being selfish sometimes. Maybe it is just a human thing, but I can relate OP"
2370,isfj,"I think this roots from not wanting to get hurt, so you “hurt” others first in defense. In my case, I usually isolate myself instead of getting closer to people. To some people, it might come off as I’m “too busy” for them, but really it’s me being guarded."
2371,isfj,I get this several times throughout each year. I usually will wake up one day with this feeling and I am able to tell that if I don't keep away from every human I know I will look for something to shred them with. I realize I am feeling this way and I can force myself to not react but it's so incredibly strong. It will mostly pass after the darkness arrives then my mood slowly elevates and feel back to normal ... but I will linger about it for days after thinking that I am a shitty person and vow to not feel like that again.
2372,isfj,"Yes, I can definitely relate to that- I think it's mostly people who are closest to you that can best push your buttons. And since I tend to bottle up feelings a lot, sometimes they burst out in uncharacteristic episodes of callousness. It never lasts long though"
2373,isfj,"I'm glad it spoke to you! It's nice to be able to relate to someone else about things like this. 
And you got that right about maintaining harmony. I struggle with that inner turmoil of wanting to keep the peace but knowing I can't watch someone make bad choices or continue to hurt me (whatever it might be). "
2374,isfj,I'm a medical assistant. This is one of the first jobs I've had that I feel like I do well and could see myself doing for a long time. Its a lot of socializing and making small talk. Trying to make people feel comfortable 9 hours a day can be tiresome. At the end of the day I really look forward to my alone time.
2375,isfj,"I'm a System Administrator. The basic job is something I'm good at, but it is not all that rewarding to me. I have accepted that by saying that it's to pay the bills. However, my manager has noticed I am good with people and relationships, moreso than most technical folks, so I am being moved more in that direction. Could see entering management at some point.
I am working on getting into volunteer work that is rewarding. Working with therapy horses and firefighting. I enjoy helping people."
2376,isfj,Right now I work an enterprise technical support engineer for a large software company.  I'm excellent with working with customers (Aside from the small talk; I've very strong in communicating technically with people) and have a strong knowledge on computers/networking/etc.  The most rewarding part is helping people solve customers or tech them new things.  I would like to move to a more meaningful company.
2377,isfj,"It seems like I'm on a different path and I work in contracting.  I originally began studying English and then Psychology and through poor decisions fell out of both.  While I don't love what I do (it pays well and I don't entirely hate it) its got me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to grow and be a bit more stern and decisive (things I learned from contract negotiations, and cold-hearted-business-truthiness).  My coworkers make it worth it. "
2378,isfj,"I'm in my last semester of grad school to become a community counselor.  For my internship, I counsel participants from our youth and anti-violence programs at my local LGBT community center.  I'm excited to finish school and actually get paid for this."
2379,isfj,I work for a school district and help run an after school day care program. I totally love my job because the children are a joy to be around and also very challenging. There's something new everyday and I love that I don't have to dress up for it. What do you do?
2380,isfj,"I would like to; I've really enjoyed working on the identity and relationship issues that are unique to this population.  I'm not sure what the job prospects will look like, though, so I'm keeping an open mind."
2381,isfj,"I like reading up weird trivia facts, whether about movies or in history. I have a diary where I write about my day to help keep up my sanity, because sometimes I just really need to vent or write about my anxieties because I have no one else to vent to. I watch ""classic"" (1930s-1960s,) films in my spare time. I read Star Trek fanfiction. I guess you could say that my interests are pretty boring."
2382,isfj,"i mostly don't talk about my interests to others, and I don't care what they think.
i draw, I read, I do atlethics occasionally, and I listen to music, I also play games.
if you call that boring, then idc."
2383,isfj,"I love listening to music that my dad used to play like The Beatles or Frank Sinatra types. I'm 24 and people around my age tend to pan these genres as boring, I guess compared to today's pop songs which I cannot stand generally. "
2384,isfj,"I play video games, mainly RPGs like pokemon, listen to an absolute ton of music (mostly edm stuff, some rock and metal, even a bit of jazz), Read very particular books (like specifically Erin Hunter's Warriors series), and like to watch shows like Doctor Who and Bojack Horseman. If someone finds all that boring, then i most likely have never cared for them. "
2385,isfj,"The interests I've read in this thread seem so cool to me!
Mine is planning, decades into the future. Then studying stuff. Then running or hiking 10+ miles on the weekends (slow going but not extreme, I like taking in the views and short trips don't do it for me). I'm like a turtle? Everything I do is pretty slow and intentional and likely boring to everyone else :/"
2386,isfj,"i play board games and magic the gathering. which i find exciting but not everyone is into it. even the way i play magic can be boring to others. i think of it like a game where i'm a lawyer and each card is a law getting passed. and i'm trying to get the right laws in place to take advantage of in order to win.
i also like to dissect the food i eat. i really get into describing the textures and flavors and figuring out the ingredients and techniques that is used to make that experience. i can go on and on with a deep focus while doing this. my girlfriend tries to get me to change topic when i eat something specifically amazing and complex because that can take a while.
also when i go to a restaurant i do this thing where i count the number of people working and i pay attention to the cost vs price of the food as well as the rate that they flip tables to estimate how much the restaurant makes. i also look to see how much of the food they make have overlapping ingredients to ease labor time. some of my friends are annoyed by this habit because i say it all aloud and they much prefer to talk about something else."
2387,isfj,"I'm very into movies/tv shows and all the trivia that I can find about them. I love to talk about all the movie details and how some visual metaphors/music/camera tricks/etc. are used to get our attention and convey the appropriate message to the audience. People like to discuss the plot of a movie, but not the specific details on how the movie is made of :( "
2388,isfj,I have learned not to talk about my hobbies and interests as it tends to elicit yawns! But yes I must have a touch of istp because mechanical things and doodads interest me to no end but my entire friend group doesn’t feel the same way. 
2389,isfj,"I'm the INTJ (23 Year old male) she is the ISFJ (20 Year old female). She's very mature and self aware for a 20 year old (and I'd like to think I am too) so there are never any major blowouts, just small miscommunications, but eventually the cycle can get tiresome, we've actually been pretty good after some good talks, but just want to keep our A game up, haha.
I guess an example of recurring themes: she sometimes sulks for a few hours here and there when I don't pick up on cues or when she assumes I'm distant (but I'm just trying to be productive). I find it troubling when she assumes the worst in my attentions and goes off on a tangent to sulk. She wants consistency and be affirmed that she is appreciated, and I'm very poor at this.
I can't always spot these ""cues"" to pick up on, when I try to be extremely aware of the present it can be exhausting. 
Any tips? 
EDIT: Format"
2390,isfj,"You will find that our types are ""enigmas"" to each other; INTJ has cognitive functions Ni Te Fi Se while ISFJs are Si Fe Ti Ne. This means we pretty much are on completely different wavelengths.
I love talking about this pairing because my boyfriend is an INTJ and I'm an ISFJ and are both 22 (you can look though my past comments to see other threads about this same topic). Like you said, we have had ""small miscommunications"" and large ones too -- it's extremely frustrating because often we will think we understood each other, only to realize days later that we both meant something else completely. An example: I mentioned a backpack I had that I was surprised he didn't like, he said he did like it, and I was like ""weird, I thought you said you hadn't but okay"" -- days later it comes up again and it turns out we were both talking about different backpacks without realizing it. We just think in such different ways, it's weird.
I have had to get comfortable enough with my boyfriend to tell him when I am upset. In the past, I did just hold it in and not want to mention it and he was totally oblivious it seemed. At this point in our relationship (a little over a year together) he can tell when something is wrong and I know not to hide it -- I tell him ""I feel stupid about how I feel and it's embarrassing that I'm upset over this because it's not a rational upset... but if you give me a few minutes to work up the courage to say it then I will. You just have to wait ten minutes for me to muster the courage"" and then I will tell him what is bothering me.
ISFJs (at least me) take a long time to warm up to someone--sure we try to be outwardly nice to everyone but I have many layers and I take a long time to peel them back because I am very self-conscious and just do not completely open up easily. I am not sure how long you and your girlfriend have been dating, but maybe she is still scared of being completely open about her feelings (she might think that her feelings are wrong or stupid? My previous two relationships both taught me that I was stupid for feeling the way I did and my current boyfriend has had to tell me over and over that it is okay to feel upset or angry about things).
If you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer because I really love talking about this, lol.
edit: If you search in the INTJ subreddit for ISFJ/INTJ topics you will find more posts like yours, asking for help about how to make it work... a lot of the times INTJ commentators are very dismissive of this pairing because they think ISFJs are overemotional crybabies or something, so that always makes me sad to read haha. But they still provide the insights that you are searching for.
edit2: here's another of my comments from a while ago:"
2391,isfj,"My mom is an INTJ also... It is a tough relationship. She was a workaholic when I was growing up and so I developed more of a mother-daughter relationship with my aunt who was always babysitting me (my aunt was a stay-at-home mom, my own mom is a doctor and my dad isn't in the picture). And then growing up I felt incredibly guilty that I preferred my aunt over my mom. My mom did try though, eventually she learned that she didn't care about money/work as much as family and made a 180 to try to be a better mom/be around more...
My mom is very rational and it would always suck because I would start crying when we got into an argument (very rare that we would, I mostly just hung out in my room and tried to avoid her). And I feel as though I disappoint her because I'm not as rationally-inclined as she and I don't want to be a doctor, I'd rather just be a stay-at-home mom or work a very simple job like be a faceless person at a desk or something (basically so I won't have to think too much, and I want to feel like I know I can't mess up).
Now that I'm 22 and away from home in college, our relationship is a bit better but I still always feel like I need to please her and I feel very guilty for how I treated her in the past (even though tbh it wasn't that bad compared to other people I know but I still feel very personally guilty)."
2392,isfj,"I feel like my friends flood to me for advice (particularly ENFP's - I am like a magnet to them). I guess people can just sense I am a good listener, but it can be pretty exhausting to have to spill out advice all the time. Sometimes I need some myself... What about you fellow ISFJ's?"
2393,isfj,"For me, people tend to be more open around me.  They know that I'm a good listener, however they don't usually seek me out.  Just whenever they're around me they tend to bring up issues they ate currently dealing with."
2394,isfj,"I'm an ENFJ and I've had many good friends as ISFJs and YES! I come to you guys for advice all the time. We often share the same principles but go about reaching them differently.
You guys tend to be a little more level headed than I am, and are great listeners. Even if I'm not looking for advice it's always nice to have an ISFJ shoulder to cry on (figuratively). It sometimes feels akin to a mother-child relationship (not in a bad way, but in a ""I know you won't judge me for my feels"" sort of way). :) Love you guys!"
2395,isfj,"I see my red hoodie for example, and I remember all the lazy boring days I have spent with it.. and think ""ok I am not going to wear that today.."" because I don't want another boring day.
I try to wear the clothes I have felt good in before, remembering all the different feelings I have experienced in it -! 
maybe I'm just sprouting nonsense, it's kind of hard to explain.."
2396,isfj,"Special clothing due to memories of empowerment tied to it. A t-shirt I wear only for certain occasions because it’s cute, wouldn’t mean a thing to anyone, but it means the world to me. It’s my feeling good shirt."
2397,isfj,"I just wear what I'm comfortable in or what I think I look good in but I don't have any memories attached to most clothes. Except... I remember wearing a peacoat through an entire concert but I don't think of it as my ""concert peacoat"" or anything."
2398,isfj,"Definitely most of my pieces of clothing have feelings tied to them. Bad dates, especially good days, unique events, things people said about them. I don’t choose predictively like you do, but I do tend to choose the same comfy, loose items for my lazy days so it ends up the same. :)"
2399,isfj,"Hi everyone. 
I’ve recently (about 2 weeks) gone exclusive with an isfj female whom I’d been talking with and dating for about 6 weeks in total. 
She told me she’s never had a boyfriend before but has been great on the first four dates we had. 
On the fourth date, she randomly brought up that she has deleted her dating apps and when I asked her why “she said that she didn’t need them anymore because she met me”. I then asked if we were official and she replied “I don’t see any reason why we shouldn’t be” but asked if I wouldn’t post it on Facebook as she likes to keep things private. 
However, since then, she’s gradually got quieter and quieter. We used to message 10+ times a day (good lengthy messages too) and send each regular snaps. 
We’ve had 3 more dates since the 4th date and spent Valentines afternoon together. On these previous dates, she’s been really quiet but will still talk a fair amount, just a lot less than normal. 
She seems to want to keep seeing me as she said that on her card, but she just keeps getting quieter. Yesterday we sent a total of 2 messages and they were initiated by me (my third message she didn’t even read but was active repeatedly, which is cool with me as I understand she has lots of people to talk to, however, a week ago she would have replied within an hour or two). 
I’ve asked her if everything’s okay but she said that she had been quiet but everything was good, then went quiet again. 
Is this normal or should I be concerned? Thanks for any help :)"
2400,isfj,"Sounds like you’re over-analyzing this.  I imagine she can sense that you care this much and it’s just pushing her away.  
You let her win your commitment so quickly and she got bored... can you blame her?  There’s no fun once you have caught the fish.
Too many red flags for me at this point... I would just go about my thing and let her come to you."
2401,isfj,"Thanks for your advice and detailed response. 
I think you’re right, I probably am over analysing this just now. I didn’t analyse much when we first started going out, it was just lately that I noticed a change. But you’re right, I need to calm down my thinking and acting. 
The reason I was happy to commit so quickly was because I was into her and we had a good connection with a lot in common. She’s already told me about how much she’s been telling her friends and coworkers about me and I actually met some of her family on our third date (we were out at the same place and bumped into them). 
Would you suggest that I don’t message her and just let her message me instead? Then, if she doesn’t just abandon things? 
I don’t really want to start dating other people again, as we are still technically exclusive and I do still like her a lot, but I’m thinking things might come to an end sooner rather than later. 
Thanks again for your advice, it’s helped a lot :)"
2402,isfj,"Yeah, unfortunately we didn’t work out pretty soon after that. She continued to get quieter even with me giving her space and messaging her less. 
She initiated a double date (soon after writing this post) with myself, her sister and sister’s boyfriend and was talking about parties and events she’d been invited to and wanted me to join her. 
I then found out (the next day) that she had reinstalled one of her dating apps and was active on it. I tried to meetup with her to talk about things but she kept putting things off. I ended up breaking up with her over message and have since moved on. "
2403,isfj,"I think you need to pull back and get busy on your own.  It sounds like the problem is that you don’t have much else to do, so you are worrying about this one single girl that you ‘have so many things in common with’.  And she senses that.
Here’s what was a big eye opener for me:
We have so many things in common with EVERYONE.  
These things are there if you look for them.. don’t use them as reasons to be into her.
I think you need to value your own commitment/exclusivity more and take your time jumping into a relationship... this isn’t a one-off case.  However you go about realizing how much you (and your commitment) are worth, is up to you."
2404,isfj,"Thanks for this advice, I definitely needed to hear a more honest answer. You’re completely right. 
I do have a lot of hobbies and interests but I’ve put a lot “on hold” to meetup with this girl and so I don’t come across as too outgoing (as she’s pretty reserved and does go out but not as much as I have, until recently). I will focus more on those now. 
I have a party tonight and tomorrow night so I will go to both of those and just enjoy myself. 
I think the “things in common” was just a plus after being really attracted to her and the fact that I had more in common with her than a lot of girls I’ve met was pretty great, but I do see your point and I can find things I’ve got in common with plenty of people. 
Thanks for the tip about jumping into relationships too quickly. It felt right at the time and was going well but something has changed. Perhaps I should have spent more time getting to know her and establish a proper baseline first. 
I really do appreciate your response, it’s been an eye opener and I’m going to really try and take it on board. I’ll get back to my hobbies and other interests and see what happens. If it doesn’t work out with her then it doesn’t work out. 
Thanks again :D"
2405,isfj,"I have an ISFJ acquaintance/ friend. While this has the potential for a long-term friendship, we don't know each other that well. We just meet one-on-one every 6-8 weeks for a semi-professional goal, and that's it. However, over the past 6 months that I've known her, I've seen her gradually lose interest in her life and hobbies and goals. I feel she is depressed and I want to be supportive. At the same time, I'm not sure if I want anything apart from a platonic friendship with her. Any clues on how I can be supportive, without crossing any boundaries? I care deeply for her, and if she is really going through something, then I want to be there for her. 
ISFJs, when you are in pain, how do you like to be supported? "
2406,isfj,"You sound like a nice person to know, but as an ISFJ (a fair bit older than your friend) if I were 'confronted' as it were, I would retreat further and probably start to avoid you. Do you know if anything notable has happened in her life that she's mentioned in passing perhaps? Or you feel could be a trigger for the change? Sometimes I find talking through an 'issue' with a fresh - non nagging - perspective really helps, especially if I feel that person is genuinely concerned about me.    
How often do you chat/text in-between your meet-ups? Sometimes when it's written, rather than in a phone call, we have a little longer to prepare a response and give away as much as we need to (or not! I'm quite private unless I want to share) Maybe a ""You've not seemed yourself recently, are you doing ok?""  message. It seems bland, but is kind enough to show concern, but certainly not overstepping the mark. 
Just my thoughts, I hope you can find a good balance to help your chum. 
​
TL:DR - don't push or we retreat!  All the best. "
2407,isfj,"23/ISFJ/F: You’re really sweet to care. As an ISFJ, most of my healing comes from just being left alone. If I’m ever confronted, like the comments above, I’m more likely to avoid it and then avoid the person wondering, or just fib altogether and say “I’m fine”. The best way to handle this, I think, is just to let her know that you’re there if she wants to talk and let her work through that. ISFJ’s are “fixers”, so it’s hard to feel like we’re being “fixed”, despite the good intentions behind the question. Just keep being kind to her! She’ll work through it. "
2408,isfj,"first of all, this is very very thoughtful and sweet of you.
well, if I would feel depressed, I would like people to actually ask me how I'm doing (because most people don't do that) with a real interest, and seriousness in their eyes. 
If I then would open up to them, telling them what's bothering me and so on, I would like them to comfort me, but also come up with real good advice - especially if the advice is based on concrete examples from past experiences, but also with a touch of ... poetry. with a touch of abstractness to it.
to be honest,  just the feeling of opening up and venting to others are more than enough,  just feeling seen by someone!
I wish you good luck!"
2409,isfj,Just say something like “I’m concerned that you are depressed I want you to know I’m here to help you get through this tough time”. Also Knowing that my friends and family are there to support me but also not forcing me to open up before I’m ready. Just knowing that the people in my life care about me so much makes me more likely to open up. I wish you good luck.
2410,isfj,"I've just emailed her; some work stuff, and then added on about being a friend and being happy to talk with her if she needed that. Said that my gut feel was that she wasn't doing well, but that I wasn't sure and so I've been hesitant about asking her to start with (and procrastinated on asking her for so long). Also apologized if I was wrong and/or if this felt intrusive to her. Let's see what happens next.
We won't meet for another 6-8 weeks, so maybe she'll reply in the interim. It was a long-ish email, so it should have given her enough to think about. I'm terribly fond of her and hope that either she doesn't have any issues, or that she is willing to chat with me (over email, or in-person). I'd hate to see her in pain :-/ "
2411,isfj,"24/F/ISFJ here. I agree with this comment. 
I’ve had multiple people confront me on seeming depressed(lol), and the one time an acquaintance did so, it made me feel really awkward. I truly believed they were being kind to reach out like that, but I did avoid them after. 
When I don’t know the person too well, I am not sure they are prepared to handle what’s going on in my life. And I’d hate to impose on them and test the limits of their kindness.
I think that speckled gem gives some great advice on how to show concern without scaring her off. I hope it goes well :) "
2412,isfj,"Thank you Jun. Did this over email (I won't see her for another month at least), and was as warm and tenuous as I could possibly be. Let's see how this goes :-/ Thanks for sharing your feelings here. "
2413,isfj,"That sounds great, lots of time for her to ponder a response (and write and re-write it several times!) and you've been clear you care. I hope she replies back to you soon, and opens up a little more.
Good Luck x "
2414,isfj,"My type means everything to me. It's my only concrete sense of who I am. I've spent hundreds of hours pouring over everything I can find about personality types, functions, etc. 
It seems like there's a HUGE lack of ISFJs on here though and I'm curious about that.... Anyway, anyone else a MBTI addict?"
2415,isfj,"I'm pretty driven in getting a definitive typing. Every online test I've done consistently says INFJ but I'm not sure. The INFP function stack seems to make more sense, but then I think about how Si resonates with me, so ISFJ could be on the cards too. My issue is that I find it hard to spot the functions in my own thinking. What I think is Ni-Fe could be Fi-Ne. 
I recently went to a psychologist to take the official MBTI (I'll get feedback on Wednesday.) - as soon as she said J and P is based on whether or not one is organized and structured I thought ""shit, I've just wasted a lot of money."" 
I also get differing typing from other users on here. Some say INFJ, some say INFP. So I feel your frustration. 
I don't know why my type is so important to me, I just feel that it's the first step in truly understanding myself."
2416,isfj,"I've been insanely obsessed by it, yeah, ha. I got very anxious over not having a definitive type - I thought I was an INFJ for about eight years, had a personality change following some trauma and starting thinking I was an ISTJ, then, after some mellowing, thought I was an INFP, but have become pretty certain I'm now an ISFJ. I have no idea if I was always an ISFJ or if I genuinely was an INFJ, because I'm definitely different now to how I was for all of my life prior to the incident. 
ISFJs are definitely underrepresented online, and I reckon it's down to three main reasons:

Many supposed-INFJs are actually ISFJs who have confused Si and Ni (easy as Si is so poorly described).
It's understandable that sensors may well be less interested in MBTI unless they have a particular reason for being interested.
ISFJs (and SJs in general) tend to be more practical/pragmatic and therefore probably have less time for faffing about with MBTI, ha. 
"
2417,isfj,"Yep, absolutely obsessed. Except at times, I felt incredibly talked down by some ISFJ descriptions on the web. I know I shouldn't believe in these generalisations, but still it hurts.. Sometimes makes me regret indulging in this whole personality thing.
As for your second statement, I believe it's because us ISFJs love doing the stuff we love rather than discuss stuff on reddit etc. You can see a big difference in activity between this sub and other MBTI subs, in particular the INFP or INFJ one "
2418,isfj,"When you get your results, would you be willing to share your experience on r/mbti? Since so few people here have gone down the official testing route, I'm always interested in what they thought of the process and whether it was worthwhile.
I've done paper or online versions of the official test on several occasions, but never through a one-on-one session with a psychologist."
2419,isfj,"It wasn't at all what I was expecting. She gave me the questionnaire and left the room till I was done. I was hoping for someone to talk through each of the questions with me and actually base my type on the conversation, rather than what I marked on a question sheet."
2420,isfj,"So I had the feedback session today and it turns out I'm INFP. Interestingly it's the first time I've done the test and not had INFJ come up. 
I was a bit annoyed that it didn't seem to measure cognitive functions and just measured I/E S/N F/T J/P. I fell very close to the cusp of J and P, but the Fi-Ne-Si-Te function stack really makes the most sense to me. "
2421,isfj,"That's disappointing if it wasn't what you thought you would get. Maybe she'll do the conversation based thing when she gives you the results; you might want to ask her to if she doesn't automatically.
I have a friend who's certified in MBTI and uses it in her counselling. From what I understand, they're supposed to use the test to narrow down your type, but then walk you through the options conversationally to help you in determining your own best fit type. I'd actually be surprised if she walked you through question by question because it would likely corrupt your answers."
2422,isfj,"Thanks for the update. Yeah, the official test is based on dichotomies, not functions. Sorry you didn't know about that before. Many of us here could have told you.
That said, unlike some here, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing... or at least it may be the lesser of evils. I mean that the test is the way it is by design, not by accident. Although an official function-based test may sound like a good idea, I'm not confident that it would be any more accurate. For myself at least, the unofficial function tests always produce wildly incorrect typings (the last one said ENFJ or ESFJ), or impossible stacks like Ni Ne Fe Fi Ti Si Te Se. Whereas even the worst dichotomy based tests nearly always produce the same type for me.
The problem is that all the tests are behavior based by necessity, and any particular behavior can be produced by a range of different cognitive function combinations, or may not be that related to the stack at all. So it's difficult, if not impossible, to write questions that can easily be answered by the common person that reliably distinguish between two functions.
Curiously enough, it's been said that INFPs are more likely to mistype as INFJ or INTP than vice versa. I've never seen any stats to support this, but it may be telling that on the older 1977-1989 version of the official test, known as ""Form G"", any ties on any dichotomy were broken in favor of INFP.
https://www.cpp.com/Pdfs/FormM_vs_FormG.pdf
So did she offer any discussion of your result to help you verify whether it was correct? Any explanation of the cognitive differences between INFJ and INFP outside of the stereotypical ""J is punctual and orderly and P is messy and spontaneous"" stuff?"
2423,isfj,"No, she didn't. She also didn't seem aware of the different orientations of the functions. Her main message was that I shouldn't rely on tests for self discovery, I need to look inwards to determine my identity. Which is truth. 
While she was going through various INFP profiles, the function stack really started resonating with me. Yesterday night I purchased the INFJ-INFP Type Clarifier from Personality Junkie which shows a 30% slant towards INFP. "
2424,isfj,"If you're still debating between INFJ and INFP, you might as well try this test, too:
http://www.celebritytypes.com/test/infj-or-infp.php
At least it's free. As an aside, after taking tests like this one, I find it interesting to deconstruct the questions to see if I can figure out which were supposed to be the INFP questions and which were supposed to be the INFJ questions."
2425,isfj,"Well she never said the accurately and correctly part, she just said the first result you get is your type. But what happens if you did the assessment completely wrong? I took the liberty of adding the accurately and correctly. :p"
2426,isfj,"Oh, okay. Even still, for her to suggest that the first result that you get is your type, end of story, is simply untrue. Even CPP, the company that owns and markets the test, would never make such a claim. 
Lots of people mistype on their first try, myself included. I came up as ENTP the first time, then INTP a few years later, then INFP a few years after that and every time since. I have no doubt that INFP was the correct type all along, but I also  understand why the result has changed, so I don't think the test is useless like some people here do. But it clearly doesn't have a 100% success rate either."
2427,isfj,Dear ISFJs i am asking this because i am not always running around and smiling at people when i am with my friends or family yes. But when i am for example on the way to work i just have a neutral/sad expression on my face. So yeah i am just like this or is not so uncommon? 
2428,isfj,"No, I don't think that's uncommon at all. I typically try to be happy and uplifting with my family and friends, but if I'm being honest, I don't really care much when I'm around anyone else. Probably most of the time when I'm not with friends or family I look like I'm unhappy or sad. I see no reason to put on a fake smile for people I don't care about. "
2429,isfj,"When I'm lost inside my head - which is more often than I like to admit - I usually have ""resting sad face"", as someone called it. Sometimes strangers would approach me and ask if I'm ok and try to comfort me.
When I'm engaged in casual conversation with someone, I tend to smile a lot - I'm doing it also with strangers, not just family and close friends."
2430,isfj,"I smile a lot, but not in situations like walking to my university. I have a neutral face, sometimes I might even look angry. There are times that I smile on my way but that's caused by something, like some sort of music/podcast, some memory or a situation I hear on my way.
Once I've heard a guy I know said ""You would have to punch her in the face, so she finally stops smiling/laughing"" about me. 
That's how it is with people, not at times I am alone. 
That's how people see ISFJs maybe, but that's not strange you are not smiling 24/7, don't worry :D"
2431,isfj,"Dunno how to help you plot it out specifically, but I find that I gravitate more toward support roles in online games. I'm not sure if that's just a stereotypical girl thing or an ISFJ thing or a combination."
2432,isfj,"I know that I'm drawn towards, and am good at, being a Flex-Support in team-based ganes and a Tank in MMOs.
Carrying the team to victory or putting myself between my allies and the enemy.
Well, when I'm not playing solo, that is. "
2433,isfj,yeah i tend to be the healer too haha. i really hate roles where i have to decide if someone is lying or something (like the jailor in TOS). i play shooting games as well but i end up trying to befriend them after they kill me.......
2434,isfj,"I like to play support classes as well. I've been learning Dota2 and seem to do well in a support role. However, overall I typically like to play jack-of-all-trades type characters. I like to play characters that don't have too many glaring weaknesses. Example: Pit from Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. A very simple character to understand but difficult to master. 
As for genres, I typically like story driven games and platformers. I like to connect with a character and see them grow and overcome challenges. At the same time, platformers are like that for me as well. I am the one growing and overcoming challenges. There's more I like than this, but these two are the main ones for me. 
On the flip side of that, I don't find myself enjoying super open-ended games. I really want to like Metroid, but I don't. There's just too many elements and open-endedness that I just can't seem to enjoy. "
2435,isfj,"Most ISFJ's are women by survey. (Actually by survey F types are majority female, and T types majority male, there doesn't seem to be a significant gender ratio between S and N other then N types are typically just more rare regardless of sex.)"
2436,isfj,"I'm just now learning how tiny aspect is MBTI of a human being. Althoug it can help to understand some actions of a person, we shouldn't forget that we are guided by muuuuch more than just four letters. What is your 'thing' that doesn't really fit your type's stereotypes? 
Mine is that I love multitasking. For example,when I'm cooking (hahha, I said non-stereotypical, didn't I?) always do bunch of stuff at the same time. Maybe that's why I end up burning down the house. ;)"
2437,isfj,"My memory is straight-up awful. 
Like, short term memory is extremely spotty, and I have relatively few memories of growing up even though I’m only 23. Maybe 1-3 snapshot memories per year from the start of my memory through high school, and maybe 8-10 snapshot memories per year of the more recent stuff. People talking about how ISFJs will remember everything about the people they love always makes me super insecure lol."
2438,isfj,"I don’t really take it slow in relationships! I’ve been the sexual initiator in the relationships I’ve been in (surprise bc I’m so shy), and when I date someone, I tend to fall hard and fast. Sure spending time with helps to get to know a person better but I’m very impatient and love to love them immediately!! 
Also, yes I keep to the social rules as much as possible, but sometimes idgaf and speak what’s directly on my mind and that can be mean or seen as inappropriate and will sometimes get called out on and if does I get defensive and am ready to fight (although I don’t ever!)"
2439,isfj,"I'm a little scatter-brained and tend to be forgetful.. my memory is bad too, like the other ISFJ said.. but I always remember those moments which are connected to a feeling, I even remember a fuzzy glimpse of my 1st birthday.. I tend to be forgetful about 'he said and then she said, and then I said', type of stuff. 
I do multi-tasking too :D ..sometimes I do well, sometimes fail lol. 
And, I don't follow any religion, but I believe in God though. "
2440,isfj,"Interestingly, I'm an INFJ with incredibly detailed, rich, nuanced sensory memory. I sometimes even remember the order of books on my childhood bookshelf. I can recall layouts of rooms if I smell a certain air freshener that my mom would put in those spaces. 
I think memory is so interesting because in MBTI it's always lopped into Si, when in reality both Si and Se are memory operators. Si is more like ""do I use past experience to guide my future actions?"" and not really much about memory retainment itself. "
2441,isfj,"My short term is spotty when it’s apart of my daily routine for about 4 hours then after that it’s almost photographic. Since my kid came into my life I’ve had a bit of a mental block here and there. Use to be able to go into an hour meeting and be able to recall word for word everything that went on. Dependent on my notebook now. Comes down to focus and recognizing the unique moments, phrases and the environment you are in then that memory happens. "
2442,isfj,"
What kind of music do you play/like?
Instrument(s)?
How long have you been playing?
Play in any bands?
Do you write original music?
How does mbti fit into your music?

I’ll start!


I like folk rock, rock, punk, bluegrass (not so much traditional), pop punk, folk, jazz fusion, funk, and blues based rock.  I’m not a fan of pop or country (I mainly just don’t like modern country, but I like Americana).  A few favorite bands include The Beatles, Ben Folds, Los Lonely Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, allman brothers, the band, Derek trucks, bob Dylan, Blake mills, blue rodeo, the bros. Landreth, Chatham county line, Dawes, Dave Rawlings, Elvis Costello, Elliot smith, fall out boy (their old stuff), Bayside, Four year strong, the hush sound, Jason isbell, I fight dragons, motion city soundtrack, the Jayhawks, nickel creek, Relient K, ry cooder, Ryan Adams, the shins, slaid cleaves, son volt, the wallflowers, and Wilco.


I mainly play the guitar. I can play the piano, drums, piano, and mandolin as well, but guitar is my best instrument


Been playing guitar since I was 12 (I’m 20 now). 
Other instruments I started later - all of them I started probably between the ages of 13 and 15. 


I play in a cover band with a few friends - we play mainly more popular stuff just to make some extra money.
I also play guitar for a family band. We write originals, but my brother and cousin have written all the songs that we play.


I do like to write music. I’ve written probably 12 songs that I’ve never showed to anyone. I’m mainly trying to improve my songwriting abilities. I’m trying to get better at writing lyrics mainly. I’ll eventually show some songs to my band so we can play them, but I’m waiting until my songs are good enough .


As an isfj, performances make me nervous. But after doing it for a while, I definitely don’t get as nervous as I used to. Could be my introverted sensing - as I perform more and more I get more and more used to being on stage and don’t get as phased by it.  Writing lyrics is hard for me, which could go back to the fact that Ne is inferior - ideas don’t come to me very easily or often and I’m not good with metaphors or other literary devices.  I do think, however, that Fe improves my ability to write good music - it allows me to experience the melody and harmony emotionally and write pieces that have the power to move others.  

"
2443,isfj,"

I like metal/prog and punk rock. Some bands include Paramore, 
    Yellowcard, Breaking Benjamin, Disturbed, Pantera, Black 
    Sabbath, Royal Blood, Animals as Leaders, Saosin etc. . But I 
    also love the 80s, artists include Prince, Simply Red, Toto, Sting, 
    Richard Marx, Collin Raye etc.


I play percussive instruments, with my favourite being the cajon. 
    Well it's mainly because I play it in church and it is so versatile.


I've been playing with my hands since 5, playing on instruments 
    since 13.


I play for church, if that counts :)


No.


I enjoy being really skilled at it. It also gives me great 
    satisfaction to bring the music up a notch. I also like considering 
    certain details when I play such as playing with greater velocity, 
    changing up patterns and so on

2447,isfj,"I say, don't worry about it. My ISFJ mom is really knowledgeable in her area of expertise, and she gets called ""intimidating"" a lot. She hasn't changed any of the more ""boring"" parts of her personality, but her confidence is enough to scare people, I guess. Don't change who you are. Just be confident, and the waters will part before you (if my petite, unassuming mom is any indication)."
2448,isfj,"It doesn't bother me at all except in situations where those traits (mostly the last one) can cause me to be unassertive and not stand up for myself in matters of importance.
Otherwise, I'm fine being boring, straight-laced, unimaginative, unambitious, etc. etc. I live a pretty peaceful, quiet life and I like it that way. Plus, I tend to surround myself with more creative, outgoing people, so I'm a good foil for them."
2449,isfj,"the positive trait we tend to have as caring and selfless actually bothers me more than the negatives, people telling me constantly essentially that my best quality is serving others gets old quick and has led to a lot of my insecurities. Being called unoriginal, reserved, etc doesn't bother me, because i don't really see them as bad things. just parts of myself. "
2450,isfj,"I don’t think these are weaknesses.  It’s how you identify with them.  Reserved to me is I speak when I need to, not whenever a thought pops into my head.  I was at a support group yesterday and a soft spoken person was speaking.  I had a hard time hearing but didn’t want to stop the speaker mid thought(empathy), by the woman behind me is hard of hearing and couldn’t hear anything.  So I interrupted the speaker for the person behind me.  
To me that’s what my ISFJ role tells me about myself.  I embrace I’ll work hard rather than make someone else do something, or avoid conflict and just adjust my plans.  But if someone needs help, I jump in immediately for them.  If I don’t get ketchup at the drive thru I don’t care, but if my wife’s wit me and she wanted some I go in and get it because she’s more reserved than me.  I don’t know if that helps, but I don’t see the less developed areas as weaknesses, just things to be mindful of. "
2451,isfj,"I don't know why, but whenever I'm talking to someone, I can't help but think how incredibly boring I must be, making me want to do nothing but apologize, and consider if they wouldn't be better of just not talking with me. I'm aware this may sound a bit cliche, but I feel like wherever I go, I'm not wanted nor needed. I know I should try to help myself about that matter, but I reckon there may be people here who felt the same as me, and could maybe help me a bit. (Sry for my bad English, and thanks for your attention!) (Sorry for bothering you all about it)"
2452,isfj,"Don't appologize when you can be grateful instead.
Look :
I'm a phony. I speak and try to engage people. I'm specific so I often struggle with the global coherence of what I try to convey.
It means people get bored of what I say, seeing it as logorrhea. It means I'm often not believe despite being right, like Cassandra in greek mythology.
I wished I could just be let in peace, so I don't have to deal with all this hatred I received through my life. Being collected like you already are is a blessing from my point of view. It also mean you won't necessarily have any benefit to become any louder.
Aware of something that isn't for sure ? Why should you care about that ?
This feeling is called shame. I know it well. I'll show you that a bit later : it's painful to me to just tap in it willfully.
Your wonky sentence structure is really meaningful to me : I have the exact same one !
From a grammarian standpoint, you put an articulation that should have been a full stop : you don't reckon anything.
From a more humane standpoint, it means you're uneasy and hesitating. I'll show you you don't have to.
From the first sentence of my comment, try saying ""thank you"" instead of ""sorry"". It's tedious at first, but words shape our thinking habits. It's a old hacking technique I come up on my own. I don't ask for forgiveness anymore. I became bolder, and less ashamed of myself.
Now, the whole subject here. Shame.
I feel unworthy. The constant mistake in others's life.
But you know what ? You just reminded me life can't be this way. You reminded me I do can help you, and you can help me. You just already did by writing this comment.
So thank you."
2453,isfj,"I used to feel that way all the time.
It helped for a bit getting reassurance from people. I asked around and people said they were happy to know me and find me interesting. They gave me details on what I said or think about that they thought was cool.
Now I remind myself of that when I think I'm not. And I seek the things I'm interested in and share them with people i know want to know about it."
2454,isfj,"Yeah sometimes I have this feeling too, more if I'm with people that I don't know much. It's shitty, because thinking about it while you are having a conversation just makes your anxiety (and consequently your behaviour) worst. A quick suggestion is that if you are in a conversation, try to have all the attention in what the other person is saying instead of being absorbed in your mind. Being focused on what the other person is talking about will make it easier for you to follow with the conversation, asking questions and so on. So try to project your attention OUT of your mind. 
It also seems you have a self esteem issue, and what you say doesn't have the same value compared to what others say, you think you don't worth it. You need to work on that, I had the same problem (and sometimes I still struggle with it). I'm sure you have your strengths, you seem a very considerate person and for sure is not your only strength. So identify them and be really proud of them! On the other hand, you would have weaknesses too, as everyone have.  So you need to acknowledge them and have a proactive attitude to get better at them, but don't beat yourself if you stumble on the path. Be forgiving with you because you are doing your best, little by little. 
For me, a combination of events and efforts had made my self esteem better: I looked for a psychologist and she helped me a lot to change my thinking habits (that were mostly negative and self defeating). Also I started to do yoga, and having time for me and my hobbies. Another thing has been to confront my fears and from here, to recognize the things that I have to improve, as well as those things I did well and I'm proud of. And finally, achieving (some of) the goals that I set for myself. 
I wish you the best and I'm sure you will find the way to be more comfortable in your skin, accept yourself the way you are and try to improve from here. You are not alone! "
2455,isfj,"I suppose you're someone who keep the head cold when everyone else is on their way doing something impulsive.
Don't mistake being thoughtful and considerate for blandness and weakness. None of those things are the same, and I see the two firsts in you. Not the two other."
2456,isfj,"For me my friends always like to make fun of me because it makes me react a weird way. I never know what to do, I just always try to avoid conflict and end up agreeing with them to try and defuse the situation. Is that normal for ISFJ or am I something else?"
2457,isfj,"I get made fun of because I am quiet and don't contribute much to conversations when there are 3+ people around. It happens everywhere, with family and friends. Not so much anymore, as I think I have made it clear I am willing to interact, but it still occurs every once in a while. Gotta love how having the attention on you suddenly makes it all the more awkward and proves their point..."
2458,isfj,"Outwardly I often go with the flow, but on the inside there's a granite wall of determination. I tell myself I will accomplish no matter what. 
Sometimes this is a bad thing, because I will chase after a lost cause of a goal long after I should have just cut ties and let it go. But there is something satisfying in achieving what looks impossible... so sometimes it ends up worth it."
2459,isfj,"My laziness, lack of determination to see something through combined with the low standards I set for myself ensure I'll never be good at anything.
My selfishness and constant desire to be alone killed off whatever social life I had and ensure I'll die alone, with no people at my funeral."
2460,isfj,"Sometimes I get into a slump and fall off schedule and don't stick to my plans. 
I get offended and angry easy. I take things personal a lot.
I have a bitter attitude instead  of dealing with emotions well."
2461,isfj,Low self confidence. I don't handle criticism well. I have a tendency to shut people out emotionally and put up a front for how I would like to be seen rather than how I am. I also have a tendency to hold people to absurdly high standards and then get upset when they fall short. I guess most of the flaws I see in myself are manifestations of perfectionism.
2462,isfj,"This is me, too. I know what I want to say, and I think I'm pretty intelligent and have valid opinions, but I usually wind up getting flustered and fail to get my point across. Especially if I'm challenged before I finish making my point, I'll just shut down sometimes. As you say, it's worse with people I don't know or who are new acquaintances."
2463,isfj,"I don’t watch mbti videos over 10 minutes because they are usually rambling and content light. Like, if the person wrote it down and edited their thoughts, it would only be a page long. But that would be too much effort as opposed to ranting into a camera ¯(ツ)/¯ You also can’t scan a video like you can with text to know if it’s worth reading. 
Honestly, someone let me know if the video conveys the same amount of information I would get from 18 minutes of reading."
2464,isfj,"Hello. I am an isfj male 23yo. I was in a serious relationship (for 2 years) and broke up a year ago. Now I am in a new relationship but I don't feel very connected with her like I was in the previous one. I do really like this girl and want to see things through but somehow I feel that there is a barrier that prevents us to connect on a more deeper level. We've only been dating for about a month if that helps and she is 19 years old. 
Some background story on my previous relationship: the girl was an ESTP I believe. Bottom line was that towards the end of the relationship, she wasn't too eager to hang out with me anymore and preferred spending time with others besides me. I later found out that she had been cheating. 
So I guess my concerns are:
1.) I find it hard to fully trust my SO now even though I know that she's not the same person. I always have anxiety that the same thing might happen again every time I'm away from her. 
2.) when we hang out, and we're just relaxing and cuddling, sometimes it's just quiet and we don't talk about anything so I feel pressured to come up with an interesting conversation. I'm not sure if that's just the way she is (we've only been dating for a month) but sometimes it makes me think that she probably finds me boring which leads me back to my #1 concern. I had her take a personality test once and she tested as an ENFJ. 
3.) I am well aware that couples need space but I feel that I'm happiest when I'm around her even though sometimes we don't do much. I don't want to appear needy to her but that's what ends up happening whenever I get into a relationship. I want to spend every moment I can with them. 
I'm pretty sure I can keep going with the list but I'll keep it short. Basically it all ties into my #1 concern which is anxiety over her leaving because I'm not good enough for her. I felt this way because of how the previous one ended and I feel like it deeply damaged my self esteem. 
Are there any advice you guys can give me as far as overcoming/coping with these feelings. I know that if I don't do something about it now, it will end up dooming the relationship. I want to be better and I want to completely get rid of these walls that I have so that I can allow myself to fully invest my all into this new relationship. "
2465,isfj,"You kinda hit the nail on the head when you admitted that your last breakup impacted your self esteem, as that is the root cause of all the concerns you are mentioning. 
The most important thing that you must realize right now is that you are NOT at fault for being cheated on. That is 100% a failure on your ex's part and you must understand that any reasonable person would go and talk to their SO about what they feel rather than try to find someone else. What your ex did was immature and speaks to a deep character failure that is not in any way related to you at its core. Unfortunately however, what happened to you was a consequence of that flaw.
Unfortunately, as many ISFJ's (myself included) are, we often tend to internalize the causes for things going wrong in our lives, to some extent as least. This feeling of not being good enough sounds like a manifestation of that. I would recommend talking to someone, preferably a therapist, in order to help understand why you are feeling the way you do, and to help you understand that those feelings that you are experiencing are misguided. 
To tackle those three issues directly, the only thing I can suggest is being direct and honest. Just ask her if she is comfortable with silences sometimes, maybe in a more tactful way, or not its up to you. But I would also recommend, most importantly, opening up to her a little bit. Talk to her that you sometimes find it difficult to trust people because of what happened before. I would advise against dumping all of your fears out, but being open with her can go a long way to helping to resolve them. Because you may have a hundred different little things running in your mind, but they all stem from the same source. I'm confident that by being open with her and getting help, this self-doubting you struggle with will resolve itself :)"
2466,isfj,"I've felt anxiety surrounding relationships before as well. Whether it would end, whether I wanted to stay with her, whether I could marry the person in a few years. Stupid stuff.
I tend to dwell a lot on stuff, and it clouds my judgement. I typically worry that without this person, I'm missing out on some great live experiences, or possibly ""the one"" (not religious, but still think about if this is someone I could marry and be with forever). 
I've found: relationships should be easy. You need to enjoy the present moment of the relationship - ask yourself, ""Am I happy today in this relationship?"" ""Are we on the same page as a couple?"". Continue to be honest with her about your feelings, treat her special, and realize she is using her limited time to hang out with you. I'll also say...
You don't need this girl. You KNOW you could live without her. There's a fuck ton of other girls to be with that would like you somewhere out there. Spend time doing shit you love. Become smarter, more informed, more athletic - doesn't matter. If you focus on improving yourself and doing things you like, girls will recognize that.
This girl obviously sees something in you. Have interesting conversations: tell her ""I like how you X, or my favorite thing about you is Y"", tell her about a hobby of yours. Tell her about the random shit you're thinking about. If she doesn't care or doesn't listen, screw it, she's not for you.
In summary: Be who you want to be, do what you want to do, say what you want to say. I know it's easy to get in your SO's head or your own head, but you'll drive yourself crazy if you let it continue. Life is fun man, don't stress :) Also, try meditation (Headspace app) and read Waking Up if you're not convinced it could help you!
Best. "
2467,isfj,"I do agree that being open would help a lot. As for yourself, how do you cope with those feelings of inadequacy (assuming you get them) and how do you not keep going back to the same thoughts over and over and what do you do to stop yourself from having one negative thought and letting it spiral out of control to where you get to a depressed state?"
2468,isfj,"I believe it's because of our introverted nature and our extroverted feeling function. In my case, I do not have a lot of friends so it makes me think that I must not be that interesting. So when someone takes interest in me, I question it and assume that they're probably just curious and once they figure out who I am and how I function, they'll quickly lose interest. "
2469,isfj,"I like the way you delivered your point. Relationships ARE SUPPOSED TO BE EASY! Being an isfj, I tend to overthink a lot of stuff and worry about things most people wouldn't even worry about. It only creates unnecessary stress that can eventually eat away at a potential beautiful partnership. You are definitely right about just being myself. I do tend to mold myself to fit other people's needs/expectations sometimes and that makes me lose sight of who I am. 
I'm curious, are you an ISFJ yourself? "
2470,isfj,"Do you ever get into these moods where you think of something bad and you keep thinking about it that it spirals out of control and you get depressed? If so how do you go about stopping that? How do you cope with stress? 
Also I find that I have the need to serve others and if I don't fulfill that need, I don't feel very accomplished/happy. "
2471,isfj,"I've gotten caught on thoughts before, especially surrounding relationships, and while I don't get depressed, it affects my entire day/week. If it's something I can control I usually do something about it. End things with the girl, have a conversation that needs to be had. 
If it isn't something I can control: accept the situation. A girl just kind of ended things with me, for example. I'm pretty hurt by it. It's a mix between going through my thoughts (""there's more girls"", ""I can focus on myself"", ""were you really that happy with her?"" ""was there ever a future there?"") and then saying ""fuck it. This is how it is. Stop daydreaming about her, what it could have been, looking at photos of her. It only prolongs the pain, I've found. Sometimes it just takes time. 
Serve yourself, man. Good for you for looking out for others, but you need to treat yourself as a human. Like I said before, spend money and time on things that make YOU happy. Really take some time to self reflect on those things and how you can improve yourself. Then you will be in a position to invest yourself into others. (not saying you aren't now, but this will only get better). Also not saying you're not a great person now. But for example, I've been learning spanish, and trying to get better at meditation, and read more. These things excite me :) "
2472,isfj,"That's really good to hear man. If I may ask, how old are you? You seem to be a healthier more evolved isfj because of how you think. I do sometimes get those epiphanies but for the most part I let the thoughts get to me. 
And that's awesome man. See for me, I long for friendships/connections and the moment I meet people who I somewhat connect with, I try to invest myself in them just to try and build a deeper connection with them. I never end up doing/exploring what it is that makes me happy. "
2473,isfj,"To recap: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/45walx/female_entp_trying_to_figure_out_what_went_wrong/ (Also posted in the ENTP subreddit).
Following is an update:
After much soul searching, I got the courage up and asked my ISFJ to talk. We finally got a chance to before leaving work last Thursday. I told him that I see this as temporary until he says it's not. I explained that I never once have taken him for granted. I also explained that I understand that he's been stressed both at work and outside of it, and that he feels that something is wrong. I said that once he figures out what it is, I would like him to let me know, and that we can work on it together. I emphasized that he can take all the time he needs to do so, and that if I found a solution to be wrong from my perspective, to let me know. I reassured him that I still love him. His response was to look thoughtful and say ""ok"". 
Past weekend (including Monday) involved a trip to Tahoe that was self organized with co-workers and friends. We rode in separate cars, stayed in separate cabins and didn't see each other all weekend. 
Sunday messaged him with a link to Disney's Paperman, after discovering it. Turns out he'd already seen it but hadn't thought of it in a while. Friendly chat, with a recap of each other's weekend ensued. Talked about future self-improvement plans. Made sure I signed off first to go in search of dinner.
Yesterday: Bumped into him in the train station on the way home. I went to a local sushi place, had low carb options, and hot sake. Came home really depressed and confused(I suck at waiting). Chatted with one of my best friends in a different state. Saw he'd posted pictures he'd taken of one of my cats (his favorite) on FB, saying how they were terrible (which they weren't). Ended up messaging him on Hangouts:

ME: Hey, you up?
HIM: Yeah, why?
ME: Just saw the (my cat's pics FB) post. Not terrible at all. But that's not why. I realized something tonight and wanted to let you know
HIM: What's that?
ME: I realized why you may have felt like you were taking care of me: you helped me out with a lot during one of the lowest points in my life. No one had ever done that for me before. It was really nice to feel like someone was taking care of me for a change, and I felt safe enough to let go for a short while, as opposed to doing the super independent thing I normally do. I apologize. I thought I could also take care of you the way you were of me. I just wasn't good at figuring out what you needed. You needed someone that was fully independent for once, didn't you?
HIM: Yeah, that would have been nice, but that alone isn't going to make everything work
ME: I'm not expecting it to. I do know that things were fantastic at one point on both ends, if I'm not mistaken. I also know that there is no reason they can't be again, and maybe even better
ME: I'm not asking for an answer now. These are just my thoughts
ME: You smiled at me today when you came to pick up lunch, before you could change your expression. It was the way to used to smile at me, the same smile thr always made me feel like everything was right in the world, no matter how shitty the day was. You tried to be distant in the train, later. You avoid me like you're avoiding something dangerous. Why is that? I can't pretend to know your mind. Th only thing I know is that if I were doing the same in this situation it would be out of a fear of changing my mind, because I'd know that I wasn't sure.
HIM: You're not viewing things the way I am
ME: Maybe not, but I also know that life is to short not to try to fight for the person I love the most.
ME: So tell me how you view it from your perspective.
HIM: I'm not going to talk about this right now. I'm still committed to what I said about us.
ME: And so am I. I still see it as temporary until you say it's not. I am still ok with waiting until you figure out what's wrong. I am still committed to figuring out a solution to that when it comes up. I will still be honest and tell you what wouldn't work from my perspective and work on an alternative, if it comes to that.
ME: I don't care how long I have to wait. Just know that I'm here, that I love you, and that I'm working on myself in the meantime, so that I can be someone that I'm proud of, as well as someone you're proud of.
ME: I also know that I couldn't be the person that I want to be if I didn't try. Not with the way I feel about you.

Note: This is the second time I gave him the chance to tell me the break was permanent, and he didn't. 
Today: Emailed my lawyer to find out the status on my divorce. I avoided my ISFJ all day at work. Around 1 PM got an email back from the lawyer saying something along the lines of ""Oh, sorry, I checked online and your divorce has been finalized since Dec 21, no idea why they didn't send me the paperwork, let me contact a clerk in the courthouse)."" Forwarded it to my ISFJ. His response around 8 PM was "" Man, what a fucking tease. Hopefully this is all good."" Went to a martial arts studio nearby and checked out some classes. Signed up for an intro month. Went to the sushi place again and messaged him through hangouts again: 

ME: In response to your email, I think it is.
ME: I just signed up for a 1 month intro special at a martial arts place around here too
HIM: that's good. Did you go check them out first?
ME: Yeah, I watched 2 of their classes. I'll see after the trial. If not, there are a few in the area that I may check out
HIM: kk, well I hope it goes well
ME: Having low carb meal at (sushi place) right now
HIM: that's nice
ME: Fish mobile! (pic of the fishmobile in question)
HIM: mmhmm. I believe there is one behind you as well
ME: Yup. These are not the fish I'm looking for (in reference to his nickname being Fish)

Extra note: The local sushi place I was at both times was one he'd introduced me to a few months back.
Thoughts? Do I have a snowball's chance in hell of working things out, and if so, what is my best course of action going forward? 
~Same heartbroken ENTP as before"
2474,isfj,"In the previous post, he said he gave it 2 months to feel whether the relationship still feels right, and it didn't- for J types once the decision has been made it is difficult to reverse. When you bring it up he shuts it down quickly because for him the conclusion has already been reached. I guess it may be hard to explain from his point of view because it is something he feels, not a logical answer.
My guess is that he has already made the decision but doesn't want to hurt you by ending the friendship completely, or telling you that the break is permanent.
That is just my view though, for whatever you choose to do, I wish you all the best :)"
2475,isfj,"To be fair, we really have no idea what is going on in his head.
But he is not giving you very good indicators that he still wants to get back together. And I think if I were in this situation, if I realized I wanted to get back together I would tell you. When you bring this stuff up, he instead reminds you he does not want to talk about it.
I think it is time to work on you for you (sounds like you are trying) and do not initiate messages. One you stop initiating contact, see how often he tries to get in touch with you.
I think he is trying to be friendly because he does still care for you. But I think he does not want to get back together.
But, this is all coming from some random ISFJ girl who knows nothing about the guy you're talking about. I do think you should try and wait for him to send a msg first every now and then, tho.
Best of luck. And remember, if he does not work out -- there are many other guys out there. It's always hard when a relationship ends because you thought it would last forever maybe (I have done that once) but with you time you realize that even though that one didn't work out, the next one might really be the one and he will be even more compatible with you, a better fit, etc. ISFJs aren't always that great to date anyways (at least me) -- I seem really sane until I know you well enough to let my crazy come out."
2476,isfj,"He gave it 2 months and still wasn't feeling it, hes not going to come up with a satisfactory  answer for ""whats wrong"" because he relies more heavily on feels than you do, and you can't logic him out of his own feels. "
2477,isfj,"We aren’t a rare personality. Still, I have observed we are one of the most ignored. Just compare the size of this subreddit with the INFJ’s. I understand if other personalities don’t find us interesting enough to talk about but I feel not many ISFJs are enthusiastic about being one. Is it part of the personality itself, to not give too much importance to this kind of thing? (If I come across as generalizing, that’s not my intention, it’s just something that’s been in my mind lately).
Edit:
I just checked, we are the most common one, and infj is the least common. Something seems off to me...
https://www.careerplanner.com/MB2/TypeInPopulation.cfm"
2478,isfj,"Most ISFJs type themselves as INFJ because low quality mbti descriptions depict the difference as being an insightful person who likes systems like the mbti (N) and a milquetoast who should be baking pies or scrap booking for their family (S). 
I do have to say though- I think a lot of ISFJs including myself /are/ kind of boring- and it’s the way we want ourselves to be perceived and go about our lives. We don’t want to rock the boat unless it’s totally necessary. We don’t want to rant about our hobbies unless we know the other party is interested. We are always measuring the group dynamics to ensure harmony and practical solutions to problems. When there’s drama and uncertainty, we tend to beat a hasty retreat if we can. We have an inner life of interesting impressions, personal drama, theories, even whimsy- but it’s locked down for the most part. Leaks in small drops, or in close confidence. 
I went through a lot of descriptions of ISFJ characters in media recently- looking for a role model. I found: ISFJ characters are rarely main characters- mostly side characters who help or serve as foils for main characters. Neville Longbottom- honor his hard work, loyalty, and sacrifice! Harry Potter’s impulsivity, reckless curiosity, and disagreeableness are a lot more interesting. That’s why he’s the main character. Not necessarily better- but definitely more fun to read about. 
All that rambling is to say: yes, lots of ISFJs are mostly boring unless you’re the sort who’s interested in prying their secret, inner life from them. And then only if they let you in. 
Edit: look at this sorry cast 
Watson’s pretty great, but only because he serves as human consultant for Sherlock Holmes. 
If anyone can point me to an ISFJ protagonist who is interesting(not just self effacing and good what what they do) please let me know."
2479,isfj,"I wonder if ISFJs are more lurkers than anything and that's why there aren't more of us contributing to this sub compared to other types. Personally, I mostly use the internet to research and read about things I enjoy. I'm not really that good at expressing myself through social media and internet forums. And I guess that's kind of the way I am in person too, present and involved but not necessarily outspoken. That seems to make us easy to take for granted."
2480,isfj,"I'm not convinced that those percentages are all that accurate. Who's coming up with these numbers? And how are they getting them?
Anyway, when I was first getting into MBTI, I initially typed myself as INFJ. But the more I read about other introverted types, the more I identified with ISFJ.
Plus, INFJs have a complex of self-importance that really agitates me. A lot of them have this air of being special and too ""deep"" and ""complex"" to be understood."
2481,isfj,"well I am an EFNP, I married an ISFJ and there are some awesome gifts that you guys get.
​
Si, introverted Sensing, this is where you have gifts to be attentive to details. Data analyzing, editing, are just a few things to name off that you excel at.
also, you are very detailed in being well prepared for almost everything you do. It amazes me how much my wife will research a job and all the things she has to look up just in case it might be needed.
You also are great at experiencing things, like taste, my wife will stop my conversations just to say ""hold on I want to focus on how good this pasta taste"". That just blew my mind away because even when I am eating something tasty, I am still brainstorming and putting together theories in my head. 
The other thing about being a master of Si, is that you can preemptively, experience things.  You can sense danger faster than anyone but also you can experience happiness, joy, and excitement before anyone.
For example, my wife wanted to stand in a line that was crazy long for a haunted house, and I was so turned off by the idea because of it. I asked, how can you deal with such a long line? She explained that she already starts feeling the excitement of the haunted house while she is waiting. That again, just blew my mind away, what a cool gift to experience excitement before the event actually happens?
So being patient comes easy for you which is so hard for Ns. They are always so future focused that patience in the present moment is very hard indeed to comprehend. 
Not to mention your attention to detail carries over to your memory. You can have almost a photographic memory at times. 
The reason why you also want so many details of what is to happen is because you are so used to comparing every present moment with the past, that you need details to compare the present moment to. Even if that means you have to google everything and read twenty books, etc.
Your gifts for extroverted feeling, aka harmony, are amazing too. My wife loves to make sure I am having fun, and that I am happy, and she will not feel happy until I am.
The other thing that I love about ISFJs, is that their Ti, introverted thinking, is what they like to do for fun.  Introverted thinking is basically engaging in learning new truths. How cool is that? That you like to learn truth for fun? My wife loves to read self improvement books and has so much knowledge to connect with me on working on myself. 
I love my wife and I love ISFJs, especially getting to know their gifts. I think the Si mastery you guys have is amazing! Do not let any ego stompers in the MBTI community tear you down because if they really understood Si, they would think twice.

2482,isfj,"I wish this was a more active subreddit. Why aren't people more jazzed about Si? 
My guess is that people are uncomfortable with being an ISFJ and therefore common and so type as INFJ to be rare and special. I think this happens especially if the person initially feels like they are IXFJ.
Also, the internet hates us for some reason, and thinks we're pretty much only good for boring tasks because of our attention to detail, or sees us as overbearing mothers or grandmothers. So, it's really uncomfortable being hated on lol and maybe just easier to keep silent.
We really need better role models and to hear from more ISFJs."
2483,isfj,"I would say I’m probably ISFJ but have been mistyped as INFJ every time I’ve done a test. I relate to the cognitive functions of ISFJ more. 
I wouldn’t say I was boring, not really deep down, but on the surface I keep things so much to my chest that people don’t really see what’s going on underneath. I look like I have it all together but I don’t really! 
That being said with people I know well I can be really fun, I have a great sense of humour when it comes out, and gosh I relate to being able to give the most thoughtful gifts! I just find social situations a bit overwhelming and tiring work! "
2484,isfj,"No, although without properly setting boundaries like I'm pretty sure immature xxFJs may be prone to do I think that we can find ourselves overextending well beyond what we should which may lead to feeling ignored or underappreciated.
I promise you this: without the relationship I had to an ISFJ woman I would've struggled a lot more in learning to love myself and I'm grateful every day for what we once had!
Not to mention that most Sensing Doms aren't usually too interested in abstract and theoretical concepts if they don't find a practical reason for it which may be why some of xSxx reddits/forums have a smaller population."
2485,isfj,"You are welcome! Oh and I found a new observation on Si, they collect detailed data of the present moment of every object or person, the sensory data, how it tastes, what it looks like, what sounds are in the air, what it feels like, and as they collect that data it passes through their body to have an intense present moment. This is also why they want to be so prepared because they want to make sure they can keep that experience continuous. 
When we go hiking, I just want to bring my coat and I am good but my wife will bring a backpack with water bottles, snacks, and extra warmth clothes. 
Si also loves daily routines, which is a great tool to accomplish goals.
As INFP, you have Si as number 3, which means you love to use Si for fun, relief. You might enjoy being outside or just reflecting on the past, or find yourself developing daily routines on your own accord.
JK Rowling is INFP, her Fi as number one helps her characters come to life with detailed feelings and also incredible will power and resilience to follow through on her story, Ne to brain storm and be creative about her mythology, Si to help encourage her daily tasks to write and also the ability to write the sensory data in her descriptions to make you feel like you were there."
2486,isfj,"INFJ's can be horrible.  Their cognitive stacks set them up to be vindictive and perpetually and constantly cruel to those they do not understand immediately with their leading Ni.  Unlike other types with the same 4 functions as they, the order of their preference sets them up uniquely to be confused in an extraordinary way until they mature enough and their Ni and Fe can cool down and be less vindictive and obsessed with punitively whipping the world into something they can understand and control.  Once mature, I find they can be delightful.  
Given this natural handicap, I feel it is very understandable their online forums can be blown up all the time and scattered everywhere.  I have had to stop following INFJ type groups because they clearly need help from others who....other INFJ's hehe.  They do drive me crazy but I have no desire really to hit them back in ways they clearly feel no hesitation about torturing me.  Frankly, I find it difficult to remain self-mindful enough to refrain from talking shit on them all the time.  That is going to far and well, I feel like an asshole because it is an asshole thing to do.  
That being said I think ISFJ are much, much, much, much, much, much more sensible and your stack makes a lot of sense.  You guys have a cognitive preference that sets you up for success and frankly I would feel happy you don't need to gain tremendous insight on every single minute and trivial detail of the world to stop being horrifyingly arduous and hideous.
<3 ISFJ"
2487,isfj,"True. I KNOW I am boring. I have accepted it and don't consider it a bad thing necessarily (I mean, I recognize most people might find me boring but I am not bored with myself). I would be fooling myself otherwise."
2488,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply, but I was browsing and came upon this comment and I just had to tell you how totally spot-on it is.
I was talking to an INFJ friend recently who was frustrated because she can't relate to the other INFJ's she finds online at all. ""They all seem like boring losers with no backbone,"" she said. And I told her I honestly think a lot of self-proclaimed INFJ's are really ISFJ's because, tbh, ""boring loser with no backbone"" is ISFJ to a tee. (I'm an ISFJ with an INFJ mom, and my passivity, defeatist attitude and general ""boringness"" has been her chief frustration with me for my entire life.)
I'm blissfully boring and take pride and pleasure in playing a supporting role in the lives of more interesting people."

William Tecumseh Sherman

It's mostly a matter of ISFJs choosing to do ""interesting things,"" which applies to all types."
2490,isfj,"Whereas INFJ will be like ""ARGH PEOPLE NO NONO DONT CALL ME I AM LOSING MY MIND OVER YOUR TEDIOUS INSISTANCE TO COMMUNICATE.........WAIT WHY DIDN'T ANYONE CALL ME WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I HAD TOLD EVERYONE TO NOT CALL ME UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND I HAD MY PHONE OFF ALL WEEK BUT YOU GUYS HATE ME AND YOU ARE STUPID I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AND OMG NOW IT IS TIME TO MAKE YOU SUFFER I WILL TORTURE YOU AND GET YOU FIRED AND I WILL STAB YOU IN THE NUTS WHY DOESN'T ANYONE UNDERSTAND ME I AM REALLY NICE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU HAVE TO READ MY MIND
iSFJ ....... No
You guys are like ""k"" or ""No""
<3"
2491,isfj,"I agree about the percentages as well. Personally, I think that every type is close in average with each other in terms of population. A lot of these studies I’ve seen are often done in smaller groups of people. Plus, there is always the chance that someone can be inaccurately typed. I’ve tested INTJ on Tests when I’m an ISFJ.  I do think there are more uncommon types but, not to those extreme percentages. There are over 7 billion people in the world and I don’t think that 2% of them are INFJ. "
2492,isfj,"You guys are awesome just the way you are.  You don't need to be the center of attention and you are fine and you got things you need figured out but creating a lot of drama in some disengenuous drama play isn't your thing.  
I appreciate that, as INFP.  I find it very humbling, with my whacked out Ne basically boring the shit out of my ISFJ partner.  She is extremely focused on what she is trying to learn and understand, and my whacked out rambling just is not something she has time for, and I am learning a lot about myself and everything from trying to understand her perspective.  Leading Si for the win!"
2493,isfj,It truly is.  Any perusal of their sub for 10 seconds you start to understand that understanding the most trivial and mundane things is something they delight in realizing that they are unique because it is hard to like completely comprehend and like wow......HOLY wow
2494,isfj,"Oh man I am still such a noob at Reddit, please check this thread again if you want more details of Si as well how it is part of being INFP, I meant to post to your reply but of course I missed and responded to the main thread instead"
2495,isfj,"I just said I'm blissfully boring. I don't consider myself a loser (but in the context of what my friend was saying, I am; she basically just meant unambitious) and having no backbone is straight up terrible, but nevertheless true about me and I think a lot of ISFJ's. We tend to be very passive; you acknowledged this yourself in your comment (""beating a hasty retreat"" from conflict).
Apologies for insulting you."
2496,isfj,"I will accept your ISFJ as a girls type and I will raise you INFP as a girls type.  
I actually disagree, keep your head up :)  Gender stereotypes not helpful as like, society is frankly idiotic in such regard.  Men can cry, men can have a million things on their mind, men can well I feel like an asshole just thinking of the stereotypical male and what not.
I appreciate your comment, I hadn't considered your point of view.  I do know that INFP males can be considered........not manly men but I will wear my pink shirt and purple pajamas out and ya well I don't care anymore."
2497,isfj,"Do ISFJs have a problem with being very polite that they don't want to hurt other people feelings even if those keep imposing their self on them, and keep nudging them in their price less ""alone time""..this thing keep one of my relatives very stressed and intense  "
2498,isfj,"yeah. it's a problem. i try to remind myself that ""sacrificing happiness"" isn't really a thing. it's more like i have a list of wants and if i don't get them all i feel bad. because if i decide to get my alone time i'll still feel bad if it meant hurting someone else's feelings, in a way i could say i sacrificed their happiness for my own.
anyways, the wants are 1) don't hurt their feelings and 2) get my alone time. 
so the best solution i figured for these situations is me explaining to people in as honest and as detailed a way as possible, and in such a way that they can understand without getting mad or offended: how i feel, how i need my alone time, and how they are people i care about to X degree and am worried about hurting their feelings but i have my own priorities as well and i can't neglect my needs."
2499,isfj,"Hello ISFJs! I've seen on a few other MBTI subreddits ""Faces of <insert subreddit here
I thought I might give us ISFJs an opportunity to do the same. So, what do you look like fellow kind-hearted, pragmatic, organized, conflict hating people?
I'll break the ice. Here is me! http://i.imgur.com/Ofb5KCy.jpg

Here I am! http://i.imgur.com/ES82hZV.jpg
I'm about to have an interview for a job where I get to muck about in the forests of Central British Columbia for the summer mostly by myself. An introvert's dream haha. "
2501,isfj,"That's funny that you mention how smiley we are. In high school a lot of people commented on how I smile ALL the time. It didn't matter if I was having a shitty day or a good one. I almost always had a smile on my face. I still try to do that to this day.
Maybe being smiley is an ISFJ thing!"
2502,isfj,"I'm an isfj and I finished my masters in computer science two years ago. What i really love about it is the programming itself, especially when it can help me to somehow improve something (e.g. programming a small tool to help us keep track of electricity expenses at home). I started going into science and started my PhD in bioinformatics but quickly realized it is not for me. I really don't have the interest and motivation to go into so much detail. So I am starting a programming job soon, where I work in teams a lot. And I'm really looking forward to it. As for java script, i have never worked with it but in my experience which programming language you use doesn't really matter, if you know a few, you can learn (almost) all of them pretty quickly. (I love python though!)"
2503,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ software engineer and I love it. I started programming for fun when I was young, so it's always been a passion of mine. In my experience, I thrive best in smaller/mid-sized tech companies. The hardest part for me was building my confidence, because I was a bit quiet and modest. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, but also know when to put in your best effort first. We encourage a lot of demos and presentations in my dev team, which I used to always shy away from, but they matter less than you think they do and it's really all about taking pride in your work, sharing knowledge with the team, and gathering constructive feedback. As soon as I realized that I got a lot more confident.
​
In specifics to JavaScript, what language you can be good at doesn't really matter, but that's a decent language to pick up first. It's popular and easy to learn. To extend off of learning just JavaScript, there are a lot of frameworks based on it like Angular and React which are popular, or node.js for server-side."
2504,isfj,"I'm INTP and a ""programmer"" myself. My wife is ISFJ she's not, but she has a lot of affinity with the technical part of computers (might be because of me) and I think she would go pretty quick about it if she wanted to. But she doesn't want to. Well, no hard feelings, there are lots of other important jobs.
As for how it fits with the personality, I'm not sure. My idea with ISFJs is that they deal with people pretty directly as that gives them satisfaction (correct me if I'm wrong). Sitting in front of a computer screen all day doesn't look like an ideal day for an ISFJ. Luckily, most programmers don't. "
2505,isfj,"I'm a web developer who uses JavaScript as my primary client-side scripting language, and I really like my job. The problem-solving aspect of it is EXTREMELY satisfying, but that also means that there's often a fair amount of frustration leading up to that point. But it really is amazing what you can do with a text editor and a web browser, and knowing how to program really opens up your understanding of how the internet works. 
​
My biggest challenge was learning my first programming language. Most programming languages use the same general concepts, but the syntax and feature set vary from language to language. However, those core concepts can be a bear to learn. To give you some insight, I studied history and communications in college and did NOT have any sort of technical background. My programming skills are self-taught, and it took a long time to adjust the way I think to how this sort of thing works, especially when the concepts conflict with my prior knowledge. For example, in basic algebra, ""x = 5"" is a statement that indicates that a variable, x, has a value of 5. It's an informational statement. However, in programming, the equals sign (=) is an ""assignment operator,"" so the same expression is actually declaring a variable called x and setting the value equal to 5. Code is active and provides instructions to the computer, so everything your write tells the computer to do something. It may seem basic, but it takes a little while to get used to. 
​
Fortunately, JavaScript is a great language to start with. It's a little easier to understand, it's EXTREMELY popular, and there are a ton of resources spread across the internet to help you learn. Just be patient, and don't beat yourself up. It'll take some time. 
​
Last thing, from the perspective of an ISFJ, remember that, even though the programming itself is a pretty solitary process, working as a developer is much more collaborative. You work with other devs, designers, content managers, business owners, etc to make a full project. Lots of communication and lots of teamwork. 
​
Good luck! "
2506,isfj,"@Lewistrick - Programming has to be the perfect career for NTs, but I think specifically INTPs. Considering we're in the same quadra and use the same functions in different orders - it makes sense to me why an ISFJ may consider this path (our Ti/Ne 3rd, 4th). I notice especially as I get older I enjoy using Ti/Ne more, which is clearly handy with programming. To be honest, the biggest appeal to me is the potential to work remotely to have the freedom in which to work where I want. The content appears stimulating, although I'm slightly impatient in the learning process. I think the path would be a nice balance - so when I'm not working - I can give that Fe side of myself to those I actually really care about. "
2507,isfj,"@JayB127 Thanks for the insight, much appreciated. I'm a bit of an odd-duck of an isfj who actually is looking for more independence and the ability to work remotely (preferably entirely) to have the freedom of where I work. Meaning, the solitary part of the job is actually appealing to me. As well, the fact a degree is generally not necessary, it requires stretching your mind, and the pay is good also fits the bill for what I'm looking for. I suppose as I get older (29), I enjoy more of the Ti side of my personality.
Anyway, how did you get over feeling overwhelmed or unmotivated due to knowing how long it takes to become, well, good enough to lock-down a job? What was your learning style like (interested to hear coming from a fellow ISFJ)? Did you allot a certain amount of time daily to learn/practice? How long did it take you? I hear varying things on the amount of time it takes to learn, but no one seems to mention the basis behind it (i.e. is this 2 or 3 years of practicing 8 hours a day, 1 hour a day, etc.). I know everyone is different, but having an idea may help with motivation. I'm getting a bit frustrated because I want the knowledge already to play and master- but feel like it's so far-reaching at the moment. I'm going the self-teaching route as well, and am only just a beginner. I'm using FreeCodeCamp at the moment and only halfway through CSS so I have a ways to go. Ultimately I want to focus on JavaScript, as my understanding, and as you mentioned, this is very popular.
Anyway, sorry for the wall of free-flowing text. Hope it made sense..."
2508,isfj,"Without fail all the ISFJ's I've been around eventually do this creepy thing where they start adopting my idiosyncracies, tastes, style etc. my housemate even buys the same food I buy. This is off putting to say the least.
Is this an intentional thing? If so, what do you expect to be achieved by doing this?"
2509,isfj,"I can't say that this is something I consciously do, if I do it at all, and it's never been brought to my attention. The closest I get is picking up the occasional favorite word or phrase or maybe a speech pattern, but that's something that happens to everybody. If this is truly happening, I'd be inclined to say it's probably a function of Si, picking up things that are familiar and therefore comfortable. Given your post though I'm equally inclined to think you're just sort of self-centered and they're not actually copying you. "
2510,isfj,"Perhaps it's an unconscious tendency then
Not everybody does this, well I certainly don't. 
Oh it's happening alright
"
2511,isfj,"I was very ready to just delete this post cause tragic, not sure why I thought it was a good idea to post this here but obviously wasn't in vain since you saved the day with this very insightful gem! So helpful, thank you! 
Lawddd you even got me thinking I might be an INTJ 
EDIT: 
How then can I bring it to light and address this? "
2512,isfj,"The reason it's obvious to me I'm being copied is cause I have a specific esoteric taste, wouldn't call it impeccable. All I wanna know is if this is an unconscious thing ISFJ's do perhaps Fe related or it's intentional? I want to address this with them but thought I should ask here for some insight on this tendency beforehand."
2513,isfj,"i don't know what to tell you.
i do tend to try to figure out what people do different and why and if it's better than what i'm doing. and try to add what i can into what i do to do more and better. but that doesn't sound like what you're describing."
2514,isfj,"Maybe they're subconsciously trying to demonstrate acceptance for you by appropriating to themselves what other people might find weird (group distinguishing) about you, as a show of solidarity (in other words you've formed your own little tribe and these are its accoutrements), despite the fact it runs counter to the mainstream or whatnot (this is actually very sweet, if its what's happening, I think--because going against the group is a sacrificial and meaningful thing to them)."

What to say more ? There's nothing to do with that much dichotomies missing. "
2516,isfj,"Ah I never enjoy being an inspiration of any sort, I like to be seen and interacted with on equal footing, heck I'd take underestimated than admired. So hearing this adds to the discomfort level. 
The way I see it, if I'm direct in telling them I'd like it to stop I am helping them as much as myself since it's really not a healthy practice. 
This is honestly more effort than I'm willing to give in this particular instance,  I can understand where you're coming from in terms of trying to understand the person, but I have a feeling it will become one-sided, at what point will she attempt to understand my perspective aswell. It's all very urgh and draining, forever walking on eggshells trying not to rock the boat especially in these circumstances as we have to live together till the end of semester. 
Looking forward to seeing this transpire, might start 'liking' questionable food combinations to speed up the process keke :)
Thank you! It was helpful once again, even though it might seem like I am already set on what to do I'm really digesting it all and weighing up my options. It's impressive how much you know about the workings of ISFJ's, they're everywhere aswell so very beneficial knowledge to yourself. "
2517,isfj,"It's not cute or sweet to me people forcing themselves to be something/someone they're not. Especially as it's evident I'm already 'out there' so don't need  'acceptance', should be obvious I expect that others do their own thing aswell. "
2518,isfj,"they're willingly taking it on because that's who they are, its an authentic form of expression
you're simply projecting how you would feel if you were acting as they are, which would be inauthentic, but that doesn't mean they are, because their personality is different and they see things differently
you gotta learn to take compliments in the spirit they're offered
I mean really, do you expect the whole world to operate according to your standards?
as for your type its pretty obvious you're a Fi of some kind and probably with weak Ne because you seem to be unable to recognize other points of view, so probably an unhealthy ISFP (all the ""I must be an intuitive!"" is classic tert Nx overconfidence).  you're welcome"
2519,isfj,"I toyed you were one. You forgot Ne dom's Devil's advocate tendancies.
PS : You lean towards xNFP, to me.
Not enough introspective for an Introvert, but we never know. Your posting rythme may have given me some more definite clues about that, but I didn't checked.
Bubbly and argumentative. Smooth talker. Ne is obvious, but not sure if Ti or Fi right after. I just bet mildly blindly on feeler over thinker.
There is no chance someone mistake you for some sensor. You're a worthy soon to become memelord.

2520,isfj,"I understand that, but I also don't have to accept it because it doesn't sit well with me despite whether they mean well or not, they too should try and understand that. For me it's not right, I guess what I'm trying to say here is that ISFJ's approach to things is very foreign to me in a way that it contradicts and clashes with my values. "
2521,isfj,The thing is I don't even have that N type superiority thing going on. I made this post awhile back and it's pretty much still how I view things.
2522,isfj,"I don't think you really understand them because if you did it would sit well with you.  You're basically asking them to extend themselves in a way you're likewise unwilling to, making you a hypocrite preoccupied with trivial superficiality while missing the underlying concept
its cool if you want to die on this hill.  have fun being alone forever or surrounded by clones, somewhat ironic given your superficial preoccupation with uniqueness"

I cannot relate to this, but I've said before that INTP's (who I adore, and think are the best thing since sliced bread) have a tendency to bend over backwards and compromising their authentic selves trying to accommodate SFJ's which is rarely ever the case vice-versa.

2531,isfj,"yeah, If I'm having a conversation with someone, and i go all in for it - i will hold the eye contact. consistently. but if I'm somehow nervous for any reason due the person I'm talking to or the settings,, eeeh I guess I hold consistent eye contact in 7/10 of the conversations I'm having.  I have noticed people looking away many times, so I try to not hold it too long. the stalker part? I don't have much of a stalker in me. "
2532,isfj,"If I'm uncomfortable around someone, I'll hold eye contact and then break it away, over and over.  It gives the impression that I'm nice/quiet/shy, which is what I want people to think of me when they first meet me (or, sometimes, it gives the impression that I'm awkward.)  If I'm comfortable with you, I'll hold eye contact for a reasonable amount of time.  I like eye contact.  It helps me read you better, know what you're feeling, and how you're reacting to me."
2533,isfj,"I'm really bad at eye contact... I'm always looking somewhere else. I'm working on it, though!
And I'm most definitely a closet stalker. I love learning about people!! Plus I have a great memory. But sometimes I forget about boundaries and offend someone by reading over their shoulder or something."

As for the stalking, I have no clue where that rumour came from lol. I'd say I'm a good ""researcher"" so I tend to find random information quite easily but there's no need to stalk someone. It's a lot of work."
2535,isfj,"Hey guys, TL;DR at the bottom. Sorry for the long read. I'm writing this instead of studying, lol.
​
I'm a 24-year-old ISFJ (male).  I am currently in grad school and about 7 months ago, I got into my first ever romantic relationship. She's 24 as well and we go to the same school.  I poured my heart out for this woman and if she ever needed anything, whether that be emotional support or anything else, I dropped everything I was doing to help her. She is the first woman I kissed and I lost my virginity to her.
​
She had thoughts that I'm not into the relationship or that I just view her as a platonic friend, but each time I (and I'm not lying when I said this) I ensured her that I truly cared for her. She (somewhat infrequently) had doubts about us but time and time again I was there for her and ensured her that I wanted to be with her because of her and not because she's the first woman I've been with. Even in the moments where she questioned the relationship, if she was in need of emotional support, I was still there for her. At one point she even asked me why I stuck around with her, and I told her that I saw the good in her and I wanted to be with her.  It is true that I am naive about romantic relationships and how its like to be one, and I learned what its like to be in one as time progressed.
​
Cut to mid-April last month, and these feelings came up again and this time we sort of broke it off. We talked, texted, and hung out still. I even spent the night two nights in a row at her place during this time because she was feeling emotional but she explicitly told me it didn't mean anything. We didn't have sex but we did kiss.
​
The very next week, after we didn't see each other on the weekend, I hung out with her again on Monday. We were still kinda ""broken up"" but I went to her place after classes and ate dinner and watched TV in her bedroom. We kissed and almost had sex but we stopped because she said it wouldn't be right. She then essentially asked me if I love her, and I responded that I do. I've been in love with her for a while, I just kept those feelings to myself because I was scared that she didn't feel the same way, so I never told her. But I told her that I do love her, and she said, ""I think I love you, too."" I spent the night with her for the next three days and we constantly said I love you to each other. On Wednesday night, while we were having sex, I told her how much I loved her as I held her hands, but she was having her period so we stopped (she said its nothing I did wrong).
​
Cut to Thursday. We wake up and I go home for the day while she goes to school. Thursday night, she, a close friend (a male who she frequently hangs out with one-on-one) of hers, me, and a good buddy of mine go out to a bar. She was fine in the beginning, but as she drank more, she got very cold towards me, and would smile at her close friend. My buddy asked her how she and I were doing, and she replied ""ehhhhhh."" Throughout the night, if I said anything to her, she would push me away, tell me to fuck off, and then smiled at her close friend. When I asked if I could walk her home, she said, ""no, close friend can walk me home."" (they live in the same apartment right by the bar we went to.) So I went to hug her goodbye and she gave me this awkward side hug. I was feeling very down after this and my buddy and I talked about it. I didn't sleep the entire night.
​
The very next day, at 7:30, she texts me and then calls me asking if my buddy talked to me after I left as to what happened that night. I told her we did. After a 30-minute conversation, she broke up with me (she said that drunk words are sober thoughts, so when she said ""ehhh"" to my buddy, that's how she truly felt). I was in tears, so about three hours later, I texted her asking if we could actually talk in person. She was hesitant but she obliged.
​
When we met up, I told her how she treated me at the bar and she immediately started shaking (we talked in her car). We drove a short bit and as I was talking about what she did, she had to stop driving because she couldn't stop shaking. For the next three hours, we talked and I was confused as to why she felt this way despite her saying I love you to me only three days prior. I told her that she smiled at her close friend every time she told me to ""fuck off,"" but she said she wants nothing to do with him and that she's never cheated on me (I believe her when she says this about the cheating). Essentially, she told me she said she loves me as well that because she was feeling lonely. Her feelings about being not sure about us went away when I told her I loved her, but after Thursday the warm fuzzies came back. She then said that we stopped having sex on Wednesday because it didn't emotionally feel right, rather than when she said it was her period at the time that we stopped.  She said she gets the ""warm fuzzies"" when she talks to one of her ex-boyfriends (i'm aware that she still talks to him and I don't care) but she also gets warm fuzzies when she talks to her close friend that I mentioned earlier (despite her saying she wants nothing to do with him when I told her that she smiled at him the entire night). She said she doesn't know what she wants and that she is going to date around this summer (she asked me if I'd be okay with it and I said I don't care what you do) and she asked me to date around as well. I told her no, I'm not going to date around. It will take a long time to get over my feelings for you.) She asked me to hate her, to call her a bitch, to be mad at her, etc., bit I told her despite all of this, I'm still in love with her and that I'm not mad at her and I don't think I can be.  She wanted to stay friends because she said, ""I'm one of the few people who get her,"" and I obliged because I truly appreciate her as a human being and care for her. She dropped me off and that's that.
​
The next couple of days, we barely talked to each other. One day, (as we are going through finals) texted me telling me how stressed out she is. I texted her back and after a bit of back and forth, she felt better. Later that night, she texts me again that she's stressed out, and she FaceTimed me in tears with how stressed out she was. I comforted her and I told her I'm always here for you and I stayed on FaceTime with her until she fell asleep. After that, more radio silence. Then again she texts me how stressed she is and I agree to go get food with her to calm her down. This happened two days in a row. She called me the second night stressed again and I talked her through it and made her feel better.
​
Two days ago from today, she texts me if I'm at school studying and if she could bunker up with me for the day. I said sure. We studied for a bit but more or less talked throughout the day. She asked me if she could download Hinge and Bumble on my phone (as an ISFJ, this made me chuckle) and I told her I'm kinda uncomfortable with it because I don't know how I feel. She told me she appreciates what we have (Friendship) and that she doesn't want anything else. I told her OK maybe I will date this summer, and we just talked about how our relationship was in the beginning (with me being awkward, not making the move to kiss her, etc.) She asked if I wanted to go on a walk with her, so we did, and we talked about personal stuff from our past and our goals for the future.
​
Yesterday, we went on another walk and had a casual conversation. There was an end-of-the-year party last night, and she asked if I was going. I was (most of my good friends weren't going) so I talked with people who I wasn't close with. She got there and she was kind of cold towards me, and flirty with her close friend I mentioned earlier. Some person I briefly talked to sort of flirted with me but I was just so shut down from it I felt bad and I went home immediately after.  I told her bye and she just gave me a high-five.  I saw her walking back alone with that close friend.  Just now (right before I made this post) she called me while I'm studying and asked if she could just vent. She apologized for bothering me and I told her no, so she vented for about 10 minutes, then hung up.
​
SO FINALLY, this is my predicament.
I still feel strongly for her. I still love her. The days where we barely talk suck, but the days I get to see her and talk with her feel good. Even if she's talking about how she's stressed, I still feel great just talking to her and listening to her problems and making her feel better. When I saw her being flirty with the close friend (who she again says she wants nothing to do with), it ate away at me and I felt empty inside. I poured my heart out for her (and I feel like I continue to do so), despite everything that's happened. I feel exhausted and my heart bleeds every single day for her, but I keep answering the phone and wanting to see her because I can't distance myself. I'm just so exhausted, both physically and mentally. I get no sleep. I need to put myself first for once but I literally just cannot. I cannot bear the pain I would possibly bring her by making her feel alone.
WHAT DO I DO???
​
TL;DR My first girlfriend ever at the age of 24 broke up with me because she doesn't know how what she wants (despite telling me how happy I make her and that I'm always there to emotionally support her) but she still calls/texts me for emotional support/when she's feeling stressed. I keep answering the phone and I cannot bear the pain I would possibly bring her by making her feel alone."
2536,isfj,"This is going to sound harsh, but you need to stop doing this to yourself. Right now she’s treating you like a mat that she can walk all over. This is a classic example of emotional abuse, you need to cut contact with her.    
Mend some old friendships, find your passions, reach out to your support systems. Focus on yourself, don’t let the toxic mindset of “I’d feel bad if I wasn’t there for her” consume you. She left you and is abusing her emotional power over you."
2537,isfj,"Head over to r/ExNoContact and read all the top posts of all time. Also the sidebar' articles. Your brain is addicted currently.  The pain will come in waves, but it will be further and further apart. Time will heal and it will be okay. If it's not okay, give it more time."
2538,isfj,"I can agree with what is above. You need to cut ties, not answer your phone because that behavior is draining for you despite saying those days make you feel great at the rate the relationship (relationship in a generalized term) has declined and shows no sign of going anywhere that would be good for yourself. You need to help yourself. She’s made her choice by being cold to you durning events that “the friend” is present, that there should be enough to make you question her honesty with you. I don’t know about you but I don’t care much for people that are misleading or liars, even ones that aren’t lying to me."
2539,isfj,"You don’t ever tell a woman that you love her man, she’s the type of girl that likes being treated bad, now, that doesn’t mean you necessarily have to treat her bad, you just don’t give her the love she deeply craves, crazy man , It’s very long to explain but yeee, some females are backwards"
2540,isfj,"I've been told this by numerous people, and I agree that its the right thing to do.  I need to go nuclear and just cut contact with her.  It just makes me feel guilty because I consistently told her that I would always be there for her (during the relationship and after the breakup).
Do you recommend anything that would make me feel less guilty? I literally just want to tell her, ""[Name], I think I'm at the point where I can't talk to you anymore.  I still have strong feelings for you/love you, and the more I talk to you the stronger my feelings get, and it is physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to battle these feelings.  I'm very sorry but I hope you can respect this decision.  After I've taken some time to heal, I think we can become friends, but the pain is just too much right now.  Have a good summer."""
2541,isfj,"I agree with you.  Especially the part of being cold to me when ""the friend"" is around.  I don't think I've been hurt like that before when she did it the day before she broke up with me.
I do need to help myself.  But for some reason I look past all of this bullshit and try to see the good in people.  And you're absolutely right, the behavior is draining for me.  I personally think (like someone else in this post said) that she has been treated very poorly in the past, and when someone like me poured their heart out for her, she did not know how to react.
I'm on the same page as you regarding liars.  I always told her that she could be honest with me and I wouldn't be mad at her.  She's even asked me to yell at her because she deserves it for some things she's done, but I refused to because she was honest.  Fuck man, I need to just cut ties and let my heart heal."
2542,isfj,"Those type of things get said often during breakups but never come to fruition. People move on and it’s not going to help you heal by having her tear up old wounds by contacting you for emotional support.   
I wouldn’t say “I still have strong feelings for you”. But keep it along the lines of it not being emotionally healthy for you to keep having contact with her. If you truly think you can be friends with her down the road (rarely works), just tell her you need some time to yourself to heal.   
It’s hard to think about, but one day you will want to be in a relationship that will reciprocate the care that you put in. This phase of being “broken up” but you’re her emotional support isn’t good for you. You’re not ever going to turn the chapter with how things are going right now."
2543,isfj,"I think you're right.  I'm so hung up over her that ""turning the chapter"" would be near impossible.  Like at the party I saw her at yesterday, a woman flirted with me, but then I saw my ex in the background and I sort of froze up.  I wasn't acting rude to the woman, but I just wanted to leave immediately and I felt terrible.  
​
I don't think I'm in a place to date at all, not for a while, at least."
2544,isfj,"It’s healthy to realize that. I was in a 5.5 year relationship with the first girl I dated and lost my v card to. You’ve sunken a lot, emotionally, into this relationship. It took me a year or two to start comfortably dating again.   
It’ll be difficult for the first few weeks but I would just focus on your academics/friendships/hobbies. You’ve been so focused on someone else that you completely forgot about taking care of yourself."
2545,isfj,"That last sentence speaks volumes.  I need to put myself first and take care of myself so I can be the best that I can be.
Maybe then I will be ready to date again.  It might take a while, but it'll be for the better.
Thank you."
2546,isfj,"I'm proud of myself for wanting and trying to get better, as a mildly depressed, probably ADHD, currently unemployed college dropout. And I'm proud of myself for saving my money, and for finally learning to crochet so I can make beautiful things. 
I think that's all I've got right now, but hopefully the list will start to grow again soon. Thanks for making this post! A little self-appreciation is a good thing once in a while :)"
2547,isfj,"Right now, I'm proud of moving on from a dwindling relationship so well. My boyfriend, an esfp, apparently lost interest, but I guess just being nice, let me continue to be infatuated and hang around him. He was gradually less nice as time went on and eventually I was the one doing all the work. But, as a man myself, I made my peace with the truth that he was communicating through his actions that he'd lost interest. So I confronted him, also proud of that, in a kind and listening manner asking how things were. I knew full well that I'd not like the answer, but I could also tell that he didn't want to continue going out. In the spirit of fairness I offered him an out, he didn't take it right away, said he needed to think about it, but 4 days later decided he wasn't willing to keep the relationship. I do worry for him, he is a good guy, and I fear he might be getting down on himself, I know that was what I was expecting of myself. But I'm proud of how I took charge in the relationship by slowing it down for a minute and evaluating it with my ex, working together one more time to realize it wasn't going anywhere good. I'm proud that I was a part of a relationship that did wonders for my self-confidence. Ultimately though, I'm proud that he's the one losing out, and not me, but I have him to thank for that. He'll always have a place in my heart as will volleyball and sweet tea, both things he introduced to me.  
Thank you for providing me the venue to actually say all that ""aloud."" I appreciate you! "
2548,isfj,"I would have something to be proud of, if I wasn't about calling on that ""self love"" as circlejerk.
I'm an hopeless jerk. I don't even try to hide it anymore. I wear it.
And that's not even my worst mark of shame. I collect them like we used to collect Pin's in the 90's.
Pride isn't a capital sin for nothing.

PS : Heh, called it. It do is a circlejerk. A hugbox circlejerk, for those who like precision and accuracy. I remain true to my words. Ignoring and punishing by votes won't do anything. You'll need to face me and talk to me : I don't see why I should do anything differently in here."
2549,isfj,"I'm proud of you, too! That sounds like a difficult situation that you handled really gracefully, and I'm so happy that you came out of it not only okay, but feeling good about yourself. That's wonderful, and you definitely should be proud! 💕"
2550,isfj,"For real, I'm not gonna argue with you but you got downvoted for being rude and telling a group of people who pretty frequently suffer from low self-esteem anyway that trying to be proud of ourselves for once is ""circlejerking"". If you can't see the unkindness in that, that's your problem, not ours. Also, lose the victim complex, will you? It's not cute."
2551,isfj,"Thanks! And it is!! In a way it feels really empowering lol, like I can make my own clothes! Blankets! Stuffed animals! I never have to buy anything made of cloth ever again! I still have to buy yarn, but I choose to ignore that fact and pretend I've escaped capitalism forever because I'm a yarn wizard  in training now. "
2552,isfj,"Too late. ""Don't feed the troll"", they say. We feed from attention.
I suffer from that too. I should tell you you'll find no self esteem that way, but I prefer relying on your representations, and telling you I do that exactly because I'm a jerk, and I like to piss off people for no reason.
You're free to understand my motivations here however you please. I'll remain uncorrected regardless.
I don't care about being cute. I prefer to be a jerk with a point.
I think I'm tired to be beaten ot of loosing that victim complex. It can't work, and you all know it. I just don't know how to lose it, and hoped people with better ethics than mine could give a hand.
But seems you aren't here for that.
I see my unkindness. You just refuse all to see my point. It's your problem you're refusing to face. I just happen to embody it."
2553,isfj,"""Yeah well that's just like your opinion, man"" . No, but seriously, my intentions with this post was bringing a bit of good vibes to a sub that usually is talking about topics like depression or how to cope... And even if your point was valid or not, it was not appropriate. So yeah, thanks for your input and messing this up ;) "
2554,isfj,"Depressing indeed. I think I don't read what's in here as faithfully as you. It just feels empty when I do.
I suppose blandly fluffy and nice is better than just bland and factual.
As if my previous comments didn't served enough as a disclaimer, I want you to take my cynical Ne-dom opinion with the fittest grain of salt.
Sighs of resign
""Not appropriate"". 
I'm parted between :


Insulting you of consensual blind idiot. I'm convinced it'll get my point across with the greatest efficiency.


Asking you what you think ""what's appropriate"" is exactly, playing the dumb. I know what it is, but you won't like my answer.


The last is about playing by your rules and just leave. As you're reading, you know it'll only for the next comment from me. I just can't follow those rules, despite knowing them. It's about time you eventually realize that. I'm some kind of antagonist to you, here. Don't expect me giving up on that role.


Huh-huh. It's not messed up enough. I strive for depth."
2555,isfj,"Yeah, actually. I was a white knight troll, younger. It says a lot.
Now, I'm just a casual. I make up some shit of this kind, and see what happen. I put some oil on the fire if necessary. Sometimes it's fun, sometimes it's my duty. Here, I'm here for business.
You'll be the only one waiting for me. No one here even remember why I subscribed to this sub in the first place. 
I just wanted to be cared about, but everyone is busy."
2556,isfj,"You don't even actually make any sense. Are you here to ~cut through the bullshit~ (newsflash, there is none), or are you here because you thought we would be nice to you? Either way, you're just as full of shit as any of the rest of us, if not more so. This tantrum is unproductive and frankly boring, and certainly isn't going to make anyone here feel any more kindly towards you. 
If you want our kindness, earn it. We're fucking ISFJs, seriously, Fe is our auxiliary function. Either you're purely a troll, in which case we can just ban you and be done with it, or you desperately need to consider your audience and restrategize. "
2557,isfj,"Cute usage of tilde as asterisks. It doesn't help for me to take you seriously.
Hum. I'd say neither, when the Ne dom code states I should say ""why not both ?"".
I'm here to slap bitches and fuck up everything I can.
You wouldn't have answered me if I was that boring. I thrive on this doubt you hold.
What amuses me is it's what I like the most in people : those who know how to question and show themselves vulnerable.
I'm just your mirror. If you accuse me of being boring, I can't help but wonder what it means about you. ~<3
I don't give a shit, because I don't give a fuck.
I more than asking for kindness, I'm a reminder of what happens with thanks to this kind of hug parties. It just doesn't work like you all seems to think it does, here.
It's a minority report I'm doing, and I do it as it should be done : formatted with your grind of reading.
Mmmh, let me think … Nah.
There is plenty of reasons for that, but I'd rather more you spend some effort finding them.
So you earn that answer, instead of me feeding you with it. Fair enough to you ?
Then use it. =)
I haven't seen it much. I keep disturbing the conversation freely in there.
Or maybe I'm meant to slip between your finger like water.
I could use my Ne for the same argument of authority, but I aim showing you it doesn't hold much on my thinking. I suppose you'd like I spare you the sarcastic antic I'm thinking about.
Let me see …
A boring threat of ban and an invitation to play another game.
Well, I'm game. I'm a fan of semi transparent strategies like the one I'm pulling off here, but I'll have to tell you you're up for more opacity, from me.
You know, like those eastern one liners that were once eloquent metaphor, and ended up as demented aphorism. I'm some kind of specialist of that. Mangled with an eye staining prose I have the secret. It's passed from generation to generation in my family : a secret nobody can understand.
I can let you this choice, too : More crap, or paying it straightforwardly. I'm personally indifferent.
I hope you're able to see through my mockeries better than how you read me beforehand. You proven yourself manichean and simplistic, here. Show me I'm wrong.
Your turn."
2558,isfj,"Hi guys,
I'm new here and I was wondering about what kind of careers or studies people here are doing. Online I find that such a type usually becomes a medical worker, teacher or social worker. I however am studying computer science which is completely different from the ""usual"" things. Is this just a stereotype or am I perhaps wrongly typed? I'm mostly curious as to what other people with this type actually do :P
Cheers"

My ISFJ friend is in mechanical engineering, which I would say is different from what typical ISFJ’s go into. However, she did express that she is unsure about her major."
2560,isfj,"ISFJ - Female
Hm. So I had dreams of becoming a doctor in neurology or oncology since I was 15. Fast forward into college where I had traumatic events that ruined my GPA. So med school was out. I'm 24 now and only recently just let that dream go after a practical yet emotional conversation with my INTJ boyfriend. In college, I finished with two degrees, Physics and Criminology. And I also was in 3 different types of research labs: criminology, cognitive science, physics. Now I'm a high power laser engineer in the semiconductor industry. Decided not to go to grad school in cognitive science or physics, last minute. 
I stayed in STEM because I also did a lot of nonprofit work in college, but it made me extremely unhappy. I didn't like the work itself which involved planning events, organizing and leading teams, a lot of emotional workshops. I also didn't like the inefficiency I encountered and in the end, believed that in order to create an efficient nonprofit, I wanted a long term solution to being ""nonprofit"". I liked the idea of having companies create long term relationships with a specific nonprofit organization, so that there wouldn't be a need to scramble for grants and fundraisers. There also wouldn't be that risk of not having enough money, and it would be better to work on a guaranteed budget. So I thought, why not become the people I would ask for money from and focus on charities farther into my life. "
2561,isfj,I know lurking is predominant over actually answering as I am pretty guilty of this but... I need help. Has anyone ever had a hard time getting over someone? My boyfriend dumped me a month ago and I've gotten a myriad of different reasons for it but I just feel like they have all been lies or excuses. I can't seem to move on and forget about him even though he treated me like shit the last month of our relationship and I can see he obviously doesn't care about me as much as I do about him. I feel like I'm going crazy for loving him so much when I know he doesn't feel the same way and it kills me
2562,isfj,"Only thing that works well for me: break all the contact.
It's also only a month ago, these kind of things will sting for quite some time, especially when it was a bad break up.
In the end it also helps to forgive the other person to be able to finally wrap it up. I myself had intense contact with a girl (3-5) weeks, wasn't really dating, but we did had something. What we were doing got too intense for her, she needed alone time and in the end it was clear that it wouldn't work anymore. Wanted to talk it out, but she didn't want to denying me the possibility to close it up. We didn't had any contact for a couple of weeks, saw her again, noticed that I didn't liked the way I acted since I wasn't myself. Afterwards I sent her a message that I still don't like what she did, but that the way I was behaving now didn't worked either since nothing positive came from it and that she was welcome at my trainings again. It make me feel real good. It made her finally tell her side of the story as well."
2563,isfj,"I agree with the break all contact tip. I just got out of a relationship (barely a relationship if I think about it now) but I kept our texts and pictures and didn't block him on social media until recently. But when I did, it helped a lot. So if you haven't erased him from your life, do that now. After I did that, I got over him fairly quickly and realized how much of a abusive jerk he was to me. So anger also helped.. Not healthy though. I just try not to think of him as much as possible. "
2564,isfj,"What about when you're in a position where you want to break all contact but it's part of your really close friend circle?
u/Smiles_are_powerful
u/jennyjenjen4
I don't want to lose all my close friends because I don't have a ton to begin with and they're all really good people even if I feel really upset around some of them.  I don't want to create any more drama."
2565,isfj,Seems like we're pretty much in the same boat. He keeps doing all of these awful things because he wants me to hate him. I actually am a video major in college and have used all of my feelings and put them into screenplays and short videos and this has been my best semester of work this semester. That has really helped me gain perspective.
2566,isfj,"I don't know anything about the story, but it sounds as more than just a romantic relationship that didn't worked out. If something occurred between multiple of you the first thing you should try is talking it out so everybody knows each other's perspective. Maybe they don't know that it affected you a lot and why. There can also be things you don't know from their side.
If it happened recently breaking the contact for 2-4 weeks might make it easier. You can still stay in touch with the other people in the friend group and meet up with them (assuming that they know what happened they will understand it that you prefer to stay away from the full group for a while). After that you can join some of the shorter activities on neutral ground and build it up again.
In case you see them almost every day since you are all at the same school for example it's much harder.
Can't say that much about it since I barely know anything about the situation. Think most I would suggest have been said now though."
2567,isfj,"I'm dating an ESFJ.
Honestly, it's pretty much perfect.
He's extremely observant of me and my emotions, and he really insists on taking care of me, whether I ask for it or not.
He's always making sure I'm fed, happy, warm, comfortable and content. He notices immediately if I'm upset, and starts a conversation about it right away. Which is nice, because I have a hard time bringing it up on my own.
Any kind of conflict between us had been resolved very quickly, with a calm and civilized conversation. Both of us hate conflict, but we make an effort to have open communication.
He's extremely kind, and very gentle when it comes to my feelings, which is important, because I'm really sensitive. 
He's the most caring person I've ever met, and he's been extremely encouraging to me. I've never felt so loved and cared for as I have since I've been with him.
We complement each other very well, and we make a great team. I never feel like I'm putting in most of the work, like I have in the past, with other people.
It feels very balanced.
He's very affectionate and loving, and he values a lot of the same things as I do. Holidays are a big deal to him, and he's an amazing gift-giver. Every gift he's given me has been very thoughtful and sentimental. I couldn't see myself happier with anybody else. 
He also makes me laugh so hard I cry, on a regular basis. He's goofy and hilarious, and he brings out my own playful side."
2568,isfj,"He's an INTJ and oh my goodness was it tough as nails for me to understand why it took FOREVER for him to come around. I loved him for two years before we became boyfriend/girlfriend and it was a grueling process of being hurt and talking about it and trying to DTR.
But...
Now it's wonderful. He had to sort things out on his own time and I'm glad I waited for him. We both wanted to make sure this relationship was going to last so commitment has been there since BEFORE we were official. His love is so genuine, loyal and compassionate. I just marvel at how his brain works. He's a listener, he's a comforter, gentle, selfless... Seriously, he just inspires me every day. I pick up so many INTJ-like nuances from him. And contrary to popular belief, INTJs are very capable of romance, but they're more practical about it.  Romance comes in the form of giving their time, checking in with you, or making sure youre taken care of versus showering you with chocolates and flowers (but he occasionally surprises me with those too!)."
2569,isfj,"My SO is an ESTJ, so we share two of the four. In general, our main differences center around connection to others and practicality. They can feel very isolated sometimes if they don't feel they have enough connection with others, while I generally enjoy and appreciate extensive times of solitude. Having solid relationships with those I care about that goes deeper than the superficial is important to me, but I often find it easy to be exhausted by them. While we both like to plan things out, I tend to be much more adaptive and try to understand how different parties feel in a situation, and they tend to try and ""optimize"" situations more, trying to identify problems and ways things could be better and then making actionable steps to reach that plan.
We share a lot in common which I really appreciate, but our differences are something I think is really special. When they are getting very emotional or frustrated with something, it is easier for me to listen and try to understand. On the other hand, it's very easy for me to be quite passive and not address things that need to be changed, and they push me to step out of what feels easiest to me. It's really been a wonderful relationship I never would have thought I could ever have, and it still blows my mind sometimes that we're together! I've been learning a lot about myself, and I appreciate their companionship so much. :)"
2570,isfj,He is an ENTP - its a pretty awesome complement to my personality. He enjoys talking about things that intrigue me and I can comment with really well-thought out ideas that keep him interested. He's very hardworking and passionate about his church and his family so my personality is great for aiding in coming alongside those two things. I'm a compassionate helper naturally but it just makes him more in love with me that I take good care for the things he loves. The only time we get even remotely close to arguing is over commonly controversial topics because those are when I become passionately talkative which combats with his debater side. We never actually fight though...more fervently disagree which tends to help us grow and appreciate our differences more. His confidence and love language of words really helps be an encouragement to me in my insecurities.
2571,isfj,"I'm researching how the different MBTI types like to be asked out/approached romantically for an article, and would like (semi) serious answers. So, if someone was interested in you, whether it be a friend or a stranger in a bar, how would you appreciate someone asking you out in a romantic fashion?
Thank you!"
2572,isfj,"Being that we ISFJs are very connected with our feelings, it would be nice to have someone else also connected with theirs. Simply just expressing how much the person liked me and told me whatever was on their mind would be enough for me "
2573,isfj,"Somehow bump into a new person or someone I kind of know at somewhere. We get talking and we share similar feelings about stuff and also we are clearly interested in each other's beliefs, ideas, and perspectives. Then she tells me she wants to see me again on an actual official date."
2574,isfj,"I shoulder-tapped my ex gf ISFJ in a supermarket, then stuck around to talk long enough to get contact info. Just acted chill, no over-eagerness, no intimidating energy, just enough interest. The surprise Ne randomness was done in an exciting yet comfortable way.
(Don't IRL approach in all caps.)"

2576,isfj,"Supply chain management/businesswoman. Though the stress of going up against my team lead has been really hard and it is my hope that I'm moved soon into something less combative.
I like things best at work when I'm crunching numbers and teaching people about technical things. But I thought long and hard about being a teacher when I went to uni, and likely would have been if my dad hadn't recommended I try the business school."
2577,isfj,"Out of curiosity, what is your motivation to switch careers?
I am in a career but have been considering switching to something around Digital/Internet Marketing. 
I consider myself an ISFJ and curious if your personality (assuming ISFJ) struggled with Digital Marketing or whether it was something else. 
Thanks"
2578,isfj,"There's a couple reasons why, but I'm not switching because of struggling with it. I majored in English and did marketing internships in college, and I've gotten several promotions throughout my career. 
The problem is that it's not challenging actually and I'm not happy with my work environment. I find nursing appealing for the challenge it brings and that I'll be helping people and not sit in front of a computer all day. Another reason it's more appealing than marketing is the job security, and the fact that ageism is rampant in white collar professions and I don't want to be laid off when I'm 50 (assuming I don't have a VP or high up job title by then). With nursing I can work through retirement if I want to. Also, it's the lifestyle of nursing. It's mostly shift work, which means more days off, and my work doesn't follow me around when I'm not there (don't have to check emails or do urgent work outside work hours). 
So it's not marketing itself that's bad it's just the office lifestyle isn't as appealing to me as it used to be. I will say that marketing is not too difficult of a profession if you're a quick learner and are willing to try new things. It also pays pretty well if you work for certain industries (like tech, finance, pharma) and at a director level you could easily make 100k a year. "
2579,isfj,"Hi! So I met an ISFJ girl recently, super cute, super smart and also very diligent. 
tldr;
Met isfj girl- confessed- tells me she wants to know me at current level- since then we've been talking everyday and having long phone calls.

What are signs an ISFJ girls like you?
How can you differentiate platonic to romantic vibes?


It started out with us following each other on Instagram through mutual friends and she would always like my stuff. Gradually she would comment on my pictures and stories too which kind of got my attention because I never really thought about her often.
I then posted an IG story asking if anyone in her city would want to hang out (we live in different cities) and she was one of the first to respond, I have to add though that we never met before in person so this got me even more intrigued. (Also have to add she has social anxiety?)
Fast forward a couple of weeks I asked if she had a boyfriend, found out she recently broke up. Fast forward again a few more weeks, I tell her I want to get to know her more than a friend and I don't expect anything to happen right now. She tells me she's been dating guys after guys since she was young and wants to experience being alone and wants to know me at the ""current level"", she did add that she didn't want this to be a BS excuse because she said she does like talking to me and that I'm a cool and interesting person so I guess she does like me as a person? Which is totally ok.
Fast forward to the present. We've been talking everyday, maybe missing a few days in the past month or two? I've held my feelings back from falling for her because I can still turn it into platonic vibes.
What I want to know is, if I am (or seems as if I am) friendzoned why does she talk to me so often and doesn't mind hour long phone calls? I've been wanting to just sit her down (my friends I've confided in have voiced that it's a bad idea and I should just ghost her but she said says too many guys have ghosted her when they didn't get what they wanted from her, which is not me) and tell her that I do like her just to make it clear and that I'd probably want to not message her for a bit so I can get my feelings into platonic mode because I would want to be able to treat her as a friend and not stress her out with my infatuation of her. She's really someone who I would've regretted not knowing whether romantically or platonically in my life. Somehow, before I make the transition into seeing her completely platonically I just want to know if there is no other way? 
Also she has been opening up to me since she says she's not good with being vulnerable or emotional? Which is very sweet and motivating for me :) 
Thanks ISFJs! Just a note you guys have honestly well at least in my life been the only people that have really invested in me so keep doing you! <3"
2580,isfj,"It could be that she is using you for validation.
Say how you feel, in the shortest most direct way possible. Keep it to a few sentences (not an hour-long discussion).
Then recognize that love is a two-way street. If she feels the same about you, she will reciprocate and you two can move forward. Ball is in her court.
Otherwise, cut her off. 
You both deserve to find your mate, but won't get anywhere if energy is spent on the wrong person."
2581,isfj,"Firstly the talking everyday thing means very little. Talking doesn't do much for the isfj. Talk stimulates NFs, it's the domain of the NTs. There is not much substance in conversation with an isfj, keep it light hearted but give her the microphone. They may get into it when they get to vent their concerns about people or their situation, this is probably the only time you actually have to listen. Isfj's are always vulnerable and emotional, you only have to ask the right question.
When an isfj likes you they will do things for you, she needs to help you and contribute to you. Being appreciated is HUGE for this type, they need to know that you see them. From my perspective, the biggest thing you can do for an isfj is take them out of their comfort zone. Be spontaneous about it. Remember their inferior function is Ne. Contrast whatever her lifestyle is currently, if she's busy, be low key when you're with her, very relaxed. If she's more introverted, bring her out in the sun more and go get dessert. You'll do great if you can ""coach"" her through new experiences or doing new things, it's mostly a showing support thing. Always look for an opportunity to help, acts of service are big with this type. If she's sick, go see her, bring something for her with you. If she's stressing out, call her, tell her the silver lining, talk about fun stuff. 
In general you can be very relaxed. Drop your agenda, just have fun, have as much of it as you can. The more you invest in each other, the more consistency, well that's basically the foundation of a relationship. This takes time but it has a snowball effect. She'll describe the process as ""just seeing"". It's actually pretty easy. Isfj's are flexible. For the most part it looks like you are stuck in your own way, declaring your feelings won't work. It's sweet but it won't move things forward. The biggest obstacle here is controlling your emotions, things are nearly impossible when you're more emotional than your isfj"
2582,isfj,"I don't understand where you got the idea that we don't care about talking?? Being able to have an interesting and exploratory conversation with someone without feeling shut down or talked down to is one of the biggest markers that we're a good fit imo. I don't like forced, fake-deep philosophical conversations, but being able to talk about any and everything and having it feel easy and natural is tremendously important to me. "
2583,isfj,"That's a pretty harsh stereotype based on one girl you've known. 
I'm an ISFJ, and I prefer a lot of alone time. Too much attention makes me uncomfortable.
I see my boyfriend about once a week, maybe twice at most, and we don't really text or have phone calls during the week when we're apart. It's definitely enough for me, and I sure as hell haven't strayed or gone looking for attention from other guys."
2584,isfj,"Most people want attention and narcissistic behaviors are spreading like a plague because of social media.
Not every ISFJ is a narcissistic cunt who needs new sources of attention and validation, and you are pretty low for generalizing like a butthurt /r/TheRedPill/.

As for the question, a person who genuinely cares will go out of their way to help you or support you. Talk about yourself or bring up a topic where you could use some help, if she turns the topic away from you back to herself, then she doesn't care about you."
2585,isfj,Unless he has a habit of shutting people down or talking down to them it's not something he has to focus on. He could as well text her cute memes and talk about her day over the phone for 15 minutes but if he really wants to move things forward he'll give her opportunities to contribute and will take her out her comfort zones slowly
2586,isfj,"Did you just not read my comment or what?? I don't understand this total discounting of the value of conversation with ISFJs? If I really like someone nothing makes me happier than talking to them all day, every day, and a long, comfortable conversation goes a tremendous way towards making me feel close to someone. The things you've mentioned are good too, but I feel like you're making a really bizarre generalization that conversation is largely irrelevant to all ISFJs. "
2587,isfj,"Not irrelevant, ineffective. The conversation itself isn't so important, the key is making her feel heard, validated and ""comfortable"" talking about what's on her mind.
Isfj's are ""helpmates"". NFs ""soulmates"", NTs ""mindmates"" - conversation will take you far with these two, not so much the SJ. There's more effective ways to go about it than hour long conversation over the phone"
2588,isfj,"Just want to gush on my ISFJ wife of 27 years. She is absolutely the BEST I could ever want and hope for. Wedded bliss for both of us!
You ISFJ's are so lovely and dedicated with a wonderful dry sense of humor!! I could go on and on (and I will) ! Dependable, what you see is what you get, awesomely loyal...I could go on and on (and I will) ! Accurate judge of character, true blue, can do, completely trustworthy!!
Take care you ISFJ's ! I love mine."
2589,isfj,"I'm a female INFP marrying a male ISFJ and we're so well-matched that it (usually) feels effortless. He's the most genuine, caring, selfless, sarcastic, loyal, intuitive person I know. I'd be interested to hear reflections from others on the female INFP male ISFJ pairing!"
2590,isfj,"I am also with an ISFJ. He's amazing. my mom and favorite cousin are also ISFJs.  I once was told that ISFJ x INFP are not very compatible because they only have two functions in common, but I love the ISFJs in my life. We balance each other well and have fun together! :)"
2591,isfj,"I am an ISFJ male, and have been married to my INFP wife for a little over two years now. It's awesome together! When we say Netflix and chill, we ACTUALLY mean Netflix and chill. Our introvert sides get along very well, and we can both usually tell when the other person needs to exit a social situation. If and when conflicts arise, they usually have to do with the fact that ISFJs feel externally, while INFPs internalize their feelings. So often times, I will launch into some big speech or something without having thought out every aspect of what I want to say, and then she will look at me like I'm crazy because she rehearses everything she wants to say in her head 12 times before saying it. "
2592,isfj,"I agree with you on balancing each other well. We have so much fun together too. We do goofy inside joke stuff that only we know about...been doing it for years. 
We can be quite serious too so there is a big spectrum in our lives. 
We can sometimes sit and not say anything to each other but we're both perfectly content because of the harmony we share.
It's really a great pairing in my humble opinion.
Take care you wonderful ISFJ's !"
2593,isfj,"It's hard to keep it all under wraps. Eventually I plan to create more exclusive channels where only certain members can post, but it's still in the formulating stage. I do have an intellectual channel which is strictly modded, though."
2594,isfj,"I understand the part about keeping it under wraps. I own a few discords myself but between cracking down and being tune with the other mods we're able to keep it from being done on a daily basis.
What bothered me is while the guy with the Winnie the Pooh avatar was trying to type me there were a few guys who made unnecessary shitposty remarks (e.g. ""ew type 1""). When I pointed it out the only thing Winnie the Pooh said was ""oh thats just what he does, I guess we can mute him if it gets out of hand"". 
I hate to sound preachy but letting these people talk around like that will make it harder for newcomers to join and stay for good which is what I assume you wanted to do by advertising this discord here which is fine.
Having one ""intellectual"" channel being heavily modded while the others allow people to just shitpost about anything anywhere just creates a lot of circlejerks and not much in the way of actual healthy discussion that many people want to take part of.
That said, I wish the best for your discord."
2595,isfj,"Bad.... When I'm standing my shoulders are always a little slumped, although I feel like it's not as bad as it could be, but my sitting posture is a goddamn mess. I hunch like nobody's business, which I guess makes my neck push forward some? Not as sure on that front, haven't paid much attention to it. I go through phases of trying to improve it, but since I have ADHD the thought tends to slip my mind almost immediately and never return..... "
2596,isfj,"I have bad posture from sitting at a computer desk nearly all day for the past 12 years. My neck is kind of forward as you said because of this. 
I started trying to do those exercises where you stand up every 20 mins. And the ones where you keep your arms raised above your head on a yoga mat to try to fix my neck."
2597,isfj,"I'm not really sure why, but I just seem to naturally get along very well with my INFP friends. I am always amazed by their artistic talents and whimsical imaginations.
My advice is the same I would give for being a good friend to any other personality type: be there for them when they're going through the rough patches in life. INFPs are characterized by a childlike, innocent, ""head in the clouds"" outlook on the world, and sometimes the harsh realities of life knock them out of their fantasy world and leave them in a depressed funk. Those are the times when they need a friend to encourage them and remind them of the value and necessity of their optimism. Without INFPs, the world would be a much darker, depressing place."
2598,isfj,"I agree with the other comment completely. INFPs do need optimism and encouragement. Listening to them is also very important, I think. I've been friends with quite a few INFPs. Most of them are really nice and fun! Once they feel at ease with you, they'll tend to open up to you and you can have really deep and meaningful conversations with them while still being able to have lots of fun. 
However, I've been friends with some INFPs in loops and grips... In those cases, they tended to exteriorise their bad and depressed feelings on me by being downright disrespectful. In those cases, I would advise you to share your concerns directly and talk to them about what's making you feel like they're treating you badly. It's really important because they may not realise at all because of the Si loop and if you do not tell them when it happens (it's honestly hard for me as an ISFJ), they won't understand when it gets too much for you because ""it wasn't the case before."" 
That's my only warning! I was a bit traumatised at first, but thankfully I met other INFPs that were so nice and warm it allowed me to move past those feelings. "
2599,isfj,"Al I've been doing is listen and compliment her art skill. Asked me for help when she was procrastinating, and I gave her a pep talk which worked. I also go full nanny mode in that I remind her of her school work and some such stuff, which is natural to me."
2600,isfj,"I may have screwed up. Literally a few minutes ago I asked her if she thinks she's reclusive and self-centered (Googled ""INFP unhealthy traits""). She said yes. I asked her if she's aware those are unhealthy traits. Still waiting for a reply, but I probably should not have done that. :/
What do you think?"
2601,isfj,"Hmm, well at least she seems aware of it! From my own experience unhealhty INFP are not even aware / in denial of being self-centered. So that's not hopeless at all! 
As for you, you seem like a good friend to her so even if she thinks your question is rude, you can still make things better. Even if you make a little mistake, it's not the end :) It doesn't mess up all the good things you've done before! 
If it stresses you out, you can always add that you didn't mean that in an awful way! Early Fi users may be sensitive to criticism but you're just trying to help her on her introspection. It's hard to get the hang of things!"
2602,isfj,"Is anyone else an ISFJ but doesn't care about family at all? 
My parents are narcissists and I'm still living with them but i really can't handle them at all. I even consider cutting myself off once i have enough to move out. They've made me very anxious and having to deal with depression. Growing up (and also now), my feelings are being pushed away. My opinions don't matter because I'm still 'a child' even though I'm 21. Being in a strict environment, having curfew, they just kill me on the inside."
2603,isfj,"I wouldn't say I don't care about family but I do not seek contact with them.
For a few years they were always saying ""why am I always the one to contact you?""
It's mostly because all I hear is drama and X ranting about Y, then Y ranting about X, and I'm supposed to pick a side. No, deal with your own shit, I'm not a mediator. Well, I should be, it's in out nature as ISFJs, but they radiate negativity and I absorb all of that. So I put some distance between us."
2604,isfj,"My boyfriend is ISFJ and is low-contact with his parents and older brother, basically only seeing them when they're in the same town as him. He also isn't interested in having kids.
People who describe ISFJs as family-oriented tend to assume a healthy and happy family, but that's not a reality for many people. ISFJs generally prefer to be around people with whom they're comfortable relaxing and being themselves, and they're very sensitive to feeling disrespected or condescended to. That makes it very difficult for them to deal with narcissists (not that narcissists are easy for anyone to deal with, but some types can find amusement in poking them).
In the absence of a family of birth, though, ISFJs can quite competently build up families of choice. In your case, maybe you are family oriented, it's just that you haven't met your real family yet."
2605,isfj,"I'm family oriented, but only because my family is made of good, kind people. I encourage you to break free from yours and live your own life, because your situation sounds terrible. That doesn't make you a bad person. I wish you luck ❤️"
2606,isfj,"I'm around your age and am fortunate enough to live on my own for school. Although I've lived with my parents all my childhood, I've never had a relationship with my parents. Not enough of a relationship to fight with them, to tell my mom about my period when I got it, etc etc.
For years, when I imagined major life events in the future, I imagined them not there or knew I would prefer them not to be there. Events like marriage, rasing a infant. 
Recently I reached my breaking point. As my brother and sister started to push my parents away, they started to hug me. And I can't handle that, cus it's not representive of the relationship I have with my parents. My mom is so willing to give me money they don't have for two reasons, 1. She's mad at my dad and it's my dad's money shed be giving me 2. She wants to buy back my love. I don't want to be bought. 
I've been wanting to cut them off for a long time and I've finally reached a finically secure point in my life where I can. The only thing I have left to do is write a letter explaining it all. 
She seems to not know the ways she hurt me. At Christmas my sister and them got into a fight, leading my mom to come into my room and ask ""did your dad ever spank you with a belt?"" To which I say ""yes"" and she responds with ""where was I"" she was there. It hard to cut her off cus I know she wanted to be a good mother. But I never felt her love, I never truly felt that she cared for me and it hurt and it has affected me in a big way. So I'm done. Months after Christmas, when I'm trying to study for my math midterm, she messages me ""I'm sorry your dad hit you, I tried to stop it"" and I just broke down and couldn't study. Does she really think that that is the only reason I have to distance myself from her. What about the things she's done. 
I wouldn't say I'm not family oriented, I'm just not MY family oriented. 
I'm sorry to make this about me, I just haven't really gotten it all out yet. I hope this helps in someway. If you can't stand your family and would live a better live without them, then do it. Also it does not have to be forever."
2607,isfj,I’m sorry you grew up with narcissistic parents. I can only imagine how tough it can be to deal with that. Yeah you have every right to break away form your family if you don’t feel comfortable around them. I’m family oriented cause I have a loving family that supports me. I know there’s stereotypes that ISFJs are family orientated but I think that’s an overgeneralization. I think ISFJs enjoy being around people who make them feel comfortable and for some that’s family and for others not.
2608,isfj,ISFJ care about small group of people but for fuck sake don't do same shit like every ISFJ do. They can literally abandon their families because how 'dreadful' they seems to like. You are not even remotely good person at all so dont abandon family.
2609,isfj,"Pretty much this for my immediate family. I couldn't appreciate the drama and accept it during my younger days, however over the course of many years and changes on both side we learn to accept each other. One major thing is that they no longer handle their conflicts in front of me.
My paternal family excluding 1 or 2 aunts on the other hand I left out my life 10 to 12 years ago.
Anyway to reply to OP post, I would say if it really affects you strongly you may want to consider moving out for awhile, I was blessed to have a really understanding friend whose family was super cool to let me crash for a couple of months when I needed to"
2610,isfj,"In Jungian theory, types are divided into 4 Quadrants : Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta.
NTPs and SFJs form the Alpha quadrant : We all use consciously Ti Ne Si and Fe functions.
Someone on /r/entp thought about making a chat for the Alpha quadrant.
So :


What do you think of that ?


Do you want to make it real and chat a bit ?


Which chat system you prefer ? (Discord, IRC, something else ?)


Can you bring some ESFJs with you ? (NTPs are not people I would qualify ""difficult to find"". =) )


In any case, have a nice day ! Cheers !"
2611,isfj,"I'll take a look :  I do have a cellphone.
It may be limitating. Both Discord app and IRC are available in nearly all platforms. No Linux desktop version for Discord app, but it's the best IM/Free Voice chat app I know. And they have a webclient, anyway.
Here's a link !"
2612,isfj,"Hey Reddit! My name is jetplane48 and this is the first episode of an enlightening series that I hope inspires most of you to learn more about the different types by watching us interact with different types. In this first episode, we learn about ENFPs and a little bit about ESTPs!

​"
2613,isfj,"Things that make you sound unlike me and the ISFJs I know:
Almost never.
It depends. I think it would take a lot for an ISFJ to act similarly. If I had to describe my own work experience, that would be the last thing I focused on. I would talk about how I try to anticipate people's needs and what they /mean/ when they ask me to do a specific task I think is silly. I bite my tongue a lot when I see mismanagement, if I think that a person means well and isn't doing that much harm. 
These differences all seem to be related to Fe, which is a pretty good inclination of Te auxiliary on your part. "
2614,isfj,"ISFJ subtypes:   
ISFJ-Fe - Seems lively, friendly, and unrestrained in conversation; emotionally responsive, easily gives compliments and closes the distance, may even take his conversation partner by his hand; his lack of restraint carries a shade of familiarity. Shyness can alternate with joking remarks; ironic quips easily turn into respectful and serious tone. Often jokes and tells even unpleasant things with a smile as to not offend the other person. - Full description 
ISFJ-Si - Calm and soft person in interaction. With his presence often pacifies others. Industrious, practical, does everything with a sense of taste. Often engages in fine arts as a hobby. Well-wishing, tactful, unobtrusive. Tries to sympathize, to assist, to provide advice. Loves rest and comfort. Likes talking about his perceptions and sensations. Attentively questions his conversation partner in regard to his or her affairs. Slightly delayed in his behavior and speech, sometimes stretching out words and with difficulty forming clear thoughts. - Full description"
2615,isfj,"What the hell are you talking about?
An ISFJ with a preference for Fe is an ESFJ!!! Ggggggrrrrrrrrr....
(Maybe subtypes exists but 1. I want that to be demonstrated as oppose to been asserted by fiat and 2. Give the unique names, please!)
EDIT: Rereading this, it gets across my frustration but I don't want it to seem like an attack. So, sorry if it seemed hurtful u/kalinali. If not harm done, grand but just want to be sure. :)"
2616,isfj,"Yes, subtypes are a thing and they do have their names. (Believe me, i was as shocked as you are). As far as i know, they're basically your temperament. Type is really just a mold. No one really recognizes you as ISFJ, ENFJ, or ENTJ. It's what you put into that mold, and one of those things is subtype.
There's a good post on subtypes. And it's here~!
BONUS INFO! YAY!!
I was sent this last night upon asking for articles on subtype. And this really paints them. Watch maybe 20 seconds of each video...
Dominant - Creative - Harmonizing - Normalizing
Watched them? Cool. They all seem like very different gentlemen, right? One's direct and another playful and boisterous. Now, what if i told you they were all ENFP? That's subtype."
2617,isfj,"Okay, so knee-jerk reactions.
A ONE. Eww... I don't like my system having things bolted on. They must organically grow out of the system. In other words, screw Te, Ti is where it is at.
A TWO. After getting over my 'eww', small annoyance at terminology. Your link says:
So it shouldn't be called a subtype, because subtype suggests a specificity that the four temperaments don't have. There isn't a unique ENTP-Dom subtype that is mutually exclusive with the ISFJ-Dom. Instead, there are ENTP's and ISFJ's and the rule that social interaction gives rise to four distinct roles, of which any type can embody. Think of it like a job. You are suggesting there exists the 'ENTP-Lawyer' type and the 'ISFJ-lawyer' type, as oppose to saying ENTP and ISFJ types can both be lawyers, and would do the job their own way. The difference is that job/temperament is external to type. In fact, I would rather call it 'preferred social role'. Okay, no I wouldn't but I'd like a word that meant that.
A THREE. If you don't mind, would you expand upon this, because I don't really get what you mean:
I'll keep researching this to decide whether I like it or not. MBTI does suffer from a lot of 'sounds good, toss it in'. I'm skeptical as a result. :)"
2618,isfj,"Why are ""Enegram"" & ""Big 5"" test not as popular as MBTI?
I think it may be because there is a lot to read about your personality type online after taking a MBTI test but nothing much after taking the ""Enegram"" or ""Big 5"" test.
What do you think?"
2619,isfj,"Though I don't know much about the Big 5, Enneagram might be less popular than MBTI because it tends to have more negative descriptions of one's personality, rather than describing many of the positive characteristics of each personality type like MBTI descriptions tends to do more.
Because people would probably prefer to listen to positive comments about themselves rather than their flaws that remind them of their shortcomings, MBTI wins in popularity.
This is my guess, though I actually don't know for sure."
2620,isfj,"The title should say ""rarely"" as opposed to ""never""
I was wondering if it is a common occurrence for ISFJs to feel like they rarely truly belong socially, no matter where they find themselves.
One example would be among a group of friends, feeling a disconnect although there is no external evidence to support this (still being included, still participating, but feeling somewhat or very disconnected).
Another example would be in a classroom, naturally ending up alone, or being/working with friends/acquaintences but still feeling like you're the odd one out but not being able to explicitly identify why (nothing obvious sets you apart).
Even in a one on one situation feeling somewhat disconnected and unable to properly express yourself, your thoughts, reactions etc to the other person to the extent that you feel your actions and contributions are mechanical and robotic (despite caring about the person  and experiencing genuine emotions inside)."
2621,isfj,"I don't know if it's common, but it is definitely something I relate to. I almost never feel like I ""belong,"" no matter who I'm with. It doesn't necessarily make me sad, but it is a feeling that inevitably creeps up in just about every social setting."
2622,isfj,"I definitely relate. When I express that feeling, I either get apathy or pandering, neither of which help. I want commonality, not distance or pity, and certainly not just because I asked for it. So yeah, I don't express that anymore. The periphery is where I find myself. 
The situations I found the most belonging are with my coworkers after being there several years, with my team mates at about the end of a season, and with my classmates the junior through senior years of college. So... I guess it takes time. Still working on it with my wife. It's going okay. :)
But I've been kind of down lately. So take this with a grain of salt."
2623,isfj,"I think ISFJs are quite well set-up for overthinking thanks to our function stack, honestly. Si and Fe give us lots of info about (and focus on) stuff like how things have gone in the past, the behaviors and emotions we've seen other people express, what we expect them to look or sound like when they're feeling or thinking a certain thing, how different factors influence situations, how we think interactions should go in order to achieve certain outcomes, etc etc. I know personally I'm a big observer of that sort of thing, taking in impressions and ""data"" about day-to-day interactions. So I think it's easy for us to end up with a lot of presuppositions about what social interactions should look like?
But then we have Ti and Ne towards the bottom of our stack. Ti can help us analyze those interactions, but I think that ""logical"" aspect can be really easily colored or twisted by our other functions unless we've spent a lot of time developing it. And Ne is the ""what if"" part of our brain that takes all of those picked-apart pieces from Ti and runs wild with them, often in a more negative direction since it's our inferior function. I think it becomes easy to take those pieces and weave them into a picture where you feel like an outsider, or think yourself into a corner where you feel very uncertain about people's feelings and your standing in their eyes. 
I dunno, maybe that's not really what you meant, and if so I apologize for rambling! I've just been seeing a lot of similar discussions lately and thinking about why so many of us might end up feeling that way, and this is one direction that it took me. (I also could be very off-base, so if people have different interpretations I would be interested in hearing them!) "
2624,isfj,"This sounds like me in every way. To quote Marge Simpson ""I havent had a friend in years."" Primarily because of school and work and when I do have free time I spend it playing video games, working out and most importantly, my family. But yeah I feel very different than most personality wise to the point where most people annoy me but I am actually a kind hearted person which most people can't see."
2625,isfj,"I  can completely relate to this. Even with groups of friends I've had since childhood, I can feel out of place and like I don't really belong. I constantly worry that people don't actually like me and whether they are asking out of pity or feel like they have to. I have to remind myself that it's all in my head and that people wouldn't ask if they didn't want to. I've always felt on the periphery of things which most of the time I'm pretty happy with to be honest as I can be quite a solidarity person. "
2626,isfj,"Odd feelings among people (no matter who you are with) are due to resistance you build in interaction with others. Mind tends to overload itself even in simplest interaction even with people you know for years. The only problem is that you let you mind lure you into thought chain which is completely irrelevant in current situation. 
Let me tell you example from my perspective: 
I got a friend, I know her many years, we know each other so well she could be my sister or even more. Many times when we are together something she say or do something that grabs my attention and my mind instantly tries to analyze what's behind. Maybe she got new sweater, mind instantly starts to think compulsively... nice sweater, where did she buy it? Did she get it from someone? Does she have a new boyfriend? 
And so on.. It's like dog which caught some smell and run out for it without consideration where he might end after all.
This compulsive thinking is the root of our feeling of disconnection. You are never fully present.
But there's a hope :)


You might try a little trick which could help you overtime... try to watch your thoughts as you think. When you realize that mind is extending your initial thought into unnecessary chain, just try to revert back to thought where you started, without judging that fact and expanding it to unnecessary heights.
Most of these unnecessary thoughts are not real anyway and you know that :) 


It's completely normal to feel disconnected, if you need someone nearby you can ask someone to come over or go and visit someone. It's our introverted nature to feel somehow strange around people, but it doesn't mean other people don't feel odd too sometimes :)

"
2627,isfj,"I feel this way a lot too. I try really hard not to because I need and want friends. It's not that I prefer being alone, I just want our connection to be sincere, and I overanalyze whether it is or not. I always assume that I'm an inconvenience. Which feels unhealthy. So I tend to not reach out and set up dates with friends, and when we do, I'm usually the one ending it early to ""get out of their hair."" This makes all my phone calls short too. 
When I find someone that I don't feel this disconnect with, I cling to that person for dear life. My husband being the main one. I get a rush of comfort when I leave the scary social world just to sit on the couch with him. I don't have to worry about our connection being sincere."
2628,isfj,"I relate a lot with your comment about feeling a stronger sense of belonging after several years of knowing someone, like coworkers (especially if it's a smaller company where everything is naturally more intimate). There is a sense of familiarity and comfort. You're so right about time being an important factor in how comfortable you feel with someone. It gives you time to get to know the person in many contexts. 
I hope you find a way out of your ""down."" It's not easy being in that place. This internet stranger is rooting for you."
2629,isfj,"Things can be interpreted in many ways. Your  analysis of cognitive functions and their role in this feeling of ""otherness"" is valuable to many I think. It is one way to address the question: why. 
On a sidenote, I'm pretty new to cognitive functions but I noticed at the end you expressed a worry that you misinterpreted the question, then you conditionally apologized for ""rambling"", maybe for fear of annoying or inconveniencing me. That is Fe at work, right?
I point this out because you should know that your thoughts and experiences are just as valuable as anyone else's. In fact I'm thrilled that the question sparked your analysis and that you took the time to write it out here. I enjoyed reading what you shared."
2630,isfj,"Aww, that's really sweet, thank you for taking the time to say so! :') That would indeed be my Fe at work, with a dose of good ol' fashioned insecurity mixed in haha. So, probably some Ne, too? ""What if I wrote this whole response and it's totally off-topic? I'd better write something showing that I acknowledge I might be wrong so they don't get annoyed about it."" 
Anyway, I very much appreciate the reminder that my opinions are worth something! If you've been around this subreddit you can probably guess that it means a lot lol, I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw your reply. I hope you have a nice day! "
2631,isfj,"Hey all. About 5 or 6 years ago when I was trying to figure out what to do with my life, I took a test & determined I had ISFJ personality type. It made sense; I wanted to help people, I wanted to work with older adults, I didn’t care about money, I was a “mostly” nice guy with a good heart.
But now after all the studying, working that job for a few years, I’m very bitter. I still like helping older adults, but I hate most of my co-workers. I get bad hours, the pay sucks, I get the worst tasks, & I’m planning on quitting the field altogether. I’m kind of an a-hole, & don’t know how to snap out of it. I’m always stressed, trapped in my head, I can’t seem to de-stress & get back to my old self.
I’m planning a career change into tech. I want a calmer setting, where I can do solitary work, with normal hours & good pay. I kind of want to travel. I don’t really care about others anymore, unless I personally like them.
Tl;dr: Is it possible my personality type has changed? Maybe I got it wrong the first time? Or does stress just make you rebel against your values?"
2632,isfj,"nope, and no. but you can develop your shadow, like if you spend a lot of time in your unconsious , unwillingly or willingly you can..almsot get stuck there but with a lot of healing you can get back to your ego. 
this is a rare case though. 
remember you actually have four personality types inside of your mind - if you're an ISFJ you have ESFP unconsious, ENTP subconisous, and INTJ superego."
2633,isfj,"I feel for you. Had a similar moment in time. Switched jobs (completely new industry) I work tech and it’s in your best interest to at least keep the good guy piece of you and ensure you express a bit of an extroverted outer shell to improve your overall relationship with everyone.
It’s a weird space to be in and you need to reach out a little from your loved ones to give the support. Make sure your battery is charged. How you do this is up to you and make sure you feel happy. I need to reflect on what I said here as I’m a little down myself. 
Do you find you can figure whatever has you down out with a little self reflection and a list of planned ideas and or small changes to your routine to get you out of the slump?
Let me know if you ever need to chat about the tech industry. Not sure which avenue you want to look at but I’m fairly geeky and can help where I can."
2634,isfj,"My wife is an ISFJ and this sounds like her experience. While I wouldn’t describe her as being an asshole, there’s definitely a lot of bitterness in not feeling appropriately appreciated in the workplace. This is especially exacerbated when she is given a high workload with no acknowledgement or thanks for her extremely high work ethic. She also is drained by coworkers who do not, in her opinion, work as hard and make more money.  I think at the end of the day, maybe  a place that gives a lot of verbal affirmation may be what you are looking for. I know at least that’s what she needs at home and she holds everyone to the same high standards I am held to."
2635,isfj,There’s remind me of a lot of stories I’ve seen about social workers who want to switch to computer science due to social mental and emotional exhaustion. You don’t have to dedicate your life to a field based off a personality test. Your mental health comes first along with opportunity for you to learn and grow as much as you want in this lifetime. I hope you find a new job or field that make you happier because no money in the world is worth the amount of frustration you’re going through right now.
2636,isfj,"My ISFJ boyfriend had the same experience. This year he was super bitter, full of hatred and wanted to cut off everyone and have nothing to do with anyone in his life anymore. He felt like no one cared about him as much as he cared for everyone else.
But he was lucky and finally found the puzzle piece that helped him to change himself to be happier again... It was something about holy geometry and how  all is one and most importantly for him: that he is enough and doesn't need anyone to be whole.
I don't think that your type changed... I think you are not happy anymore... Try trusting this infj here and listen more to your heart and less to your ego in your mind. Feelings are the communication of what your soul wants for you because it will be great ❤️
Oh and... The way you treat yourself is the manual for everyone else to treat you. So be good to yourself and don't push too hard "
2637,isfj,"First, I’m sorry about your work situation. Sounds like you’ve been place into a situation around people who have forced you to try and be something you’re not. I think you’re on the right track in getting out of that situation. You shouldn’t have to change your entire personality to fit in with people. I think you need to find people who accept you for who you are. 
Second, I believe that we all have predisposed type that is inborn to us. However, as an ISFJ you have Extroverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Perceiving functions. It’s just you prefer you’re ISFJ functions. Also, as you get older you’re lower function (especially your tertiary function) get more conscious and start playing a bigger role in your life. For example, the ISFJs third function is Ti and now that I’m in my early 20s it is starting to play more of a roll on my life. However, That doesn’t mean you are a different type this just means you are working on your weaker functions. to become a more well rounded ISFJ. Based on what you wrote when you typed as an ISFJ I still believe you are one. You should definitely read up on the ISFJ functions here’s a couple of good links.

2638,isfj,"Could it be that you were incorrectly typed the first time around? I thought I was an INFP for years because basically every test said I was... but then I started researching the cognitive functions because something didn't feel right, then a friend mentioned that she was an ISFJ and that since we are very similar I might be too. Yep... fits like a glove. So you might not actually be an ISFJ but rather mistyped. Just a thought..."
2639,isfj,"How do you listen to your heart? I keep trying to block out my negative thoughts but they're very strong.
I am very unhappy, but I don't understand why I'm being such a jerk to everyone. At home I'm calm and collected, but the moment I get to work it's like a switch flips & I want to yell at everyone who's ever wronged me. I'm not even a hard-worker any more, I'm just pissed off at them.
I have been pushing myself hard, I work days and come home to study at nights.. I don't know how to love myself any more. I don't really have any hobbies or practice self-care any more."
2640,isfj,"How to listen to your heart - that is a very good question! I didn't know what that is supposed to mean either. I could send you all the good videos and stuff I got but there is only one English one: ""conversations with God"" (I recommend the audio books) 
But let's try to explain: we learned that if something feels good to you, that is the truth. If it feels bad, it is not the truth for you.
When you say to yourself ""I made a lot of mistakes in my life"" out loud, how does it feel? Is it heavy, tightening, pushing down, dark? That's because it is not true for you.
Now say ""I am a gift for everyone who meets me"" out loud, how does it feel this time? Light, wide, bright? That means it is true.
Take this and study your feelings!
One more thing we learned is that if you have hard feelings about someone, it has everything to do with yourself and nothing to do with the person you are angry with. But you are doing your best all the time, everyone is! So please forgive yourself... You're even calling for help and this as an ISFJ 😊 I know you will make it "
2641,isfj,"Greetings ISFJs.
I'm creating a Skype chat for people who fit into the role of the ""Sentinels"" which according the the 16-personalities website ""Highly practical embracing and creating order and security and stability wherever they go."" 
In theory Sentinels tend to enjoy each others company and have common goals. So I thought I'd create a chat to see if this is true. So come join us.

2642,isfj,"Recently this week (also found about this sub) i stumbled upon one of those test quiz sites to determine your personality and i just took it. Ive done it before but never believed these, bit like zodiac signs. 
But this time i did some more research and looked into the ISFJ and it felt pretty strange and accurate. Its really weird to find out so much about myself at the age 29 (Male) when i really thought i knew myself. 
Now im reading through most of the posts and its really funny and fascinating to read about other ISFJs. As im reading im also understanding things a bit more. 
I dont really have something to tell or say here, but since there are so little posts around i thought id drop by and say hi. Please share about how you found out you are ISFJ and what did you learn after knowing you are ISFJ? 
Plus whats the deal with all the ENTP here? "
2643,isfj,"For the longest time I thought I was ISTJ but after retaking more tests recently as well as studying the Fi/Te and Ti/Fe I realized I do lean more towards ISFJ since many big decisions in my life were more people-oriented than task oriented. I did know I was definitely ISxJ though with how quiet/shy I am as well as tendency to undersell/not talk about my acheivements and such.
As for ENTP, well it's the complete opposite of ISFJ so it's interesting to see how interaction with someone of your exact opposite would be like."
2644,isfj,"I have taken several tests that all pointed to ISFJ. It is really not like the zodiac, when you think about it. If you have a good enough understanding of your own personality, you could theoretically figure out your own type without ever taking a quiz for it because it is all about where you fall on the spectrum of each of the four traits.
I think one of the best things about learning my type was just realizing there are other people who process the world the same way that I do. There have been so many times on this subreddit where I read something and just went, yes! It isn't just me. Also, I've seen several sites describe the ISFJ as something along the lines of a people oriented introvert. I've always felt this weird internal conflict where I care deeply for people and am fairly good at social interaction, but am extremely hesitant to open up to them and build lasting relationships. So reading about the ISFJ type has shed a bit of light on that."
2645,isfj,"If we work on the E/I dichotomy of Jung, Se would essentially be ""collecting"" sensations of intensity. A major drive to do so.
How does Si work? They should assume how things would feel and look since all introverted functions tend to do that, which is why they don't seek out novel sensations like their extroverted counterpart. What are these Si equations? What is the ""model"" of things in reality that they are operating on?"
2646,isfj,I still gather by my own. Jung couldn't understand that in his model but Si user can just gather on his own sensors and conversations. Also I use other stories to fill my Si. That's why we have things called B O O K S.
2647,isfj,"From what I’ve read about Se, it’s a lot more skin deep (I mean, skin and the whole body- but yeah). It seems like the information just occurs on that outside layer of sensing organs and leaves just as fast. Sense memories are the stimulus “played again” on the sense organs and tend to be quite vivid. To borrow someone else’s metaphor (maybe yours?) Se user will see a fluffy blanket and want to play the sensations out. That’s how they can feel the most vivid sense of fluffy. 
I think Si absorbs the initial immediate impressions of things mostly subconsciously and builds up a personal library of sensations. Rather than the sense playing mostly on the skin/body, the greater part of the sense is its correspondence to that library of impressions. A kind of internal vista of platonic ideals of sensations.  
So, fluffy blankets have been felt, why bother to feel this one when you are 90% accurate in imagining it."
2648,isfj,"Well by gathering on your own you should be ""looking"" inside yourself. While the Se perceives and feels an impetus to act and gather the actual sensation, you instead look into the sensation of ""impetus to act"" and perceive something. What is that ""something""? That something will be a holistic model that represents whatever the sensation related to, and you watch those models interact with one another."
2649,isfj,"So you're saying Se doesn't build up a collection of sensation memories? They just forget it and just always stay super present, choosing whatever is most intense right here right now then immediately forgetting?
This is the most representative of Jung's idea. But the building the personal library sounds like Se. That's weird.
This is basically all introverts(I am one too). I think deceiving looks get to us probably."
2650,isfj,"I don’t know as much about how Se keeps its memories. From what I’ve heard from a few Se doms, memory is a present action- experiencing what they choose in the moment. I figure this is not as weird as it sounds when they sort the sense memories out with aux and tert functions. I get the sense that a worthy memory is encased in a glass dome to pull up and enjoy later, and they can find it when they look for it. Kind of like a library. Ask a Se dom? 
I feel that line about “Si absorbs the initial immediate impressions of things” is actually not super representative of everyday Si use for me. Sure, my Si does this when given a new stimulus. But the rest of the time, Si is a quiet background noise. Door knob still feels like door knob, check. Walking up the stairs still feels like walking up the stairs.
I pull impressions from Si when I need to remember something. And Si asserts itself most strongly when it resonates with some random sense that occurred. The light catches just right on the window, and I remember a time when it did that before. The personal library functions more like the overlapping sense impressions of a lifetime rather than a place you can pick books off the shelves. Few things are under domes to review. It’s all the salient, most impressionant pieces of senses chopped up and put in a box you can sift through, or mostly just read the label and be like “yep, fluffy”"
2651,isfj,Sounds like subjective sense impression models and then when one feels different it pops out at you. Than again I am an Si user too and I cant imagine not working like that.
2652,isfj,"Hello, I'm a friendly neighborhood INFJ who has an inquiry based on our similar function stacks. We both share, if one is familiar with the theory, an incredible weakness in the 7th function; it can be called the blindspot, Polr, trickster, whatever really. Without it Ti is given free reign, and from there it prevents one from seeking out and caring for the facts of this world; it would rather rely on it's own methods(in theory.) In the INFJ one would give fantasy free reign and dominion over the mind, leading to dreams and visions of how a better world could be brought about. However, given the nature of Te it's unbelievably impractical, immeasurable, overly perfectionistic, and it leaves one with a pass/fail mindset in tasks. I imagine such fantasies, as they stem from some ""underlying universal pattern"", are product of an INFJ's Ni, but I'm unsure how it would manifest in an ISFJ- could you help me out? Is it the same thing minus the universal pattern part?
So yeah, maybe just explain some things that happen in your life that you think link Si without Te? Maybe there's a video that helped you understand it? Anything would be appreciated, thank you for your time."
2653,isfj,"I’ve always been allergic to Te. I don’t think about it, and it bites me in the ass. I despise the simple linkage between act/physical form and reality. I fear that kind of work above all else. Engaging in Te is deciding to engage in a mockery of what’s real-to me, Si and Ti- and engaging in the disgusting world of working towards a concrete goal. I despise workout plans, affirmation meditation, the bureaucratic pea cockery of job applications and fake interpersonal work dynamics. Information meetings, filling out tax forms, taking an overwhelming task one step at a time. 
I think Fe is the only thing holding me together sometimes. I don’t want to engage, but if someone else wants me to do something, I do it- and suddenly I am in the universe again. "
2654,isfj,"I’m the worst at telling people no. I feel so beyond guilty for it, even if I have a good excuse. I stress about it and go over situations and what they could be feeling or thinking if I do say no. 
Example: Nov - Jan turns into my fiancé’s family plans almost every weekend. No big deal, it’s the holidays and a lot of birthdays during that time. I just had to cancel on a thing thrown in there (they do some outings for the women so I’m just missing that, not a bday or holiday thing) and I could tell my future mother in law wasn’t happy about it and I feel so beyond guilty, but I’ve just got too much on my plate (we’re also wedding planning). Even though I know it’s okay to cancel and everyone will be fine, I sit here and worry about it non stop. 
Is this an ISFJ thing? Anyone have success with getting better about this? Any advice welcome!"
2655,isfj,"Oh yes. Last weekend I got invited out to celebrate a birthday. I said yes knowing I would get home from an all-day road trip roughly 30-45 minutes before I would have to leave again to make this. ""I won't be that tired it'll be fine"" I said to myself
Even after I got home exhausted, and I knew it was very much not in my best interest to go, and I knew everyone would be cool (and they were), I was still so nervous about canceling.
It seems to be an ISFJ thing, but I don't know how you get over it."
2656,isfj,"I've developed a habit to say ""I'll check what I have going on and get back to you"". If I'm lucky, I never get asked again, lol.
I have more trouble inviting people to stuff. I don't want them saying ""no"", and I'll imagine them saying ""no""."
2657,isfj,"YEP.
I've gotten better at it as I've gotten older, especially when it comes to my coworkers asking for too much from me, but yeah, it's so hard to say no in most situations. Don't really have any advice about improving things though, it just kinda...got a bit better on its own for me."
2658,isfj,"I used to have trouble saying no because I felt obligated or responsible to my commitments to people/job.
After some time, I'll reach my tipping my point and become resentful.
Now I've learned to not stretch myself thin for the sake of others. No point burning yourself to keep others warm.
For the few people that matter to me, I have no problems going above and beyond for them, even if I'm exhausted or caught up with work. Some how, some way, I will make time."
2659,isfj,"Hi, I am a 21 year old INTJ (guy) and my best friend is an ISFJ (girl). It's only been about 5 months since we met but we are already super close. I mean really close. I should say that we only have met twice in real life and that was during two inter-university event and yes she is from another university. Despite that we used to communicate everyday via phone or text. We never used to start our day without wishing each other 'Good Morning' and never end our day without saying 'Good Night/ Sweet dreams' . Our conversations may extend upto 5-6 hours each day. It's been the most fulfilling few months of my life as far as human relationships go. The thing is recently my grades have been gradually falling. Every time I try to open my books my thoughts wander of to the conversations that we had and I would mostly be looking forward to have our next conversation. I thought this was problematic and I talked about this to her and I told her that I was taking a kinda long break from social media and texting, including the chats with her.
Now it has been about 30 days since we last talked. Even though I said I wanted to take a break from Social Media I used to stalk her stories and her profile almost every single day. Today I saw that she had posted some sad pictures about stuff like 'letting someone you love go'. She never acted like this and I attempted to contact her on messenger. It seemed that I couldn't find her. I had a crazy thought that she was referring to me when she posted those pics and she had deleted her fb profile. I kinda knew if she was upset about me she would not pick up my phone and so used a spare number to contact her. She picked up and she seemed really detached. I talked to her for about 30 minutes trying to cheer her up and asking her why she seemed upset. After a while her spirits seemed to rise and she began responding well. Before we hanged up she asked me to accept her friend request on facebook because we got accidently 'unfriended' when she deactivated her account. That was when it hit me that she might have actually blocked me since simply deactivating your account will never remove any of your friends.
I am very much surprised about how all this turned out. She is probably my favorite person right now on earth and I have always found her to be very level headed and emotionally very mature. I never expected her to block me in my wildest dreams let alone be super upset about me apparently 'neglecting' her for a month. It puzzles me very much why she did not even attempt to message me even once if she felt neglected. I thought I had perfectly communicated with her regarding my need to find some space to take back my lost grades. I had promised her that I would get back to her once I got my life back on track. What surprised me the most is after this occurred I feel that she constantly has to be in touch with people that are closest to her, whereas I am perfectly fine with not communicating with my close friends (or even my family) for extended periods and being able to connect effortlessly later without the need for any such drama.
I would very much appreciate your valuable take on how I should have behaved in this situation and what to do to not let her become upset again. I really like this girl and it means so much to me.
Thank you :)"
2660,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ (18, F) and a very similar thing happened to me with an INTJ (17, M) who used to be my best friend. I’m pretty sure I can tell you what’s happening.
ISFJs are extremely sensitive and INTJs can be insensitive, so sometimes that can cause some problems (like the one you’re having). You may have explained quite logically why you need to cut contact with her for a bit, but if that happened to me, my thoughts would start spiraling. Let me explain.
ISFJs are extremely loyal, but also doubtful of their friends’ affection. It’s just an irrational fear a lot of us had. So when you told her that you needed to stop talking to her for a bit, that probably fed right into that fear. She probably began thought spiraling about whether or not you really liked her, analyzing your conversations for signs that you don’t actually want to be her friend, and just feeling rejected. That’s how I would react anyway.
When my INTJ rejected me, I did what she did on social media. I never actually blocked or unfollowed him, but I posted some sad stuff about letting people go and being hurt by people. Honestly, I was hoping that he would see the posts, recognize that he was hurting me, and ask me about it.
The reason that she got distant with you is because she wanted you to chase her. She feels very hurt, confused, and doesn’t really trust you right now. She wants you to prove that you actually do care about her by showing her some attention. She’s thinking that if she removes all her effort from the equation and then you start putting some in, that’s evidence that you actually do care. Until she’s satisfied by the amount of effort you’re putting in and thereby convinced that you actually like her, she’ll be distant because she doesn’t want to risk hurting herself again.
I know you may have logically explained your motives for not wanting to talk with her so much, but we’re human, so we don’t always have logical reactions. I can tell you, however, that we’re very forgiving (at least, I am) and if you just talk with her about it and put in some time and effort, things will go back to the way they were before. Good luck!!"
2661,isfj,"Thank you for replying :) , even though it's been a bit late. This is exactly what happened with us. Things are still a little cold between us. But I think what you said makes sense. I guess I should let her know I care for her regardless of her perceived 'coldness' towards me. To be honest it hurts to hard to see things change between us because we were really close once (The closest I have ever felt being with a person in a long long time) . But I think it all makes sense now. I never gave emotions it's due importance in human relationships because at times it indeed felt contrary to what rational sense might make of something. But rationality may not always be useful it seems now. I wish I knew this earlier though. Thanks again for replying happyorange ^^."
2662,isfj,"Alright, it's been about two days and she seems to be more and more detached. There is not the same spark in our conversations as before. Maybe I should give her some time to recuperate, at the same time letting her know I am indeed there for her through little gestures I guess. I hope it will work out. Thanks for sharing your experience too brother. Hope things turn up for the best in your case too."
2663,isfj,"I’m glad I could help, albeit a little late :). I really do think things will work out between you two because you’re acting much more maturely than my former INTJ friend. He just ended up bottling up all his emotions and randomly lashing out at me because he was unwilling to express them in a healthy/mature conversation. The fact that you’re willing to express how you’re feeling and take initiative in repairing the relationship shows a lot of maturity and I think she’ll appreciate it. Your willingness to step up without her calling you out will also go a long way towards getting things back to normal.
So like you said, let her know that you care about her (don’t say “despite your coldness” though because that could offend her) and actually make CHANGES in your behavior. Be consistent with it and you’ll be fine. The fact that she reacted so strongly shows that she cares about you a lot, so I’m pretty sure she’ll move past this :)."
2664,isfj,"Before I go to far I firstly want to apologise for any spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes. I'm dyslexic lol (true) 
I'm an ESFJ and my sister in-law is an ISFJ. I care about her and just want to get along, but alas I have upset her and would like to patch things up as it's gotten out of hand.
Last weekend I had my daughter's birthday party at which we had an issue. It was time to do the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I had spent over a week putting it together and the topper on the cake had already fallen and broke in which my husband patched up and fixed it to his best ability.
We had a plastic table cloth on the table a the little ones ranging from ages 1-4 were pulling at in and everything including the cake was sliding everywhere. So my sister in-law piped up and said why don't we just take the table cloth off. Which I happily agreed should be done and was grateful she wanted to help. At the stage she was crouched down holding her son, I was now standing hands full with an unstable Birthday cake in my hands. She from her crouched position couldn't see a thing past me and began to pull the table cloth off. On the other side of me was all my daughters gifts big boxes etc. They were all coming in my direction. I was trapped between boxes of stuff coming my way, a cake in my hands and my sister in-law crouched down holding her kid in one hand and grabbing at the table cloth in the other. I was trapped and couldn't do a thing. In a panic I asked her to stop. She kept pulling so I raised my voice in urgency to stop again which she did. Everything got fixed up boxes taken off and went on with the Birthday song and cutting of the cake. I thought nothing much of it until my husband had talked to his brother and he said she wasn't happy with how she was treated. So now what do I do as this weekend my nephew had his birthday party this weekend and we didn't get invited and got to see all the photos up on fb. For me I'm just upset my child got excluded from her cousin birthday over this. I'm sure this couldn't have just been the only thing I've upset her with, but I've never gone out of my way to upset anyone on purpose let alone her. I don't want to make things worse I just want to make things better mostly for the kids sake. Please any advice would be nice. Thanks in advance. "
2665,isfj,"From what you said, the only thing that could've felt like she was treated badly was thinking she was getting yelled at when you raised your voice. Did you explain that you weren't yelling at her but raised your voice in a panic because of the situation?"
2666,isfj,Most ISFJs will grudgingly accept an apology or explanation but we also like to be very clear about what our role was in this debacle. I always give others another chance but my heart does not always agree.
2667,isfj,"that's a tough thing to answer. she's obviously a sensitive person. sensitive people have triggers on their self image that when threatened, even unintentionally, will set them off to defend that image. it's why she doesn't want to see you right now. is there a way that your kid can go to the party and you won't have to be there? maybe she'd be ok with that pointless and needless compromise.
also, iono. personally i'd confront a friend or family member about this rather directly, but it might lead to more conflict and more distance. "
2668,isfj,"Hey all, I would greatly appreciate any and all advice I can get on dealing with negative emotions (usually feeling sad or anxious). Right now dealing with some health issues that my husband has and it feels so overwhelming. If I am able to encourage myself for a few minutes, it usually doesn't last long.
I am willing to do what it take... I wish so badly to be in control of my emotions, or, better yet, wish I didn't even have emotions. Have any of you had success in dealing with this type of thing?"
2669,isfj,"I would recommend you look into CBT, the most effective therapy available for depression. Because our negative emotions stem from our negative thoughts, the easiest way to cultivate positive emotions is to have positive thoughts. I know this sounds super empty and fake, like ""just think happy thoughts and you'll be happy!"" which is actually terrible. And it is a little more complex than that, with specific responses to specific ways that we believe the worst about the world.
I've been reading a book called Feeling Good by David Burns, and its written for a wide audience. You might like it.
https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/cbt-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-techniques-worksheets/
That's a pretty good intro, and it's pretty detailed too. Good luck. =]"
2670,isfj,"I'm pretty new to this and actually helping myself by learning about my type & using different resources to guide myself, the best advice I'd give myself from what I've learned so far if I were in your shoes as an ISFJ is: to take it easy on yourself, don't be so exacting & overcritical with yourself if you feel like you're not able to be the ""be all & end all"" for someone else., 
Our first step should be to heal ourselves before we can be of any real help to others. 
We have to learn to take things easy as an ISFJ and realize that we can't fix everything and neither is it our place to do so.
The best way to help others is by empowering them rather than putting all the pressure & responsibility on ourselves to help them.
Not sure if this resonates for you but that's what I'd tell myself. :) "
2671,isfj,"Sorry I'm a little late on this, but I can really empathize with how you feel. In addition to the CBT suggestion a poster already recommended, also do a little search on ACT (Acceptance-Commitment Therapy) and a book called ""The Happiness Trap."" It talks about how people often try to ignore/get rid of negative emotions and then those emotions keep rearing their ugly heads until you can fully acknowledge and accept them. Also, meditation!"
2672,isfj,"Hi I sometimes put a lot of pressure on myself about getting something done, but there is no time to do it or it is realistically could not be done. Then I keep trying to do it again and again, but couldn't get to it or make it come true. I just tell my mind, this can't be done and it will be okay if I fail to do this, so stop putting more energy into it. So if your mind start to strangle you, just find a way out or a space. Think of thoughts like it's okay if this is not done or this do not happen, it will be okay. I can cope. There is another way out. It's not a big deal as I think it is. The world will not end if I don't finish this. This is just something that works for me. I'm not saying to give up, but to let go what can't be done and replace it with something you can achieve."
2673,isfj,now this could just be a option for only those who is not too feeling and feeling is kinda the whole isfj deal but what you could try is forming a logical reason why hes going to be fine that the chances are on his side so theres no real point in worrying he will be fine combine that with a cat video some sleep and you should have yourself a happy day
2674,isfj,"A little late here, but Im an ISFJ and find that self soothing in a sensory way helps me to feel better. For example, taking a warm bath or listening to nature sounds. Anything that can engage our five senses. I learned this technique from therapy Ive been through, and find it helpful:)
I also second the poster who suggested CBT. It can help with anxiety and depression. "
2675,isfj,"I would, although I've seen him typed as both INFJ and INTJ online. A lot of people don't seem to like him very much though, which I kind of understand, but honestly I find him to be very similar to myself so I do actually enjoy his character. (I'm only at the end of season 2 so far.) Thoughts?"
2676,isfj,Yeah I think he is either an ISFJ or INFJ. I think he is more of INFJ though because that whole series was about his vision of his life with mother and kids. But he could also be an ISFJ because he does recall the store in great detail. Not sure if an INFJ would do that.
2677,isfj,I had a best friend who was an ENTP and I ended up falling in love with him. We both horrifically screwed it up though before we could even give the relationship a chance. He's getting married today and I still regret everything with every fiber of my being and wish I could still talk to him. 
2678,isfj,"I don't think I know any irl, but honestly every time I see you guys online, you piss me off. I tend to avoid interacting with you because I know there's a very good chance it's just going to spike my blood pressure something fierce. I have a particular problem with pretension though, so I might not be representative of most ISFJs. "
2679,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and my SO is an ENTP. We have been together for 7 years and have a lot in common, also we have different traits that admire in each other. We help each other to be a more complete person. For example, he is now more empathetic than some years ago, and I have learnt to not overthink too much and identify when I'm being crazy. Normally, our arguments get complicated when I feel bad or anxious and he can't understand how I feel, he always is giving me solutions to my problems but little comfort. Sometimes I want someone that understands how I feel, not telling me what I'm doing wrong and what I should do instead. Also I'm very caring and like to surprise him with little actions, he on the other hand shows his love in a more practical way haha. "
2680,isfj,"Depends on people. If you have enough tact, you'll be fine.
Source : I don't have enough tact.
PS : INFJs who worship us don't know us. ISFJs are usually more clearsighted and pragmatic, at this regard."
2681,isfj,"ENTPs are the most attractive of all people (not to me but in general), even when they treat people badly they still find them around, could be a natural charisma or whatever you want to call it. SFs are more prone to see through it.  All STs  on the other hand are not impressed to begin with. Specially ISTJs don't think highly of you people."
2682,isfj,"i usually find them to be, yeah interesting and intelligent, but too detached and like to play devil's advocate without really listening to what i'm trying to say.  i do have a good ENTP friend who i have the same interests in though and we get on well enough, wouldn't be an ideal relationship though."
2683,isfj,"I am an ENTP and I just told my friend to do this test. Apparently he is one of you guys, an ISFJ.
The funny thing is that we have a lot of things in common when it comes to interests. We both like to play games (are good in those games too), have the same career (web development), around the same humor and we both like watching Animes :'d
Our friendship is good I think. Not that close (we don't really talk about personal stuff) but I can talk with him about many things. Unfortunately I am a bad listener sometimes because I always get distracted and lost in my thoughts and then I'm like ""What did you just say?"" :P but luckily he always responds easily and friendly in a fun way. No hard feelings. I do get along really well with him. I never really thought about this kind of stuff, so I can't go into much details but I will take care of our social interactions :D!
Also in term of relationships ENTP and ISFJ have a potential to get along according to
http://www.personalityrelationships.net/entp-relationships/"
2684,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ, and my fiancé is INTJ and my best friend is ENTP. I've gotta say, I love my NTs and it bothers me how much material online says we should clash. But what REALLY makes me laugh is how supposedly I should be comparable with ESTP, my least favorite segment of humanity 🙄"
2685,isfj,"I almost dated an ENTP, and I know a handful of xNTPs personally. They're definitely interesting. ENTP in question and I would've never really gotten along romantically, however, despite that never happening, I still go to him for advice. He always gives me rational, reasonable solutions when I'm not handling things well and allows me to see things from completely new perspectives, especially being a traditionalist. 
As for my other xNTP friends, I love the constant flow of ideas from my INTP friend and I love bouncing those ideas off of her. My other INTP friend never fails to make me smile. Yeah, I'm really different from them, but I don't know if I could ever get bored of them. "
2686,isfj,"My dad is an ENTP and I used to love & respect him & get along very well with him. But he kind of went off the rails after his midlife crisis recently and our relationship has been rocky ever since. Now I can barely stand to be around him! His behavior in public... weird need to have to charm everyone he comes across, especially new people, really irks me for whatever reason. IDK if it's just me but maybe once you get on an ISFJ's bad side it's hard to get out haha I don't give him a break at all, even when it's clear he's trying to appease me.
We used to get along b/c our senses of humor, and him making me feel protected and like I had someone to hide behind in social situations, or an example to follow. Now all I can do is notice how different we are and how much I dislike his personality lol! Even though other people think he's the nicest guy alive! I go to the dentist, and they find out I'm his kid and get all excited telling me how great he is, even though he's only been to this dentist twice."
2687,isfj,"We're not pretentious. We're nerds. Chances are we know what we're talking about.
I'm not sure I represent myself well what you're talking about, though. Do you care to elaborate ? =)"
2688,isfj,"As an ENTP I can agree. My girlfriend is an ESFJ with a mental disorder. She is quite anxious because of her mental disorder but I can comfort her well with rational and reasonable solutions to make her feel better. Also ENTP like to improve themselves and their relationship, so if you work together with an ENTP a good outcome is quite likely to happen :)."
2689,isfj,"People who think they're funny, or clever, or know more than you about something. People who lack the humility to have a dialogue because they feel the need to show off or one-up or just be right. 
It's an irritating trait to most people, but I have a brother who's the absolute epitome of that kind of know-it-all behavior, so it makes me irrationally furious. And unfortunately that's been 99% of the kind of behavior I've seen from you guys. Even the original post in this thread feels condescending. ""INFJs worship us?"" Really??? I'm a huge nerd too, but I don't say shit like that. "
2690,isfj,"I'm just brutally honest and cynical, mind you. =)
I'm trying really hard to learn how to be more smooth and politically correct. Tactful.
It's just, you know, it's like trying to build a card fort with mittens."
2691,isfj,"And that's not even my final form.
Pretentious people are the one who come without backup for their claims. I'm not of this kind.
Maybe you came here to be educated on this topic …
… or about proper english.
I'm only scornful."
2692,isfj,"It only makes me want to tell you to return on Facebook, where everything is non-confrontational.
But you're right about that. I can handle with admitting I'm just needlessly confrontational and spiteful.
It still makes me wonder if you can handle this kind confrontation, though."
2693,isfj,"No. I'm just really really really frustrated about being unemployed. And being told I'm lazy over and over, on top of it.
There is no adult and respectful way I can deal with it. I tried. I failed. Again."
2694,isfj,"I couldn't care less about being seen as deep. (Or shallow, as you're probably sarcastic.) I'm saying I need help/advice. Or emotional validation.
I'd like you to stop being a cheap troll and work your fingers on your keyboard and neurons better. There's people who need your help out there.
So don't make me waste my time. Don't waste your time."
2695,isfj,"Hello. I came here for help since im absolutely clueless. I have absolutely no idea what should I buy to my best girl friend (notice that space) for xmas. Like...I appreciate practical gifts..But I think she loves those creative sentimental gifts...I think she is ISFJ (not sure, im not that good at those letters :P ) ..
What would you buy? Any help would be really appreciated. I wasnt sure in which subreddit I should upload this. If to infp(me-male) or isfj (her). So I posted it into both :D
And happy upcoming christmas holidays for all of you, wonderful people :3 "
2696,isfj,"From personal knowledge, I would say get something that either
1. Has a practical, everyday use
2. Has a sentimental value (preferably something homemade)
For best results, find/make something that combines both :)
Hope this helps! And happy holidays!"
2697,isfj,"Honestly I love hand-written cards and gifts that are meaningful yet not expensive. 
If she really likes League of Legends, you could get her a cute Poro plushie (this is just an example but can be applied to a lot of stuff). If she enjoys activities, you could make her a coupon like ""one free trip with me to the bowling lanes"" and just make it look cute and like an actual ticket/coupon.
Best of luck, as long as you put thought into it I'm sure she'll appreciate the gift you give :) Remember it's not about price but the thoughtfulness that goes into the gift (altho I can only really speak for myself). "
2698,isfj,"Hey, I'm also looking into getting a CPA! I have a commerce degree but never specialized in accounting so I've got some schooling left to go before I can start with CPA Ontario. I work for the government so they may pay for some of it."
2699,isfj,"Hello there, INFP here. I'm curious about something. I'm trying to get in touch with my Si and I notice that when a focus on the world around me, it gets hard to pay attention to my constant stream o absurd ideas and I cannot keep perceving the world for long before I get annoyed and defaut back to paying attention to my mind. So I wondered: is that reversed to high Si users? When you try to focus on your ideas connecting inside your head, do you feel annoyed and defaut back to perceving the world around you? "
2700,isfj,"It's kind of the opposite for me. Sometimes I can get caught up on ideas and stuff, but then I realize that none of that will ever happen if I don't focus on the real world, so I go back to the present. I kinda ride the line between sensing and intuition, so I go back and forth between idealistic and realistic. I guess I'm not really a good ISFJ to respond to this then lol. "
2701,isfj,"Im not sure if you are still actively looking at this thread, but Ive always wanted to ask an INFP this: Why do you guys disappear when you get offended? Its happened twice to me and both times I wasn't aware that I offended anyone"
2702,isfj,"I think i might need more info but off the top it could be two things:
1-we do take criticism personally and can get defensive. I think an immature INFP could easily break ties than to face the situation and the person. Which leads to reason 2. We feel things so deeply that it can hurt too much to face that. We're dealing with possible rejection from someone who is important to us, regret for the situation and guilt from how the other person feels. These are all painful and we tend to ignore pain and shutting it, or shutting a person out is easier than facing it.
The F is not rational at all. (I often wish i could be more T) F is like riding an emotional roller coaster all the time with a ticking time bomb in your lap. One minute life could be amazing, the next it is hopeless and it can be triggered by anything inside or outside our heads. So we shut it out, or in essence, turn off the feelings in order  to make it through the day and through life.
I think maturity has a lot to do with dealing with this stuff effecticely, but still it happens to varying degrees daily.
Hope this helps. Let me know if you have more questions."
2703,isfj,"I also want to say Im sorry this happened to you. It seems like it caused you pain. Also, I'm not defending it. It is selfish behaviour, especially to an observer or to the other person involved. I'm not proud of it, but i can say that i have out grown it finally....at least mostly."
2704,isfj,"I am an ENTP (tertiary Fe), and I find it pretty difficult to handle emotionally manipulative people.
I tend to kind of just walk away, as I’m not sure what I could say to remedy the situation (YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FE).
Any of you strong Fe users have any ideas for gracefully dealing with these types of situations? Thanks :)"
2705,isfj,"I deal with it by either playing into with them with the full knowledge that I'm being manipulated and turn it around on them given the chance to make them realize what they're doing. 
Or I give em' the old call out and call their bullshit out on the spot. "
2706,isfj,"Most of the time, I encounter the manipulative types during casual conversation.  They tend to get socially agressive whenever an opportunity (to impress someone they admire or cast a better light on themselves) arises.
To me, this is a competition, of sorts.  It's not that I necessarily want the thing more, I just want to show them that they don't need it right then and there, and that aggressive social behavior affects everyone involved."
2707,isfj,"""Often replaying the same song, or rereading a book, provides a form of time-travel within the ISFJ. They revisit who they once were and what they once felt in powerful ways.""
Majorly this. :) I love being taken back to the feelings I got when I first read a book or listened to a song. "
2708,isfj,"Former editor's assistant here.
You might get someone to proofread this and directly correct some of the syntactical & grammatical errors.  It's a great topical read, and it's very insightful, but I don't want to just pass this by and have your work misconstrued as something less than credible.
Nevertheless, thanks for posting it.  The read was very nice."
2709,isfj,"Oh, absolutely. After I start doing said thing, it usually subsides though... Then comes the ""making sure it's perfect"" aspect of my personality... I don't start a lot of projects just because I know I will drive myself nuts to make sure it's PERFECT in the end."
2710,isfj,"Yes. Actually I just started doing EMDR with my therapist, it's a kind of therapy that aims to engage both sides of the brain so that emotional thinking is balanced out with logical thinking. It's a slow process, but it's been very helpful to me so far. "
2711,isfj,"I thought it would spice things up here since this sub is dead. If you're an ISFJ, post your picture on here. I wonder if we have any similar physical qualities.
Edit -I'm new to this joint -i.e reddit- how do I post a picture with my text? :)

2712,isfj,"I used Tinder, and it worked great for me.
I downloaded it for the entertainment value, out of morbid curiosity. I had no intention of actually meeting up with anybody on there, and I assumed most (if not all) of the people using it were just seeking hookups, which isn't appealing to me.
Within a few hours of having the app, though, I matched with a really awesome guy. He was funny, attractive, seemed really normal. We talked for a few days and went out, and we've been together for nearly a year and a half now. I'm very happy with him.
I'm probably in the minority with my immediate success, though, and I have a lot of friends who've had zero luck with Tinder."
2713,isfj,"Grindr has worked fairly well for me. I find it’s the best one for gay guys because it’s simply got the largest population. It is however a hookup app, or at least has the reputation.
Though as a caveat to hookup apps, if you’re looking for the long term relationships like I do, I find it important to humanize myself in their eyes as they’re human to me. I look for the potential of friendship in who I’m talking to, not necessarily someone who has 100% the same qualities or interests I have, but someone who I can enjoy being around.  That means they need to see me for that as well. 
I’ve found a few quality guys who I’ve fallen out of relationships with for reasons more to do with them or our inability to see eye to eye on critical issues, but that’s been due to issues developed after meeting and getting to know one another. 
I do recommend that if you get into a dating app, it’s better to talk to the person for a few days at least before meeting up, unless there’s really a good connection. (I’ve had that work out for one guy actually who I dated for around 2 months). 
Good luck! "
2714,isfj,"I've tried a few apps (POF, Tinder, etc), and didn't have much luck. I gave Bumble a try about a month ago and have been dating someone after less than a week on the app. 
I felt Bumble gave me the opportunity to vibe out my possibilities without being harassed or spammed the way I experienced with other apps.  "
2715,isfj,"I've used Tinder and OkCupid. Tinder was pretty much a bust for me since I've been looking for more than just a hookup. OkCupid has been much more successful for me, especially with the more in-depth profile sections and whatnot. It's a lot easier to see what you might have in common with someone, assuming they fill stuff out to a certain extent. "
2716,isfj,"So u/kjeezy0127 and I have done some themed threads, and I did a few weekend threads but forgot to keep up with them. But if there's interest from the community, I'll set reminders in my phone so that I remember to post things.
A few questions:


What would you like to see? Daily/weekly/weekend/a combination?


What would you like them to be about? Generic topics/specific topics/current events?


Any other feedback?


Thanks guys, just trying to get a feel for the community! Oh and I didn't talk to u/kjeezy0127 before posting this so feel free to weigh in, dude. xD"
2717,isfj,"I'm not an ISFJ (narrowly) but am dating an ISFJ.  It'd be neat to see topics that help me understand some of the tendencies and preferences that may come with your type!  That might also draw other types into this sub who are interested in learning.
One thing that could be fun is a weekly/monthly ISFJ appreciation thread where us non-ISFJs praise the ISFJs in our life so you can all see that your actions are appreciated.  You'd probably have to build up a decent non-ISFJ subscriber base first, though."
2718,isfj,"I think something that could be cool is doing an ISFJ AMA here and advertise it on /r/mbti .
​
Where people from that sub (non-ISFJs) can ask ISFJ questions on a sticky topic and maybe leave that open for a weekend or something."
2719,isfj,"I’d appreciate anecdotes of how you ISFJ’s have taken advantage of your shadow functions. Stories are great. Really any kind of “aha” moments, esp your demon/trickster functions (my bf is an ISFJ, I’m INTP). 
Also ways you have overridden Si-Ti loop either intentionally or accidentally. "
2720,isfj,"Hey, there! Dropping in from r/entp. :) This looks like an interesting idea. I know r/infj has had success with their weekly threads. If you haven't already, you should check it out and maybe reach out to their mods."
2721,isfj,"I’m an ENTP who was just curious to know what the subreddit of the “opposite type” looked like, and I barely resisted the urge to click away as soon as I saw this question. It’s so anti-ENTP I’m getting almost physically sick imagining someone could find this kind of endeavor entertaining. Ouch. 
(P.S. My wife is an ISFJ, so there’s also a personal thing going on here...)"
2722,isfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/entp] The most anti-ENTP question ever...

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
2723,isfj,"Well see my idea is to get more people cpick me and subscribe to this sub
So:
1) Make a topic on /r/ISFJ saying ""All non ISFJs ask us ISFJs any questions you have"" or something
2) Make a Link topic on /r/mbti saying ""Asks ISFJs anything on /r/ISFJ subreddit"" have the URL link to topic on /r/ISFJ
3) The subscribers of /r/ISFJ see and answer the topics that come in"
2724,isfj,"Lol we're not good at small talk either, naturally, being introverts. But I work in a professional environment so I've had to get good at it. It's a work in progress. 😅 If I had to hazard a guess I'd say that being good at small talk is a Fe thing."
2725,isfj,"Does anyone know if there are any suggestions of dog breeds/temperaments that mesh particularly well with ISFJ? 
Obviously it will vary some from one person to another, but generally speaking. Thanks!"
2726,isfj,This is kinda interesting. I never thought about dog breeds meshing with certain types. For me I am in love with dachshunds. I'm partial to the long dogs for some reason. I also like jack russels because they are just fun-loving. Not really into the big dogs.
2727,isfj,I'm not really sure about this. I had a yorkshire terrier but we never clicked. Big dogs are my thing personally. Great Pyrenees are my favorite though. All depends on what you're looking for. I only had that breed because we had animals for them to look after. Big friendly dogs make me happy heh.
2728,isfj,"I have a black Labrador, her name is Onyx and she is incredible, but she is getting on in years had her for about seven years now. We clicked right away, and she's a rescued pet in quite the literal sense as she was being neglected and abused by her previous owners. To this day I still can't pet her without her wincing a bit, but I see no harm in admitting that she was stolen from vile individuals that surely would have let her die in their backyard. Two weeks later and she was obeying even advanced commands that take way more time and dedication than the average canine. 
The only bad habit she has is getting into food when she is not supposed to. I strongly suggest a dog in the labrador family as they are not temperamental on a whim and they are great cuddle dogs faithful and friendly even when others are not.   "
2729,isfj,"What's the general consensus?
What's your experience with them as friends, relatives, or lover?
I hate them. I admire their intelligence, but they're very difficult for me to accommodate; leaves me literally crying in frustration and disappointment. "
2730,isfj,you guys are just way too emotional for us but hey now for my hourly sarcastic comment. you guys just love us so much dont you? now then the fact that we are difficult for you making you cry is a example of this
2731,isfj,"IxFJ gets energy from other people's excitement. Therefore they also get energy from intellectual interactions, exploring possibilities, or doing things, with the relevant other introverted types.
IMO, YMMV, etc."
2732,isfj,"My best friend seriously thought I was an extrovert by the fact I can talk her to death on Skype chat. But...most of my efforts are focused towards a few people, and even though I love to withdraw at the end of the day to be by myself. So...social while I'm with the ones I love, but happy to be alone too. Strangers...it really depends. Sometimes I'm quiet and other times I'll talk to someone in the checkout line. "
2733,isfj,"Hello, ISFJs, I'm an INTP. Me and another person were talking about how a lot of INTPs experience this, and which other personality types are more prone to experiencing it. I decided I'm going to go around all of the different reddits and ask. If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, basically it means you don't feel worthy of your successes, and you find it hard to be proud of achievements or accept compliments. You feel like a fraud, and that you got lucky to achieve what you have. You can Google it if you want to know more."
2734,isfj,"INTJ here. What is this imposter syndrome you speak of? 
Jokes aside, I think this is related more to low self-esteem and confidence, than anything else. Therefore, you would expect people in their 20s to have it more than those in their 40s, for example. I suspect FPs struggle with it more than TJs, as another example."
2735,isfj,Like the other comment mentioned I think this is primarily linked to low self-esteem and lack of confidence in one abilities. I think for me it's when I was going through self-esteem issues and lacked self-confidence that I suffered imposter syndrome. I think as ISFJs especially at average or unhealthy mental health levels we can be prone to this cause we can be self-conscious about things  and suffer social comparison bias (More Info about this is here https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/social-comparison-theory).
2736,isfj,"I have this odd contradictory thing going on where when I receive an award or recognition, on some level I really think I deserve it because hey, I do work hard, but on another level I'm immediately like, ""But remember that one time you were lazy"" and then I feel bad."
2737,isfj,"One theory of the MBTI states that people crave their fourth function, or are convinced that they are missing out on it. For INFPs, that is Te (extroverted thinking; or order & success in the outer world). So when you struggle with feeling successful in the outer world, know that it is something that most INFPs and ISFPs feel. 
Also, I've known people who were built for worldly success, but others who were built for helping/ coaching/ guiding others towards worldly success, and yet others who were built for being loners who walked their own path. At different times in life, I've felt like I belonged in one category or the other. So don't compare yourself to others; find what works best for you - what aligns with your soul - and go with that.  
Hope that helps. I don't know what I'd do without the INFPs in my life...y'all are adorable."
2738,isfj,"I suppose I should begin by stating that I'm an ESTJ and I'm not afraid to venture my opinions or debate with people. I have a lot of friends, and it's true, some people don't like me, but not that many. But a trend with ISFJs seems to have surfaced. They think I lack people skills. One of my friends that I've known since I was eight (I'm 30 now) has commented periodically through the years that I lack people skills, though has never been willing to elaborate when I've asked him what he meant by that. I thought this feeling toward me was individual to him, but other ISFJs I've met and made this comment as well, which has shown a trend now.  
I can tell you right now, other people don't tell me this, even the types that tend to be more blunt. In fact, I usually get very different comments, usually positive. Are ISFJs not good with perceived conflict? My friend of 22 years acts like any difference of opinion is automatically ""conflict"" and always attempts to smooth things over in group settings as if he's some kind of referee. I've never been able to have conversations with him about deeper matters, religion, politics, etc, he 's always clammed up pretty fast. These other ISFJs I've spoken with were willing to talk about these things, but were really offended really fast, and now seem to hate me with a loathing passion, of which I sense vindictiveness in the way they communicate now. I suspect this person is a little unhealthy, because my friend has only ever been vindictive once.  
Any thoughts or comments?"
2739,isfj,"Based on other ETs that have come here with posts like this, I think you’ll get answers you like better if you ask /estj or other T subreddits. 
My first impression of this post is that you want Isfjs to tell you something you can debate them for, and to you this is a normal conversation. To us, it’s like “ISFJs! What do you have to say about your weak, sniveling brethren!”
Isfjs and estjs don’t value the same thing in social affairs. Aux Fe is all about harmony with others and Estjs don’t value that too much if at all. 
Again: you probably won’t find the info you want here. It’s going to be said in a way you don’t value, based on principles you don’t value. "
2740,isfj,"It could be that these particular ISFJs don't like your way of discussing. You're a Te dom which can easily clash with our Fe aux. Te values logic and efficiency while Fe values group harmony, so an Fe user is much more likely to not want to take an argument for the sake of not upsetting anyone.. which could be why some ISFJ might think you lack people skill
I for one have no issues with having a difference of opinion w/ someone, but I dislike overly aggressive/assertive argument, and will likely end the discussion if i feel my partner is getting to 'railed' up(in a negative sense).
edit: Fe user are also more likely to tell when people are getting uncomfortable/upsets, so maybe you just don't notice what your ISFJ friends do (i.e. your focus is probably on you being right, while theirs is probably on how everyone is feeling)"
2741,isfj,"Interacting with a Te dom can be a bit jarring for ISFJ's. I think the root of the problem is auxiliary Fe vs. inferior Fi. Our emotional processes are just so different. I know for me personally, Fi is one of the hardest functions to understand or relate to, and the lower it is in a person's stack the more true that is. I find ExTJ's very intimidating.
Te doms are all about cold logic, rationality and getting results above all else. These are all great qualities in the right context, but to a sensitive ISFJ they can come off as unfeeling/uncaring, and we might see the ESTJ as a bull in a china shop, socially speaking.
u/Nutella_Hotchocolate summarized it really well. ISFJ's value group cohesion and common ground. We tend to be indirect communicators and are very attentive to the tone of an argument. The straightforward, self-assured way Te doms tend to communicate can sometimes read to us as social ineptitude. We see the ExTJ steamrolling over people's feelings to make their point, ignoring the nuances and nonverbal communication that might be taking place, and we interpret it as social ineptitude because we are so finely attuned to nonverbal cues. (In truth, I think it's often the case that ExTJ's are aware of these things, but simply don't care, and refuse to let them get in the way of the ExTJ making a point or achieving a goal.)
I hope this doesn't sound disparaging to ExTJ's; I actually have a great deal of admiration for those types. But I think ExTJ's and IxFJ's are just naturally frustrating to each other when it comes to communication because our processes are just so different and we have such different goals. ISFJ's communicate to understand more about themselves and others, and to find common ground and harmony. ESTJ's communicate to get results and figure out actionable steps to take toward their goals. ISFJ's communicate for communication's sake; ESTJ's communicate in service of their goals. Neither is right or wrong, but they can be difficult to reconcile."
2742,isfj,"maybe it is because we are so focused on behaving morally,  always behaving in the right way to the right people, always careful not to trigger anything in them, and many of us also hold others to the same standard, which is wrong of us and cause us to alienate people.  
therefore it is important for us to stop holding others to that high standard. "
2743,isfj,"I know ExTJs can be very intimidating to deal with as ISFJs. Like others have said dominant Te can be a lot to handle. This seems to be a Te and Fe clash. From an ISFJ perspective, it seems like you guys can come off as very blunt and say hurtful things. I think what they mean is that you aren’t good at relating to how other people feel and understanding the effect things have on their emotion. I will say as ISFJs we are so in tune with other people’s emotions and feelings that we can expect others to be as well. TJ types in general seem to have the hardest time reading other people’s emotions. A lot of times in a discussion they’ll keep going and not realize that other people don’t wanna listen to you or might be upset. My advice is just to be more mindful of this when you’re speaking. Also since we tend to not always speaking up about this tell them it’s okay to tell you when you have upset them. "
2744,isfj,"ESFP, ISFJ's, INFJ's (when I talk to INFJ's it is like I am living.  The INFJ's in my life are the most helpful people I know, and they don't unintentionally overwhelm me with talkativeness or a need to fill the air like ENFJ's and other extroverts sometimes do,) ESFJ's, and ISFP's.  Though ISFP's really piss me off sometimes."
2745,isfj,"Where did you find female ESTP lol
My fav types so far: ISFJ, ISTJ, ESFJ, ISFP, ENTP, ESFP, ENFP
I am not sure about other types because I couldn't type them correctly.
I have always hard Time with ESTJ, ISTP and INTJ."
2746,isfj,"Hey guys and gals, 21 M ENTP student here. 
I honestly wish I could be more like you all. Because of my Ti and Ne, my GPA seemed to have dropped incredibly low to the point where I don't know if I will graduate. 
How do you guys manage to stay so focused? I've tried to develop habits I learnt from my ESFJ dad like writing up a schedule and trying to follow it but my Ti just takes over and I start going on wikipedia to learn about why turtles swim (for example). It works fine for about 2 weeks or so and then I just lose focus. I just don't get how I stop that from happening. 
It's gotten to the point where it just gets super annoying and I end up rushing on almost every assignment and handing it in last minute. I even end up missing lunch/dinner just because I was procrastinating the entire day."
2747,isfj,"Sneaking in with some INTJ advice, hope that's OK.
I would try folding in Te (ENTP's motivating function). Start keeping a log and using other measuring devices like timers. Just measure yourself and what you're doing, see what you can find out. Remember, you're a mad scientist. If you want more control over your life, you add instrumentation and measure things. And keep doing the exact kind of exploratory research you're doing here, both on the inquisition side and on the exposition side--sharing your experience so far in e.g. written form.
You may also wish to start a study group where you will guide the group through a set of productivity-oriented exercises you dug up and become a sort of host / guest lecturer. When I coach ENTPs I frequently put them on the stage and tell them to lecture me in subjects that are new to them. Make it fun.
Deliberate Si practice could be risky with your energy because it's introverted and you sound pretty extraverted. It's possible that a focus on Si could just leave you more exhausted without much to show for it. I'd work on your extraverted functions first, and watch as Si and the rest fold themselves into the fractal of your daily activities automatically, in their own way, as Jung said they would.
It could also be (possibilities!) that you are studying an area that is somehow too boring, too easy, not a match for your type (does not really work Ne/Ti/Te), etc.
Good luck."
2748,isfj,"Hey Guys, I am an ENTP and I am creating short video summaries for each type as a side-project. I just finished the ISFJ video and thought I'd let you know :)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LklfhiFNzms
Thank you guys for being so warm and friendly individuals that you guys hold the pillars of the world together :)
I really love reading feedbacks so let me know what you think! Enjoy! :)"
2749,isfj,"Hey everyone, so here is the thing. I'm coming back from a relationship that really messed me up,  it's been a couple of months now and I'm getting better, I'm ready to move on with my life, but I don't know where to... 
I define myself a lot by what I bring to others. I'm not as close with my friends as I used to be, but that's just everyone being busy with their lives, so I naturally want to get closer to someone and I'm asking myself: do I want another relationship just to quickly feel better? Should I take more time alone to learn to like myself better? On the other hand, what if it's just me being an ISFJ, maybe there is no ""working on yourself"" bullshit that's gonna make me happy like feeling close to someone can.
So, as anyone been struggling with the dilemma of trying to be happy by themselves, or relying on your relationships (friendship or romantic) to achieve that? Any advice on that?
I'm doing fine with my life otherwise: good job, doing my master degree, exercising, eating well, etc... But that's daily routine, it doesn't make me happy or unhappy, it's just there to keep me busy."
2750,isfj,"You can be happy by yourself, and you should absolutely work on it. I have been in the exact same situation before and felt the same thing, where another relationship would have felt great because it would allow me to become close with another person. But what I realized is that a lot of the reason why I liked that was because it allowed me to essentially let them do a lot of the work for things that I'm not good at (eg. Ne). 
I think it's really important to know who you are and what you value, and being with someone else didn't force me to answer those questions because I could just say ""I'll do anything as long as you're happy"". Obviously I want my partner to be happy, but it's ridiculous to believe that it's the only thing an ISFJ wants. We're notorious for doing that, and neglecting our own needs is a pretty big shortcoming, because it's not sustainable and if you do it too long it can push you to some pretty dark places. 
So I would say that taking some time is a good idea. Find out what it is that you truly desire. Ask questions about yourself. A lot of them. And be honest. Look at your past relationships as well. What went wrong, and why? These can be painful things to analyze but it's absolutely worth it in the end. That way when you do find a partner you enter the relationship as a healthy, responsible person. You have your own ambitions and they can have theirs, and you can support one another with out having to become one another. Obviously you'll value your partners happiness, but you'll be more grounded and won't need to overextend and hurt yourself again. "
2751,isfj,"Hey-Nabla_223, Think I can help. I'm 49, female, ISFJ, borderline INTJ, 2 marriages -one bad (divorced), one good and current. 
Like another person advised, take time off from dating, step back and really analyze your relationships. Which ones did you Enjoy? Which ones were utterly Exhausting? Really ask yourself ""why did I feel that way, did I do or say things because I wanted to or because it made the other person happy""
I am part of a healthier relationship and am much more outgoing now than before. I still have my introvert issues, but now I know how to ""help myself"" around them for the most part. Even though you are ISFJ, you still have the judging  trait. Learn to use it to help break down situations and consider both sides. You  will surprise yourself."
2752,isfj,"I overall want to be happy with the decisions I make in life and I am, but my brain always likes to compare to what others are doing.  Believe me, I always try not to do this, but I catch myself all the time.  Is it just me or a ISFJ trait?"
2753,isfj,"I do it all the time. The biggest example is having friends who are buying houses when I'm nowhere near financially stable enough. It's hard not to measure yourself against others that you've grown up with and feel like you haven't progressed enough. I try to remind myself that my accomplishments are different, not lesser."
2754,isfj,"it is a isfj thing. every isfj i've known does this. but it isn't good. comparing leads to bad thoughts.
i work at trying to not do it.
the whole thing stems from disliking something in yourself. and when you do that you look for people who do it well or you dislike seeing it in other people.
an example is ""i work really hard to be considerate. he isn't considerate. he sucks. why isn't he considerate like me""? or ""i'm so lazy, look at everyone who accomplished so much"". 
in both cases the person dislikes something in his/herself. laziness is an unwanted trait so the person looks to people who aren't and compares. inconsiderateness is an unwanted trait but the person tries to be considerate and dislikes seeing people who don't try.
the way i'm working to bypass this is to understand that i am as good as i am right now. i can change in the future if i try at it but my current level of whatever is just that, the current level. and it's the same for everyone.
on my 4th birthday my mom caught me crying on the back porch. she asked me why i was so sad. i said it was because none of my school friends came to my birthday party. she asked if i invited them. i didn't know that was something i had to do. i assumed from TV that everyone threw surprise parties and just somehow knew when to do so.
it would be silly to expect those kids to go to my party if they weren't informed. it would be silly to expect myself to have a skill i haven't mastered or a level of success i don't yet have the right combination of resources, skill, and opportunity to achieve. and it would be silly to expect others to act in ways they don't have the particular life experience to teach them.
but yeah, the future can undetermined and i can keep working toward bettering myself. no need/point in feeling shitty and comparing myself to others."
2755,isfj,"Hi guys! I spend a lot of my time online, chillin, relaxing, the whole deal. Over time I've collected a couple websites and activites for mindless distractions. They help me to unwind, in a relaxing way. They're usually something I can do in the background while hanging out with friends. These types of distractions give me a calming/mind numbing sense of peace, if that makes sense. So, here is my little collection:

Several of these are offered in the App store for apple and android devices. As you can tell, I like to read a lot, and so anything that catches my eye, will be read. So isfj, what are your secret websites or favorite distractions? "
2756,isfj,"I don't know about the rest of you isfjs, but I sometimes have trouble letting myself relax due to guilt that I should be doing something productive.  I've found a good compromise with Duolingo.  This site alone won't make me fluent in a foreign language, but it's a fun way to learn the basics or brush up on a forgotten language while sitting on the couch."
2757,isfj,"Yes folks, it's time for another one of these! My rambling below is not important though, feel free to ignore it and start your own discussion lol.
So, we've been hit with a TON of snow up where I am, far more than usual. And my landlord has been incompetent at getting the snow removal guy out, which means I've gotten stuck in the driveway more than once. I had to call CAA this morning because I got stuck with my back wheels off the ground and I was two hours late to work. Also, yesterday I got stuck in my friend's driveway and burned up my tires.
So this morning the landlord told me the plow guy can't come until tomorrow at the earliest. Well, the windrows left by the city plows are easily 2 feet high in the worst parts, and I didn't own a shovel, plus there were none on the property (I searched). I borrowed a shovel from a neighbour this morning and cleared a little path. This afternoon I came home from work and the city plows had pushed the snow up like I wasn't even there this morning, so I kept on driving and went to Canadian Tire. Bought one of those ice breaker sticks and a small shovel as well as some salt and some engine oil (unrelated, wanted to top it up). Returned home, parked on the street, went to pick up my friend, went to Lowe's and bought a more intense shovel. Came home and shoveled for an hour. We made a car sized path to get into the driveway, and I got in with only some back and forthing required.
We were going to go to a pub but called it quits because shoveling tired us out. Oh well. Now the other neighbour with a car just came home and got stuck, in the driveway though so at least he's there and not stuck on the street so he won't get a ticket, but I'm not able to get out again until either the plow guy comes, this guy leaves, or I shovel my way out. He's using the shovels/ice thing I left outside now to try to get unstuck. I asked him if he wanted help but he said no, he's fine.
The driveway fits ten cars (five by two) so it was no easy feat to clear out space. I left a big mountain in the middle of the driveway because it was too difficult to throw the snow up onto the person-high piles that already exist by the curb.
/tipsy ranting"
2758,isfj,"In the past 3 weeks, I've had school cancelled 6 times and delayed 3 times. Due to the way we also do things at my school, i dont have to make a single one of those days up. Whenever we get a snow day called, the work is put online and that's counted as our school day. 
I honestly find delays worse than school getting cancelled now. 
And in other news i had a physics test and precalculus test on Thursday. Passed the physics with a 90% and the precalculus with an 80%. Happy about both ^^ "
2759,isfj,Aw so lucky! My school only cancelled twice and they never notify students until later in the day when people are either already there or are on their way commuting. I would rather not have to look at the lesson online because I know I'll never do it until a test. Congrats on passing your tests with flying colours! 
2760,isfj,"I’m 25F and one of my best relationships/strongest love was an ISTP male. I fucking love that type. Their intensity melts me and I love the challenge of cracking open their shell and getting to the soft/emotional interior. ISTPs are so relaxed, aloof and go with the flow which I love to be around—it chills me out immensely. They have a quiet confidence which is super sexy and refreshing compared to a loud attention seeking extrovert. "
2761,isfj,"Hello, guys :) I'm MBTI fan and trying to help my friend. He own small social network where main feature is Questions Game - people talk to each with pre-prepared questions or use their own questions list. The main idea to filter users and show related members are totally oposite options: 1) compatible members by zodiac sign 2) compatible by personality type. So, he created personality test which contains 32 questions. I want you to ask to take that test and tell is it accurate or not :) 
You don't need to create an account or login to take test, but you can create it if you like the idea and want to try other features :) So, link to test is: 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test
Any comments, ideas, critics are welcome!"
2762,isfj,"On the paper, it'd be really surprising to me it works. It also reminds me of those two or three dead MBTI based dating websites that remain taking dust in my browser's bookmark bar.
I fear the same fate awaits your friend's idea.
I take the test, and tell you my specific thought just here in an edit.

EDIT :
I usually get annoyed by online tests because of the lack of precision in answering. Those knobs are great !
The question are rather ambiguous. It's a good thing : I struggled to hack it.
There is no explanation for the proposition of compatible types. I suppose your friend used MBTI's data of couple stability by type. It's rather notoriously unreliable. The alternative is Socionics intertype relationships, and it's not much better.
I think instead of replicating the same biases about that, how about letting people searching by type by themselves instead ? 
How about pulling up a test about what type you'd like your yet to be SO be ? That could be great.
Overall, I'm surprised about how thoughtfully made it is. It's already a better testing than the overwhelming majority of online test I filled."
2763,isfj,"INTJ, but I got ISFJ, which actually really surprised me. However, I could easily attribute this to subtly becoming more like an ISFJ I'm attempting to court atm. I was also fairly in the middle on all grounds, with 59% sensing and 53% feeling. I'm a big fan of the percentage bars in the results.
I actually don't like the sliding knobs in the questions, if only because they don't have anchors, which would usually be the numbers on a Likert scale. I'm in a Tests and Measurement class and this was literally on the test today so I can back this up. :) When I was not entirely in agreement or disagreement on a question I would usually just leave the slider around the middle, where the 25% or 75% marks would be. Does this make sense? I actually really like their aesthetic value and I think they would be more useful if your friend could make them longer, with more space to move the slidey.
I like how it gives you the results and immediately tells you compatible types and invites you to search for other users of those types. I'm not a fan of the compatible types stuff, but again, tying to attract someone outside that range so ofc.
I also really like the inclusions of the zodiac, but I'd really like to see other personality measures like Hogwarts house, Enneagram, uhhhh NEO-PI maybe? Stuff like that. :)"
2764,isfj,"Thanks for all the presents.
Also some people might think the way you remember everything we've done together to be a bit creepy, but I find it endearing. You guys focus on your looks a lot, which I appreciate, but it's unnecessary. Be proud of yourself, you're fitting in! Don't worry so much about relationships, if you can. Enjoy your time with people and try not to think too much about the long term. :)
Alright, hope I didn't come off too insulting or authoritative. Again, thanks for the presents."
2765,isfj,".... I think you must be my SO responding to the conversation we had last night. So... You're welcome, boo! I love you! So sorry I'm so anxious about relationship stuff.. I try my best to keep it to myself normally :)"
2766,isfj,"Same here. I also tend to remember much more about people and what they say. A girl once said that she had this idea that I remember every word she says. This isn't true of course, but with people I do remember the relevant things, little fun facts, a good amount of random facts and things that triggered emotions and those trigger quite fast."
2767,isfj,"Edit: I MEANT ""INCOMPATIBLE"" NOT ""INCAPABLE""!
Not sure if it's an ISFJ-INTP thing or it's just me. I couldn't go along well with two out of three INTPs I met. Friendship with first INTP lasted four-five months before it gradually crumbled (we became incompatible friends), and second INTP was rather strange, apprehensive, and complicated. Both INTPs have hurt the fuck out of me (not deliberate) just for being INTPs and since I'm such a soft, sensitive and fragile anxious soft fuck. As for the third INTP, we're... okay, I guess. 
ENTPs - I've only met one; very difficult social chemistry. Conversations feel forced and unnatural.
What has your experience been?"
2768,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INTP and I'm an ISFJ. We've been together 4 years. Our relationship works really well. I'm a pretty well rounded ISFJ though, and we met later in life. (We met when I was 27 and he was 26). We joke that if we met any earlier in life it would never work. "
2769,isfj,"Haven't had enough experiences with ENTPs to judge but they seem fun. One of my closest friends is INTP and we get along very well. I think it works that greatly because I'm not really sensitive. She tends to test out other people's limit so by staying chill it's like I'm passing some sorts of test. We can talk about anything and I help her out with dealing with her feelings because that's clearly something she's not used to doing. And she teaches me a great deal about rationalizing my thoughts and feelings before freaking out. 
I really like INTPs and Ti dom in general, but I can understand that you would feel anxious when facing someone with low Fe. I know my INTP friend might seem cold (she's aware of it but doesn't know what to do about it) but it's just her way of saying things, she's actually one of the funniest and chillest people I know :) 
Basically, I think we can be compatible, it's just a question of understanding each other (or at least trying to) and of maturity for both of our types (as we can be really anxious and they can lack social awareness). Anyways, I'm sorry you had bad experiences, I hope you meet a great and fun xNTP as well :)"
2770,isfj,"ENTP married to my ISFJ husband. One of my closest friends is an ISFJ as well.
I think it depends. There are some people you just will or won't get along with irregardless of personality type. Maybe you just don't have the same interests or aren't in the same stage of development in life.
I think my husband and I are amazingly compatible. It's a very easy relationship. If/when we argue (rarely), it's resolved within a few hours and is always a misunderstanding instead of a difference in opinion. Only problem is that sometimes it's SO easy/peaceful I get this strange itching to start drama via debate. This is when I go and try to find some new ideas/interests to play with so I don't harm my relationship.
Overtime as my Fe and his Ti develops, we've had a much deeper relationship. Now he's able to discuss all the crazy thoughts/theories that go through my head every second, and I'm able to check in with his feelings and see if he's doing okay.
I don't think our relationship would've worked out very well had I not developed Fe and had he not developed Ti however. 
There are some ENTPs that he's met that he absolutely HATES (in that really nice ""I'm still going to talk to you but secretly loathe you"" ISFJ sort of way haha!) because these ENTPs don't have Fe and don't yet realize it pisses people off when you push their buttons for fun. Similarly there are some ISFJs that can't follow my train of thought and only want to talk about the day to day. The both of us met somewhere in the middle.
I feel like our relationship only gets better over time. :)"
2771,isfj,"I (INTP/M) have been living with my love (ISFJ/F) for five years now, and it's been a roller coaster.  
I hurt her feelings, and am always surprised when it happens.  I understand that I need to be more sensitive in the way I speak and think about the ways she could take (what I think of as) neutral comments.  She will get so mad at me for saying something she finds insulting, and will stay mad even after she realizes I didn't mean it the way she took it.  It can be really rough.  And this happens almost like clockwork every 9-11 days.  
The hurt feelings used to last for days and were rough on both of us.  Lately I have found that if I don't take her anger personally, and just continue to be sweet to her while avoiding sharing my perspective on the disagreement, things calm down really quickly.  Instead I write down what I would like to say and how I'm feeling, just to get it out of my head.  I'm not sure how sustainable this is, but it's been working pretty well for the last couple months.  She/we get mad for an hour or less, as opposed to a whole day plus.
I read an article a while back that said the INTP/ISFJ combo needs breaks,  short times apart on a regular basis.  I mentioned that to her at the time and she took it as confirmation of her fear that I just wanted an excuse to not be around her, and it caused a weekend of hurt. But I think a weekly break of a day would be great for our relationship.  It might break this 10 day fight cycle.  
Do you find that you mostly get along really well, and then when you disagree on something everything goes wrong?"
2772,isfj,"The difficulty with INTP's is due to their very weak Fe. ISFJ's are very social for introverts and INTP's struggle being social as it takes extra mental effort to process auditory communication.
ENTP's can be very polar for ISFJ's. Some are crazy, others are toned down and collected.
I've been with my ISFJ for nearly 10 years and sometimes she's the one forcing me out of the house when all I want to do is stay home after work and have quiet time.
At the same time, ENTP's are great for coaxing ISFJ's into challenging themselves, developing new skills and learning that the world isn't a scary place.
ISFJ's are great for teaching ENTP's to develop Fe and take others into consideration before blurting harmless but rude jokes and observations. That took me a couple years to flesh out.
Technical communication between ISFJs, ESFJs, INTPs and ENTPs is fantastic in my opinion due to the same cognitive functions."
2773,isfj,"My boyfriend is ENTP. I can’t imagine a better relationship. My best friend of over a decade is an INTP. I think compatibility becomes a problem with intjs and entjs. Our POLR is Te and role is Ni (Socionics), both in which they use strongly - this is an insecurity point for us.
Anyway, love me some entps and intps sooooo big!"
2774,isfj,"Just my own observation, not concrete:
My husband is an INTP, my sister is an ISFJ. They tolerate each other but fundamentally don't get on. This very much appears to be a clash of personality rather than anything actually happening. My sister is pretty sensitive and takes everything to heart, my husband can be a bit of a brick to the face and doesn't give a shit. They've known each day 10 years and the time has just made it worse"
2775,isfj,"INTP guy dating an ISFJ girl here. We seem to have had a solid 3 year relationship with a couple bumps. We’ve been loyal and very transparent with each other. She on the other gets easily frustrated due to the fact that my mind is all over the place and I’m not as careful and thoughtful as she is. She does find me very understanding, which helps her put up with me."
2776,isfj,"My gf is ISFJ, and I'm INTP. We've been together for over 8 years. We have very similar personalities in terms of having contempt for ignorant people, enjoying good food, listening to similar music, communicating well... So it's possible. "
2777,isfj,"I adore INTP's!  I currently have a ""thing"" with one of them and I've had a thing in the past.  Provided there is mutual respect and open communication between both of us, I find we have a lot in common.
I can get along with ENTPs but again there needs to be mutual respect and I find that's difficult for both sides.  I sometimes feel an ENTP says things for a reaction and I feel they cross the line sometimes (compared to an INTP who I feel like they cross the line but unintentionally) and they probably feel we sit on the fence too much, are too ""proper"" and guarded."
2778,isfj,"Yes, I agree with this.  There aren't a ton of things we share an interest in, except certain binge-watchable shows. 
So I (INTP/M) decided to just saying yes to everything new she suggests we do.  I almost always end up having a good time, even though I would've rather sat at home working on one of countless projects floating around my head.  I don't even entertain the idea of saying no.  And I throw myself into doing it.  No pouting or complaining.  If it's god awful, next time she suggests it I will just suggest something else.  
It's hard to get her to do things she isn't already interested in.  But I gently nudge her to try the things I like that I think she will too.  We are working on it."
2779,isfj,"I think this is a mistake a lot of people make. That you should share interests.  
But to me it is it is clearly flawed, because that does that mean. If we go back to the tribe time. Then men were out hunting, and being men, while women were home organizing, and taking care of the children.  
By this logic men would only be attracted to women who is also out hunting, and being ""men"". Which is bullocks.  
If we take a newer example. Okay, so I am very much into football, and counter strike. Something 99% dominated by men. So everyone in that field, could only be compatible with the 1% ""tom boy"" woman in there? No.  
Human beings have different needs. Different friends satisfy different needs you have.  
For example as an ENTP, then I don't want a partner that is ""just like one of the guys"" - I crave a partner I can get certain needs fulfilled with. Like showing my soft loving side. Because when I am with my male friends. We do not hug, we do not kiss, we do not cuddle. We don't share emotional vulnerabilities with each other.  
I rather want a partner I can do that with. Than a partner having the same ""interests"" as me. That is a need my friends are already helping me being fulfilled in.  
If we tried to swap it around, then what would it mean for ISFJs? They would also want a partner who had an interest in yoga, pets, and children? Another ISFJ? Well, isn't that need already fulfilled with her female friends? Why does she need a male to do that aswell?  
That is why I and socionics find it makes perfect sense with duals. In this case ENTPs and ISFJs.  
Because we have the exact same cognitive functions, just in reverse.   
ENTP NeTiFeSi - SiFeTiNe ISFJ.  
In theory if both are mature we have the easiest time communicating frictionless.  
But ISFJs and ENTPs do also need to be mature to be compatible. Because when we are young cognitively we are highly imbalanced and underdeveloped.  
Because when an ENTP is young it is nearly 100% Ne, and when an ISFJ is young it is nearly 100% Si. So we are far from each other. But the older we get, the more we move towards each other and meet each other in the middle. ISFJs develop more Fe, and Ti, and ENTPs develop more Ti and Fe. So we understand and potentially value each other much better.  
Personally I can't imagine a more compatible and joyful relationship, than when 2 duals are mature. In my case ENTP with ISFJ.  
Also I have never experienced the same joy with other types as when I look into an ISFJs eyes, and we both smile.  
If I looked into the eyes of an ISFP I would get this reaction: ""O_O What?"" :D"
2780,isfj,"God damn I see all these excellent ISFJ and xNTP pairings and I can't help but be salty and jealous. :( 
I'm starting to think it's just my personality. Maybe I'm too needy, sensitive, and talkative? Idk."
2781,isfj,"I have an ISFJ friend and can confirm this. As long as she doesn't go full motherly you do what I want to help you helper syndrome psychoanalisis on me and I from time to time let her inside my head, we get along greatly. It's about respecting boundaries. I can also confirm her being less sensitive and me being interested in her as a person and her well-being helps a lot and we can also talk about anything. She actually knows quite a few secrets about me I wouldn't share and vice versa. It's one of the few people I gave a thoughtful gift in the past decade or so, when I learned she's an ISFJ and learned she really appreciates small gifts as sign of appreciation - a thing I personally don't give two fucks about and thus it never occurs to me naturally.
I would also say that INTP-ISFJ relations can easily decay over time after an initial euphoric start, because if an INTP is initially interested in a person and they like them they try their best to be as nice as possible: inferior Fe trying to harmonize and thus can probably feel very overwhelmingly appreciative of the ISFJs. However, INTPs lose energy, initial heavy interest becomes more routine and other factors will result in a normalization which the ISFJ might rightfully or not - depends on the actual reason - interprete as withdrawal. Just as an example I have friends for over a decade, but I maybe speak 4 times a month on the phone with them and an entire month might pass before I even see them once, but I'm fine with it. I can see ISFJs potentially struggle with such an arrangement."
2782,isfj,"For the first INTP I met, that's exactly what happened. Conflict in all of our views and opinions. She said we're incompatible people, that it was no one's fault. It hurt like all Hell when it ended."
2783,isfj,"I'd like to clarify that I've only socialized with these xNTPs via online chatting. We've never met IRL.
Basically, I'm too talkative and spontaneous? Too exhausting for them to keep up with? "
2784,isfj,"Sex? Also I try to make sure my boyfriend is eating, I'll cook for him, and try and clean up any areas around him that are cluttered. I'll try to make sure he is medicated (he has add) and drinking water, try to get him to go for walks, wash his clothing for him. Basically try and make his life easier. Get them to a phsyc and medicated."
2785,isfj,"Oh I understand! It's easy to get envious. I tend to get discouraged seeing how so many ISFJs say they don't manage to get along with them... I worry I might be boring. But I think it just needs work like any relationship... It's not necessarily ""you"". In relationships, no matter the kind, there is two people :)
It's not a bad thing to be talkative. I've found INTPs to be able to be really talkative as well when they're interested in things actually. As for being sensitive and needy, that's part of Fe aux development, probably. It only gets better with time and work on ourselves. Before, I needed reassurance all the time. I still do sometimes but I try being more objective by remembering all the times people showed me they liked me. It helps make things better. Don't belittle yourself for something that's part of your own development :)"
2786,isfj,"Hmm I think it depends on why they're depressed/anxious and whether or not they want to be helped. It's hard to say without knowing them personally. :o
Though when I'm depressed/anxious, I usually want my ISFJ to hear out/help me figure out what I'm feeling. Once it's all out and I have a solution in mind to change whatever is causing my negative feeling, I feel a lot better.
I'm not sure what an INTP would prefer though, given our functions are in a different order."
2787,isfj,"Since you describe yourself as a ""sensitive and fragile anxious soft fuck,"" I would suggest you don't try to care for an anxious and depressed person.  Your own anxiety will likely add to theirs.  And xNTPs will occasionally hurt your feelings and that will make them more sad.  
Have you seen the TED talk on Vulnerability by Brene Brown?  The ISFJ whom I love started a transformation after watching this."
2788,isfj,"Online would be a different story. In person, it's hard to talk to INTPs unless you have their undivided attention. If they are busy, or thinking, they won't completely hear someone if they suddenly walk up and start talking. 
Think about how you cook a new meal, calculated and measured. This is how INTPs interact with the world."
2789,isfj,"idk about the meds part, but as an INTP, i can confirm that gf cleaning up, helping to keep me eating, and providing affection (cuddling is great) are very helpful when I'm down. Good work, Burntpainting!"
2790,isfj,"She literally just did. I'm not sure if she was actually being rude or it's just my softness as an ISFJ. Or, it's just the incompatibility itself and it's nobody's fault."
2791,isfj,"ISFJs are naturallly supportive and empathetic people so just be yourself but also take into consideration that if they are seeking answers/decisions, that is not our best suit. Be available and be a sounding board. Of course if these symptoms persists, professional help is irreplaceable. :)"
2792,isfj,"It was probably all three. I have learned I can be rude while not intending, and genuinely not understanding why what I did was rude.  My ISFJs can be over sensitive and be offended or hurt by things that are just neutral.  The combo often means that even if either one of us is trying hard to not cause this reaction, it still happens.  
Is your friend a romantic interest? "
2793,isfj,"I'm making MBTI relationship statistics and I would like to do statistics of every type. But I don't have a lot responses of certain types, one of them is ISJF. This is why I'd like to ask you to fill out this form and contribute to these statistics.
Here is the form.
I really appreciate your help. If you are really interested in statistics, here is the sheet, (Check out other Tabs. It's also always updated.) It's currently unfinished, so pardon any bugs. And it's better to copy it to your google drive and edit INFP Tab from ""INFP"" in cell A3, to ""ESFP"" if you want to see your statistics. ESFP Tab is somewhat less finished due to Google Sheets bugs."
2794,isfj,"I got introduced to this subreddit without ever knowing it existed, from a newly met friend of mine (an INFP), and I really just wanted to say how awesome is that there's a subreddit for personalities like this. I found it super cool how accurate some of all the things people write is in relation to what I feel I can relate to and the descriptions for what an ISFJ is.
And basically I just wanted to say hi, so hi. "
2795,isfj,"Hi, INFP here. I'm really beating myself up. I have obsessive compulsive, depression, and anxiety. I am seeing a therapist and am on medicine. I only mentioned that to put things in perspective. My thinking is not exactly normal or orderly. ISFJs always seem to have valuable insight and tend to see concrete solutions where I cannot. I have been beating myself up recently over many things. 


I was supposed to go out of town and stay with a family member for ten days. I made it one night and one day and ended up coming home the second night. 


I am at the age where I am supposed to decide what I want to do and begin figuring out my life. I have an INTJ parent and an ESFJ parent. They both understand me in different ways, but neither of them fully understands me. I am beating myself up because I can't figure out what I want to do + I feel like I am a failure and will always be a failure. 


As mentioned above, I feel like I will never succeed. I am in the INFP Hermit Mode, currently. (Basically the dark side of INFPs, falling into a state of mental illness and physically frozen and cut off from the outside world. On average I have left my house less than twice a week for the past two years. I don't have any true friends anymore, they either ignore me or just don't care.) Being in Hermit mode, I don't want to do anything. I know that I need to get a job and I want to start providing for myself/working, but at the same time I feel like I won't be able to hold a job or do anything properly. 


There's more, but honestly I don't even know how this post will go over.
PS. I love you, ISFJ. You all are so kind, caring, and helpful. Anytime I've ever needed help, the ISFJ in my life has been amazing. Here on reddit you all have been amazing. If this post isn't okay or appreciated, just let me know. I just like having the input of other personality types and most of the other types don't care enough/are generally mean about things. You all are almost always kind, gentle, and you genuinely care. I'm not trying to use you to solve my problems, I just appreciate and request your special outlook on the world.
Also, I started crocheting for my anxiety (as suggested by a family member) and made a full size blanket in less than a week, so there's that. Oh! Any stress relieving/anxiety relieving strategies you have would be incredibly welcomed and helpful. 
If this post isn't appropriate please let me know and I will take it down. I have so much respect for this community and don't want to upset anyone. "
2796,isfj,"Hi there! Thank you for your kind words about us :) This comment might get really long, I hope you don't mind! Also, it's probably going to sound really... stereotypically naive.
I see things have been tough for you! It's a good thing that you want to talk about it and hear advices. In my experience, the worst thing an INFP could do is reject others' opinion. I think seeking out other people's point of view of things is the best first step you could have taken!
What you're describing seems awfully similar to a Si loop, or the start of one... You feel trapped, as if nothing will ever change. But it's not always the case! I know it might seem weird for an ISFJ to say that of all things hehe but change is your best friend. Just because things have been like this for a long time doesn't mean they won't change! In fact, things keep changing around us, all the time! Even you as a person, are bound to change. You're no failure! So what if you've failed before? You will learn from it and get better.
So things will change, but you have to take baby steps! If you try to change things too suddenly, you might overwhelm yourself in doing nothing. I would advise you to try out new things to find yourself a new lifestyle that you like. Maybe try deciding on one thing to do that week, such as cleaning the apartment, or going to buy groceries! (I know cleaning doesn't sound fun at all but once your apartment is clean you feel like a new person). You have to take care of yourself for things to change, and those are things that are important for your body! 
You don't have to ask too much of yourself, but it's a good thing to try and do things, even if you start slowly! I've found that if you put too many things on your to do list for one day or one week, you will most likely end up procrastinating, so it's best to start small, even if you feel like it's dumb. Try it out until you find a routine or lifestyle that fits you and makes you happier. One advice I would give would be to try and get up early (not too early hehe) everyday. It might be hard at first but it makes you feel like you have so much time to do things! So it can be really motivating and good to help feeling like a failure! 
It's important that you try out new things as well! It's really nice that you started crocheting. Try new things often such as going for a walk, going to see a movie (even on your own!), drawings things, etc. Go out and sit in a park with a book on a sunny day! Find what you enjoy doing. Discover a little bit more about yourself!
As for the future, it is completely understandable that you would feel so overwhelmed. It's really tough trying to figure out what you want to do with your life. But as I said, you're no failure and you won't always be failing. 
Very few people know what they want to do that early in life. It's very common for people to try out something and then discover that it was not their path at all! It's ok to go out there and try things and ""fail"". It's not wasting time, you're figuring things out. Take your time. Start vague: instead of thinking of jobs, think of fields, think of your favourite subjets! I think we tend to try and find a job right away, which is a mistake because we don't know all the kinds of jobs there are out there! Do you like literature? Study literature! Once you learn more about it, you might find a job you like. And if you realise you don't like literature that much after all but you're kinda into law? Try out law! 
Life is full of opportunities and sadly (my Si dom heart speaking ahah) you can't have it figured out as you start. If you look at all the things you have to do and figure out, you'll get overwhelmed because it will just seem like it's too much and you'll never have the time nor the motivation! You have to do things step by step without worrying too much about the big picture. It's just like when you're washing your clothes after a month of not doing it. Everthing is so dirty and there is so much to wash. So you should just pick up your clothes and start washing them one by one. Then you'll realise it wasn't as bad as you thought it would be. You might even start seeing the beauty in the little things, such as getting up early one morning and witnessing how beautiful the sky was in the golden morning light. 
In short, it's not about ""What can I do?"" but about ""What do I want?"" and ""What do I like?"". Take your time. Try things out, step by step. Fail if you have to. Go slowly, but always try to move forward :)
Sorry if it sounded a bit generic and overly optimistic, I hope you can find some useful information in there! Good luck!"
2797,isfj,"First, you need to sit back, take a deep breath (or 5), and look at this logically. If your closest friend was exactly where you are right now, would you be as demanding of or as harsh on them as you're being to yourself? I doubt it. What would you tell them to do? Treat yourself like you'd treat the most important person in your life... because you are the most important person in your life. Be kind and gentle with yourself, bud.
Next, I need you to understand something: not very many people are where they think they should be in life right now. Everybody has doubts and has been unsure of where they were going, how to get there, and what to do when they arrived. Hell, I'm 35 and about to graduate college, and I'm still feeling pretty shaky. 😂 
Bottom line? Every single thing that you're feeling and going through right now is absolutely normal, everyone has been through it at some point, and everything will be okay in the end, somehow. You'll get where you need to be in life. In the meantime, take care of yourself. Give yourself pep talks. Step outside and breath fresh air. Love who you are right this very moment. Most importantly? Never stop going forward, even if it's just taking baby steps; many baby steps equal a giant leap. 
ETA: Hey, I'm super proud of you for being brave enough to actually stay with your relative for one day and one night; for people who have acute anxiety, that's a huge accomplishment! Don't look at it as, ""Well, I was supposed to stay for 10 days but only managed to get through 1."" Think about it like this, ""I had the choice to stay home, but instead of taking the easy way out and bailing, I went and actually managed to stay a night. Go me!"" Baby steps..."
2798,isfj,"I am trying to give you some advice and excuse me if anything sounds too obvious. We don't know enough about you or situation to make this really tailored to you. So this can be a bit generic.
First you have to try to beat yourself up over things. If you are seeing a therapist maybe they are working with you on a method like CBT to reframe your thoughts? Simply explained it is just a tool to analyse your fears and ask yourself if they are really true and if they have bad, non-reversible consequences. Often times the fear becomes bigger than the worst case. Often bad consequences are very unlikely. Often you can just take action to correct bad consequences if they really occur.
If you want to read a book about it I can recommend Feeling Good by David Burns.
I am not sure how #1 impacts your life but it seems like it just happened and there is not too much harm done. You tried to do this and you made if for two days. It's ok, try better next time. If your anxiety is too strong maybe you can find something that comforts you like your crocheting. Don't make yourself do scary stuff for a long time. Take resting periods.
I understand the feeling that some problems just appear so big that you can't tackle them like choosing the perfect career for your life. Then you don't get to have any pleasure because most of your time is spent worrying that you don't make progress with the biggest scary item on your to do list. Appreciate yourself for doing something for yourself. Did you eat healthy today? Good job. Did you get some crocheting done? Nice! Did you enjoy it? Yes! Did you make your bed? Great!
Try that. Just make your bed in the morning. Nothing fancy. Just put your blanket on their neatly and you are done. 20 seconds. Then understand that you accomplished this. It is the first thing you have checked off your list for the day. Let's see if we can do one or two more things. But the counter will be at least 1 at the end of the day.
This sounds quite self-defeating. Why do you think that? And wouldn't it be great to have earned some money for a few weeks. It's a success. Also you earned experience. You know if the job is right for you or if you should try something else. You are getting closer to something that works for you.
Also the good thing about your anxiety might be that you don't want to disappoint anybody and therefore will make an effort to do a good job. People around you will see that make an effort, even if you are still learning and make mistakes.
Plan your week. Your goal should not be to have your dream job at the end of the week that you can stay in for 40 years. Your goal should be to finish your CV OR to send out an application OR to find a course that you could do to prepare yourself for a job OR to talk to somebody about their job. Do you know who has a job that sounds interesting? Ask them if and why they like it or how a typical week looks like.
Don't try to be perfect. Don't try to make the RIGHT choice. Try something and see where it takes you. Life is actually quite long and so much stuff happens. If you keep trying and doing things you will learn what you want, what you are good at and it will lead the way.
Good job for coming here and taking action on making a positive change in your life! Keep going."
2799,isfj,"Over the past few months i've been in a bad place. the kind where i in get into a groove of ""this is what i did/am. what can i do to do it/be better? how to forgive better, how to endure more, how to accomplish more, etc""? and while that was happening i forgot to be nice to myself. so i spiraled from the positive need for constant self improvement toward a constant feeling of imperfection and inability to have my achievements meet my personal expectations. i felt like i was so tired and i worked so hard and i couldn't feel satisfied with anything i did. and i got really down and sad for a few months.
then yesterday a friend sent me this text, out of the blue: ""You are the most logical loving person i've ever known. you don't make emotional decisions, but you are one of the more generous, compassionate, and self sacrificing people i know. When i have to get motivated to keep going after failures and hardships, thoughts of you always surface. if there is someone as cool and loving as you in the world, i can stand to be a motivated hard working individual that helps people too"".
she is someone i respect for her ability to face down hardships and move forward. she takes life's punches in stride. and to find out that that's how she sees me was and still is a huge deal. 
i cried a bit when she told me that. i go so long with only my unforgiving and extremely demanding self as the judge of my life, that knowing this is how someone else i look up to sees me is world shattering and also relieving. like i can tell myself ""it's ok. you're ok. you're good enough. right now you are good enough and you can rest and take it easy for a bit without any guilt""."
2800,isfj,"Wow such a nice compliment to receive, especially in a time of need. I find myself [insj/infj] judging myself harshly all the time, for things that are minor and could be fine if I just let it go. When I'm in a down period I just keep trying to push through with the routine, but listen to my body at the same time. Extra rest, extra workouts, and extra nourishment. It'll pass, stay strong. "
2801,isfj,"That's inspiring. c:
I'm glad that someone was there for you like that, having those types of people in our lives is something you should never let go of, but I'm sure you already know that.  It's actually more of a self-reminder, now that I think about it.  ~.~"
2802,isfj,"Turns out I am also an isfj and type 5 enneagram. It's kind of scary how accurate the descriptions of those are. I assume from the way you talk and having a very close female friend that you would be too whereas im not, however your username throws me off. Anyway, if you need someone to talk to with similar mindsets? personality maybe, just pm me"
2803,isfj,it's a username i made when i was 12 and never stopped using it. it's the name I gave the main character in the game final fantasy 10 because he swims a lot and it looks like he waxes his chest. don't care much for the game but i've been using the username for so long that it's sentimental now.
2804,isfj,"Part of the woes of being an introvert: wanting to be alone but at the same time, craving connection and social feedback—it's important to know that one is appreciated for what they do.
 
Sorry, I know this is off-topic, but would you happen to know what your enneagram type is?  I'm just curious, as I kind of feel like this insight you've shared might help me better understand a type I have been researching recently."
2805,isfj,"Sorry, I didn't mean to make you go out of your way to find out, but thank you for humoring me!  I appreciate it. c:
There is this page which may help you confirm or refute the typing: http://theenneagram.blogspot.com/2007/09/how-to-type-and-what-to-look-for.html
They have a lot of good resources there, even though the site hasn't been maintained in a long time.  It's too bad, they did a great job of bringing multiple facets of information into a single place for a more rounded perspective."
2806,isfj,"To be completely honest, I haven't really checked out the other personality types, but reading it now, I can definitely see some aspects which are present in me. Although, isfj is 100% my type. I guess to answer your question, yes."
2807,isfj,"Hello I am a student at University and I am collecting data on Big-5, type indicator, and cluster B personality characteristics. The IRB and the Human consent pages are in included in the link. At the end of data collection I will be giving away amazon gift cards. The information is on the last page. I appreciate anyone willing to take the time. The average response time is around 15 minutes. Thank you again.

2808,isfj,"I am an ENTP and I just started dating an ISFJ. My last serious relationship ended 8 months ago and I've been dating people here and there since then, but there hasn't been a woman who seriously captured my attention, until now. The night after we went on our first day I immediately closed my online dating profiles and distanced myself from a couple of woman I have been semi-dating/talking with.
I know myself pretty well at this point. I'm in my mid-30s and I can already feel myself falling in love with this woman. Things have gone well up until now, but as an ENTP I am constantly analyzing things and looking to make sure our relationship continues to grow and go smoothly.
I've already read a lot about ISFJs, but I wanted to ask you folks here for any good tips or pointers you might have. I realize ISFJs don't express their feelings as often, so I've already learned not to expect her to show me the same affection that I show her, and I also know she needs to hear that I appreciate things about her, which I genuinely do. But what else should I know?
I want to spend every waking moment with her, but I know that's rushing her and I understand ISFJs don't like to be rushed. Is it too much to give her a little present or something every time I see her? I don't want her to feel overwhelmed or that I'm smothering her or trying too hard, because that can be a typical reaction of women. However, from what I've read, ISFJs like to receive tangible mementos of one's interest, am I right?
Thank you all again for reading this. I know as ISFJs you will probably naturally want to help this ENTP be successful with his relationship so I look forward to hearing from you.
Sincerely,
Matthew"
2809,isfj,"I can't speak for the woman you're dating, obviously, but getting even a little gift every time I saw someone would make me feel very overwhelmed.  ISFJs are often more comfortable giving than receiving.  A less intense way to convey the same message would be to send a text or email after seeing one another that mentions something you enjoyed about that date.  I'd love that - it's positive feedback, but it wouldn't require an immediate response so I wouldn't feel so flustered."
2810,isfj,"I'm an ENTP that's been married to an ISFJ for 23 years--plus, I'm a certified MBTI facilitator. I'd love to help if you have any specific questions. There are a lot of practical tips I could offer at different stages in the relationship. We have found a wonderful rhythm between our differences, but it has taken us years of learning each other--more some than some of our friends that at least shared one letter.
Good luck, Matthew. It can be a glorious adventure. 
Wes"
2811,isfj,"I've never been in doubt about being an S so I can't personally vouch for any article, but this page describes it based on the function stacks of ISFJs and INFJs."
2812,isfj,"IMO, ISFJs want to help people just as much an INFJs, however feel that the best way to do this is by doing things for them. 
For example, my ISFJ friend loves being matchmaker. For a friend who was depressed about being single, he said ""The only way I can help is by taking him out to meet girls"". In the same situation, I feel that the INFJ would think they can help the most by instead sitting down and counselling this friend, working at changing his state of mind.
The ISFJ is more hands on, giving real world practical help, and INFJ are more prone to giving lots of sage advice/wisdom, and boost the persons spirits. It's all in the way Si/Ni  interacts differently with Fe."
2813,isfj,"I recently got back into studying these personality types, mostly to pin down mine in hopes of giving my wife some material to study to get to know me more, and to encourage her to do the same. I've gone back and forth between INTJ and INTP, but after reading up on the traits of these two personalities, I've realized I am pretty firm in INTJ territory.
My wife took some tests and got ISTJ and INTJ on different tests, which surprised us both immensely, since absolutely NOTHING in the personality profiles rung a bell. I thought she seemed more like an ""Fi"" than ""Ti"" so we looked at ISFJ and INFJ and the personality descriptions for ISFJ were absolutely spot on.
My first question is: have any of you taken a MB test and gotten skewed results? Were they that far off? I was wondering if my wife answered the questions with how she thinks she should be instead of how she is, especially since I asked her to take the test and she got INTJ (my personality type).
My second question is: has anyone been in an ISFJ/INTJ pairing before? Has it worked? What problems arose, and if you overcame them, how did you?"
2814,isfj,"Getting skewed results is very common. Don't just use tests to determine her type. Read up on the Jungian functions some more and type her by observing what functions she uses. 
If you insist on using tests as a reference, you might want to guide each other through them, answering carefully and true to yourselves. 
You could also use this test to determine the strength of your functions: http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm  
You also said she uses Fi (introverted feeling). If that wasn't a typo for ""feeler"" in general, you might want to consider ISFP and INFP as her type as well. ISFP use the same functions as INTJ, but in a different order. The more rational and aloof INFP can give off an INTJ vibe as well.
In any case, none of these types, including ISFJ, are actually much alike. If you immerse yourself into the topic, discerning and spotting functions in other people should come naturally for you as an INTJ as long as you can observe them."
2815,isfj,"Never heard about INTJ/ISFJ.
I used to read about INTP/INTJ OTP on /r/INTP, on an other hand.
Considering how the trashcan of MBTI Reddit this sub is, I take this with a grain of salt.
I've seen the Falconi type Square that uses Socionics intertype relationships on this thread.
It says best mach for ISFJs is …
ENTPs. Insert perma Pokerface here. Duals partners.
I'm not saying MBTI says your couple won't work : MBTI prescribes nothing, and don't even have something about intertype relationships.
And I believe Socionics intertype relationships are more bullshit than the dank memes I read daily, which says a lot.
Best to follow your Ni and her Si, I guess.
It was just my 2 cents on this. I'm not even sure it actually worth two cents."
2816,isfj,"I've seen very far off mistypes. INFPs as ENTJs, ESFJs as ENFPs, almost every letter is off. I have never seen a legitimate INTJ and ISFJ together, but that's just my experience. I personally cannot stand ISFJs. 
According to this website (http://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare/)
INTJs and ISFJs have a super-ego relationship which is described as ""a relationship characterized by differing values, discomfort, and mutual misunderstanding.""
So INTJ and ISFJ are probably not the best match. "
2817,isfj,"This was a mistake on my part. I meant that she dominates more toward feeling than thinking, but it is an extroverted feeling for the most part, so Fe is more accurate."
2818,isfj,"I was reading the ISFP subreddit, and noticed a post in which ISFP's were discussing their ""inner INTJ.""  I was immediately fascinated, because this is something I've noticed myself! I see ESFJ's with an inner ENTP, INFP's with an inner ISTJ, ENTJ's with an inner ESFP, etc.  What I mean by ""inner"" is, say, we ISFJ's finding that we relate more and more to INTP's as we grow older.  I find that I relate easily to fictional INTP characters (April Ludgate, Daria,) and feel that I have more in common with them than I do with INTJ characters.  I generally find it very easy to relate to NTP's.  I notice commonalities between INTP's and I.
So, fellow ISFJ's: do you have an inner INTP?"
2819,isfj,"Only re knowledge and intellectual discussions. My best friend is an intp and the differences in our EQ are... extreme. In his words, ""I have to think for days to work out a reason for why someone was upset wih me."" I feel like I'm overwhelmed with 25 possible reasons the split second someone starts to be upset hahah"
2820,isfj,"Well the ISFJ cognitive functions are SiFeTiNe.
It' normal that over time you develop your lower functions and become overall an more balanced person.
As an INTP, i have TiNeSiFe and i've notice that over time i've become a lot less cruel and uncaring than i was let's say 7 years ago because i've been able to find use for my Fe and it's perspective. I find my Si patterns more predictable so i can do better use of it's information, etc.
Would i say i have an inner ISFJ, no. Every type has something unique to it that's irreplacable, that's probably why we have the type distribution we have now. I'd say to strive to wake your ""inner INTP"" is the wrong thing to strive for, balance should be the goal.
Also, if you absolutely have to compare yourself to someone else (see rule 4 or Jordan B. Peterson's 12 rules for life), you might want to compare yourself to a real person. Fictional characters are only as 3 dimentional as the viewer requires them to be. There is too much left to interpretation."
2821,isfj,"So I am an INTJ and I met my ISFJ girlfriend when we were in high school. We have dated for 7.5 years and been through a lot together, including a few years of long distance. She moved overseas 18 months ago and we have been trying to make it work, she says it has been working for her and she always spoke about our future together, however for the last while I haven't been feeling it and even though I tried my hardest I eventually took the step and ended it. 
It was not easy for me as she is my best friend and we have largely shape each other into the people we are today. I know she is very angry with me and very hurt, which I understand but I am worried about her. She was in a very good place, she loves her job and was probably the happiest I have ever seen her, so I am worried that i may have broken this.
I guess all I want to know is will she ever forgive me? Will she be ok in the long run? Any sort of advice from other ISFJs that have been through a long term breakup. How can I make it easier for her? Should I distance myself, should I remind her I still care about her? 
I like to believe that one day we could be friends again, as I don't see how we can just throw everything we have built over the last 7yrs away, are any of you friends with your exs?"
2822,isfj,"I've actually just gone through a remarkably similar situation.
It's been 2 months since he left me, and we've had no contact for over a month. 
I don't harbor any ill feelings towards him. Am I sad that he threw away so many years together so easily? Of course. Do I wish things could be different? Absolutely. 
But I don't blame him for it.
I personally believe that everybody is only doing the best they can with whatever they're given in life. Of course there are moments where I feel mad at him for it, or I just fall apart and need to cry my eyes out for a few hours. But it gets easier with every day that passes.
ISFJs do have a hard time leaving the past behind us. I haven't gone a single day without thinking of him, and I miss him like hell. But all I want is for him to be happy.
When you love somebody, their happiness becomes more important than your own. I still have hope that we might have a chance at some point, way down the road, when we're both at different places in our lives.
But if not, that's okay too. As long as he's happy and healthy.
I do think staying friends could make it easier on her, but it also might be worse. Because it's really hard to be friends with somebody you're attracted to, and have so much history with. 
My biggest advice would be to make sure you're not leading her on.
If you don't have any intentions of being with her in the future, don't imply that you do. ISFJs can hold on to that kind of thing, and at least in my case, I know I'd be willing to wait forever for somebody that I loved, which would consequently mean putting my life on hold in the process.
Be kind to her. Hostility or coldness from you is going to hurt her really badly. Explain in detail why you did it, and what your thoughts/feelings on the whole situation are.
Don't let her try to talk you out of it, but definitely make sure you've explained it all in depth.
For me, the worst part was both the confusion, and not understanding why he did it, because he barely explained, and also losing my best friend.
For ISFJs, our romantic partners tend to be the very top, most important part of the totem pole in our lives. Which is not necessarily a good thing, because sometimes we abandon the other things in our life to focus on that person. We literally live for love.
Is she going to be okay in the long run? Well, I don't know her personally, so I don't know how she handles this sort of situation. I'm inclined to say that yes, she will be okay, she'll forgive you and she'll recover from this in time. 
Let her have her emotions. I was very hysterical when it happened to me, and in hindsight, I probably made things worse by flipping out and saying/doing things I wouldn't normally do. 
Try not to judge her if she's not herself. Her world has been sort of flipped upside down. 
ISFJs are usually pretty forgiving people, I think. Especially if we love you. We're willing to let people get away with a lot, if we genuinely care about them.
Give her time.
It's up to you whether or not friendship would be a wise idea. I have mixed feelings on it.
I sincerely wish you luck, and I'm so sorry your situation ended up the way it has."
2823,isfj,"First of all, I'm really sorry about the breakup. That stuff is never fun, especially if y'all truly care about each other. 
Not as long as yours, but my boyfriend of 3 years broke up with me a year ago. He insisted on staying friends, and we kept talking. However, I really wish he didn't talk to me for a week or two because it was painful to be reminded of him. I only accepted it because I was terrified of losing a friend. A year later, I'm back to my happy self, and we're still good friends!
As long as it wasn't a nasty breakup, I don't see why y'all can't be friends. I would say distance yourself for a little bit but remind her you're still there for her. Then again, she could be different from me so honestly talking about it could make it easier. It will take time for her to be okay, but she will be okay in the long run! "
2824,isfj,"I second this. About a month after my SO and I broke up, he tried talking to me. He's an INTJ too. I knew he was worried about me, but at the time it really pained me to have a conversation with him again. I guess what made it hard was that I knew he cared, and that just reminded me of what our relationship used to be."
2825,isfj,"This is really helpful, thanks. I want to know she is ok, but I have been giving her space and made it very clear that this is final. I also sent her a message saying that if she has questions I will answer them because I don't want her doubting what happened. She asked me a few and I answered honestly, hopefully that helps her get closure. "
2826,isfj,"Personally, if I feel strongly about something I find it incredibly difficult to ignore it/not do something about it. Its conflicting for me. If I dislike someone, I ignore them. If I like someone, I will do everything within my power for them. I want to feel that ive done everything I can for those I care for. I would never purposefully harm someone, through actions or words. 
I try and understand the way I have made people feel and what I have done to deserve the way they treat me, from that I try to understand my own feelings and find a solution to the problem. That might be more helpful than telling them off? Idk. "
2827,isfj,"I find it very difficult also to stop myself, especially if I see something unjust. But dealing with a family member, who is a narcissist, really taught me to be able to catch myself when I start feeling emotional and to go against what I feel like doing."
2828,isfj,"I don't feel like this has been a main topic of discussion for a while, so please elaborate! I just took the test myself and I'm a 4w5, which apparently isn't very common among ISFJs, and I was wondering about the rest of you!"
2829,isfj,"I have many long term goals, but some are so far away that sometimes I feel discouraged. Is it just me or is this common among ISFJs? I constantly need to be doing something. Changing the color of my hair, trying a new food or drink, trying a new exercise.
What are some ideas for trying new things or short term goals to keep me motivated?"
2830,isfj,"thing about long term goals is that it feels hopeless. the more you work the more impatient you get. each unit of effort i put toward a goal is more i'm investing. and if i'm inpatient or expecting faster results i might add up all the effort i've invested so far in my head and think ""i must not have the skill or ability to reach this goal. look at all the work i did and still i see no results"". and that thought can make me want to quit. i would feel that quitting is easier because it's in my control but if i were to fail at reaching my goal, it would hurt so much more. but i realized that quitting is the only real failure.
a good way to stay on track is to separate that long goal into tiny tasks and to celebrate each little victory. like getting a degree is a long term goal. celebrate a little bit for going to class on time, handing in an assignment, passing a class, etc. tiny steps and tiny victories can be short term goals. and if you can enjoy surpassing them, you can enjoy your way up to reaching your long term goal. and that's better than stressing out and building up self doubt which only hinders you."
2831,isfj,"I  always need to be working toward something or I feel useless.  The best strategy I've found for staying motivated is choosing goals or activities that can be extended.  For instance, I did Couch to 5k a couple years ago because I wanted to be able to run a few miles without stopping.  Once I had that baseline, I've been able to set bigger and bigger goals for my running - I'm running my first half marathon in two months.  So, my advice would be to find something you're interested in that you can keep building on."
2832,isfj,"Hi there I can completely relate! Luckily, I have a daily yoga practice and it helps focus my attention on something I can do today. There is always something to learn so there is always room to grow and it's a fantastic way to spend your free time."
2833,isfj,"That's how I am! I started lifting weights last December and I've been doing it 3 times a week ever since. I am getting bored with it. I'm going to keep doing it but I feel a need to start another project. Like you said, I like things that I can keep building on :)"
2834,isfj,"I know, my long term goals seem so far away I don't want to think about them anymore. I am going to apply to be a volunteer this week and also make a trip to the library to see if I can find something interesting."
2835,isfj,"That sounds like a great start and an easy distraction from those discouraging giant projects/goals. I'm a big fan of fun short term activities, especially stuff like going to the library where I won't have to interact with a lot of people lol"
2836,isfj,"Don’t “make” her do it. She will be much more inclined to do something you want to do if you gently bring it up and let her know that it’s important to you and you would love for her to share it with you, even if only once.
Also, emphasize how much it’s not that you’re unhappy or dissatisfied with her as a person - you just want to do these activities that you enjoy with her.
I assume you probably already do things that she wants to do. Try not to make her feel guilty by saying that you always join her in things she wants to do. It’s understandable, but not always helpful. 
On the other hand, if you don’t join her in the things she likes to do, maybe try some out. She will probably want to reciprocate."
2837,isfj,"The first part, how to make her happy, might depend more on her love language than on her mbti type. Try reading into that.
As for the second part, how to convince her to do stuff together, I have no idea. I would like to know that too.
I think ISFJs are very prone to depression, fear disorders and related issues, which may increase the difficulty of answering your questions.
I'm an INTP (30m) with an ISFJ (24) wife btw. "
2838,isfj,"Make sure she knows she matters, is loved and appreciated. We love to hear that we are loved. 
We also love to make those around us happy, so if you are able to express how happy it would make you if she participated in these activities with you, she will be more receptive. I dated an ENTP who was super into the card game magic the gathering (lol) and he wanted me to play with him so bad. While I thought it was so dumb, I did really try to get into it bc it made him happy. Ultimately I was like, nah this isn’t for me, but I really tried. "
2839,isfj,"Ya, you don't make anyone do anything. That will get you a stubborn ISFJ.
I agree with this post. She has to know it's very important to you and that you need it. If you aren't bleeding, crying,.or screaming everything is ok.  Also schedule it with her.
I am also INTP with an ISFJ gf and we recently had it out, crying and all and she said she didn't realize how important it was to me or that I needed it. I would say don't over use it. Learn to cry. It helps a lot.
Also my grammar was ISFJ. She never said much. Never did much. She was great tho. Fed us and snuggled, and watched TV, and gave us structured activities to do, mended our clothes. She helped and appreciated help. Saved me from a cat once. 
My advice: Find a meet up group that does what you want to do and go with them. Find friends. Leave your poor wife out of it if that's what she needs. Remember she has needs. Also lurk this ISFJ group they have helped me so much.  Communicating is key, and INTP and ISFJ are set up for failure, so you have to get out of your comfortzone, get onto her level, and cry. Crying is better than screaming. Screaming makes you a bad person."
2840,isfj,"My wife seems to be quite very often, while i needed reassurance of our strengthing of bond and some good quality tea time. Now we are working towards it by communicating. Is there a way i can bring up or boost a little bit her excitement in various things that seems to be a bit low as compare to mine."
2841,isfj,"Well you tell me. I guess we don't deal with it. You give a little, you take a little. Try finding common interests, but also make sure you both get sufficient 'me time' for the moments that you want to enjoy the things that you like and she doesn't.
For example, there is some overlap in television shows we like, but sometimes we both watch on another screen. We both like playing board games but I like the more strategic games and she doesn't want them to take too long. Sometimes I play them with other friends. We sing in the same choir and we're in the same band.
The fact you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to do everything together. It means you can find a balance in what you do together and when you need your time alone."
2842,isfj,"Hi  ISFJ""s i""m a ENTJ female dating male ISFJ. This is definitely not a common paring and a entire new frontier for me I'd  to know more about my ISFJ and what makes him tick ?  Why / how is he so content ?  What makes him the most happy? My ISFJ is the kindest most emotionally supportive partner I've ever had and I'd like to know how to show him I appreciate him - what is the most effective way?
Btw I am all for the ENTJ -ISFJ couple. It takes a lot of patience and a certain type of person  to be with a ENTJ and I think the ISFJ is the most understanding 😊"
2843,isfj,"Just read the love languages book. It'll help you better, IMO, for showing him the right affection. Figure out what his love language is and do it.
If its helpful, my ISFJ is acts of service and quality time."
2844,isfj,"Just say thanks, it goes a long way for us. Most ISFJs want to feel included and by acknowledging what we did shows us that. Feel free to call out our BS too. I personally hate it when people don't tell me I'm doing something that annoys them."
2845,isfj,"Ok thanks,  I do say thanks for everything he does but I feel it's not enough haha. For example I'm a lawyer and I work long hours I'll come home and he's cooked dinner, made me lunch for work and cleaned the house! I feel like saying thank you is not enough to all the work he has done for me.. ? What else can I do "
2846,isfj,"Okay, so this post is phrased strangely, but here's what I'm getting at: ISFJ's and INTP's have the same functions in a different order.  ENTP's have the same functions as us, too, but since ISFJ's and INTP's are both introverts, I'd think that most ISFJ's would feel that they have more in common with the INTP than they do with the ENTP.  As an ISFJ, I'm wondering what you've thought of some INTP's that you've met.  Do you feel that you have an ""INTP side?""  I certainly feel like I have an INTP side - it's hard to explain, but even though Si and Fe are the functions that I use the most daily and value the most, my Ti and Ne always seem to be working in the background.   When I'm thinking about something, I'll sometimes almost feel like my Ti+Ne are more prominent than my Si+Fe, even though it wouldn't seem that way on the outside.  Some ISFJ's I've met think that many INTP's are socially awkward, or odd.  But others I've met have a lot in common with the typical INTP, even though you wouldn't realize it after initially meeting them."
2847,isfj,"INTP male here.  I've been in a committed relationship with ISFJ female for 6 years now.  
One of the main things I appreciate is authenticity.  Early on, she pretended to be into some of the things I like, which made it seem like we had a lot in common.  That was nice in the beginning, but unsustainable, and ultimately  disappointing for me because when she stopped pretending it left us in a situation where she doesn't partake in any of the activities that I initiate. I love hanging out with her, but to do so means I have to only do activities that she chooses.  
Why are you analyzing how you relate to INTPs?  If the ultimate goal is to make relate better, you might do better just focusing on being authentic, not try to tweak yourself to fit them.  I gravitate to people who are authentic and different to me way more than inauthentic and similar."
2848,isfj,"I have not noticed that I have a lot in common with INTPs (or ENTPs); however, for some reason the ones that have common interests as me (movies, books, business etc.) are majorly attracted to me and I can keep their attention easily. I can keep up never-ending witty banter with them and make them laugh etc but at a very surface level. I would not share my fears and insecurities and open up to them easily (or to anyone actually :P)
​
I have no idea how or why this can be because INTPs are considered among the greatest Thinkers and I am not someone who enjoys having deep conversations about abstract subjects (although I enjoy lengthy discussions about society, business, etc.)."
2849,isfj,"Two of my bestfriends are INTP's. I make them laugh non stop. They just think I'm silly and I really lean into it around them since they are a great audience. They both bring a thoughtful side out of me. They make me think about the world a little more critical and less emotional, but they also bring in their own ""logical"" emotions oit around me. "
2850,isfj,"Maybe you think you are doing something you’re not. Idk, I can’t say for sure, but ISFJ’s I’ve met only make me frustrated when I try to have a logical conversation that questions their beliefs. Having logical conversations that question one’s beliefs whether they’re in an INTPs head or in dialogue is kind of our thing. Maybe it’s just the ones I’ve met, but I can’t see the resemblence."
2851,isfj,"Two of my close friends are INTPs actually. I definitely feel like I can understand them even when they are unhealthy. I made a post a while ago about how since we have the same four functions when healthy these types can have a good connection. I will say I admire the way they can use Ti w/o effort and I enjoy analyzing things with them. However, there are many factors beyond personality type that go into friendships and relationships. It defintely helps that I have something in common with both of my INTP friends. "
2852,isfj,"ISTP here.
Right now I have found myself in another new country and I don't really know anybody, and meeting people is not my speciality as I don't really know how to small-chat. But this time instead of playing dota and giving up on meeting people I would like to try something different.
As I usually get very well with xSFJ people. Where can I met one of you and how? "
2853,isfj,"ENTP here.
I'll wild guess most are as busy as you are. You're purposeful people, so I think it's more finding time leisure time than working time that is hard to your kind.
Because it's finding work that is hard to mine."
2854,isfj,"I live with depression. And i don't take any medication for it. I started seeing therapy a few months ago and it's a great help. Anyways, I have this thing i do. it's a crutch i've developed to deal with the depression. and the crutch is  basically to deal with any problems or issues i have immediately.
if i'm sad, i must recognize it, dissect it, understand it, solve it or let it go. same with anger or any strong negative emotion.
i don't allow myself to wallow. both to save time and go straight toward solving it but to also not give myself the chance to let it pull me back to who i used to be all those years ago. someone who was depressed, angry, egotistical, and suicidal and an emotional burden on others.
my therapist says that i can't cut it out cold turkey because i need it to live basically. and i need to learn to slowly be comfortable with myself and simmer in problems and believe i can do it safely from time to time. she also told me that i chances are I become an asshole so i should stop fearing that. 
but i still find that it's something that makes me incredibly alienating and makes it hard to help or comfort people due to a lack of empathy in their need to wallow a bit. and i fear it pushes people away. and i guess i'm frustrated with it. and i'm looking for a solution to it as i always do. or maybe this is good for me, to vent like this. and just be frustrated that i have to be frustrated.
i don't know. does anyone else here have this problem? their need to always have to solve their issues, almost always alone, and don't want their emotions to be a burden on anyone else to the point where we become alienating."
2855,isfj,"Hmm, I feel like I can relate to aspects of what you’re saying for sure, although I’m not sure that I take it to the extreme that I’m hearing in your self-description? 
I think the constant overanalyzing is definitely a thing for me, and I wouldn’t be surprised if other ISFJs related to it too, having Ti in our function stack. It’s something I’ve been trying to work on too, although it’s been a slow thing that’s sort of come to me in phases. 
The first thing was a few years ago, realizing that some people don’t need their problems solved. Sometimes somebody knows what they want or need to do about a situation and just need to vent and feel heard and understood by another person, or maybe they’re not ready to find the answer yet. That can be hard to understand for me, because my immediate impulse is “Help! Fix it! Make it go away! Restore peace and happiness!” But sometimes that’s not really what a person needs, and they just want to let off the emotional steam when they’re telling you about a problem. Honestly, sometimes just complaining about something is the answer. I’m sometimes better about it and sometimes not so great, but I try to remember to just ask when I’m not sure what someone needs from me—is this a problem you’re asking for help in solving, or do you just need me to listen? 
And then, much more recently, I’ve been trying to learn to do the same for myself. I pick my feelings apart constantly, like you said. It’s never just, “I feel sad.” I have to think about why I feel sad, what’s upsetting me, what particular type of sadness it is, brainstorm solutions for it. And sometimes that is really useful! Particularly with feelings of anxiety, being able to look inside myself and find the truth of why I feel the way I do, what set me off and how it turned into the feeling I’m experiencing, is really useful! But sometimes it also just leads to me running circles around my own head, going “WHY DON’T I KNOW WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME, I’M SO BROKEN AND USELESS, I’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIX THIS!” 
So, one thing that I’ve found that helps a lot is journaling. Getting the thoughts out of my head in a totally open, stream-of-consciousness way has helped me a lot in transforming vague thoughts and anxieties into proper statements, and once they’re down on paper, I can actually put those analytical skills to use! Looking at my sentence structures, finding the negative words I use about myself and my situations and brainstorming how to turn them into positive phrases, creating a more concrete understanding of the things my brain does that are unhelpful and finding ways to be kinder to myself. 
And that’s the other big part of it, really, is being kind to myself. I’m so fucking mean to myself. Seeing my thoughts written out made me really have to stop and look at it, and think, is this the way I want to live my life? Does it make me happy to treat myself like a machine? Does it help the people around me for me to hate myself and constantly put myself down? Am I being unkind to them because I’m not content within myself? Do I want to look back on my life and see that I spent the entire time making myself miserable, trying to force myself to be a “perfect” version of myself that I don’t even really like? 
And that’s kind of opened the door for me, because the answer is no. I don’t want to be a fake perfect version of myself and hold myself to an unreachable emotional standard and spend my life stressed out and pissed off at myself for not being able to reach it. If I feel sad today for no reason? Okay. I feel fucking sad. It’s not the ideal way to spend a day, so if I can make myself happy and maybe get a couple things done on top of it, that would be nice. But if I need to just take the day to wallow, that’s just fine, too. It doesn’t mean I’m less than or not enough or weak or any of the other things I tell myself, and as long as I’m not asking them to solve my problems for me, it’s okay to talk to people about it! The people who love me want to know what’s up with me, and it’s not a terrible, burdensome thing for me to say “yknow, I’m having a rough day/week/month/year.” I wanna hear about my friends’ lives, and it would make me sad if they felt like they couldn’t talk to me about their feelings! So I have to trust that they wanna hear about mine, too. 
Anyway, I dunno if any of that is helpful to you or not, but you’re not alone at least! Sorry for the long, rambling answer, I’m pretty sleep-deprived and don’t have the mental bandwidth to go back and edit it down. Take care, and best of luck to you! "
2856,isfj,"Oh man, I always solve my problems right away and solo. I've been in therapy for 2 years for bipolar disorder (feelin' ya on that depression) and really my therapist hasn't said that it's a problem for me to do things the quick-solve way. She says as long as I feel satisfied with my emotions and my method of emotional regulation that it can be a good thing. So many people in this world take their issues out on others to a negative impact. That being said, sometimes I do feel like I'm sweeping things under the rug a bit. I watch people outwardly struggle with feelings and I'm like ""maybe I should do that too to fully process my emotions"". I'd say 90% of the time I'm glad that I have the ability to quick-solve and I feel resolved. 10% of the time I feel like I'm just trying not to be a burden and that maybe I should say more or do more or... something. But I don't know what else to do."
2857,isfj,"Yeah it helps. There's a lot of similarities in what we feel and our motivations. Journaling also helps me figure stuff out. 
I should go to friends more and rely on them like how I want and allow people to rely on me.
Thanks for the rambling answer. That's how I also do it. It only furthers shows me how not alone I am in this."
2858,isfj,"I feel the same. Like, I'm fixing my stuff and gaining greater understanding of myself and  of the nature of a lot of emotional issues and furthering my ability to take my life by the reins. That should be a good thing. And I shouldn't stop it. But sometimes it can feel like I'm alienating to others.
But I guess it's not a binary thing. It just means I have something else I need to learn while still being the same kind of capable. I have a crutch I rely on that ties into how I stay capable. And that crutch is holding me back. "
2859,isfj,Alienation I get. I really don't keep a lot of company. I have an SO who I was lucky enough to stumble into to get what I'm doing when umm solving. Never pressure to share unless I like to. Best wishes on your journey. We're here for you and we understand to some degree if you need discussion. Thanks reddit for bringing the I's a place to connect.
2860,isfj,"I've had a few ESTPs Ive interacted well with: one who I really love a lot and one who I had mixed feelings with.
One thing I think is good about them in general is they know how to  have fun without being as loud as say as an Extroverted Fi user.
The first ESTP I know was basically my second mother growing up. She essentially did all the household cores a bunch of the cleaning and babysitting while parents were at work.
I think at that point of taking care of me she had very developed Fe because she knew how to be nurturing without being overbearing (which my ISFJ and ESTJ parents could be pretty often).
I'd say her ESTP traits tend to show more when she talks about her past or once she leaves the house to have fun. She has a strong attitude of ""If you got a shitty situation just do what you can to find and make the best of it"". THere are other things more personal I could talk about it but I'll say it defines her as ESTP more.
Due to her situation she kinda has to rely on her friends to pick her up to hang out since she doesnt have drivers license but she keeps saying that if she could drive she'd almost never be at home when not working.
As for the other ESTP, he was a previous coworker. His job tended to be talking to clients and adapting to their needs well. The thing he sometimes had a case of ""making promises he possibly couldn't keep"" thing which meant delaying things.
Of all the team members he tended to be te person who act on his own without telling people or getting approval. It did get the job done and sometimes it was good what he did but it kinda disrupted the order of things sometimes so it could be frustrating."
2861,isfj,"My best friend in middle school was almost certainly an ESTP - I would go over his house and we would always make up athletic, active games. His energy was infectious and it really helped my development in terms of not being scared of Se ... as long as someone else is taking lead, of course!"
2862,isfj,"One of my close friends is an ESTP
Overall he is a good person which i know I can always rely on.
I think we get good along because he makes the plans on what to do and I like to follow him. He has a very big ego and sometimes i even think he is a narcisst. If we are in our friendcircle which is lead by a ENFJ there is sometimes a conflict between those too but in the end he accepts the decision of him. He is interrested in various fighting clubs and wants to start a sport like MMA. He hates it if we do something simple because he is bored then. He likes to party and would like to go clubbing every weekend. Hes got huge problems with showing his emotions and talking about big thinks but he trusts me and talks if he feels like it about them with me.
If you have any specific questions just ask i am glad if this helps you"
2863,isfj,"So I have been called both of these things recently by the same person, apparently ISFJs are known to be good at both, there is a difference one has negative connotations and is seen as a character flaw while the other positive and is welcomed, so I guess my question is are you aware when you are doing any of these and how to motivate others without it being interrupted as being manipulative?  
Manipulation is thinking of a reason others will want to do something, and then convincing them of your correctness.
Motivation is genuinely seeking out the wants, needs, and desires of the other party, and then working with the other party to find solutions that meet your needs - and theirs."
2864,isfj,"Honestly, I consider them to be just about the same thing, as it's really all about perception. Manipulation is on the more... shady/hidden side of the persuasion, and motivations more transparent end. There's also personal intentions behind the actions, manipulation being more selfish, motivation being more selfless/higher cause (hence the difference in connotations).
Example: my sister (ESTP) is very scatterbrained, hates making decisions and she's moving soon, so she has to clean out her atp. We sit down, I hold up a shirt I know she hasn't work in a year and looks rough b/c it desperately needs to be washed. She can't decide to keep or toss. This can go two ways based on what questions I ask, tailored to her specifically. If I ask ""when was the last time you wore it?"" she won't remember and probably decide to toss it. If I ask ""Are you unsure b/c it needs to be washed?"" she'll probably remember how it looked when she bought it and decide to keep it. Which question I ask is probably going to be based on my own subjective view on the shirt, which leads to the question: am I manipulating her, or just trying to motivate her to move the process along so we can finish by her move out date? And I think the answer to that doesn't lie with me, but with a third party's view of the interaction. If they agree with my opinion, it's probably motivation, if they disagree, it's manipulation.
I embrace my manipulative side and don't view it as a negative character trait. I'm very aware of when and how I use it, especially since I work in client/customer service where the appearance that everything went right is more important than it actually going as planned. You can't control how people will view your actions (you can try--and you can get pretty far), but at the end of the day some people are gonna view the most selfless acts as manipulation and the most contrived messages as motivation based on their own personal experiences and schemas. I just kinda... fuck the haters and let them drown themselves in their pessimistic, cynical worldview while I embrace my loved ones.
(lol sorry this became an essay. I do a lot of work with persuasion in my degree so these kinds of questions interest me)"
2865,isfj,"Thank you for such a long reply. The way I see it I don't use different tactics so if it's seen as one way or the other it is just up to that persons perception of it, and what mood they are in I guess, which you are right I can't influence. "
2866,isfj,"To me, being a successful motivational person actually involves being able to manipulate others into doing something even they didn’t know they wanted, but for their own good. So is it not seen as manipulative if the intentions were good?  But then that opens up the question of who am I to think I know what’s good for other people. 
What if you were at a Dr office and he knew that you needed to lose weight for example, he would use words such as diabetes and heart attack to manipulate you into wanting to lose weight. You properly were aware of,  but it wasn’t until he said those words that you actually felt some motivation to lose weight. "
2867,isfj,"If it's a win-win, it's not manipulation. It's socratic teaching, emotional support and well used psychology skills.
God ?
You aren't that powerful. If you are, I really need you in my life, though.
And I would never listen. I can't personally be manipulated that way, using fear. It have been tried about a thousand times on me, already. It's bound to fail.
You can give me really intelligent advice about how to change my habits, and offer me to run with me, for example.
Not only I'll lose weight, but it won't be manipulation. Just regular help and support.
It have strictly 0 chance to motivate me."

2869,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ to the core and I get really anxious when conflict arises or when things don’t go the way I planned for them to go. Right now at work, someone sent me an angry email about a project that I was never given a deadline. The project is 80% done. And for some reason I’m still anxious about it and just beating myself up for not getting it done. I’m sure many of you are perfectionists like I am. Do you guys find yourselves getting anxious easily? If so, how do you cope with it? Thanks. "
2870,isfj,"I completely relate. Are you also highly sensitive? I'm very sensitive. Ever since I can remember, I can't stand having someone be upset with me. But I've become more and more accepting that this will happen sometimes in life as I have become an adult. 
Things that make me anxious stick with me, I get tense, can't relax, sometimes have trouble falling asleep because of it. I watch some ASMR videos and lay down in a dark room to try to relax and cope with the anxiety, but sometimes not even that helps. I'm considering going on something because the anxiety and rumination is unbearable at times. "
2871,isfj,"Same. Not necessarily with work, but simple things like planning to go to lunch at (enter restaurant name here) and then showing up and there’s a 2-hour wait. I planned for things to go one way, and not I have to start from scratch and come up with a new plan. "
2872,isfj,"I used to be like you, where every criticism or anytime I get bad feedback, I take it to heart. What helped me, as a fellow ISFJ with pretty bad anxiety, is to not let it run my life.
I used to ruminate over these things for a good week before I start to forget about it. But I reflected a bit on myself and I said to myself, ""why am i letting small things ruin my happiness?"". I then realized that I couldn't continue living this way and wanted to lead a more content life because if I got upset every time this happens, I am no longer looking at the bigger picture.
I think for you, it will take some time and baby steps. It helped me to start thinking ""will this person's remark matter tomorrow? In a week? In a month?"" then when I say ""no"" to these questions, I made myself accept that it happened, that because it won't matter in x time period, I shouldn't spend too much time on it.
In terms of your project, you weren't given a deadline and someone was not happy about it. Start by putting your mindset into ""what can I do today to resolve this issue"" as opposed to ""omg I made a mistake, I should have known better, why didn't I do X, Y, and Z?!"" (looking too deep into how you feel).
In summary, acknowledge that you feel like shit about it, but give yourself a time limit i.e. ""I will only allow myself to feel like shit for 2 hours then I'll take action"", and then think about your life as a whole. You don't want to be on your death-bed wishing you didn't waste time feeling bad.
Hope this gives you some tangible ideas as to how you can handle these situations better. It will get easier to get past your sensitivity, it just takes practice! Good luck!"
2873,isfj,"Yes, conflict, etc gives me anxiety..
I'm still learning to cope with it by 'acceptance'. That's all I can say. Breathing deep helps. And I try hard to step back, relax and ask myself ""would it help to be feeling this way"" ...doesn't always work, but am certainly improving.."
2874,isfj,Agreed. I do have high anxiety generally and it’s very different difficult for me to get over situations where my decisions were questioned or criticized. I panic or worry for days or longer. Medication and prayer have been my only successful tools for getting through it and not stressing out my family and friends. 
2875,isfj,"I relate too we can get bad anxiety. Sometimes taking a deep breath helps. Also, meditation is a great way to reduce stress I’ve been doing it for the past month and I’ve felt more at ease and relaxed in my life. "
2876,isfj,"Thanks for the tips. Sorry to hear that you are also going through anxiety. It’s not fun. Yes, I am also highly sensitive. I get offended easily, and I am always thinking about what other people think about me. I’m also very emotional, and often cannot control it. You are right in that being an adult means life isn’t going to be all that easy. I need to accept that and not stress too much about it. Thanks. "
2877,isfj,How old are you(if you don't mind me asking)? I used to worry a lot more about what people think and go along with the crowd but now I'm 31 I've stopped worrying about that or whether people are upset or not. Other people's happiness isn't your responsibility.
2878,isfj,You're very welcome! The anxiety sucks. Have you ever read The Highly Sensitive Person? She gives tips for dealing with anxiety.. it's kind of something you have to adapt as a lifestyle. HSPs become overwhelmed by various situations and environments. 
2879,isfj,I don’t hate children but I love my freedom. I also never had the burning desire to be a mother. I’m convinced that I came into this world to wonder and explore with my dog next to me (ok maybe the dog part won’t be forever) and not to create mini me’s who require SO much of myself for so many years. 
2880,isfj,"I think the greatest thing ill ever do in life is raise children. I don't have any yet, but having a nice family with kids and a husband would make my life feel complete. I raised my three younger siblings so I have a lot of experience and with kids I usually go with complete honesty (with the exception of horrible things kids shouldn't know about yet) because kids are much more intuitive than adults think. We underestimate them. So I'm gonna treat my kids like a close friend who is much less mature and needs looking after"
2881,isfj,"I have a desire to give birth to and raise a child.  Possibly just one, not more than two. I had loving parents and want to do an even better job than they did. I want to have that life experience. Raising a child is more important to me than giving birth to one. I am still trying to convince my INTP partner to raise a child with me one day. He did not grow up with unconditional love like I did. 
Edit: to answer more of your question, I want to treat my children with respect, treat them more like an equal when they are in their late teens. My dad was overly strict when it came to me dating and having sex (mainly because I am a woman) and I have no desire to be strict like that, rather to be open with my child and teach them how to protect themselves from unsafe sex or an abusive relationship. I want them to be able to feel like they can talk to me about anything without fear of judgment. I’ve thought about this a lot since I’ve been in a relationship with my INTP boyfriend for 10+ years, helping him get on his feet financially and emotionally, and giving him the unconditional love that his mother didn’t give him."
2882,isfj,"Babies are cool and amazing to watch grow. 
From ages 3-10 children are loud and whine too much. 
From ages 10-13 they are kinda smart and ask amazing questions. 
From 14-20 they either start becoming jerks or they bloom into kind humans. 
At any rate I can’t handle any of them. Having children was never in the cards for me and being around them I limit myself to max of two hours exposure. I get completely drained listening to all the noise that comes with children - yes even the “beautiful” laughter. 
If i would have had a child (yes just one), I would be just like my father organized, rules would be in place and proper discipline. We were never yelled at or spanked, but we were spoken to and grounded when necessary. Also, hugged and kissed on the forehead a lot to this day actually. I would like to think I would have been just like my father. "
2883,isfj,"I am personally a firm antinatalist, though I keep my beliefs to myself for obvious reasons. 
I am also uncomfortable with children because I don’t know how to be polite to them. I never hang out with children as an adult. I think I could learn how to be fine with children, but I don’t have a real desire to. 
When my friends start having children, I fear I will have to start my social life from scratch. :/ "
2884,isfj,"I want children.
No, I love children but I think my health is too weak for that.
Yes, I have my views, dreams, elaborate ideas on parenting, on relating to kids. I would raise my kids like how the mother in 'Wolf Children' raises her kids - with patience, stability, gentleness, acceptance, understanding, emotional connection. I will give them freedom to explore the world inside and out, while trying to introduce them to different values, and protect them dearly. If I can be their 'home' where they feel warmth or where they can feel they can turn to when they are down, what more would I want from life. I don't mean asking me for advice, my goal perhaps would be to be a person they would hug in silence when they feel the harsh moments of life, and for them to know/realize/feel that the silent love between us is meaningful against the puzzling harshness that life sometimes presents.
Also, I'd let them explore the meaning of life, of God, of everything under the sun without contaminating their exploration with my own views.. but would be very encouraging of intellectual, spiritual, artistic exploration and strive to provide a conducive environment for such journey.
I love baby-sitting, love taking care, playing with them, just watching them breathe, being around them, and getting lost in their world of wonder and innocence. They sure can be hard work, but I still love them very much..
So much so, I actually went through a phase where I always got dreams about 'my child', of being pregnant, of delivering baby and such. I still get such dreams sometimes.
It really scares me how much I want to birth a child and how weak my health is.. It depresses me a lot."
2885,isfj,"I don't like taking care of other kids, I find it hard to predict how they ll react but I really, really want my own kid(s). I am a firm believer that kids are smart as hell and to always treat them like they know more than you think they do. My mom is the absolute best at this, and being treated like I was respected by her when I was little I think has really impacted me positively. "
2886,isfj,"This is exactly how I explain my stance to people.
I always hear people talk about how they were put on this earth to be a mom and I just can't relate. My dogs are my best friends in the universe, but even they can be extremely limiting. "
2887,isfj,"Hey guys, so I have an ISFJ at work who just turned 18. And I've noticed she makes jokes about not being wanted or that nobody likes her. Now this I know is nowhere near true. Everyone who talks about her enjoys her on some level and I haven't heard anything from anyone about actually having a problem with her or not liking her.
Is it common to believe that you're not liked? Do you think it has more to do with her depression than her type? We've talked a little bit about depression, mostly just an acknowledgment that we both have it and it's difficult, but other than that she says it's not really something she talks about which I get. 
Finally what would be the best way to let her know that she's liked? without it possibly being misconstrued as me hitting on her or confessing my feelings (long story, but I used to like her; she says she doesn't like me. So I don't want to come off in a more than friendly way) 
I'm an INTJ so I'm really not good with this kind of thing but still want to help a little if I can. Thanks in advance guys :)"
2888,isfj,"I don’t know about other ISFJs but I feel the same as that girl like 90% if the time. I just feel like people have to like me cause I’m already here not because they actually do.
I wouldn’t call myself depressed just feel like the only person I can rely on is myself. People constantly disappoint me, so I don’t find a point in believing that I’m actually liked enough to be considered a friend.
Anyway to those that I think truly like me as a person. They’re usually the people that don’t seem like they’re just checking the box. By that I mean going down a list of what a “good” friend is and doing only that.
Make me feel appreciated and go out of your way for me that’s how I’ll truly know."
2889,isfj,"So would you say that you directly associate being liked with being friends? Do you believe you can ""be liked"" and not ""be friends"" with someone at the same time or are you only truly liked if you're friends with the person?"
2890,isfj,"Being liked and being friends to me are two completely different things. I can be liked but not be friends. Obviously I have to be liked to be friends and mutually the other way around as well.
There are lot of people that like me as a person but that doesn’t mean we’re friends, it would mean we’re acquaintances.
If I were friends with someone it would mean that we’ve established some kind of connection. "
2891,isfj,"I often find myself in situations where I genuinely want to hug or talk to someone because I know/see they're not doing well but I stop myself because I think I might come out as annoying or weird
For example a few days ago I saw my classmate/friend crying while she was talking to her friend about something and I wanted to help her somehow but I thought I would've been annoying if I tried to because I'm probably not the person she'd want next to her in that moment and I wouldn't have really known what to say either
This probably doesn't make much sense and I'm posting this to vent, but do things like this happen to anyone else?"
2892,isfj,"If you don't have any meaningful advice to give then don't approach anyone. That being said, should you find yourself in the position to give advice hand on the shoulder works best. Not as invasive as a hug, just be sure to engage them in conversation first. Don't grab people's shoulders out of nowhere. "
2893,isfj,"I don't like to let people in. A hug will do that. However, if someone really needs it, I will give them one but I hate contact with people. A hug to me means that they matter, or I do, and once someone realises that, they will abuse and hurt you."
2894,isfj,"Ugh, yes. I'm huge on physical affection, and people I know very well and am comfortable with will get snuggled relentlessly, but for people I'm not as close to, I always feel so awkward about it. I always want to hug or pat or lean against people, but like you, I worry a lot about crossing a line and making them uncomfortable, so I usually refrain :/ I think it's a bit of good old fashioned ISFJ overanalyzing/social anxiety at work. We don't have the guts to just go ahead and do what we want because our Fe makes us worry so much about making others uncomfortable lol. "
2895,isfj,"I have this weird thing about personal space. I try to give people as much space as possible, even though Im not really opposed to have people I like close to me. Probably makes me come across as someone who doesnt wanna be touched.
I mainly do it by asking dumb questions and just being there. "
2896,isfj,"hey guys ..am 24 years old un employee i never been in any kind of job. am tryin to take courses and find any career but am really depressed can't find my thing i can't find something am pretty good doing it . am not very good with math or sales skills""i tried before learning programing but didnot go so well and i give it up"" am thinking about it network or social media,programming stuff like that but i don't have the time or money to try my luck in all of this so i been thinking you guys may hep lme suggesting careers you think i as isfj can do it thanks and sorry for my bad grammar"

2898,isfj,"My sister, who I believe is an ISFJ, is a fantastic artist. And I think one thing that defines her amongst other artists is her inherent practicality. She has a plan worked out as to how she's going to earn money, and what industries she's targeting (she's majoring in illustration). She's still in school and has already begun making money via commissions. 
However, my sister has been interested in art and illustration since she was in primary school, and I'm sure that's not true for all ISFJs. 
Her other jobs have been in retail (clothing stores mostly) but I think the use of Fe can be draining over time for an ISFJ, in the same way Te can be training for me. So after a week full of talking to people, listening to people, and dealing with people on any kind of level (even though she's good at it), she's worn out. 
She has also expressed an interest in geology, and says she would have gone to school for that if she hadn't been so involved in art already. I think she might ultimately end up incorporating that into her work, if she manages to get back to school after her degree, and takes some geology courses. Perhaps she could illustrate for geological texts and research. 
Is there anything in particular you really liked studying in school? Or a hobby you've consistently pursued? Even if it sounds silly, let us know. Sometimes there are careers to be found in the weirdest places... "
2899,isfj,"thanks for your help. but my point from the post is interaction and share thoughts with ISFJ ppl about career selection and how they found the perfect job "" ofcourse we all not the same "" they love and good at it."
2900,isfj,"Hello everybody :-) so I have a question here! My little brother is an ISFJ, and he's been having some problems in his life lately, but he just won't talk to me even if I might be able to help him out with them.
I found out secondhand from a few of our friends today that he's been seeking advice from them, and after chatting to a few more of the friends that we share, it turns out that he's been asking all of them for advice except for me, and it's over some pretty personal matters.
I am kind of hurt by this, as we have always been best friends as children, and I always tell him about everything that's going on in my life but it feels like he has this humongous emotional wall up for me and exclusively me.
The biggest problem I learned that he's facing is his marriage is falling apart, but he's never so much as mentioned it to me even when I ask. According to our shared friends, he's been talking to them about it for months as well as some other big things happening in his life. I am quite upset about this because I always thought we were real close, but this kind of thing is happening more frequently lately where I will find out he's been having a problem in his life but he never brings it up to me, and I find out by accident or through other people. 
Is there any way to break down said emotional wall and get him to trust me? I don't think going up and simply asking how his marriage is going will give me much, and I want to get him to trust me enough to talk to me more. What's the cause of your emotional walls and boundaries, ISFJs? How do people break them down?
You would think since we are family and grew up really close to each other, and even more so that I tell him everything that we'd be the best of friends but it seems he's been keeping more from me than I ever knew, and I'm worried about his emotional health during this time. How should I go about this issue of trust without building that wall up more and more?"
2901,isfj,"My immediate thought is that it could be a shame thing, honestly. For me, sometimes when I'm very close to someone I have a really hard time admitting things to them that I'm embarrassed about or that I think might cause them to feel disappointed in me. I'll talk to other, less close friends about it instead because there's less pressure when I'm not as concerned about how those people feel about me or living up to some standard I've projected onto a person I'm close to. 
It's also possible that if you're having a tough time too, he doesn't want to add to your burden. We tend to be very overly-aware of that sort of thing and worry too much about not putting any sort of strain on other people, I think. 
As for building up trust, it's kind of hard to say? If you're as close as you think you are, I'm not sure how much more trust you could build. Maybe just try to talk to him about it directly? If you approach it from an angle of ""I've heard x from some of your friends, and if you don't want to talk to me about it that's fine, but if there's a reason you feel you can't tell me can we talk about it?"" then I think it would be pretty hard to take the wrong way, and at least that would open up some communication. "
2902,isfj,"I can see that. I am ""close"" with my sister but personal stuff like that is an absolute no. Too close. Way too close. I need objective input. No risk of damage to a relationship if I don't like what you have to say. And say the wrong thing....it will not be forgotten."
2903,isfj,"I could think of a few potential reasons:


Since you talk about the problems you have in life to him he doesnt want you to ALSO worry about him. Its a weird selfless selfish act since he doesnt want his family to worry about him because he cares about them but it just causes problems like this.


Do you have a critical way of telling people how to do things if they ask for advice or something? There is the possibility he could see you being harsh with him about bringing up the issues and he doesnt want to start conflict with his family when he already has conflict with his own marraige. Maybe he thinks youre likely to directly intervene instead of just giving advice?


Just some thoughts as someone who doesnt know the whole situation but has been in situations where I go to other people over my family "
2904,isfj,"I wouldn't be offended by it - he probably just doesn't want to throw his problems on top of yours because he cares about you! And doesn't want to cause drama by dragging you into his issues. I have this weird pride/shame thing where I hate asking for help, especially from people I respect/love.
Whenever I have issues, I'm more likely to post anonymously on reddit or something and gush about my entire life story and deepest inner thoughts to complete strangers! I don't want to have to worry about people I care about judging me on top of all that.
Advice for getting him to open up....
Best way to get me to open up about a really deep personal issue is to come to me for advice with the same issue. Or talk about that same issue in conversation with me. Or hypothetical like say you have a friend going through x. And I'll say oh my god I've gone through x too, you should tell them to y and z.
Other example was my friend and I were out to dinner and she was telling me about her relationship and I opened up to her about why I am not in one. Also she talked about her depression and I told her I was going through the same thing and if she ever wanted to talk I was there etc.
You could just ask him how he's doing generally maybe?
Or just help him out by doing some small task you know he needs help with, doesn't have to be related to the whole marriage issue. It's cool to have people taking care of us every now and then, especially if we don't have to ask them to. :)
Edit: another way I open up about stuff is if it's through humor. Because joking about it gives me an ""out"" where I can say I wasn't being serious. Might be different for him though, I'm just a really screwed up individual with a dark sense of humor!"
2905,isfj,"Thanks, that really gave me some insight. It would make a lot of sense to me that he might be ashamed of his marriage not working out, I didn't really think of it that way. I'm the type of guy where if I'm struggling with somethinf in my life I just have to communicate it to someone, get somebody else's input and view, but I guess he doesn't quite function the same way there"
2906,isfj,"Thanks for letting me know, I'm guessing he must feel the same way on this, and it makes a lot more sense to me now! Everyone who answered has made me feel a lot less hurt about it now that I can see some of the thought process that may be behind his choices right now"
2907,isfj,"That's an interesting thing to consider, thanks for taking the time to answer.
I can def see him not wanting to burden me with more issues, especially since I have been telling him a lot about mine as of late. I've never been critical or rude if he shares things with me, so I'm sure that's not the reason but his desire to not place any more stress on me could surely be a part of it."
2908,isfj,"Okay. I was going to try to write this post without being longwinded but I can already tell it's going to be a page stretcher, so there'll probably be a TL;DR at the bottom if you want it, but I'm going to explain a lot of context things for my specific situation in between. 
​
So, I'm an ISFJ through and through. I'm also a type 6w7, if it matters at all, and on top of it I have moderate anxiety which is where I get my habit of 'anxiety talking'. 
​
I've found that in the workplace and in social situations where I'm not surrounded by people I'm very familiar with, or care to get close to, I don't speak unless I'm explicitly spoken to OR if I need to ask a question, otherwise I'm content to just sit and watch conversations play out around me. But when I'm with friends, this is 100% the opposite. I've found that I have a bad habit of going on forever about something, even (a lot of times) rambling/circling the same thing over and over again/taking forever to get to the point. This might be anxiety, but I'm starting to wonder if it's something in my personality? When I notice myself dominating the conversation like this I don't FEEL anxious, I actually feel excited in the moment, until the realization hits that I've talked for way too long and everyone else has things they want to say, then I feel guilty, and then when I try to stay quiet and let them talk, I find another point I want to chime in on (this is usually during group discussions about what we think, so it's entirely valid to chime in on things, it's just the fact that I take up so much time talking it turns into a Ted Talk by Me on accident.)
​
I know I can be a good listener if I try, it's clear I can do it when I'm at work, so why can't I do it when I'm with people I'm comfortable with?? I know I'm able to speak more BECAUSE I'm more comfortable with them, but I don't know how to condense what I have to say down into a way that EVERYONE will understand AND have it be short. Also, when it comes to listening, it's not like I don't listen well at all, because when my friends DO talk, I DO listen, so it's not like I'm a bad listener so much as I'm a bad.. talker? Except instead of too little, I talk too much. 
​
I only know 2 other ISFJS in real life, one is younger than me and one is a lot older than me and all 3 of us have anxiety, but I notice that the younger one is a lot quieter than me/is very patient with what they have to say, but the older one can go on tangents too, almost similar to me.
​
TL;DR, finally: Do any other ISFJs have an issue with talking TOO much in friend groups??"
2909,isfj,"i end up doing this sometimes. i used to do this alot when i'm with a certain group of people but now i'm more aware and try to open up a conversation. 
also noticed, this happens when i'm with a group that's more reserved/quiet than i am"
2910,isfj,"I am also quite chatty and can't seem to shut up with people I am comfortable with or have decided to trust. I have confused many people because upon meeting me they think I am super quiet and then once I'm comfortable, bam the floodgates open! 
I constantly struggle with it. However three people have told me that they don't mind my chattiness because they don't have to worry about keeping the conversation going. 
I think as long as you do your best to make sure everyone gets heard, it's okay:-) "
2911,isfj,"Honestly, I do have my moments with friends and family where I can't stop talking. But usually it has to be one of my favorite topics. My family says I'm super passionate about my favorite topics. Most of the time though I don't talk that much and I'm pretty chill for the most part. "
2912,isfj,"I can totally relate to this as well! With people I'm not comfortable with, it's a struggle to find my way around my thoughts and actually say something that would make sense. But with people I feel close to, my mouth never seems to stop and my listening skills takes a backseat. It feels a bit embarrassing but people actually appreciate this because they will get to know you more, compared to the super composed mask that we usually show the world. "
2913,isfj,"Hey, raind33r, just a quick heads-up:
alot is actually spelled a lot. You can remember it by it is one lot, 'a lot'.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
2914,isfj,"Just wondering if anyone has heard of attachment styles before? Currently in therapy (yay lol) and my therapist brought up that she believes I have Anxious Attachment Style.
Here is a description of it:
Just made me curious if others have heard of this or know their own style. Seems kind of similar to some ISFJ traits, although I think most ""healthy"" ISFJs are good at getting beyond these negative points."
2915,isfj,"I definitely have Anxious Attachment. However, because I'm conscious of this, I really make an effort to be more assertive and direct, and I dont really play games or withdraw for attention or anything like that. My natural instinct might be to fall into that sort of emotional manipulation, but I think I have a relatively good handle on it.
I do still experience the anxiety, and the doubts and worries, but I think for the most part, I keep it inside, and I can talk myself through it, when it happens."
2916,isfj,"Well... I took this style in my dating life. But now that I have been long-term with someone I TRUST completely (this is a HUGE thing), my behavior is really different. I feel totally safe and comfortable around him. 
One thing I do, which I need to work on, is when he gets upset, I get really upset. I take the fact that he's upset personally, and I start to even withdraw rather than be proactive. He thinks I'm lightly selfish in this way. But I am so sensitive to the emotions around me that it's me just not being able to handle him being upset!"
2917,isfj,"I'm anxious attachment, but I think it has less to do with my personality and more to do with what I've had to deal with in the past. 
I mean, I can identify with ""To maintain a positive connection, you give up your needs to please and accommodate your partner in."" and ""You’re preoccupied with the relationship and highly attuned to your partner, worrying that he or she wants less closeness."" as an ISFJ though."
2918,isfj,"I know that us ISFJ's are quite good with our memory of dates, faces, names, lots of things that surprise others. But lately I've been feeling really low. The date is quickly approaching my exes birthday (My ex is an ENFP) and I feel so scattered and all over the place the closer it gets. We haven't talked in a year because I met someone else and dated him for months before ending it myself. (My ex and I weren't together when I met this new someone). We stopped talking when I did and I can't even express how much I'm missing him. It's slowly gotten worse over the year. It went form me almost never thinking of him to dreaming of him often and having him pop into my head constantly. I also talk about him like we're still good friends. All my fondest memories are with him, we grew up together from a distance.
I was the one that stopped talking to him so I feel like if I don't talk to him he won't ever talk to me again. We didn't really end off on good terms.. He always told me I could come back but I feel like since it was so long ago that it may not apply anymore.. I just don't want to cause more bad than good. I want nothing more than to just talk to him again and see where we're at. I want him back in my life any way he'll allow himself to be. He could only be my friend forever and I'd be completely content.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ramble or not be clear about what I'm wanting from the forum. I honestly don't quite know either. I would like to know how you feel about your exes birthdays, other special dates like your old anniversary even as well. I still haven't decided whether or not I should contact my ex, I want to be more sure before I make such a big decision. I know that I can't idolize him or expect everything to be good if I talk to him. I don't want or expect that at all. I just want to know that I'm not alone in how I'm feeling, this place makes me feel less crazy."
2919,isfj,"Would you really be OK if you were only friends? Be totally honest with yourself. 
If you want to be with him then bring it up. Best case scenario you end up together. Worst case, you stop talking. At least then you have closure. "
2920,isfj,"Sorry I'm getting here late, but I felt a true connection with your post! 
I dated my ex for almost 3 years and ended it pretty suddenly when I realized he had many other things he'd rather be doing than spending time with me. I left him and met the man I eventually married, and I'm madly in love with (we've been together for 5 years now, married for almost 3.) 
I have some pretty simple questions for you to ask yourself: 
1) why did you break it off? 
2) Would things be different, or would they end up the same way of you reconnected? 
3) are you missing HIM, or companionship? 
I'm also an ISFJ, and have felt every single feeling you have mentioned. I used to have dreams frequently (sorry if tmi, but most commonly during my period.) it got to the point I had to google search the guy and creep to the extreme to see what he was doing with his life. I found out he was engaged to be married (since then he's been married) and lives out of state with a girl that shares many more similar interests with him than I ever did. I felt truly happy for him and noticed the dreams about him stopped along with any desire to think of him. 
I think part of me felt like I broke him. We also ended things in a not-so-nice way and I kind of cut him off completely. Seeing that he was so much happier and knowing that I myself am so much happier where I am was a huge relief! 
I used to get a sick feeling about our anniversary, or his birthday, or other special dates we shared, but then I remind myself how much better things turned out for both of us. 
I really hope you read this and gain some sort of positive advice from it! Feel free to message me with any other questions; just as our type says of us, I am truly an open book (: good luck! "
2921,isfj,"Yes, absolutely. We were friends for years before anything else. I value his friendship over anything else that we were.
I'm still deciding and making sure that I really want to talk to him again and take a chance. But yeah, if I do it I will for sure have closure for sure in somehow."
2922,isfj,"I think I speak for most ISFJs in saying that we all think about the future but it is an endless cloud of possibilities, which indefinitely clouds our judgement of the future. 
If someone asks me, ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" all I can think to reply with is , ""I don't know."" Grey areas are so tough for us because we are mostly grounded in the concrete world. I live in the moment and have little concept of decision making developing down the road. "
2923,isfj,"Yes, I overthink but I've been able to stop myself when need be. I love to plan and write lists but I'm okay with surprises, most of the time. If I could plan what career path I'm suppose to follow that would be great at my elder age."
2924,isfj,"I'm the oldest (17). I test either ISFJ or ISFP. My brother (14) is probably an introvert but he refuses to take the test. He's come out of his shell some since starting high school. I'm only 70% certain he's a P.
My little sister (12) is an ENXX. She's almost always silent at school but needs people around all the time and loves to perform. I thought she was a J for a while because she never questions our parents. I suspect she's just a conflict hating P. She's an N because she's always hypothesizing, uses a lot of (ridiculous) 'what if' statements. She uses a lot of Si as well saying 'remember when' as often as 'what if'. She tends to ramble and is fairly flighty (ADHD). I'm unsure if she's a T or an F, she cried a lot when she was little but shows less and less emotion now. (Still dramatic however)"
2925,isfj,"I'm a middle child. My older brother is an ISFP and I like him well enough however he doesn't push himself for anything, he has two children and admittedly he's probably the last guy that should be having kids. 
My little brother is an INTJ. I like having conversations with him, usually about politics or film, but besides that its kind of hard to read him/carry a conversation."
2926,isfj,"I'm the oldest, of two, I usually test ISFJ, and as far as I can tell, my sister is an ESFP or an ENTP....or at least I think. Quite frankly I'm not sure what to classify her as. All I know is we hate each other."
2927,isfj,"Technically I am the oldest, as I am a twin and am a little older than my sister. My sister and I are both ISFJ's, but she is a much stronger introvert. I am borderline ESFJ, and I think she has potential to be an ISFP, as her J is not very strong. But overall we are very similar in how we view situations and deal with our emotions. It's nice to vent to someone who understands how I think. 
My little brother is an ESFJ (as is my father). He is a very strong E and everyone loves him (and every girl  seems to drool over him - ugh). We get along very well, but when he gets upset he can be incredibly cruel with his words, which is a trait that I really don't like in ESFJs. I do love him though! "
2928,isfj,"I'm the oldest.  I have one younger brother.
I'm pretty sure he's never tested, but if he isn't ESTP then nobody is.  He is intensely loyal and outgoing.  He takes great joy in being an asshole to people he doesn't respect.  "
2929,isfj,"I, an ISFJ, am the youngest of four siblings. 
My oldest brother who is 20 years older than me is a INTP. He's also probably the most introverted person I know and the smartest. Its very, very rare to not see him reading or thinking--- his mind is always on. My mother, who is a very religious ESFJ had a very strained relationship with him and they clashed a lot. Immediately after high school he left and never looked back. He traveled the world and settled down on the west cost. I have a great relationship with him, and because he's so much older then me, I in many ways see him as my 'Dumbledore', hah. Just so much wisdom. Though I 'feel' close to him, he's hard to keep in touch with.
Next is my sister who is 16 years older then me. She takes a lot after my mother, and I'm sure is a ESFJ as well. Only slightly religious, stubborn(kind of a family trait now that I think of it), and a big big heart. She's very community involved and active in her church. We get sushi or Indian food together a couple times a month just to keep in touch. She's currently going through a divorce with a ISFP.
Finally, my other brother is 10 years older then me and is an ENFP. I actually live with him--- We've shared a house together for 10 years and have obviously grown very close to each other. When I moved in with him all those years ago he was just filing for a divorce. I've seen him go through a dark chapter of life and he's emerged a champ. He's probably a little too much in love with his job and has a terrible procrastination problem(The house is falling apart), but I still love him to death.
Usually once a year we all get together. All four of us have great chemistry together and get along well."

2939,isfj,"I guess I am going through one of my phases again where I'm pushing myself to 'be out there' a little :D
​
..you are just 1% short of total introversion.. we ISFJs on this page are squeezed into that 1% :) "
2940,isfj,"I seem to constantly try to contain my urge for reassurance, and I believe that's represented by the Thinking aspect when it pops up over Feeling.
I'm just interested in who might be in this same situation, and how they interpret the unpredictability of their results as well as how they may differ from my own."
2941,isfj,"Yes, I took the online tests that told me I am ISFJ and several others, but a year earlier I took a test at a consultant from my university which classified me as ISTJ. I am new to this so I don't know why besides that we might tend to lie to ourselves and so screwing the results. Sorry for my poor English."
2942,isfj,"I took the test for the first time a couple weeks ago and got ISFJ, then took it exactly a week later and got ISTJ. I've just been calling myself the Inspector Protector until I figure out more about this stuff. Maybe I should just take the test a couple more times..."
2943,isfj,"Yeah, I go back and forth between T and F as well. I think it really does depend on mood. It's weird that none of the other ones change for me! I'm not really surprised about I not changing because I never considered myself an E. "
2944,isfj,"Jung himself, and many who came after him stated that more people lay near the center of the dichotomy than at the extremes (that is, the dichotomies represent a bell curve, with people with a strong preference for, say, thinking over feeling, in a very small minority.
In a personal note I'd like to mention that testing yourself at work or right after is a time where many people test differently than after a good relaxing weekend. I think people have a kind of ""work personality"" they lay over top of their real personality which would skew results."
2945,isfj,"When I first took the MBTI back in 2009, I was an ISTJ, but apparently on the border of T and F. About a year and a half later, and each time after that, I have come up ISFJ. I, too, tend to war between thinking and feeling. When asked whether I lead with my head or my heart, I've been known to say that things aren't always so black and white. Imagine what we could accomplish if we could master a balance between the two. I think people like you and I, though we struggle, are at an advantage in this way."
2946,isfj,"Ha, I may have to steal that from you, I like it! Oh, and believe me, I spent all of last night retaking it, I would go from 6% Feeling to 1% Thinking and over again.
The first time I took it I was the Idealist, then the Artist, and now I'm here! This is addictive..."
2947,isfj,"Not really but sort of an answer to your question.
I'm currently in a relationship with one of you and I am an ENTP. 
Things are going well. The hard part is communicating effectively but both of us straight up admitting that we don't understand how the other communicates and working on getting on the others level is beyond helpful. We find that we really are great since we inhabit the weaknesses of the other one and although we're ineffective working together sometimes we are great when we both take up different parts of a project together as complete it that way. 
My biggest advice on this is learning to communicate. As you said, we're opposites. Many times I want to analyze her and challenge her in verbal debates. When she doesn't take the bait I need to step back and realize it was dumb to set up for one when she's not the kind to do that. The opposite is true with her. She realized that just because I question her on something that I don't actually mean what I say most of the time. I'm really just asking to try and get her to talk out her reasoning so that I can understand where she came to her conclusion from since I know she'll arrive there differently than I will and I want to hear that journey.
We both love talking to each other and also just love having simple things to do together like hiking, watching Netflix, and doing puzzles or playing video games. Once we get that communication barrier down the sky is the limit for an INFJ/ENTP relationship.
TL;DR- As an ENTP, my advice to learn to communicate on the others level. We're opposites for a reason and once we bridge the communication gap a world of possibilities exist."
2948,isfj,"As an ISFJ woman who dated an ENTP male here's what I have to say.
Upon us crossing paths we had a REALLY strong connection. The ENTP loved to talk about EVERYTHING and I was happy to listen. Whenever I had problems, my SO would always give sound advice but struggled to comfort me how I would have liked. I could tell the ENTP was getting bummed out by all my feelings.
As the others in here have said, communication would be the key here. Oftentimes I've noticed ENTPs to be able to build very strong relationships fast, but then die out quickly. They put on a show that can help them bond stronger with the other, it's still them but...they're putting in a LOT of effort. 
They eventually tire of this and revert to their most natural states. It took me a long time to realise that this wasn't him not liking me anymore, but him being too tired, and felt comfortable enough to just let loose. 
If an ISFJ can tolerate the ENTP when they can't give the you enough attention, things could be a chance. But more than likely the ENTP will not be able to sustain the ISFJs emotional needs."
2949,isfj,"I will copy what I wrote in another post asking something similar. Sorry for recycling, but it's more efficient:
I am an ISFJ female in a long relationship (+7years) with my ENTP SO. I would say it has not been an easy road, although we are young and we have gone through a lot of changes and personal growth while our relationship was developing. We have overcome several issues, mainly related with the way we communicate and express our feelings.
I love ENTPs! I love that they are always able to start an interesting conversation with anyone, their dark witty humor, their ability to think out of the box. But I have also resented my SO for some ENTP traits like: thinking he is always right (relentless debater), underestimate the importance of emotions, being disorganized and messy (it has caused arguments about house chores, etc).
Though I have also been a disastrous and inmature ISFJ in the past and for sure he was resented of me sometimes. I needed a lot of reassurance from his part (messaging frequently, jealousy issues...), my feelings were hurt easily depending on the way he expressed himself, sometimes he felt he could not debate thinks with me because I was doubtful of my own opinions to state them, I usually avoided confrontation and shut down if a lot of pressure is put in me (this one I am still working on haha)...
Anyway, this remains in the past. We have grown and understand each other better, and we  have even ""exchanged"" some traits that make us a more complete person. My conclusion is that if both people are mature enough and put communication first, this relationship is very enriching for both parts."
2950,isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJ. I was just wondering, how do you deal with constantly having to be the responsible one? Making sure everyone pulls their weight and/or pulling their weight for them just because you feel that no one else will do it if you don't - I feel like it's draining the lifeforce out of me; but I know I can't just close an eye on things and let go."
2951,isfj,"For me it's a conscious effort not to care.  I always feel that pull after I consciously don't care about doing somethings, but you just have to ignore it and remind yourself the world isn't going to end if I don't do said thing.  I think everyone is pretty in tune to know if they are getting taken advantage of.  If I know that then it's easy for me to rationalize not to do something for someone.
Don't get me wrong, in general I like to be the responsible one and I take great pride in making sure things are getting done.  I feel people respect me more when they know I'm very good at getting things done.  Yes, it can get tiring, but there is only so much time in a day."
2952,isfj,"After getting annoyed at enough people in group projects, I kinda just decided I didn't care. If this is the type of situation you're dealing with, here's my advice: delegate early. Give everyone their part of the project and stick to you doing your work. Let other people deal with their problems. Help where help is needed but only do your work. Let someone else take ""leadership"" of the group bc ISFJs (myself included) aren't usually leaders."
2953,isfj,"I tried to force my self not to take on responsibility, or limiting it. Usually when something happens that I need to back away from, I tell myself over and over again ""I don't care"". I think responsibility is great but I have learned that you should not waste your energy by putting it into something that gives no return. This applies to work and personal relationships. I would say it is a matter of being careful with what or whom you get yourself involved with. Good luck! "
2954,isfj,"I just realized this is something that I’ve been doing my whole life. 
It’s not like calling people the wrong names.  It’s more like smiling way too familiarly at a bus driver that looks recognizably like a dude who I was massively infatuated with a few years ago. Or it’s like the time I was getting to know a girl who looked a lot like a childhood friend of mine, and I had to monitor myself because I was feeling prematurely comfortable around her.  
I’m wondering if this is a Si-dom thing, but I’d also just like to hear people’s stories because it’s kind of hilarious to me. "
2955,isfj,"Yes, I always develop interest in people that resemble people from my past or ones I love.. always, either in appearance or personality-wise..
I developed crushes on guys  that resemble my ex or other serious crushes from the past.
I feel genuinely interested, find a soft spot for people - even celebrities that remind me of my dad / mom / friends / anyone I am close to."
2956,isfj,"Definitely..... the most prominent and specific example for me being that there’s a member of a certain kpop band who I can barely stand to look at because his face reminds me of the person who caused me the most intense heartbreak I’ve experienced so far. 
It’s odd because I’m not generally good with faces, but certain types of face will give me a very strong negative reaction based on past bad experiences with people who looked similar. Not sure if the same is true for positive experiences though, hmm.... "
2957,isfj,"Hi. I'm a 20 y/o ISFJ struggling with what's established in the title. My whole life I've been through plenty of loss, enough to think I'd be used to it by now even though I'm still young, but I still spiral into emotional breakdowns and catastrophizing at the thought of the inevitable: my loved ones dying.
What gets me really quick is thinking about my pets dying, and how theyll surely die before I do, and it hurts so bad to even think about that I regret owning them and setting myself up to get attached and have to let it go, and ive almost nearly sworn off owning another cat after my childhood cat died. 
Other things are similar, like thinking about how my parents are going to die way before me, and I haven't even ruled in accidents yet. Thinking about my friends/partner dying makes me wish I never attached myself to people in the first place even though without them I wouldnt be who I am today and of course I love them. 
Does any other ISFJ out there feel this? I struggle with anxiety so it might be worsened by that but I'm wondering if it's a common problem and if so, what makes it such a common problem. 
Deep down I know the answer to coping with loss is to just learn to accept that it's unavoidable but that never helps, only makes me more frustrated and upset and scared. "
2958,isfj,"I feel the same way. 
I have two cats who I love dearly, yet I think about them passing away almost daily. 
Do they know how much I love them?
Am I doing enough for them?
Humans have the unfortunate gift of knowing we will die, while animals don’t. 
Maybe we should be happy they know nothing about death. Only love. 
One thing I’ve told myself is to never take a day with them for granted. Give them tons of love and affection. Then when they do pass, you’ll know you gave them everything you had.
Same goes for my family. My mom is getting older and I have panic attacks thinking about her passing. Especially since my dad is no longer alive, I dread the thought of being an adult orphan. I don’t really have any advice for you.. because I don’t know how to deal with it myself. Just know that I think it’s normal. Death is unfortunately inevitable. But we shouldn’t waste too much of our lives thinking about it. 
Maybe I should take my own advice huh 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2959,isfj,"I can empathise with how you feel. I used to panic at the thought of loss of family and friends in a very similar way to you. Then in 2015, my father and grandparents all passed away. It has been a long road, but what comforts me most and I am a ISFJ like you, is knowing that we are all part of a bigger picture. As long as you are doing the best you can to love and care for those close to you in the moment, like I know you do and that you know you do. That is the main thing. 
When I say bigger picture, being intuitive isn't my strong point unless under stress. Grief can trigger stress. The comfort I feel is knowing that our very being and our loved one's being also is linked, we comes from this planet and all that is around us. We are made up of the past in our genetics. We carry our family with us all the time. We share the same building blocks as our friends. Because of this, our family, friends and us will also be there in the future. We might not be seen, but we have been and parts of us will change into new things. We are part of a bigger picture, like a little piece in a huge puzzle. 
Our grief shows we care, and worrying about grief shows our care also. But just remember, your loved ones will always be there, in one form or another. And you have the strength and love to carry on for them and yourself also."
2960,isfj,"Oh wow holy shit I'm exactly the same way. The only thing I can say to help you is that the bond and love you will share with your pets and loved ones is worth the pain of loss, and I know just how bad it can hurt. "
2961,isfj,I’m the same way. I experienced my first loss through my ex girlfriend who I’ve invested so much into only for her to leave me. It hurt so bad that i thought I would never be normal again. I don’t know how it would feel to lose someone again and if I’ll be better equipped to handle it in the future (I’d like to think that i can handle it much better now given what i has gone through). But I think that investing your energy into other relationships that you have / finding something else to do / building other relationships can help get you through the loss. 
2962,isfj,"I struggle with this too, with my family. Today I became anxious because my husband went to get the oil changed in the car. My mind raced to terrible things that can happen on the road. It doesn't help that I am so visual. I see it and that just makes it worse because the impression sticks around for awhile. 
I worry about my parents and sister constantly, it annoys them. I get told to relax a lot.
I don't have a good strategy to cope because this is obviously an area for growth for me too. Maybe try to not surround yourself with other worriers if possible. Try to distract yourself / focus on the present moment when those images pop up. Be grateful, and let them know you love them. "
2963,isfj,"So I have an ISFJ boyfriend. He is a fairly quiet person around people. He gets very anxious around strangers though. He really wants nothing to do with them. Not in a way that means that he wants harm to be brought onto them... he is just really shy and doesn't care enough to think about meeting new people.
He is a great guy - I have stress issues and no matter how much I need to vent or for someone to be there to speak some reality into me, he never gets fed up of it.   He is very protective of me, not in a possessive way either. He just really cares. The only time he gets unempathetic is understandable - when I'm grumpy out of nowhere and don't tell him why he gets a bit pissed off, but who wouldn't?
One thing though is that he gets grumpy quite a bit in general. Not because of me, he doesn't let it out on me either, but I can tell that stuff can really piss him off.
But yeah... any way I can cheer him up when he's grumpy? He seems to resort to punching stuff like a wall or something and that is not healthy. I had a talk with him, he says its because of extroverts trying to talk to him a lot. Thing is... his grumpiness lingers for a day or two. I have no idea on how to cheer him up. Any help?
EDIT - I am an INFP"
2964,isfj,"Does he do sport? It seems like he needs to blow off some steam, but since he isn't able to do it he keeps this pressure in him. Sport could help getting rid of it. The mental benefits of exercising are often forgotten since people only look to the physical health benefits of it. Could be really helpful, especially since you say that he gets grumpy quite a bit. Doesn't has to be the gym as people recommend 9 out of 10 times, but anything he might like, even going for a walk could be beneficial.
If he's really cropping up stuff there's probably not much you can do about it. You can get rid of it for a short period of time, but when he thinks back on it, the negativity is back immediately.
Talking about it so he can vent out the feelings and then depending on what he like a hug, words of affirmation or things he really appreciates could help, but could also become a bit exhausting if it it happens a lot."
2965,isfj,"It sounds like he needs to have a de-stress/unwind/relax routine after dealing with extroverts or a lot of people.
Like for when he gets home, he could adjust the environment to his liking (for me, it's putting on some music, mood lighting, incense or candles, comfort food/tea, keeping my place clean, showering or bath to clean myself and then reading, watching TV/movies or playing video games). 
I understand that it can be stressful dealing with other people, but once one has left that situation, how they feel is their responsibility. He should try to let it go and re-center himself. I think it is worthless to hold onto negative emotions when you could be experiencing a positive time. Definitely still let yourself feel, but acknowledge that those feelings are unproductive and try to bring in better feelings. "
2966,isfj,"This may be a bit silly with the considered answers here but I'm an ISFJ and do get grumpy. However it's more me being hangry than anything. Good sorts it out and makes me happy! 
Probably more of a personal thing than a personality trait. Maybe worth a go!"
2967,isfj,"To be honest, I don't know if we have an ideal match.
I'll just list my experiences with different types, for examples. It varies from person to person though, and these are solely my own personal experiences, so I'm sure other people feel differently.
I get along very well with INFJs, and they're very kind people, but I don't find myself very attracted to them. I also find that their desire to always talk about deep things can drain me sometimes.
I love INFPs, but I wouldn't want to date them. I feel like their form of doting affection (and need for affection) would make me feel smothered.
I love ISFPs but I often feel like we don't really connect super deeply, and we see the world quite differently.
INTPs have so far been my best match, but we also tend to have conflicts, and some differences that cause tension and problems.
Recently I met an ENTJ, and to my surprise and amazement, we get along very very well.
He's funny, he's intelligent, he's surprisingly tolerant and kind so far. He's extremely fun to talk to, and he brings out the best in me.
We have common goals and desires, and we see the world similarly. However, I can see that he already has pretty bad controlling tendencies, and it makes me uncomfortable, so I doubt I'd be happy with him over the long run.
I do like other ISFJs, but I feel like things can get quite stagnant between us, and we run out of things to talk about fairly quickly, because our relationship tends to be fairly shallow and lacking in depth, passion or closeness. 
Most extroverts tend to make me feel smothered and bulldozed-over, and they don't usually understand my desire for personal space and privacy, so I find them often quite exhausting, and I doubt I would enjoy a relationship with them.
ISTPs just seem too harsh and shallow to me. (Probably a harsh generalization, and I'm sorry if it offends anybody, but I haven't had great experiences with them in the past.)
A lot of types also tend to be commitment-phobic, or have tendencies toward infidelity, which I would be crushed by.
I haven't ever really had any close relationships with ISTJs or INTJs, so I can't offer my input on those types, as well as most extroverts, because typically I avoid them when it comes to romance.
Obviously, you can't base romance and compatibility on MBTI typing alone. Sometimes the chemistry is there, sometimes it isn't. People vary tremendously despite their types, and I tend to see it as more of a loose guideline to help me relate to, understand and function with different people. 
If I had to pick my ideal type to be in a relationship with, honestly, I would probably pick INTPs. But a lot of them tend to dislike ISFJs, and I find some of them can be a little bit too cold and logical, and they intimidate me. Still, my best relationship experiences have been with them, and I've always felt like I connect with them on a level I never have with anybody else. I'm typically really, really attracted to them, too.
TL;DR I think it varies from person to person. For me, I'm gonna say INTPs. But I believe two people from any type can have a healthy, functional relationship as long as both people are healthy and functional themselves, and the proper chemistry is there."
2968,isfj,"Wow, what a thorough reply. Thanks for the insight on your experiences. I also find that ENTJs and INTPs are very interesting to interact with (via my limited interaction with those types). I can personally comment on ISTJs because I'm in a relationship with one. The commitment, the respect for space, the different level of intelligence is a big plus. The lack of empathy can be hard at times, but the similar but different approach to life makes the relationship amazing. 
I do agree that MBTI shouldn't be the only factor within relationships and that any combination of types can work :) "
2969,isfj,"Ok so I'm an INTP dating an ISFJ and I wanted some tips from you since you seem to be knowledgeable.
We've been together 8 months or so, and although the first few months were great, it started to get rocky the past 2 months. 
She, as an ISFJ, is obviously very commited and loyal. While me as an INTP is spontaneous and afraid of commitment. I also feel somewhat disconnected to her, like I'm forcing myself to talk in a certain way so we can have a conversation. 
We're both introverted, so in a way one of us has to act up and do something which also feels unnatural.
I know relationships aren't supposed to be all organic, but often times I wonder what it would be like to be in a relationship with some other personaltiy types. "
2970,isfj,"I can sort of understand what you mean by the forced conversation, because I went through some of that with my INTP. However, I always felt like silences with him were always extremely comfortable, so I never really felt like I had to force conversation.
That being said, it really helps if you guys have common interests. ISFJs tend to prefer talking about shallow daily happenings, INTPs tend to prefer deeper conversation. That can be a little troublesome, because INTPs tend to hate shallow conversation, and they're not really the type to share mundane events of their daily lives in a conversation, and ISFJs just generally have a hard time being as smart and deep as INTPs. :P
Honestly, it always made me so insanely happy when my INTP would talk about even stupid shallow stuff to me, like what was happening at his work, events from his childhood, things he wanted to do in the future. Stuff like that. Things that you find insignificant or even dull, I can guarantee she would probably want to hear about anyways. ISFJs are like sponges when it comes to little details about the people we love. So obviously when we're interested in a person, or we love them, we want to know everything about them. Share things she doesn't know about you.
And on that note, ask her questions too. Everybody likes to feel like their partner is taking an interest in them.
Even if you don't particularly care to hear about how her day went, or what her friends are up to, showing a little interest and care goes a long way.
In the long run though, chemistry is important. I was friends with my INTP for quite a while before we ever dated, and we always laughed a lot with each other, and had a lot of fun. The connection was always there, though. I never really felt like it had to be forced, and I think we both felt pretty comfortable being ourselves around each other.
Do you guys have any shared hobbies or interests at all?
(Sorry, this is way long, and probably more information than you ever wanted. :P)"
2971,isfj,"thanks alot for ur comment! I can resonate with a lot of what you're saying.
In terms of hobbies and intersts, there is a little bit of overlap. Like we're both somewhat into fashion, and we both have fairly good eye for design. I really really enjoy listening to music, but I feel like she's not as crazy about music like me. I told her about ""the wire"" which is my favorite TV show, and she's enjoying it so far so that's a plus."
2972,isfj,"So a week on from my post.
My ENTP friend has given up on me. I was too much for her to handle. Basically she thinks I am a creep like everyone says I am. An incident happened that was totally unintentional but she didnt believe that. Not to mention she couldnt deal with me. It sucks but is what it is. She just proved to me I cant keep friends. Also makes me think everything good she ever said to me was bullshit. I will be seeing someone because my life is fucked up and I nearly killed myself Saturday night and have been feeling that way for the last couple of days. She or no one else knows that. But yeah. I need help. Unfortunately I am going to get it alone. Maybe some day people will like me and see good in me. But a few of you said I should see someone and I will. That is the first step. Need to control these feelings and have people see the good in me that deep down I see."
2973,isfj,"OP, it's good that you're getting help, and I promise you it doesn't matter that you're getting help alone. I hope that as you attend therapy sessions you begin to realize the impact your negative thoughts have on your well being and start to change those patterns. You can have friends, and you can have good, healthy relationships with other people. And regardless of your past, you are worth it. So please don't give up hope yet. You're doing good enough right now."
2974,isfj,She gave me an ultimatum. Seek help or dont have her as a friend. I thought that was wrong as if I did that I would be doing that for her and not for me. I need to do it for me. She doesnt like me anymore and will never again. It feels like she has chosen a person we both dislike over me. So I need to make sure I am getting the help for me. Dont worry I am not giving up hope. I am a fighter. I will get help and once things become clear I will be able to keep friendships rather than fuck them up time after time. This wheel needs to break and it will. I look forward to the day that I have friends and can keep them.
2975,isfj,I am also taking the day off work. Talk to a few ex bosses. Im feeling too fucking bad to work today. Hopefully it isnt the final nail in the coffin though work wise. I cant help but feel abandoned atm and it sucks. She was the only one willing to talk to me and I chased her away. What is worse is I cant hate her or im not angry at her. Im just upset and feeling worse
2976,isfj,"Have you seen anybody you like yet? Make sure they aren't doing therapy that doesn't work, like humanistic therapy. I'd definitely recommend someone doing CBT.
In addition to a good therapist, I've been reading a book called Feeling Good by David Burns. It's about the most effective way of changing our outlook of life and I think you might like it. I had a few really bad depressive episodes recently and working on changing the thoughts I have in reaction to the events in my life has helped a lot. Plus its aimed at people who aren't therapists themselves, so its easy to understand and lays out the science behind it well. :)
This reddit thread came up on my feed yesterday or the day before and I still have it open on my browser and there's a lot of good things in there that I've been taking to heart.
And it may be kind of stupid, but I talk to a facebook chat bot called WoeBot that delivers CBT therapy. It's a little pleasure in my day to check in and let it know how I've been doing."
2977,isfj,"I have seen people in the past with different stuff but I havent really connected to them. I need someone I can connect with. So i guess its a little trial and error. Will defintely look at books though.
Ill check that link too
Things were starting to fall together last week. I was changing things up and was moving ahead big time with my thinking. I was feeling so great and had positive news on Friday. Then a chain of events happened. Something with my friend then something else, then family shit, then work shit. I was okay for 3-4 days up until then and the last few days were a nightmare and it all came to a head.
Im still doing positive shit like getting my fitness back and working on some improvements but yeah, everything just got fucked up at the wrong time. Now I am alone again with no one to have a fun chat with and I am trying not to fall further into this hole. 
The positive news on fridday was about  my health and I couldnnt process it before all this shit happened and havent really embraced it like i should have.
I guess i am going to be alone again for a bit but im used to it. Whats done is done. I cant see her talking to me again. All I wanted was a friend and yet again i fuck up another friendship. This one sucks coz she thinks im something im not and as a lot of people think it and with what happened, she thinks it. But I should be able to change that for the best in future when I start sorting shit out. Whilst I am doing that I need to defend myself and will.  I want people to see me as something I am, not what they think I am."
2978,isfj,"I have just had a nice chat with a friend and her daughter. Lost her husband just over 2 weeks ago. Had a chat about their situation said a little of mine and got some clarity. Life is too short. You only have one shot at it. I am going to prove to people i am not what they think i am. I dunno how, but I will find a way. Its hard getting opinions changed of you that people have made their minds about. The good thing is these friends who just lost someone they love know me and know what I did wasnt intentional which helped.
I will also going to quit my job tomorrow i think. Bullshit happened this week that I shouldnt have to deal with. 
Also culling facebook friends too. People who I think dont have a good opinion of me are gone. Some related to this other situation."
2979,isfj,"I was also thinking of cutting ties with EVERYONE and starting fresh too. If what I want to happen tomorrow happens, I think deleting facebook, creating a new one with contacts, changing my mobile number and forgetting everyone in the past may be a good thing. Last resort though but starting fresh like that could be another option.
Only problem with that is I need to clear my name. I hate what people call me and think of me. Its not true so if I do that I cant do the above.
Be interesting to see what a specialist says."
2980,isfj,"Im so close to going to the police over this incident i was involved in. I know it wasnt intentional on my end but leave it in their  hands and take responsibility for my actions
Ill keep you informed of my progress in the future. In the long future i wanna help other people if these posts help them then good.
Thanks for the advice. "
2981,isfj,"so i had a great view of how my si works,it usualy comes out more when im a bit stressed as iv noticed in myself,and this guy that i know well made a strange reaction to a joke i made,and somehting in me was telling me something,all of a sudden three past evens just came together to give me that insight that he wasnt happy at the jokes i made,so with si,all past experinces are connected in a web,and each point of the web when it ripples throughout the rest of the si web,so hes reaction seemed slightly off,because in the si web,i already saw that same reaction when he was angry or pissed,make sense?"
2982,isfj,Hey there ISFJ's! Looking to find out how you would flirt with someone you like or how you would show you like them? I think this girl I work with at the pet store likes me but I can't be entirely sure. If you could put your gender too that would be helpful (maybe guys and girls flirt differently even between the same type?) 
2983,isfj,"Talk to them like anyone else, and gauge interest.  Takes practice and embarrassing yourself a few times to get more comfortable.  Enjoy the journey and don't put too much thought into the outcome of the interaction.
Male ISFJ here, on my way to becoming more extroverted."
2984,isfj,"I can't speak for female ISFJ's, but when I flirt, I display my attraction through touch (hand on their arm/shoulder, thigh/knee).  
Just gotta get through the small talk and find common ground and see if you can get them engaged.  If they aren't, don't force it.  That's how you get labelled a creep."
2985,isfj,"While Se sees data points of ""this surface is brown, it's hard, it is about the size of my ass, it has a perpendicular piece attached to the back,"" Si is creating a reason for why Se is seeing these things. The reason being ""the object is a yew chair"" and attached to that is a model of what a chair is(a supporting structure comprised of a hard base and a hard back). While Se is observing ""brown and hard, and has a certain pattern on the surface"" Si has summed all of these properties up by labeling the thing ""yew wood."" Similarly as much data as Se takes in about the structure of the object should relate all back and be explained by the fact that it is a chair."

Keep a tidy mental library
What I already see and know is the easiest way for me to develop an opinion on something.
What is different?
over-concern with realistic experience in order to repress unruly imagination
"
2987,isfj,"I think I agree for my personal experience. 
I used to believe I had aphantasia because I couldn’t look at a memory or mental image and be able to answer things like “what color was the chair?” I realize now, it’s because the key thing I’m aware of is the impression of chairness it left on me. 
So when I’m reading a book describing something, I’m not seeing a movie being played out with all the sensory details. I’m kind of sensing the impressions the character has about their surroundings. If I had to draw that scene, I would have to sound out the exact sensory details-try out different colors of chair until one had the right impression. "
2988,isfj,"Ooh this is really interesting to me because I also have aphantasia -- or at least, I think I do. But maybe that's just a way strong Si manifests itself? It would definitely make sense. I wonder how many other Si doms lack a visual memory/imagination.
I have a friend who's INTJ and also has aphantasia as well as a similar disorder (the name escapes me at the moment although I'm pretty sure it also starts with A) where she doesn't have any imagination at all, visual or otherwise. The fact that we share aphantasia but not the other thing makes me wonder if my ""aphantasia"" is more just a manifestation of a very strong preference for Si.
It's interesting too because Si is so often associated with memory. I actually have a very good, detailed memory -- I just don't remember images. Like you said, I'm more likely to remember an ""impression,"" and I often bring memories to the surface by remembering other things I associate with the thing I'm trying to remember. I do this unintentionally and automatically.
I've often thought that I have synesthesia because I associate everything in life with colors. In my mind, every person has a color. So do days of the week, classes when I was in school, tasks I have to complete at work, etc. There's no rhyme or reason to which color my mind associates with these things (at least that I can identify), but it always does, and these associations act as sort of a mnemonic device and aid in memory. For example, if I'm trying to remember when a deadline is, and I see orange, I know that it's due on Thursday because my brain associated that deadline with the color for Thursday and that's how my memory stored it. I'm now wondering if this isn't true synesthesia but rather another manifestation of strong Si.
Sorry for babbling 😅 Lately I've been really trying to wrap my brain around Si and get a better grasp of how it manifests, and you've given me much to think about!"
2989,isfj,"Babble away, it's my favorite thing when people try to explain their thought process at a more vivid, exacting level than the typical descriptions. Less- ""draw connections between"" and more ""my brain rummages through a cupboard in the kitchen of my mind palace."" 
​
We might pose this question to the subreddit at some point! I am very curious as well. My first instinct is that more visual oriented Si doms might have more visual impressions of stimuli, and therefore a good visual memory. Of course, not being one, I can't confirm. I'm better with sound and touch. What about you? 
​
I think, related to the idea above, that Si dominance might look a lot like aphantasia depending on how your brain is put together. 
Like you, I have a pretty detailed memory and bring up memories by related memories. From the things you said above, it seems like you might also have a kind of ""nowhere"" sense of these things. I read a description of complete blindness: when you close one eye and not the other- it's what you see in that closed eye. I feel that's the medium where I process the memories, symbols, things associated with one another. 
The things I encounter in life are kind of like a fingerprint impression left on my brain- not the stimuli themselves. And the fingerprints can overlap to form a kind of gut impression of the item. In the liminal space of the ""nowhere"", these things can easily be located and present themselves reflexively when a link appears between them and something in the world. Ugh, that might not make sense, but it was a good faith effort. 
​
Cool as shit. Maybe that's Si dom thing, we should ask the sub about this too!  
I tried to do what you said- think about days and deadlines and see what happened in my brain. I think the closes thing I get beyond the nowhere sense is a kind of ""taste""  being held on the tongue. The taste of mondays, certain numbers, songs. I think that's a lot less synesthesia and more neuron bs. :P 
​
Anyway, thank you for giving me some fascinating things to think about! And a great discussion question for the subreddit if I can get around to asking it hah
​
​"
2990,isfj,"I'm definitely better with sound. I can remember the sound of a person's voice much more easily than I can remember their face. I'm also a very musical person and can remember the lyrics to a song after just a couple of listens. I can easily entertain myself by playing the ""radio"" in my head. Also, my dreams are mostly sounds and voices, not images.
I'm definitely a very tactile person too. I also find that scents are very closely tied to memory for me, but I think that's true for a lot of people.
Yes, this is exactly right. It can be really frustrating at times, honestly, because I KNOW that my memory or intuition is correct, but I can't articulate why or where these impressions are coming from. So people (understandably) sometimes think I'm talking out of my ass because I find it difficult to explain the ""how"" and ""why"" of the things I intuit.
I spend a lot of time in an online community dominated by NT types, and I find it fascinating because I'll often come to the same conclusion as an NT friend (particular xNTJs), but they're able to articulate the ""big picture"" aspects, the cause and effect, which is something I struggle with. I can say ""This is how things are"" but I have trouble saying ""This is why things are this way, and it will lead to XYZ in the future."" Which I guess is really the hallmark of the N/S divide.
No, this makes total sense to me and I think you phrased it really well. That gut impression is something I can totally relate to. I'm wondering then if that's sort of the difference between Si and Se -- would a Se dom have a more detailed memory of the stimulus itself, rather than the ""impression"" the experience left on them? My dad is ESTP and I've talked about this with him before. He said his visual memory is so strong as to be overwhelming at times. He's also a musician and has excellent muscle memory; he can pick up a guitar and play a song note for note that he hasn't played in years, but he struggles to remember lyrics."
2991,isfj,"Sound oriented buddies! Same here with the radio. It kind of never turns off, and sometimes it’s super loud. 
I’d love to hear your experience existing for long periods in NT environments! NTs kind of dominate my hobbies too. I have to admit I retired to /isfj from the NT dominated /mbti because it wasn’t my scene :(
I think I agree basically with how you characterize the N/S difference, but with nicer words lol. I think S is perfectly able to explain causality, but on a more granular level. All the steps between the cause and effect are accounted for instead of leapt over by instinct- so it takes longer, and S types tend to stop sooner in the stair than N types who can take 12 at a time. I think that if an S type cares to, they can and do reach N type levels in that “why and what next?” kind of thinking. 
Side note, I think the intuition of S types works to point them in a vague right direction, but they just don’t believe it enough to express until they work it out step by step, unlike Ns who run with it! 
Woah, I feel like I might finally understand Se on more than a “they see sights and smell smells” kind of level. Just got to confirm that idea somehow, ask some ESTPS (I know none hahh). Maybe your ESTP is able to play songs and see thing he’s seen before because he know the stimulus so well on the outside of his finger tips and the part of the eye/brain that sees things. I suppose lyrics would be more internal because words have to be processed from sound to meaning...
Can I say as an ISFJ that I love how you had the idea, and then immediately backed it up with a story of a friend? I do that all the time. Like, it’s not enough that I think this- I have a friend who can confirm, here’s their number. "
2992,isfj,"Hear me out here. I think it has to do with a few things: if I really like something, I've done my research and have determined that it's the best option for me at this time. Then I think it's also just good old fashioned sensitivity. 😅 Anyone else?"
2993,isfj,"Yeah it often feels like a personal attack on who I AM because I don’t soften feel super attached to those things. It’s almost territoriality. I too read a lot about what I like 
Edit: often, not soften "
2994,isfj,"it used to bother me and i'd spend time to figure out why that something else is better or how i missed it. often it'd be people talking out of their ass.
so now i have become indifferent towards the comments. its kinda sad because it's making me closed toward certain experiences."
2995,isfj,"I think so. I used to be a lot more insecure, like it was crazy just how insecure. Anyways, a few years ago a lot of my friends would tease me for my interest in dubstep/EDM. It's robot music, they'd say. It has no soul. At the time that really hurt me, because I trusted them enough to share songs with them, so I became really closed off about my interest in it (and also quite obsessive). When I was in the car with them I tried to play other music, suggested they play theirs even if I hated it... Etc.
Nowadays I don't really care what people think about EDM in particular. I love it and have built up a little shell, I think, so comments can't hurt me. It helps that some of my other newer friends who I hang out with more regularly actually enjoy it too! But for the interests where I haven't yet built up the shell, I think I'm a lot more liable to get hurt."
2996,isfj,I’m like that now and it’s awesome because I get to be a weirdo at festivals. I love going by my own and finding people like me. But now my bf wants to go and I’m scared because he doesn’t know my edm side lol 
2997,isfj,I’m dating an ISFJ and they’re great. One of the better relationships I’ve had they’re so sweet and communicate pretty well in person. I started out having to ask most the questions but they’re opening up and feeling more comfortable sharing their thoughts now which I know is a special thing for them. My issue I’m having is as an ESFJ I have a very large social group. I wake up to many text messages from friends and I talk a lot to people over text to fill the hole when I’m not being social with someone in person. But I never get texts from my ISFJ the one who I would love to text me and ask how my day is going. All my past relationships they have texted a good deal. He will respond over text pretty darn quick but it’s never a full on conversation. And so I have to wait until I see him in person to have those. Is this something you all do? Or another thing I have to wait for? How can I go about letting them know I want to more text communication without seeming obsessive or clingy. 
2998,isfj,"Just want to preface this by saying this is anecdotal.  This will be hard, especially if he is very introverted.  I personally behave the same way as the person you are seeing and I am generally uninterested in engaging in text messaging.  For whatever reason, I engage more over facebook messenger, google hangouts, discord, etc, but that aside; I don't feel compelled to nor do I enjoy engaging in constant communication with anyone; I like having time to think to myself and live in my own space.  I sort of force myself to engage in lengthy conversations with my SO a lot more than I would like to, just to make them happy but sometimes it wears me down.  "
2999,isfj,I think it’s very common for ISFJs to feel like they’re being intrusive if they initiate communication. If you mentioned this in much the same way you put it here (“hey I’d love to hear from you more often”) I’d bet you would get a positive response. Sometimes being direct with us is the very best way to get us to understand.
3000,isfj,"I’m ISFJ and I absolutely love texting and could do it all day with someone I’m interested in. So I guess it just depends, perhaps if you let them know how happy it makes you when receiving a text from them. "
3001,isfj,"I recently took a personality test and am blown away by how accurate some of the descriptions for ISFJ's are to my own life. Growing up, I always wanted to be a doctor but, after not getting into medical school and struggling to enjoy my job in an emergency room (way to stressful of a work environment with burnt out workers), I really don't want to even go into medicine. I have a 4 year degree, am 23, and have a supportive family. I am struggling to decide what I want to do, because I have so many interests! How did you guys determine what jobs you wanted to do?"
3002,isfj,"I'm the opposite- I have very little interests. I have never been able to keep up a hobby. I find myself losing interest when I don't see any immediate improvement and then it just becomes a chore. Growing up, I never knew what I wanted to do. I'm 25 and graduate soon and I still don't know what I want to do.
When I graduated high school I wanted to take a year off school to try to figure things out. Have some sort of job in the meantime. When my mom (ISTJ) found out, she threw a fit and pretty much forced me to go to college. I spent 3 years in community college, and then another 4 years in state college. I've changed my original major from one type of art into another type of art, and a year or two ago I began to hate making art- something I once loved doing. I fell into a deep  depression over it. It didn't help that I was nowhere near as good as my classmates, and I didn't care enough to put in the time and effort to improve. After I get my degree I am not going to make art for a long time, if ever again. I am minoring in Psychology (a subject I actually love) and that's my last class this semester. I finally broke free of that depression because I am no longer making art. That's how much I ended up hating it.
Right now I have a clerical job. My dad works at the company and was able to get me in. I like my job a lot more than I like making art projects. I honestly wish I just got some sort of certificate in office work but of course the entire world thinks office work is the most boring thing in the world so I always thought that was a bad thing to do because everyone is always saying ""who wants to sit in a cubicle all day?! go out and liiiiive!!"" After I graduate, I'm probably gonna look for a similar job that pays more. I just feel like I wasted 7 years of my life though. Thank god I was lucky enough to have enough financial aid to cover everything!
Sorry for turning this into a novel...
tl;dr I majored in something I thought I loved but I ended up hating so much to the point where I got depression over it, during all of that I got a clerical job that I love despite most people thinking those types of jobs are boring. Plan on staying in clerical work for now.
I don't know what advice to give you, seeing as you already have your 4 year degree. But I'd just try applying to any jobs that look interesting and that you qualify for. If you end up in a job you hate, maybe try searching for a better one (but before quitting the present job, of course). It's hard to get a job nowadays unless you have experience and/or know somebody, so just apply everywhere you can. Good luck!"
3003,isfj,"I was halfway through my Bachelor's degree for pre-med when I realized that I would never get into medical school and I wasn't sure if I would even be able to complete med school. Looked into pharmacy, but it seemed so boring so my guidance counselor suggested nursing. Only took 2 years to get my nursing degree and I'm happily enjoying the 12 days out of the month that i actually work (Three 12-hour shifts a week is fully time). 
But if you're done with medicine, I wish you luck on your search. "
3004,isfj,"I can understand where you're coming from. When I started college I was in Electrical Engineering, and while I enjoyed the theoretical aspect of it, the more exposure I had the less I wanted to do it. So I did a complete 180 and switched to History, which I had always enjoyed but never thought of pursuing academically . Now I'm teaching at a middle school and absolutely love what I'm doing. "
3005,isfj,Hey I was just like you! Actually I was an EMT and a firefighter to be. Did not like it so I just went back to school. Decided I still liked helping people so I just picked psychology. Now I'm thinking of human resources but still fully undecided. Good luck to you! 
3006,isfj,"I'm a translator and got my inspiration from a talk by one of my college lecturers about what it was like to work in the industry. Even the difficult parts sounded good to me, so I sat in on a couple of Translation Studies tutorials to get a feel for it. I'm now in my 6th year of working in the industry and still enjoy it."
3007,isfj,"Logged out of reddit, saw this, and had to answer it.  I'm currently pre-med, and though I don't really think I'll be working in the ER (though it's a possibility - I've seen my own family members' lives saved in the ER & through EMS, so part of me feels like I want to repay that) I definitely want to do something in a medical field to help people.  I've considered becoming a therapist before, because mental health interests me, but I'm not sure it would be the best career choice for me simply because I feel like I would take my work home with me, and that's probably not something you want to do if you deal with those kinds of heavy issues at work.
Too many interests is often a curse and a blessing - I feel like we as ISFJs tend to pick things up quickly but then have trouble sticking with them for a long time.  Have you ever looked at consulting?  Or a career that involves some amount of creative problem-solving?  I've heard that consulting is basically on-demand problem-solving in a professional setting, so there's the stability of a paying job but enough variation to keep you interested in what you're doing and not have it turn into a chore."
3008,isfj,"I tell everyone I want to go into local politics or medicine or something but really I want to be a police officer. I know it is dangerous but fuck it, we need police officers and if everyone decides ""Police work is dangerous, I don't want to do it"" then where will all the police officers come from?"
3009,isfj,"I thought about going into the military, being a nurse, an accountant, a teacher, a counselor...just never felt I did well enough in high school to pursue any one of those paths. Not going to college minimized my options. "
3010,isfj,"That's awesome! I've always been interested in teaching but never felt strongly enough to drop being pre-med and be an education major. I'm glad you love your job! I want to end up at a job where I love what I do, rather than dreading having to go to work. Thanks for sharing!"
3011,isfj,"I have great respect for those who work in the ER and thrive in that environment. It just isn't for me. It's been a wonderful opportunity, and I am grateful for my time there. I am, however, ready to do something else.
I have never considered consulting before. I'll have to look into it. More than anything, I just want to have a job that I truly enjoy. I am also considering PA school. Good luck on your pre-med endeavors!"
3012,isfj,"Hey everyone,
I was just curious to know what type of jobs do fellow ISFJ's have? Do you think it works with your personality type or not and did you primarily choose your job so that it would suit your personality?"
3013,isfj,"My ISFJ GF works in an assisted living facility, currently dealing with financial matters and on track to manage nurse scheduling for a new program there.  She's an old soul and likes to care for people but prefers not to directly interact with clients so those positions fit her well - she gets to interact with residents but does most of her work behind the scenes."
3014,isfj,"I’m a manager and there are aspects that really hit my ISFJ wants well and aspects that don’t. I have 4 people under me and I work closely with developing them and helping them grow in their roles. Seeing them succeed speaks to my helping nature and I love doing all that I can to support them. The other part of my role - interfacing with stakeholders and having constant interaction with my superiors REALLY drains me. It’s nice being able to have a lot of influence, but being the spokesperson all the time is tough. Overall, I like it though."
3015,isfj,"I suck at this. I worked few times in warehouse and I was salesman couple of times. Currently working in bike shop with all SPs and NTs. 
I wish to have create my company someday but my school sucks and I a pretty much stuck."
3016,isfj,"Still in school.  I'm currently in a program for engineering - I have a number of career goals (remember that it's always possible something won't work out, so have other things in mind!) Engineer and nurse are my top two, but if something doesn't work out in either one of those fields... I'm willing to do almost anything else that pays decently and allows me to either learn more, or help out others!  I think I'd make a phenomenal secretary.  Some part of me wants to be a lawyer, but not too sure about my arguing skills?  If I somehow end up in a bad place in life by the time I'm old enough to get a career, I just wanna say that I'll be happy to have any kind of job :)"
3017,isfj,"Retail, I work in the backroom and I definitely belong there! Seeing progress in accuracy and setting clean standards/helping “visitors” find product makes me happy. But I’m also a cashier at another very, very busy store. I hate it, but have been enduring for a few months to make ends meet. I don’t know how much longer I can go on~"
3018,isfj,"I have an engineering degree and work as a scientist for a small company. It was terrible at first because my boss would have vague expectations for me and not provide any support. I wished desperately to just have a boring, easy, predictable job. But, nowadays I've settled into job responsibilities that I like. For example, I deal with international shipping for my company, involving tons of paperwork, and making sure details are correct and organized. I find that boring kind of stuff fun and satisfying"
3019,isfj,Ive been in an open office for computer science programmers/testers (software QA tester is my job) for two jobs in a row and havent had a problem since theres no drama and people keep to themselves unless they really need you or hang out in break room
3020,isfj,"Preface this with this.  I'm an INTJ, therefore I analyze and analyze and analyze everything.  BUT, I'm also a complete moron when it comes to reading and understanding someone's emotions and social queues.  Therefore, I get frustrated analyzing these things because I don't get it.  So yeah, there's that.
Anyway.  At work, there is a lady, mid 20s, single mom.  I'm in my mid 30s, married dad.  I'm an INTJ, she's an ISFJ (I remember because we did one of those company exercises where we took the test).  Over the years, we've developed kind of a ""frenemy"" relationship.  Friends but playfully antagonistic with each other.  We talk mad shit and hate on each other all the time, but it's all in good fun.  Years without any hurt feelings that I can tell.  At company outings we usually end up hanging out, etc.  There has never been anything romantic or sexual between us.
Out of the blue this week she has all but completely stopped talking to me or acknowledging me.  If I say 'hi' or 'what's up?' in passing I get a flat 'hi' and she keeps walking.  I popped over to her cube with a quick, ""Hey are you doing OK?""  She says she's fine.  ""You sure?  You see a little off.""  Yep, she's fine.
I'm afraid that I've unintentionally done something to upset her.  It's a friendship that I value and I want to make it right.
How do I approach this?  Do I just give her space and not engage?  Do I give it the old, ""Hey, I think I might have made you mad and I want to say I'm sorry?""  I don't know.
Since this is at work, I'm a little worried about getting an HR beef.  But it's my friend, and I want to fix whatever is broken."
3021,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I often prefer to be non-confrontational. To a fault actually. So maybe that’s what’s happening with your coworker. If something did come up between you two and it upset her, if she’s anything like me, it might probably be that she feels that she wants you to address it first. Not specifically because the blame is on you or that she wants you to fix it because it’s “your fault”, but just because speaking up about it just doesn’t feel right and might cause turbulence. Like she might come off as too aggressive or rude if she calls you out and that you’ll be off-put by that. 
Going and saying “Hey, just wanted to clear the air, is there something I did or said that put you off?” can be a start to discovering why that hard behavior started in the first place. It also would be extremely valuable to say that you feel that the friendship is important to you and that you feel it’s worth your time to maintain/mend it. ISFJ’s need a lot of positive feedback and we can’t put ourselves in the vulnerable place enough to express that we need it. "
3022,isfj,"ISFJ married to an INTJ here. Do you recall your last few conversations before she stopped talking to you, and what were they about? 
Does she have a decent understanding oof INTJs? If not, you may have said something that you did not intentionally mean to hurt her and she took it at face value.
Regardless, I recommend talking to her or writing her a note or something that just says, ""Hey, I think I have done something to hurt your feelings and if so, I am really sorry about that. I miss chatting/hanging out with you. Let me know what I can do for you."""
3023,isfj,"Just a thought, maybe there is something going on in her personal life and/or she isn't feeling social. I'm an ISFJ and sometimes even after a day where I talk a ""lot"" with a co-worker and feel like I bonded with them, the next day I'm not up for socializing for whatever reason and I barely talk to them at all. It's nothing personal on my end. 
Don't know if this is what's going on and I know sometimes people won't tell you the truth when directly asked, but if she says nothing is wrong (and you truly have no idea of anything you might have done to bother her) maybe just take her word for it. 
Good luck :)"
3024,isfj,"Yeah I think there are two potential possibilities
1. You did something to unintentionally upset her and she doesn’t know how to talk to you about it  (because ISFJs don’t usually feel comfortable with situations that can lead to conflict). Which in this case you should say something along the line of  “I want you to know that I value our friendship highly and if you are upset about something please come out and tell me”. Also don’t be super pushy and agressive about it, that can make us want to withdraw from you even more. 

She is just overwhelmed having a lot of issues in her personal life and she is just having a bad day.

3025,isfj,"Every ISFJ I know goes all out for Christmas. One of my younger sisters (age 15) video chatted me yesterday wearing Christmas themed socks and pajamas...while holding a snowman mug lol She apparently led the house decorating and pretty much put the whole tree up. 
My dad's gf is also an ISFJ and she legit did up his house in Christmas lights and put a tree up. He hasn't done that in 8 years!!! 
Do ISFJs who celebrate Christmas often love Christmas? Maybe holidays generally that you often celebrate? "
3026,isfj,"Not really, I don’t look forward to holidays that much and keep them low key. One thing I have heard about ISFJs is that we like tradition, and that seems to be true for me, despite my not really caring about the holiday.  There are a few small things my SO and I do every year and those traditions bring me comfort. "
3027,isfj,"I don't particularly care for holidays so I can't say I look forwards to Christmas. My family is quite small on this side of the world so celebrating it isn't as exciting as I thought it would be when I was younger. That stance has stayed the same over the years as I've had to work on Christmas during the holidays and it's never made me feel like I was missing out. 
I also grew out of asking for presents fairly early on and I just see Christmas and holidays as an excuse for people to get together or splurge on close people in your life. I can do that anytime during the year, so why force yourself to go out and deal with the huge crowds of people at this time of year?"
3028,isfj,"i really like Christmas, it has always been that tradition I can look forward to at the end of the year. My mom is an ESFJ, so she really likes Christmas and goes all in for it. I'm still young so I just go with the flow around here during Christmas times, but yes , I really like Christmas.  it is the holiday where we should help and spend time with people you love, and those who are alone and those who need help. it is the time when you give people gifts, and I really love giving gifts. Receiving gifts? That's nice as well, but not primary for me. "
3029,isfj,"I'm actually not super into holidays - I don't decorate my place, I don't dress up for Halloween, etc. I don't really like all the commercialism. However, funny enough, I do like picking out gifts for people! My bank account doesn't like it, but I do. 😊 I like Christmas because I usually go home for the holidays and see my family, and my mom decorates the place, but other than that I don't really care."
3030,isfj,"I like Christmas a reasonable amount on the actual day but I hate, hate, hate all the expectations leading up to it that trigger my anxiety really bad. I've always felt like the over the top gift giving tradition should just be for kids. 
But for some reason I've ended up having partners and in-laws who find it very important to give and receive large amounts of gifts. And if I don't mirror their excitement or do it ""right"" then it's disappointing to them. This is really really stressful and also doesn't make any sense to me. I'm an adult. I want to buy the things I want, not spend all my time returning all the crap my mother in law got me at Ross because she thinks I want off-brand athletic shoes that are a size too small. (???) I wish Christmas was easier for me. I really don't like the holiday season because I'm never allowed to do it my way unless I wanna hurt everyone's feelings forever."
3031,isfj,"I like Christmas, but definitely don’t go all out (or even out at all) for it. Maybe it’s cause I’m a dude and my mom (esfj) always forced me to decorate and me being a somewhat rebellious child always hated doing what I was forced to do. I could see myself doing a bunch of cool lights in the future though cause I always liked those. Don’t really care much for the decoration though. Our house was also always decorated in a cutesy way which isn’t my cup of tea so maybe that has something to do with it 🥴. Also I think I will do more gift giving in the future cause I do enjoy that part "
3032,isfj,"That makes sense :) I know SJ types typically like traditions so I wondered if that was part of it. 
Yeah both ISFJs I described really seem to love gift giving more. My younger sister is super intense about receiving anything fluffy though lol My mom (ESFP) is apparently now jealous of how much more intense my ISFJ sister is about Christmas than she is. My mom always throws Christmas parties so she seems to feel her daughter is somehow outdoing her. "
3033,isfj,"Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm, the rhythm of the street
Is shitposting allowed on /r/isfj?
Anyway, that song came to mind because in my opinion, it is a really internal, feelings-based way of being in tune with your surroundings. (not exactly though lol) 
I would recommend doing something and really thinking about how it makes you feel- your internal impression of the experience. The six senses sure- but your emotional response as well. Then, think about how you might have felt something similar in the past, and what is the same between those two feelings. especially if the emotional response is the same, but the situation rather different. "
3034,isfj,"Start noticing the tiny details and facts in your environment and then try and compare it against something you have experienced before. 
Start collecting facts about things you are interested. Try not to imagine what could be just try and understand it for what it is.
Take 5 minutes every day to be aware of your physical state and how you feel in detail. "
3035,isfj,"Dominant Si (ISXJ): I know how this works, how it was last week, and how I want it to be in the future. If knitting in that way helped the other person to create that scarf, I feel sure that I can do the same thing by learning the same stitch. I feel happiest when I hold tight to the things that are truly important and lasting in life, such as family, friends, and often, my faith. I find that interesting, but it doesn’t match my memories of what happened. Can you give me more details, so I can decide whether or not to accept it? I know if something or someone is different from how they used to be, and can tell you exactly what has altered. I highly value my past experiences, and find it hard to forget or move past things. I really love participating in local events, family traditions, and cultural things, because it makes me feel like I am part of a living past. I enjoy routine and like things to be predictable.
Auxiliary Fe (IXFJ): I know what is important to you, and can support you in it, provided it doesn’t hurt others. I’m not always comfortable taking sides. Can we talk about this and reach a compromise that keeps everyone happy? I don’t want to upset people, and I can easily fit into a group and make everyone feel wanted and involved. Your emotions can influence mine, so I am careful not to let too many people in. I want to take care of you, and protect you. You are so talented. I hope you know that, and how much I like you. I’m happy to serve, but feel better when I get how I feel off my chest and out into the open.
Tertiary Ti (IXFJ): I am interested in learning how to make things run more smoothly and efficiently. Please be as clear and concise in your explanation as possible, so the message isn’t lost in theatricality. I’m sorry, but I see a logical inconsistency in the statement you just made; may I point it out to you so we can talk about it? I really love thinking about my ideas (Ni) and experiences (Si), and analyzing them to see what meaning they hold for me, and why. I’m good at putting a name to what is happening around me.
Inferior Ne (ISXJ): I know that these two things are connected, but I’m not sure how. I’m sorry, but that idea is completely unrealistic. Can we stick to one idea, please? Hmm, the last time I thought something might happen, it happened; so maybe I can trust my intuition this time, too.

3036,isfj,"So apparently one of the main traits of an ISFJ is that we are super organized. I am 100% ISFJ, WITHOUT the organization lol. I'm 25 and have always been nicknamed ""scatterbrain"". My desks and lockers in school were constantly unorganized, my room always looks like a cyclone just went through it. Even as a baby/toddler, my mom would know which rooms I'd been in because there would be a little pile of toys wherever I had been sitting 😂. It doesn't matter how tidy I try to keep things, my surroundings always end up in disarray within days. 
That being said, I actually LOVE when things are in order and my anxiety skyrockets when my surroundings look like this lol.. but no matter how hard I try, I can't keep things tidy! Still holding onto the hope that it'll change someday but we will see haha."
3037,isfj,I don’t stay long with jobs I don’t feel passionately about and I don’t enjoy. I also leave relationship when I start to feel unfulfilled and unhappy and when I am betrayed. I’m not a doormat as they usually stereotype ISFJs.
3038,isfj,"can read or determine manipulation, stops caring when people abuses me or takes advantage of me, great at designing model for research ( yep i just got my bachelor degree in economics), perfectionist? can be at times"
3039,isfj,"Everybody has does this now and then but ISFJs I know seem to do this thing where they seem like they're listening but when addressed, will say that they didn't hear what everyone was talking about and it will need to be repeated. Aside from when you actually zone out, does this sound like ISFJ behavior? To listen but say you weren't? 
I'm not talking about eavesdropping either, but a conversation you're technically apart of."
3040,isfj,"Sometimes I can genuinely zone out. It's not me pretending to zone out I just honestly do. I think it would be strange to lie by listening then saying I hadn't listened only to make someone repeat it... 
Sometimes I do ask for clarification as I want to be completely sure I understand what was said. So I might hear something once but not comprehend it so I say ""can you explain that again, I don't really understand what you meant."""
3041,isfj,"Since I've started living on my own and working under the fairly serious pressures of college and what ever else it is I do, I think I've come to appreciate relief more so than pleasure for their own sakes. For the record, I've not just had a big exam or anything. I just see it this way; there's, for me, comparatively more pleasure in relief than there is relief in pleasure. I live such a busy and demanding lifestyle that I can never escape the pressure I put on myself. I see seeking out pleasure for its own sake just adds to the pressure since the time I have to relieve myself of that pressure is being wasted without result. That simply doesn't bother me though. In fact, I love this lifestyle. I'm always productive, a little on edge, and everyone around me constantly compliments my accomplishments, which is pretty awesome as an isfj. I feel like I'm living a worthwhile existence even though what I'm doing isn't super important yet, but that doesn't mean it doesn't suck. 
After doing informed reading and watching plenty of good resources, I've come to the conclusion that taking that much pleasure from relief is a sign of anxiety. Although, I would also like to point out that I do not suffer from anxiety, rather I simply crave such a lifestyle. Whenever I am not aware of that ominous pressure, be it just homework or getting somewhere on time, I feel stagnant. I love the concept of relaxing. I think I believe that I would love to just relish in the sweet completion of my efforts, but I bet the settling of my mind and life would leave me bored. I desire challenge. 
I guess I'm also a little curious if I'm alone in this or if it's part of my personality and something for us to commiserate in. I believe that you have to give a little to get a little and giving a little stress and time for a life I can look back on proudly seems pretty worth it. "
3042,isfj,"It's one of the two functions I have trouble wrapping my head around. How do you define your Si? The more details, the better for me though I understand you might not want have the time to go too much into those details.
Thanks in advance"
3043,isfj,"Hello! I just wanted to point out quickly that there was a similar post a week or two ago that got a few answers; this subreddit isn't that active, so you can scroll down a bit and find it fairly easily. 
I'm still happy to answer you and I'm sure other people will too! But since I just woke up and don't really have the brainspace right this second, I thought maybe you'd be interested in reading that other post while you wait on responses :) "
3044,isfj,"We have a ""Home INTJ"" on /r/ENTP.
He's really invested in the sub's life.
I thought it was a good idea to let behind like minded people and be the Home ENTP for another sub.
I chose you all. I already subscribed to the sub.
I'll be more of an observer, at first, and then you'll see me more and more in the comments.
I already came here for various purposes, but not just remain here and participate.
I need just to know how y'all feel about that, though : 
Is it a good idea ?
I don't mind that my reddit history is read. If you ever feel like I will never ever fit here, just tell me.

Just a bottom note for the mods : Flairs ? =) 
I think I can implement them myself if needed. You could just mod me with the fitting permission the time it's done, and unmod me afterwards. Win-win. "
3045,isfj,"Hi all!
Browsing around the INFJ sub I came across this personality test by Erik Thor. My first test ever was INFJ but after that I consistently tested as an ISFJ, but now I got INFJ again. Very curious what you guys get from this one!"
3046,isfj,"Used to always test as INFJ in my youth, now always ISFJ. This is the first ISTJ result I have ever gotten... but the T is by 3% and I hated the questions on this test so most of my answers were ""slightly disagree"" or ""slightly agree"" not hell no or hell yes."
3047,isfj,"I'm afraid I did not read that far - saw INTJ, scoffed and closed the page.
I just did it again now and got ISTJ which is probable as I have been borderline F/T as of late. This result shows that I am borderline N/S as well which I find hard to believe personally..."
3048,isfj,"ENxP, here.
I still wonder it myself. So much shiny crap that are obvious traps that a chose to poursue and stupid things I did for the love of fire and rocket science.
I know what people mean when they tell me life is a miracle. I just still wonder why I survived to natural selection. Or how my ancestors did."
3049,isfj,"Reminds me of a comment I read, ENTP was smart enough to make a homemade firecracker, but somehow forgot where he put it and managed to blow up his keyboard.
If you don't survive at lease all the experiments were entertaining right, what better way to live. 
I really do wonder how many of you guys have a homemade furnace in the backyard, you know for some causal smelting, are the blueprints in one of your NTP starter kits or something. lol"
3050,isfj,"I wished I could do some smithing myself. We all have some dead computers and some spare parts, just in case, though.
I know no xNTP in this world who isn't a finite technophile.
Maybe it has to do with how careless we're with our belonging. We all know it can sometimes burn or even make the battery explode. Dangerous but entertaining.
I call this the Michael Bay syndrome. Everything is cooler with fire and explosions."
3051,isfj,"You are all made scientist lol and the way your eyes light up when living so dangerously yet nerdy, I can’t imagine NTs any other way, if you weren’t “allowed” to experiment I think you would slowly curl up into a ball and never get out of bed, what the point.
I knew an ENTJ, he was a computer tec, and his daytime job was to repair laptops and desktops. Every time I would see him, I would notice a new cut, burn mark, or scar and as soon as I pointed it out, he would tell me a story explaining how he got it, mostly had to do with heat guns and other at home projects he was doing. You would think one injury was enough to get him to wear some type of protective gear. Lol    "
3052,isfj,"You know me so well. I just seen a video about prototyping. I think I need more of it in my life.
I have insomnia because I lack of that spark of insanity. I literally sleep until 12h because I can think of nothing that worth getting up.
ENTJs who do stupid things for gigs are best ENTJs.
I think those who don't are corporate managers, spending their whole life in planification. Brr.
Also, protection are for the weak ones. I find the perspective of being that stupid now kinda endearing. Seducing.
I was crusading against it my whole life, mind you. Never too late to learn about humbleness."
3053,isfj,"Funny you mention prototyping, my INTP is playing with his DIY 3D Printer right now. Can't remember the brand but it was around the $500 AUD mark. Countless hours of fun and endless possibilities, especially if you know how to make the blueprints yourself. 
Yeah I know, it is kinda endearing, the way you keep hurting yourself lol. "
3054,isfj,I feel lost. I've worked as a waiter which actually gave me a lot of life experience and now I work for a supermarket. I really want to upgrade my skills either going to uni or community college. I'm just stuck on which field to go in??? 
3055,isfj,"I would suggest going to community college and taking a bunch of different classes to figure out what you like. I did a bunch of trial and error, jumping from chemistry to nursing to graphic design and finally ending up in communications, but what I really learned is that at the end of the day I want to manage creative people. Whether it be in a production studio for film/tv company, or at a design agency, or what I'm doing now being a house technician at a theatre (tech theatre is another interest I found along the way). If I were you, I'd figure out what exactly I want to be doing all day (for me, it's dealing with people and the logistics they bring to daily routines) and then map that onto a field I'm interested in (which you can explore through cc/hobbies around town)."
3056,isfj,"Are you liking your supermarket job? I got a job in the pharmacy department and decided it was good enough to make a living. So that's where I focused my college studies, since I need a PharmD to ""move up"" in that department. If you are cool with where you are, you could major in business and try for upper management. My store manager makes six figures."
3057,isfj,"compared to some other subreddits this sub has a real simple feeling to it. I only recently added a logo and sidebar picture. I'm trying to think of a banner idea.
I want to start a temporary topic series where I ask what you guys' experience is with all the 16 types (including other ISFJs)
Other than that I'm trying to think of a way to make this place more active or bustling.
Anyone have any ideas?"
3058,isfj,"I think it's going to be tough because ISFJ population on reddit seems really low. I've recently figured out I'm ISFJ and was all excited to start engaging with the community.. hm. Oops. I'm far enough along in my development that I've moved past the Si-Fe insecurity (I'm 35) so the negative stereotypes don't bother me, but man.. I would like to help give the many Si-Ti looping folks more encouragement.
I barely know enough about MBTI or design/community to help out though. I could be a mod if you wanted?"
3059,isfj,I think the level of activity means that some of the secondary things aren't that important right now. Perhaps seeding some posts that others are likely to contribute to would drum up some activity and then building the 'extras' might make sense.
3060,isfj,"Maybe some recurring weekly community things?
Man, it's tough tying it to myer Briggs.
Ok. What about... The different sections of my Briggs character portraits? Personal growth from our flaws (like a self reflection thing), relationships, as parents, our jobs. Maybe like a day for each of those and a day for things we need support or advice on?
Designated days to get people to share and talk and connect might make this community for alive."
3061,isfj,"I don't see the whole ""so you've received an isfj unit"" or the ""isfj care manual"" stickyed to the top like it is in some of the other subreddits. I don't know if we even have one, but I've never seen one.
I think that would be cool. "
3062,isfj,"r/ISTJ has a thing where there's a weekly community thread about fun stuff that may/may not be related to MBTI (e.g. a post I saw once went like ""what kinds of posts would you usually upvote?"").  I think it's a pretty interesting way to get people to participate and for the members of the sub to get to know one another! We might also be able to find some trends with our personality type and it'll be a fun little experiment too :)"
3063,isfj,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/ISTJ using the top posts of the year!

3: ISTJ appreciation post

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ^^Contact ^^me ^^| ^^Info ^^| ^^Opt-out"
3064,isfj,"Hi, all. I feel weird typing this because I usually find these advice things really cringey, but here we go:
So I have an ISFJ friend who I thought I had great (platonic) chemistry with at the beginning of this year (we were basically best friends), but as we became closer, she slowly began to devolve into this little-sister type character. She would agree with literally anything I’d say and would never generate any meaningful conversation or contribute to anything with anything other than agreement.
Now, I can’t STAND yes-men. I need someone who thinks for themselves and stands up for what they believe in, which is who she was before this strange transformation. Because I was the main talker in our relationship, I decided that I’d shut up for once and just let her initiate conversation. We haven’t had an actual, meaningful conversation in two months. 
Because of this, I’ve been hanging out more with two of my ISTJ friends, and I know she probably feels left out, but I really can’t go back to the nodding and pleasing. Is there any way to get the person I originally became friends with back? 
TLDR: ISFJ friend is suddenly agreeing with everything I say; how do I get her to stick to her own opinions?"
3065,isfj,"The only relationships I am aware of doing this sort of behavior is in those where my opinion (I have felt) does not matter, and the person is just waiting for their turn to speak. 
​
For me it has to happen a few times, but I don't know about your friend. It may have happened once and she decided to just agree so she can't be judged. 
​
It could also be that the topics either don't interest her or she has too low of an understanding to say anything informative ((( fear of looking dumb)))."
3066,isfj,"I mean, I understand if it happens once in a while; everyone does that, and perhaps ISFJs more than others, but, say, if she says that she wishes it weren’t raining, and I say that I kind of like it, she’ll immediately give me some reason why she likes the rain. I mean, it’s so extreme. And she’s smart, too; I hope she’s not just shutting up in fear of appearing dumb."
3067,isfj,"So my theory is it has to do with our Ne seeking. We want to see alternatives/possibilities and stay open minded to alternatives (ie I hate the rain, but you make a good point, it can be nice sometimes). I think Fe comes into play here as well- we want everyone to feel good, like they’ve been included and heard. Then our Ti function being third - we are always second guessing our own intelligence. Outside of this, our Fi isn’t a valued function, so we do not hold very strong convictions (ie we can change our minds based on those in the room)."
3068,isfj,"With that example in mind I think it's less about looking dumb and more of wanting to stay close friends who, in her mind, agree about most things. I do this too, often, but I stick to my original viewpoint. And from reading below, yeah I really don't like debates lol. I do like exploring ideas though!!"
3069,isfj,"Mmm. On the contrary, I think the best friends disagree on everything but the important stuff. Keeps things exciting :D 
Also, while I think exploring ideas may fit once in a while, it’s rarely an actual discussion about ideas anymore; it’s just me disagreeing and her consequently agreeing. I’m not sure what to do (short of directly challenging any deep rooted beliefs)."
3070,isfj,"Haha, I don’t disagree constantly, and nor do I necessarily want to, but I’d like to disagree some, y’know. 
And interestingly enough, I did try disagreeing to stop the agreeing. It didn’t work, though."
3071,isfj,"You’re doing it right now! Jk. But seriously trying “disagreeing to stop the agreeing” is absolutely the opposite of what I would want after I started defensively agreeing with someone. 
I placate people instead of saying what I believe when I feel they don’t appreciate that my opinions are personal, deeply subconscious Fi that I am ill equipped to support in an unprepared for debate with Si and tertiary Ti. I agree when I feel I am not being given the benefit of the doubt. Or sometimes, I’m just sick of bickering every time I try to say something.
Edit: basically, 
Debate to Ti doms: Fun! My friend is a competent debater and we can banter. 
Debate to ISFJ: I am unprepared for this and my friend thinks I’m dumb. I’m going to hang out with INFPs instead."
3072,isfj,"Ah, I’m not sure I’ve conveyed the situation accurately. It’s not just that she agrees after I disagree, it’s that I can say anything and she’ll agree. There’s not usually any reason for her to be defensively agreeing, and when I began to intentionally disagree, it was gentle. It was more like, “I like the letter V more,” versus “the letter V is superior to the letter B; change my mind.”
And I apologize if it seems like I’m arguing here; I’m just trying to figure out how to make amends with a friend and it’s stressing me out more than it should. And thanks for the input; ik you probably have better things to do than give advice to random redditors and it really is helpful."
3073,isfj,"Thank you for your concern- It’s appreciated :) Anyway, I absolutely do enjoy responding to you on reddit- mbti is one of my favorite topics. I think you’re just trying to understand something. 
It could be that she’s being unreasonable. She could just be an oversensitive person who overreacts to provocation, or someone with no real convictions. That’s very much how it sounds from your description. 
But I feel that if you liked her at some point, it might mean she had convictions then. So that leaves this: she perceived the situation differently than you did. Maybe she felt attacked when you were just playfully debating something. 
It’s hard to say without actual experience of what happened as an internet stranger. I can only tell you what me and similar people would be thinking."
3074,isfj,"I think it’s less defensive, more loving. I’ve seen her really stand up to an ENFP friend about some opinion she had on immigration, and she was aggressive af. She has a pretty aggressive personality underneath, despite the outside timid-ness, and if she really felt attacked, I’m certain she would have raised her voice as opposed to agreeing with me to shut me up lol. That feistiness was part of the reason I liked her, but it seems that she’s closed it off from me."
3075,isfj,"From my experience of knowing other ISFJs (along with myself) I usually only save this aggressive side when it's something I'm REALLY passionate about arguing with.
If it's just something minor or something that is just going to revolve in circular arguments I just don't bother saying anything or at worst (but rarely) like the girl does: just 'agree' for the sake of stopping the convo.
So imo, seeing that aggressive side is something you're just not gonna see very often from an ISFJ lol. This kinda stuff will likely happen once in a blue moon."
3076,isfj,"

Reading - as I grew older I started getting more into non-fiction (especially medieval history lately).


Playing videogames - mostly story driven single player games, but I also enjoy fun coop games. I'm not so much into competitive online games (I guess this is a very ISFJ thing).


Watching movies - I used to watch a lot of arthouse films, now I stick mostly to tv series and easier stuff. But I plan to return to watching ""serious"" stuff once I'm in a better state of mind. The backlog is growing daily.


Traveling and seeing places and art I've read about. Obviously this doesn't happen often, but I made a promise to go out of my country at least once per year. It helps that I'm in Europe, so there's a lot of places to cover.

"
3077,isfj,"Cooking (and eating!), playing board and video games, casually hanging out with a small group of close friends, going on walks, the list goes on! Cooking is really enjoyable and pretty relaxing for me because it's a creative process that's also pretty procedural and scientific. The food at the end (usually) tastes yummy too and is a reward in and of itself. It's even better to do with a friend or SO. Smaller group interactions are fun because I enjoy getting to talk to my friends, but the smaller group makes things less chaotic. Walking around outside on a nice day can help take my mind off things. :)"
3078,isfj,"I'm big on hands on activities like cooking and knitting. I also really like lifting weights, hiking, walking my dog and reading. Most of my hobbies are things I prefer to do alone and one of the things I enjoy most about them is learning new facts and skills."
3079,isfj,"I love my me time, as does every introvert. But I really enjoy being with my best friend (or a potential SO) and family, not all the time of course. 
Video games, reading, daydreaming, watching movies/TV shows/anime, sleeping (very fun indeed!), and I really enjoy exercising & feeling great after my workout (sadly I haven't been feeling great afterwards lately)."
3080,isfj,"Travelling is my top 1, but obviously I need some money to do it... I love learning about different cultures and the diverse life styles around the world. 
In my everyday life I love watching good movies/series and going to the cinema. I like all kind of food so I enjoy eating and going to restaurants with my SO. Meeting with friends and playing boardgames while smoking some weed is a good plan too. Going to the beach when it's sunny and warm and becoming a lizard in the towel. Playing with my PS4. Being lazy around the house with my cat and pet him. Singing and playing the ukelele even if I'm not good at it. Sleeping the weekend's mornings. Great pleasures. "
3081,isfj,"Hello ISFJ's! I am a 17 year old ENFP male, and I've been talking to an ISFJ for awhile now, and we really hit it off well. I know I'm falling for her (admittedly a little too hard a little too fast), and I think she's falling for me (she's always wanting to talk to me on the phone and won't tell me who she has a crush on, constantly saying ""You don't need to know"" when I ask, with a little giggle).
So I guess I forgot to point out the fact that she lives far away from me. Very far. Hundreds of miles.
But today I messed up. I think I messed up really badly. She wanted to talk to me again like we usually do.. but I sort of pushed back a bit and resisted the idea. She was confused obviously as we have been talking a lot on the phone recently. I finally just told her I was afraid of what my parents might think if they found out I liked a girl who lived hundreds of miles away
(Side note: I really don't know why I'm so afraid to tell my parents anything that has to do with relationships. I guess I'm afraid of disapproval, or disappointing them, I really don't know. All I know is this happens every time. Maybe it's an ENFP thing)
I could tell she was upset by the way she was responding to me afterward. She started saying things like ""I get it."" and when I started to apologize because I realized I messed up horribly she shifted into saying things like ""I don't like making people sad either, I understand."" and ""It's okay it happens a lot""
I knew it was too late to backtrack at this point.. and when I asked if she wanted to talk anyway she shrugged it off saying she ""didn't really want to anymore."" I asked if she was sad or frustrated with me (obvious question I know) and she said she didn't know. I asked if she wanted me to leave her alone for awhile, and she said yes which really started to worry me. She said she hoped to talk to me ""in an hour or something"" but I don't know what will happen, and I don't know the extend of the damage I've done.
I'm kind of desperate for advice and feedback if anyone has any. Will she still like me? Is it over? What should I do to make sure she's okay, because that's what I want more than anything. I just want her to be okay. Even if that means she stops being with me."
3082,isfj,"I (ISFJ) can be easily hurt but I am very forgiving if it is some one I like a lot. Reiterate that you still like her and make sure it is genuine. She might be kind of insecure talking to you from now on. Although I can forgive people, I never forget the falling out."
3083,isfj,"Right I'm gonna be blunt here, you are 17, move on and find another SO.  Right now for the less blunt part.
My son's mother is an ISFJ  and she gets butt hurt easily and its visible for everyone to see, also she can be very stand offish and extremely defensive afterwards too. unfortunately, there is only 2 options, wait and see (which is never an option for an Ne dom, Our minds just work way too fast for this) or Move on. Due to having a child with her, I have no option but to move on in a slightly different way, ie.e wait for her to come around and then talk it all out, but during this time I'm away chasing butterflies and unicorn in cloud land (basically doing things to keep myself occupied)"
3084,isfj,"Thanks a lot for the response!
What specifically did you mean by insecure?
(By the way, update: She and I are talking again and everything seems okay. I just gotta be careful not to be an idiot again)"
3085,isfj,Glad you guys are talking again. :) I just meant that if I were her I wouldn't forget about the incident and it would always be in the back of my mind moving forward. Giving me some hesitation about opening up to you as much as I would have in the past.
3086,isfj,"Hey guys, new ISFJ here. Just joined. Saw online that there was a fairly large percentage of ISFJ's were female - I'm a guy. Just curious, how many lurkers here are guys? I find that most guys I know fall more as thinkers or intellectuals rather than protectors."
3087,isfj,"Male ISFJ here. I've never known many ISFJs in general (I am surrounded by mostly NTs and at times it's not very pleasant because of the fact that NTs and FJs are complete opposites), but the one or two I have known have been female, so welcome to the minority man. It's all good though. We're a good minority!"
3088,isfj,"It's funny you say that, I was already wondering that. This sub is really small in a MB category that is mainly women, while my friend's MB sub is much, MUCH bigger, and his is mainly men. So, probably, the fact that more guys are on reddit is probably why this sub is pretty small."
3089,isfj,"There could be other reasons too, I don't know your friend's type, but if he's intuitive that is probably a bigger factor, since the subreddits for the intuitive types are much bigger. One theory here is that intuitive people are more likely to be into MBTI than sensors, I'm INTP, and yeah /r/INTP is a lot bigger than /r/ISFJ. Another theory is that there are more initiatives on Reddit, which sounds likely in my ears as well. But there are big subs for feeling types as well, just take a look at /r/INFP for example"
3090,isfj,"sometimes I just feel a DEEP crave to control everything, the people around me...and tells them what to do and what they should do. then, when they don't do what I tell or suggest to them, then I get mad. I just want everyone to do what I want them to do.
this mostly only goes to my family, perhaps it's because they are the ones closest to me. 
and I want to stop it, I really do. but the urge to do this is so big that I really really have to pull myself together in order to not do this. "
3091,isfj,"... oh, me. 
I didn't realize other people felt that way. At least not how you're describing. 
I'm normally a really passive person. I'm a follower, not a leader, but sometimes I get a craving to be in control and boss people around. I'm usually ... Kind of an asshole when I get like that, too."
3092,isfj,"I've never seen this lowkey habit of mine so well described before? I kind of figured that this was just my little thing and other ISFJ's didn't get like this. But I do sometimes have this urge to tell people what I think they should do with their lives - talk less and pay more attention, study instead of telling me that they're stupid, etc. I try not to get this way in front of friends often because it's like I'll go too far and not know how to fix it, but at home I feel like I do this with my family members sometimes where I just want us to be ""normal"" instead of having our little flaws. "
3093,isfj,"Omg I'm so bad for that, especially when I think I know better.
""What do you mean you can't afford rent, I see your boyfriend on Facebook marketplace buying video games all the time!!""
It is never very well received, of course. But like the other poster said, I become kind of an asshole about it."
3094,isfj,"I was like this more as a kid but now I've mostly grown out of it. I've learned to not take to heart what people do with the their lives. I think it's because I grew up with a sister who tends to learn things the hard way and a family set in their ways. I've also seen how many times despite trying my best I make mistakes, I feel like I don't have the right or capability to control anyone's life. However if you put me in charge of a project, I will see it as my duty to delegate and take the lead."
3095,isfj,"Me too! Only with my parents!
It gets so bad, I think for them, think before them for them, I do things for them just so that things will go well(in my head). It's like an instinct, it's not that I think they're not capable or proper, it's like an instinct.. I too want to hold back and want to stop this behavior of mine, I am getting better at it..Sometimes, I feel ISFJs would make great personal assistants/secretary, especially if we love that person.."
3096,isfj,"Jeez are you guys in my head? Lol I try too hard to -fix- things because it's usually something that someone else is doing is really stressing me out, and they don't want to listen to any advice. I need to learn to not as you guys have said not to take it personal and not let them drag me into their bs. "
3097,isfj,"Yes I can, I’ve blamed it on being Aries. I try to appear more relaxed and laidback, but when I get close to someone I can be pushy or bossy unintentionally. I’ve always viewed it as a personality flaw "
3098,isfj,"Personally, I ABSOLUTELY hate it when others try to control me. So I try not to control other people. The only way I could see myself doing this is if someone is directly under my authority. But even then I'm pretty patient person and think it's more effective to be accomodating than controlling when dealing with others."
3099,isfj,"Just wondering how does temper/rage fit into this type? I usually won't back down from an argument with someone close but with friends/acquaintances and strangers i will. At home I can get very frustrated and loose my temper easy. Most of the angry outbursts stem from feeling unloved..wanted..or appreciated.
Edit: oh and I am very impatient"
3100,isfj,"I get frustrated very easily... But i can probably count the amount of times I've yelled at someone. That's not my style at all. 
I oftentimes get frustrated at whst others do (cheating of tests, being rude to service people) and I can rant for ages about it to my boyfriend... But I hardly go up to the actual people about it.
One time I saw someone being a dick to cashier and I went up to them, said ""That is extremely rude"" and walked away. 
When I was breaking up with my abusive ex, I am pretty sure I yelled at him. Or more just screamed out of emotional panic or something.
When I found out my dad wrote an article talking shit about my mom and it was published in our local newspaper, I called him up and said ""as soon as you can be as mature as me, your daughter, stay out of my life."" haven't heard from him since (5 years ago). 
While I admit I get frustrated and angry easily, I often do not take it out on the object/person that caused the anger. But I will boil over about it later on my own or to others.
I do not get angry from being ubloved/unwanted/unappreciated usually. I mostly get sad in those cases. Sometimes I do get angry at the world I guess, and will he all ""I don't need anyone else anyways!"" But that happens a lot less frequently now than it used to. 
As for arguments, I normally do not feel angry during them. Honestly I try to avoid arguments. They make me frustrated at myself more than angry, because I'm not good with speaking and get emotional too easily so I'm less convincing. But I agree, with someone I know we'll I'm comfortable enough to keep talking. If I disagree with someone I don't know well, I might not say anything at all or just think in my head about how wrong they are (imo). "
3101,isfj,The only time I was ever truly angry was when I was on birth control.. Never was I an angry or sharp person like that until I was taking it for a couple months. I full on yelled at my boyfriend at the time for laughing at me when I was trying to talk about something I felt to be really serious. I don't yell.. So I'm off birth control and am back to normal. I think this is a variance in ISFJ's because my ISFJ friend does exactly what's been described by gretay. If I'm angry about something it's because a person was awful to someone I love and I want to beat their face in a little but never would so i just imagine it in my head or think about what I'd say to tell them off.
3102,isfj,"Yes I get angry very easily. Only once or twice have I had to restrain myself physically and for good reason, like someone already hitting me or something. I only let myself get visibly angry around people I am close to, which is bad. :/ I get carried away easily when I'm arguing with someone and most of the time we're arguing about something completely different than when we started. I bottle it up though, so when it comes out everything comes out. I'm working on it, clashing with anyone at all ruins my day and I feel guilty for days after. :/ "
3103,isfj,"It really takes a lot before I become visibly angry. Unless someone is doing something exceptionally annoying or harming another person, I just can't get worked up over it.
Except once in a while, and this is the one that scares me, once in a while something that would otherwise not bother me triggers a cataclysmic release of blind rage. This only happens once every several years, like all the anger I should have been expressing in little bursts has been building and building, then gets released all at once. Though I'm not really sure if that is the case. I don't believe I hold on to anger like that. Maybe I'm wrong and it's some kind of subconscious thing.
So I guess I kind of have a temper. About once a decade. All at one time."
3104,isfj,"I don't/can't feel anger very easily. It just doesn't come to me. I'm much more prone to feel sad or disappointed. Anger just isn't a comfortable emotion for me, and I'm not even capable of really raising my voice and I don't recall ever having raised my voice. If others get angry, I almost always nope myself out of that situation. "
3105,isfj,"I always come in to this subreddit and end up going ""GOD DAMNIT STOP KNOWING ME SO WELL""
It's kinda overwhelming how everything just fits in :| 
I get incredibly easily frustrated, but I manage to bite it down very easily as well, there might be a shallow but hardly detectable snide remark towards a friend / over skype text to someone, but at worst I just tend to stop the conversations before it boils over on someone cause I don't feel like dealing with the results of me yelling at someone.
That is to say, it's more the case in the recent past like... 6-7 years (more or less since I became like 'proper' teenager, age 15 or so, I'm 23). Before that I was ragey, easily provoked, easily getting into fights and all that. I suppose I grew into being myself more so in my teenage years. 
That isn't to say I hadn't lost it at someone since then, but if that ever did happen it turned into more like mean hurtful comments through a calm exterior, never the full blown yelling rager."
3106,isfj,"Yes! I do this too. My cousin would in my mind mistreat my aunt (order her around to do simple things like fetch her drinks etc) and I would get so upset. I'd tell my aunt, ""no, sit down. You're her mom. She should not be bossing you around like this.  I will get her the drink."" (keep in mind my cousin has done this from age like 15 to 25)
I would get sooo angry. Or get angry because someone's mean to a cashier. 
But I often don't get angry on my own behalf. Just if I see others being ""abused"" (can't think of quite the right word). "
3107,isfj,"Do you like it? In what form(s) do you prefer? Does knowing the person change the level of touch? Do your preferences change with your mood? As being Si dominants, I was just curious as to how inclined ISFJs are towards touch and how it relates inward. 
Personally, I generally like touch. Handshakes, hugs, and pats from strangers don't strike any particular chord in me. The closer I am to the person, the more inclined I am to appreciate touch. Hugs are a solid choice. High-fives, fist-bumps, and secret handshakes make me feel closer to the person as well. I like having physical contact with introverts and extroverts though I appreciate introverts slightly more as it seems like they are more comfortable with you. 
Giving: When I see people down or sad, I use hugs and shoulder holds as a sign of caregiving(more with friends rather than strangers). If I know they don't like touch then I look for other outlets, but touch is a common default.
Receiving: When I'm emotionally exhausted or down, I long for someone to initiate touch and ideally I'd like for them to embrace me in a long hug or just let me have some sort of contact with them(head on lap, backside resting against them, etc.). I feel like I can't process negative feelings unless I have touch. When in a good mood, my wanting for touch is less, though I would still appreciate it!"
3108,isfj,"Physical touch is really important to me. Generally, I don't mind hugs, handshakes, or most forms of physical touch from strangers, unless they smell bad, or I find them to be creepy or something. :(
Physical touch is definitely an important factor in making me feel loved and appreciated, and I especially love getting hugs from people I'm close to and care about. 
As far as giving it, it really depends on the situation, for me. I'm typically a pretty shy person, and I'm conscious about not making other people uncomfortable, so I'm usually fairly hesitant about touching people unless I know they're receptive to it. That being said, I'm definitely a hugger, and I have made people uncomfortable in the past by hugging them when we weren't well-acquainted. I tried to hug my brother's girlfriend after he introduced us and she hung out for the day, and she really cringed away. Stuff like that makes me more hesitant in future interactions. I always love hugs, so sometimes it is easy for me to forget that not everybody does, and lots of people hate touching someone they're not close to."
3109,isfj,"Not a fan. Eye contact, handshakes, hugs... all of that makes me feel uncomfortable to some degree. Only person I feel comfortable doing any of that with is my s/o
When I was growing up, my immediate family did not really express affection physically, especially my mom. But I love her dearly, and I know she loves me. But expressing that through physical gestures was never really done. We do it through practical actions, like doing a chore for one another."
3110,isfj,"I love hugs! Not a fan at all of the kisses on the cheeks though. The human touch is really important to me and when it's lacking it also affects me. I'm also someone who sometimes touch the shoulder or less common the upper arm for more connection. With a handshake I often do touch the shoulder/upper arm.
The touching happens most of the times with female friends and acquaintances. Despite being a guy in male dominant city I still hang out more with girls than with guys.
I like giving massages as well. The physical touch while helping someone else at the same time gives me a kind of relaxing meditative experience. It are quite extensive massages though taking easily more than an hour."
3111,isfj,"I have been known to lay on my closer friends, and in a way them not pulling away is enough for me. They themselves are not necessarily ""huggy"" people, so it's usually me hugging them. With strangers I don't mind, although I am socially awkward and so it might end up being weird anyways."
3112,isfj,"Coming from the love language thread, it seems a lot of ISFJs are primarily or secondarily physical touch, including myself.
I love physical touch. I love hand-holding, cuddling, linking arms, leaning, anything innocent. The person definitely matters- some people I would only awkwardly hug and prefer not to touch or maybe a high-five would suffice, but there are people who I want to CUDDLE CUDDLE CUDDLE. And yes, mood also matters, but that's probably normal. 
When it comes to giving, I've already elaborated, but even if I'm not close with the person at all I find myself patting them on the back or something weird like that???"
3113,isfj,"I only like to give or receive physical touch from my mom and my husband. I guess I'll include my grandparents in there, too, even though they're no longer here.
I particularly love hugs from my mom and my husband. Whether it be just to show them I love them or to feel their love for me/a source of comfort if I'm upset. I always hold hands with my mom and I would hold hands with my husband but he hates it lol so I leave him alone ;)
Physical touch with other people makes me feel uncomfortable. "
3114,isfj,"When I was younger I use to hug everybody all the time. Friends, relatives, strangers on the street, I was all about the hugs. I was the person with the ""free hugs"" sign.  
Now, I am comfortable hugging my parents and my husband. My best friend forces me to hug her because she knows I hate it.  
I can't link the change back to a specific event, but it did happen over the course of a month or two maybe ~4-5 years ago.  
I use words/advice as a comfort to others as opposed to touch."
3115,isfj,"Whenever anyone touches me, my instinctive reaction is to flinch. I have to like, steel myself for hugs and try to cover my reaction to people touching my arm and stuff. I don't want to be like this ;_; I wish I was a huggy person who could easily express and accept affection that way. 
Did you grow up never touching anyone like I did? "
3116,isfj,"I am a bot. On behalf of Reddit, I would like to thank you for your honesty.
We live in harried times. Honesty is in short supply. That's why when you go out of your way to assure the Reddit community that your comment is honest, I, HonestlyBot, have made it my mission to thank you."
3117,isfj,"well i just cant help but put high expectations on friendships. When i sense a friend or a person doesnt want to put effort in nurturing relationships, then I leave them out because i can always tell if im being taken for granted or not. I can also sense if these ""friends"" want me or they just tolerate me because they don't want to hurt my feelings. If I'm not putting an effort into a friendship, thats because they sometimes leave me out or they are taking me for granted. I don't care (maybe) if i loose friends because of this, it's not my lost anyways, it's theirs.
I admit i can be nitpicky when it comes to friendships but hey who wants temporary friends? Im more focused on long term friendships"
3118,isfj,"Yes I agree! I pick apart my friends so much and held them to such high standards and I’ve began realizing it and hating it :/ because I then only consider them a casual friend rather than a “best” friend, (someone I’m suuuper close to). But like you said then again, why waste my time becoming close to people with some qualities I dislike? But no ones perfect obviously, idk it’s weird!! "
3119,isfj,"I dunno, I mean, I’m picky, but I don’t really think it’s a bad thing. I only have a couple friends, but I know they’re people who really enjoy my company and like me. Most of the time I’m alone, but that works just dandy for me as an introvert, especially when I’m forced to socialize most days for work. 
I just think, why shouldn’t I have high standards and want to be around people who genuinely appreciate me? I appreciate them just as much in return and tend to be very focused and overt in my affection, so I think it’s only fair. I would die for my best friend because we’re genuinely in harmony and I know that as much as I adore her, she loves me right back and she shows it. That’s the kind of quality of friendship I want, and I don’t think it’s wrong. 
So yeah, maybe an ISFJ thing I guess. I think our Fe gives us high standards for social behavior and thoughtfulness in others, honestly. We value social harmony and go out of our way to make others comfortable, so we want the same consideration in return. "
3120,isfj,"ISFP's dominant function is Fi, specifically Fi-
This is from a profile on the Fi of ISFPs:
I'm not saying you're mistyped, btw; there's no way to tell from one paragraph. Just thought it sounded like more of an ISFP sentiment."
3121,isfj,"Si-Fe clones Fi fairly well.  
Is not the same.   Leading Si - inferior Ne EASY to distinguish from lead Fi -inferior Te.  Not immediately but after a few weeks...........  ISFJ lacks inferior Te.  They will fiddle with something, ponder something about how it works, memorize procedure, Ti exposed.   Inferior Te will be more skillful if not master at such unless piqued.  Sure it can be sloppy but there might be more proficiency, if less curiosity per ""Thinking.""  Leading Si more concerned with subjective opinion.  Leading Fi more concerned with being valid.  Inferior Te will focus in and efficiently if sloppily and ruthlessly negate leading Fi, not caring who gets hurt.  Inferior Ne......""For so many ways and reasons I can't get anything right.""  Perhaps go chasing unknown thrills.  Very impatient with more mature or maniacal Ne.
Fe is a ""fake"" (my opinion based on my perception) function in that it is more concerned with perception or arbitrary code or rules than actuality.  More concerned with group seeming harmonious than tolerating, understanding, or dealing with an individual experiencing disharmony, labeling them ""false"" or ""wrong.""  Si-Fe can fake it till it breaks it but is very very different than Fi.
In OPs case her leading subjective perception of someone is piped through her Fe and if they don't make it through as ""quasi-valid"" she doesn't feel the urge to spend emotional effort on them.  Tertiary Ti strongly believes in VALIDITY THROUGH LOGICALLY BEING LOGICALLY LOGICAL AS VALID OR NOT.  Thus an easy decision to make. This is actually very efficient and I respect this ability.
My Fi-Ne will endlessly consider more how someone or inanimate objects feel personally.  How they match up with my feelings or values.  What it is like to be them.  Why they do what they do.  I am far less selective until I get burned.  I admire the ISFJ method.  However, my Fi is glad I am me. 
If I am wrong, I prefer to know how to be right.  If Si is wrong, thats impossible as it is SUBJECTIVE lol.  Can feel severe offense at suggestion.  I will feel, re Fi, severe offense towards destructive criticism or ignorance masquerading as reality, but ultimately if I am wrong I want to know.  It may need a little time to cool down but I despise few things more than gaslighting.  Si can almost self-gaslight as a matter of instinct.  I can self-gaslight as well, Si being my tertiary after all, but my aux Ne is a strong defense.  Wheras Fe supporting Si might amp up the self-gaslight. And Ti is hardly concerned with reality if the theory seems charming enough.  With inferior Ne screaming ""ENOUGH WITH ALL THAT NONSENSE, RIVERS OF NONSENSE I TRUST Si.""  
On the contrary, ISFP inferior Te will be like ""OK we have established nonsense on radar.  Seems like friendly game of TENNIS.  We shall NUKE FROM ORBIT TO MAKE SURE NONSENSE IS ALLEVIATED.""  8)  That is how my Te is, at least, and from what I've read ISFP Te-grip is no more polite or sympathetic.  Ne-grip........very..........terrifying?  
Sorry I have gotten carried away with the...metaphor.
Generally Fe hates my guts.  I am most thankful to learning about cognitive functions as learning about Fe is more of an eye opener than the couple years I spent obsessively trying to understand Te.  Fe makes me uncomfortable but valid people validly utilize valid Fe so I want to learn to fear it less, and how to coexist with those who prefer it, and respect it more.
edit #17:  Holy shit I just realized you have Si as your 4th.
Am I completely full of it here?  Would love to know if you feel any of my blather makes sense.  Si-grip seems terrifying too.  I have experienced Ne feeding Si.
Also consider ISFP has Se as aux.   Fi-Se rulez, Si-Fe droolz.  I mean no disrespect.  I know I am an idiot."
3122,isfj,"Oh wow, where to begin 😅
First of all I don’t think it’s productive to debate OP’s type. Since we’re both working with the same source material, which in this case consists of a small paragraph, there’s really no point in definitively claiming any one type over another. 
One important thing to be aware of is that all introverted functions are subjective. Si is subjective perception/experience, and Fi is subjective ethics. Objective ethics would fall within the domain of Fe: determining what is right/good/acceptable via group values/feedback. 
So this actually perfectly illustrates what I was talking about with regards to the the Fi of ISFPs vs the Fi of ISFJs. INFPs and ISFJs both use Fi+, the ethics of trust/forgiveness. So your sentiments make perfect sense for your type, and ISFJs’ Fi will operate similarly. Fi-, on the other hand, is the function of suspicion/distrust, and is the dominant function of ISFPs. Therefore, based on OP’s self-observation, ISFP sounds more likely; although, again, we’d need a lot more information to actually type her as such. "

3124,isfj,"I couldn't imagine life without my ISFJ wife. She's everything I'm not.
She's caring where I'm impatient . She's pragmatic where I'm ambitious. I bring her energy and vision while she tends to my wounds.
Key to all of this is implicit trust. She will follow my lead even when she can't see over the horizon, and I follower hers when my head is in the clouds. You don't need to see exactly what the other person sees when you trust them. 
We make one hell of a team. I've gotten more done together with her than I could ever imagine alone."

When things were good it was just perfect harmony, completely complementary, the real killer was when we let communication break down between each other, like ignoring her when she told me I was doing something she didn't like (or even using it to tease her), dragging her into arguments because I couldn't handle the silent treatment, shooting her down when she wanted to talk about her feelings or getting jealous when she spoke about her ex. "
3126,isfj,Yeah ENTP at first are pain in the ass because they often call you beta cucks but for some reason they stop insulting you and they might like you. Also I admire them that despite they are called shitfucks they are still pretty calm. If I was them I would already burst and start to insult back. I am not sure if ENTP would be great for dating. First off there is not much ENTP women and second I actually like SP girls ;)
3127,isfj,"Yeah, sad that so many other people do not understand this or are ignorant of it. Those who hate themselves can never understand Duality until they get how their stack works (how their brain actually works). Mistyped ISFJ pretending to be INFJ... Mistyped ESTP pretending to be ENTP... Annoying, illogical.
​"
3128,isfj,"Yes, I've struggled with acceptance myself. Insecurity is truly the matrix of the mistype and prevents proper interaction and understanding of other human beings. I blame the stereotypes from MBTI a lot for this too (i.e. every INTJ is a 420 IQ genius and every INFJ is a special unicorn)."
3129,isfj,"I understand your sentiment. It's may sound funny, but it's not much easier as ENTP (thought process can be too overbearing/direct/cold, nobody cares to listen to your ideas or they may steal them, you're nice but not really nice or too nice, true thoughts and concepts are weird or too out there) (end up having to soften yourself in society to be more presentable, but still considered a weirdo when you open up). Easy for ENTP to end up a socially unaware people-pleaser at times."
3130,isfj,"Also you add other Si users who will hunt you down for acting different. It isn't like only intuitives get their fresh shit from SJs. There is literally fight between SJs inside. ESTJ won't ever like me at first. Only when I start using my Fi inferior they are like start to like me because they also sucks with feelings but you never use Fi in daily basis because you were told to not display it. Despite ESTJ cannot even handle your emotions and actually comfort you at all!
MBTI is funny thing."
3131,isfj,"I think this is true. I only met one ESTJ, he mostly interacts with me to buy... things. Fi... I do not understand well enough (how it affects me, it is ""unused"" in function tests consistently). (though I did correlate it, nostalgia is my friend and enemy at times) (following a bit of information and finding something you've forgotten too, kind of triggers it, things ISFJs say trigger it too usually, no other type has this effect on me)."
3132,isfj,"ISFJ have strong Fe but opposite to that have shit Fi which it is opposite what Fi dom is. When Fi dom is like independence and emotional stability, weak Fi is being dependable on feeling department and being quite emotional inside. Yeah but ISFJ doesn't show much from it because Si is more dominant function and actually try to hide those imperfections. Someone one said that ISFJ is the most scared/worryhat of all types and that's why. Fi is on 7th position in function stack. 
I can give you example. I think my friend is ISFP. I literally vent some shit I have stored in myself. I can do it pretty easily because I know how to talk about feelings because of my strong Fe. He have strong Fi and shit Fe. So he probably doesn't even understood half of what I was saying to him. He used his Fi and Te to analyse what I said and he just said something that he understand me(Te)(Se) because he feels the same (Fi).  
Also I know you are disgusting ENTP and you actually learn from this meme conversation so go ahead xD"
3133,isfj,"Ah, that makes sense. This is why Fi doms have an easy time making you think they understand you, but they really don't at all (just agreeing). I read up on it by the by (mostly because I remembered 7th is ENTP position), Fi is 6th for ISFJ, 7th for ENTP, 8th for ISTP. Fi seems like the worst. I have minimal dealings with Fi people, but an INFP I know, is basically one of the worst human beings ever."
3134,isfj,Yeah Fi are good at balancing their emotions but they cannot communicate in emotion language. So they are literally cut from this communication at all or on some certain level they can understand. That's why my friend always was somehow surprised that I knew what girl was interested with me before approaching her. I just always said I just see her body language and just make decision. I am not sure how certain shadow functions works. I guess the deeper function is from 5th and 8th that means you more suck at it. Also some dudes like Chase said 8th function is gateway to demon personality. 
3135,isfj,"Ah, this makes a lot of sense. Demonic Personality Disorder is a form of pathological narcissism stemming from 8th function (explained in Beebe's work before, but I see it more clearly now). Fi seems to create NPD, if it's the 1st or 8th slot (Demonic Personality making the person get crazy unhealthy). I know what you mean (I have an ISTP friend that asks me how I can understand body language and intentions from words so well and things like that). So I see... Fi = feels emotions. Fe = recognizes emotions."
3136,isfj,"I was a very shy and reserved kid, and was often bullied for various reasons, my Tourette syndrome and general social ineptness being one. Nowadays I am waaaay better at socializing and can more easily fit into a group (although some groups are too complicated and sometimes I just prefer not to).
I was known as being very quiet as a kid, to the point where people were shocked if I spoke. 😅 Also, I offended more than a few people by not wanting hugs and such! These days I just take a deep breath and suck it up.
I'm wondering if maybe some of these situations were due to underdeveloped Fe, as I've heard that doesn't really develop until early adulthood. Alternatively, it could have been that I was unhealthy (had severe untreated anxiety up until a few years ago when I finally acknowledged it as a problem), so I was in a Si-Ti loop, grip of Ne or whatever.
Thoughts? Similar experiences? I'd love to hear 'em!"
3137,isfj,"yeah, at school i were very quiet, and i only had two friends, but they were younger than me and not in the same grade as me. Even just a few years ago there was a guy in my class who thought i was mute.
i was very quiet, and I still am. 
I feel like I have gotten more comfortable with myself, but I also feel like its intimidating that I'm so quiet?"
3138,isfj,"I actually have vivid memories of being really outgoing and funny as a kid, but come to think of it, that was always amongst a fairly large friendgroup where I trusted everyone enough. Outside of that, as well as around figures of authority I would have no idea how to act or what to say."
3139,isfj,"Absolutely. I was very quiet and shy as a kid. My favorite activity was being alone in my room reading books. I hated talking to strangers. I’ve gotten a lot better as an adult when I realized I don’t mind sharing personal details with people I trust. People think of me as outgoing even though I’m an introvert. I just like to see different friends and bring people together, even though a lot of social activity does wear on me. I feel that social anxiety creep in when I’m by myself in a crowd of strangers, or just worn out after a long day, or when I have to speak in front of an audience. But I’m not sure if it shows."
3140,isfj,"I am INFP and I had very similar experiences pertaining to social anxiety in childhood. I used to be awkward in most social situations. 
I assume the kind of environment we are brought up in has a big part to play in our social attitude, especially as kids. I grew up mostly around people who I consider aren't nearly compatible by personality type to me, and it took me a very long time to realise that, there were more people, who were more concurrent with my interests. This I now figure took a big toll on my social abilities and outlook."
3141,isfj,"Yes. And I was more comfortable around adults than other children (because they were more predictable). But luckily I had one really close friend throughout my childhood. And then at high school I got less shy, and more friends. "
3142,isfj,"Yes, though nowadays i try not to label myself as such. Im still in high school and I feel not even trying to consider myself that makes me more confident. I only have 2 close friends in school, and I guess a few other less close ones. (Though I'd consider them more like nice acquaintances) "
3143,isfj,"Oh, absolutely.  I secretly craved social interaction so, so much, but I felt like other people would find me boring and so in school settings I kept to myself and did my work (which apparently led to some people thinking I was stuck-up in middle school.) When my mom took me to the park, I'd barely talk to the other kids - I didn't really know how to relate, even though I wanted to.  I'm sure having two introverted parents and an introverted sibling didn't help my case."
3144,isfj,"Yes, I was very awkward. Kind, but completely clueless about what should or shouldn't be said or done in situations. I probably annoyed a lot of kids. My behavior started to become more normal around when I was 14-ish.
Now, as a young adult, I probably seem like your average Jo, but people who know me more personally say I've got some Asperger-like traits. I don't think I have enough to get a diagnosis, though. "
3145,isfj,"Yup I was for sure. I had autism so that made things like making and maintaining friends hard for me. As a result, my Fe was pretty underdeveloped and I had stronger Ti. I was definitely super shy as a kid and looked forward to school being over. I had to even attend a program to learn proper social skills. People were also shocked if I spoke too. "
3146,isfj,"I was tested for autism when I got my diagnosis for Tourette's but I think it was kind of lacking. Although now that I'm older I've been watching those videos on female autism by that guy on YouTube... I'll find it later... and I'm not so sure anyways. Might just be a fun combination of anxiety/depression/possible ADHD.
That's interesting that so many of us have had the same experiences! I wonder if other types have this. I'm sure types like INFJ and INFP can relate, but I wonder about extroverted types."
3147,isfj,"Yeah it’s interesting! what is Tourette’s syndrome anyway?. I’m sure other introverted types can relate, but people tend to misinterpret introversion for social awkwardness when they are two different things. "
3148,isfj,"It's a neurological disorder that causes tics, or unwanted movements (ie blinking, twitching, etc). If you've ever watched South Park, they kinda parodied it in the episode where Cartman claims he has it so he can have an excuse to swear a lot (fun fact, the swearing aspect is called coprolalia which is only present in about 10% of people with TS! Not me, though)."
3149,isfj,"I've been designing a self-care app for FJ types, and I've just finished a prototype. I'm looking for folks that could user test for me today. Participating is very easy, and I would greatly appreciate your input.
Reply to this thread or message me if you're interested in checking out what I've been working on!"
3150,isfj,"I guess my real question, is if I should be posting here, or to relationship advice.
INTP here, and I feel increasingly frustrated by not knowing how to support her when she's frustrated. 
This is the best way I can describe it:
Her: ""I'm so thirsty lately. I don't know why I'm so thirsty, but I hate being thirsty.""
Me: ""yeah, that sounds uncomfortable""
Now, this is where I think I'm making a mistake, but can't help it, because, in my head, I'm thinking, ""so go drink some water!"" But I know that's the wrong answer, and she's reaching out to me for emotional support, ... But if you would just drink the freaking water, we wouldn't be having this conversation, and your mouth wouldn't be dry!!
So invariably, I can't keep myself from saying, ""I know this is frustrating for you. What if I pick up some flavored water you like on the way home?"" 
This is where my head explodes and it feels like trying to lead a mule to water. I cannot talk her into an obvious solution! She won't do it won't do it won't do it. It will be something like, ""it's not the water. It's just that I'm so thirsty"" 
headexplode.jpg
So, is this an ISFJ thing? If so, what do I do? 
Help me subreddit, you're my only hope.
Edit: for clarity, the ""thirsty"" example was hyperbole made up for an example
Edit edit: thanks for all the feedback even though I may be in the wrong sub"
3151,isfj,"Given your limited context, my instinct says it's a depression thing. Not an ISFJ but I've been in her situation before. She most likely knows what she needs to do herself, but is stuck in this self-defeating cycle.
Best you can do is support her and try to get her to rationalize what she's feeling and what she's going through."
3152,isfj,"when i complain like that, i already know what i'm going to do or not do about it. the plan is set and i just want to complain for a bit before i continue with the plan. hearing someone give me a ""poor baby"" can be nice. 
it's....not the most rational behavior. and though the plan is set, a lot of the times it's not the best plan. like being thirsty and not dealing with it because i'm sticking with my plan."
3153,isfj,"Ah you poor INTP's, I've seen a trend of your type always bending over backwards trying to accommodate SJ's when it's rarely the case vice versa. Please, if they cannot understand that your authentic way of being helpful is by suggesting ways to solve their problem then let it be that. Do not compromise your way of being for those not willing/incapable to meet you half way. "
3154,isfj,"Yeah, depression/some other disorder that impacts executive functioning might be closer to the mark than her personality type, although it may be a combination of both. I'm an ISFJ and I always know what the rational solution to my problem is, but I also have ADHD, which can make executing that solution feel a lot more convoluted than it seems on the surface because of my difficulties with memory/executive functioning/etc. 
Often though if I'm complaining I really do just want emotional support, because ""I'm not fucking stupid, I know how to fix the problem, I just don't want to deal with it/it's not that easy/it still bothers me even if I can fix it/etc."" It's more about venting my feelings than coming up with an actionable plan, and people trying to give me solutions I'm already aware of just pisses me off. Also, sometimes I vent more as a social thing? I don't really express much feeling to people I don't care about, so if I'm whining to somebody it means I trust them and want to open myself up a bit. She may be different, though! That's just my personal experience. "
3155,isfj,"INTP here, married to ISFJ. For me the issue is that I want to fix things and go, ""hey, drink more water, get a water bottle, or even setup hourly reminders on your phone to remind you to drink more."" But what my spouse seems to want is compassion and empathy, which can be a little hard at times. Sometimes my spouse will ""hint"" at things she wants this way, and we've agreed we won't hint to each other on issues, that if we want something or help from each other, we will ask for it. Spouse agrees this is reasonable for us. 
TL:DR: I have no idea what to suggest for your relationship, I'm just saying you aren't alone here. "
3156,isfj,"She wants you to say something like ""UUGHH! THAT is the WORST.  I hate being THIRSTY... AND there's no reason for it!  WHY?!?! You'll be OKAY though, do you want to stop somewhere? No? Well let me know if you need anything.  By the way I did [totally unrelated questionably ""helpful"" act] for you.  Want to marathon Harry Potter tonight?"""
3157,isfj,"Maybe it's a test or something. To see if you can provide her with ""water"" or whatever it is she is asking for. Maybe her way of asking for help is merely mentioning the problem, but not outright asking if you'll do x. Maybe like another person here said it's to try to be ""babied"".
I hate asking for help so sometimes I'll put my feelers out there like that and just mention something. If I get a bad response, I will bottle it up and deal with it on my own.
I have no idea haha. ISFJs can be complicated.
Edit: another thought - although along the lines of my first thought above. It could be a way to see how much you care about her. Because if someone had said to me ""I'm thirsty lately"" and I cared about them/lived with them I would definitely come home with some water without even asking. 
LOL or a statement like that would be my hypochondria and me trying to get reassurance from them. That might be less of an ISFJ thing though."
3158,isfj,"Thanks, this is helpful coming from someone completely removed from the situation. I need to remember this next time."
3159,isfj,"Why do ISFJs hate asking for help? Im an ISFP with an isfj girlfriend and its very bothersome that she doesnt ask for help. Even when she clearly needs help.
She does the thing that OP is describing and like OP, i tell her get water. I have a hard time understanding this."
3160,isfj,"Personally I hate asking for help because I don't want to burden other people; I want to do everything myself so I can do everything for people I care about too. And also it's a bit of stubbornness and just feeling like asking for help is admitting I don't know something/am incompetent. 
We want everything to go smoothly and no troubles or arguments to occur and asking for help puts a little risk in there that it might cause some sort of drama or conflict."
3161,isfj,"I really get upset at this. Why does asking for help cause drama? I always ask for help when i need it. My girlfriend sometimes starves herself when she can ask for help by people at her church for food because every sabbath, there is a potluck, but she doesnt ask. We are long distance. She complains to me that she has no food, so i tell her to go to a church member and ask, they won't deny. But she is being very stubborn. Im worried about this stubborness because people who dont ask for help can risk getting themselves in a bad situation. She got herself nutritionally deficient to the point of having her muscles cramp and cant walk so i told her ask her friends to take her to the hospital but she wouldnt even do that. I had to msg her friends to go to her room and help her out. It is frustrating. She says i dont understand her but im only trying to help her to get food in her stomach. I get stressed out because she is always getting herself sick by being stressed all the time."
3162,isfj,"Touch and words is how I show affection. Touch stuff is hand holding, leaning my head against hers, and cuddling. Words are genuine. And I pay attention to the person's emotional state and will talk about it with the person.
Most people i want to spend limited amount of time with, a lover I'd like to spend some more time with. Also I get moments of fuzzy vision around a lover where it's like a movie and the background gets blurry and all I can see is the person.
The intimacy I seek is based in a relationship where both me and the other person are compassionate people, caring for others together, and pushing and helping each other to care for and be compassionate with ourselves."
3163,isfj,"Words foremost, touch is secondary. Texting is okay but I much prefer talking on the phone or face-to-face. That way I can read your emotions. Someone who I can enjoy moments with and communicate problems and find compromise. Someone who will listen to my wisdom and I will do likewise."
3164,isfj,"My husband and I are both isfj. It makes some things complicated, but it's been awesome for our relationship because we need the exact same things, so we can easily give.
He needs a lot of reassurance that I like what he's doing, how he looks, that I appreciate his contribution to our marriage. And he needs physical touch. We often did our homework next to each other so we could touch butts while doing our own thing. We always fall asleep touching.
Sexually, he just needs to know that I'm as into it as he is. He's a very selfless lover and really wants me to enjoy it. I'm the same way with him, so our give and take works out perfectly.
And one thing I love about us is that I would give him the world, I always try to serve him by making food or cleaning the house or bringing him a treat from the store, and when he gets to the dishes before me, I ALWAYS appreciate it because it's something I could have done myself, and it wasn't an expectation. He feels the same way so our duties get naturally split up equally, with very few expectations of who should do what. The balance is key though, our relationship would go downhill fast if it were one-sided. We would feel unacknowledged, disrespected, used, and unappreciated. "
3165,isfj,"This sounds like my current relationship with an ISFJ. Thank you for helping. Especially thank you for writing so much as it helps me to understand. 
Only if you feel comfortable, but what is your sense of sexuality....like as an ISFJ, are you more romantic? Aggressive? Sensitive? Gentle? "
3166,isfj,"GREAT answer! Yeah my ISFJ boyfriend is sweet and sensitive and gentle, but he's so strong and physically imposing (body size, not attitude), and his voice is so deep that he naturally comes across as extremely manly. He's super gentle though and self sacrificing and always makes sure I'm taken care of first...he's wonderful! I do have to say though...once in a while he'll get a little fire if I tease him too much and establish dominance hahahah he always makes sure I'm comfortable though lol"
3167,isfj,"Well I said explicitly that I hope to be trusted, and was told that I was...is that an ISFJ just saying he trusts you to make you happy? Or is that actual trust? He said I could ask him anything...and when I do, he gets pretty deep, but he doesn't volunteer it. I have to dig. Does this sound familiar or no? "

3169,isfj,"Romantic, definitely. Aggressive, NOOOOOOOOOOO LOL. Sensitive and gentle, absolutely.
We aren't going to be aggressive at all. Yes, it screws things up a lot in a dating scene where the guy is supposed to be aggressive and the guys who ARE aggressive have more success and thus promote the idea that aggression is best. And that gives rise to people like Harvey Weinstein.
Just be willing to get to know someone, no matter how they present themselves. Then you just might stumble onto one of us sweet and sensitive ISFJ guys. :)"
3170,isfj,"sexually i'm always sensitive. 
romantic? sometimes. aggressive? rarely. gentle? mostly. but every time what i do is based off of what's going on between me and my partner. that's the sensitive part. we're kind of filling each other's want or need and are aware of each other that way."
3171,isfj,"ISFJ male here. And yes, absolutely I will. Mostly because, like most people, we just want to feel like we aren't weird. Or we just want someone else to understand. Or we just don't want to feel alone having this thing, whatever it is.
You have to understand, we give of ourselves in virtually every other relationship we have. It is who we are, giving people, and we give much more than we take. So when we finally reach a level of mutual trust and understanding with someone else, we might go a bit overboard in letting it all out."
3172,isfj,"Well I would say the latter. The important thing is that you can still earn that trust. It really depends on the relationship I guess...it's hard to explain, but I am just more comfortable sharing with some people than with others. Being a good listener is super important."
3173,isfj,"I am supposed to start University in January, although I may postpone due to other, more pressing issues. My majors are Psychology and Sociology. I've been in love with both subjects for as long as I can remember. I've always got my face buried in a book on either subject. I cannot get enough of them. 
After my Bachelors degree is my major concern. I want to go to law school, but I am beginning to wonder is it really the best place for me to be. I'm thinking that getting my Masters and becoming a Psychologist rather than a Lawyer would be more suitable.
Thoughts?"
3174,isfj,"I wanted to be a nurse after getting my bachelors in psychology from Purdue but after a single anatomy course at another college, I realized how much I don't care about nursing and how much I do care about psychology. I've since switched tracks and I'm meeting with an advisor for U of Indy to pursue a clinical psychology masters degree.
It's really hard to learn things when you don't have the passion to apply what has been learned (or the passion to learn it in the first place). Follow your instinctual calling. There's no abundance of psychologists, so you're likely going to get a job very soon after completing a masters program in clinical psychology.
Or try the law career. But there's a reason you feel this way."
3175,isfj,"From what I've read, a lot of traditional recommendations for ISFJ would point you toward being a psychologist.
But you have time to figure things out! You're only just starting for your Bachelor's degree. University gives you a great opportunity to explore if you take diverse classes. I'd say if possible take some sort of law classes and see if you click with the subject at all.
Who knows maybe you will get a job out of college and won't need to go to law/graduate school.
The only issue I've experienced really is money -- I went for an Animation degree and often have trouble finding projects. Sometimes I wish I didn't do what I loved and instead did something more practical like Computer Science. But I am lucky to have enough savings and some support from my family to get by."
3176,isfj,"This is so presumptuous and condescending.
My master's work involved philosophy of language and critical theory. My (clearly intuitive) adviser commented that my attention to both detail and the big picture is rare and impressive. Sure, some Si-doms may get hung up on the concrete and neglect the abstract, but just as many intuitive types can't ground their arguments in the concrete. It's foolish and usually arrogant to downplay the importance of one. 
It seems like you've put some effort into studying Jungian typology, so it's surprising that you make assumptions about intellectual ability and types. Are you sure you don't have baggage with Si-doms or general inferiority complex? Can you correctly identify an ISFJ? Generally speaking, INTPs tend to respect ISFJs who share similar interests, and sure, are on the same intellectual level. "
3177,isfj,"Haha; I dearly love ISFJs! (I keep crushing on them left and right; it's sort of horrible). My best friend is one and a Philosophy graduate.
My experience with ISxJ Philosophers is that while they're relatively capable of comprehending any individual school of thought or whatever, they're quite incapable of actually synthesizing any of it. Conversations invariably turn to them explaining what this or this guy thought; and... that's about it. At most, they might say they think they agree more with that guy; but that's largely the extent of their individual thought. Philosophical conversations with them just aren't nearly as fun as with, say, an INFJ.
It's clearly an inferior draw (Ne); and pursuing such in the long term is almost always unhealthy. I think philosophy should best remain a casual interest for ISxJs."
3178,isfj,"I appreciate that you qualified your criticism. But at the same time, I chose to make an independent study bachelors because I wanted to bridge analytic and continental philosophy as well as critical theory and literature. I chose a specific intersection to focus on, to be fair. This move was risky at the time, but I was validated by my grad school advisers after producing great work. I don't want to sound like a bullshitter, but I'm very sure I'm not the only Si dom to thrive in interdisciplinary, theory based fields. In Jungian typology, (which I didn't study academically) attention to detail (Si) is naturally counter-balanced by a less conscious pull towards objective abstraction (Ne). I thrived in my academic setting but had to cut it short due to financial issues. The humanities don't pay well.
FWIW, people who know my main account mostly type me as an INTP. I won't get into the specific reasons why they're wrong, but activity partners are a fairly common mistype."
3179,isfj,"That, of course, is the crux of my issue here. ISxJs are normally quite practical for the most part; but the siren call of the inferior Ne can lead them to train solely as Philosophers, for which there is virtually no demand. The possibility of incompetence is icing on the cake.
~
By the way, my comment is derived from my friend who, after graduating, felt that she didn't understand the world much better - maybe even less - but at least she ""knows the names of things""."
3180,isfj,"I'm not particularly familiar with him (in general, I've little interest in the particular philosophies of individuals; I hate putting boxes in people). (And perhaps here is where one goes, ""Aha! There's his problem!"". Whatever). 
From what little I've seen in my lectures and readings, he does seem to look and smell of an ISTJ; I see hints of Si (e.g. historicity; distaste for modern technology), tertiary Fi (limited/selective empathy), and inferior Ne (struggle with significant anxiety, particularly about the future, and the desire to conquer it)."
3181,isfj,"Ok, seems like you shifted your argument a bit. Maybe there's a higher rate of ISxJ philosophy students who ultimately choose a more lucrative career path, therefore limiting the number of ISxJ philosophers. In the long run, the output of professional work may skew against SJs or whatever. Fine. But you did write:
And:
You clearly think ISxJs have an intellectual deficiency when it comes to the abstract. I'm arguing against that point, not the one you shifted your argument toward. It's still condescending, shitty, and patently false. Not that you'd believe that I was in a highly competitive honors program in abstract shit, or what my advisers said about my thesis on abstract shit. "
3182,isfj,"Ok, so assuming you've pursued philosophy academically in the first place, it's impossible to succeed without being able to understand and cite other philosophers. Maybe your ISxJ friend is a drag to talk to about philosophy because you're pulling ideas out of your ass, and they want to give you a TL;DR to form a more relevant platform for you to pull ideas out of your ass. Or maybe your ISxJ is not so bright but works hard. Or I'm the most special snowflake of the ISxJs, because this was my domain (and is still something I beat my friends and former classmates out of the park with)."
3183,isfj,"I tend to get interested mostly to INFP and ENFP women, but since the INFP are usually too shy to make first moves and the ENFP seem to prefer mostly other E relationships over I, it's not so good.
Edit: I've just found out this type compatibility chart. No wonder why I'm still loveless. lol"
3184,isfj,"I've made a post on this before heh. Anywho, I've always been drawn to INFP's in specific, dating one now. My ex was an ENFP. As for getting along with it's usually the INFP's or other ISFJ's, of which I've only met one other one. I can get along with anyone but it's easier with other introverts naturally."
3185,isfj,"I seem to always either be drawn to INTJs are have them drawn to me (honestly not sure which way... Maybe a bit of both). 
That being said, I only really have a few friends and most of them are online friends. There is one girl I've known on school just from all out classed together and we are starting to talk more (partners for two different projects) and I told her about mbti and she said she'd take the test... But i honestly could not guess what type she is - - definitely not intj or isfj so that only leaves uhh 14 other options lol. "
3186,isfj,"LOL that chart seems so random! Admittedly I don't know many ISFJs but the female one I know relatively okay is with an INTP male.
I've definitely heard of a few INFP-ISFJ relationships. It happens
edit: and according to others of this sub, it seems ENFP-ISFJ relationships aren't uncommon either"
3187,isfj,"It's quite frustrating, because I feel the main obstacle is not in the I/E axis, but more in the J/P one (judging/perceiving). 
I've always had a terrible time in communicating with them, but specially because I sense they feel too judged by me and act like if they knew I didn't like them, while my actions and thoughts are absolutely the opposite (at least they seem to me, I can't do more), even if they don't interpret it like that. 
So, I don't really know how to express my interest to them but specially how to communicate them that I don't despise or judge or look down at them at all, but that it's exactly the opposite, that I admire their personality. Every time I manage to take them out of the ""group"" for a private talk (and that for itself is damn hard), I can't get any meaningful conversation going, because I feel their evasions, and even if I use to have no problem at all in establishing deep talk with most people, I kinda get blocked and nothing good ever comes out, and the meeting simply dies out and awkwardness ensues. 
PS: that ""they"" I've been talking about through the text was three ENFP girls, and I always felt the same with each case. That's why I have developed a so detailed account of my frustrated meetings. 
Do you have any experience like that seen from the opposite side that's similar to that? "
3188,isfj,"Do you have any specific examples?  I can't speak for them, but I know for myself, I'm always watching body language and facial expressions as well as listening to words.  I know that I struggle with certain personalities and think they don't like me because they hold everything inside.  For example, one of my good friends is an INTJ.  Often times, when we are having a conversation, she will just sit there completely expressionless.  For me, it is unnerving.  I'll make a joke and instinctively, I'm watching for these cues to gauge her reaction, but she gives no external clues.  Eventually, she breaks out into laughter and inside, I sigh a bit of relief.  Now, I've known her long enough to know that even though she isn't visually expressing herself on the outside, that doesn't mean she is frustrated with me or irritated.  It's just that she doesn't express herself like I do.  It's harder for us ENFPs to really get to know people like this because we DO feel judged by the lack of visual cues.  With us, you know what we are feeling all the time because we can't contain it.  
Having an ISFJ as a husband, I've had to learn that he just doesn't express himself the same as I do.  I have learned to not take it personally and if I need to hear him tell me something (like I'm feeling down or whatever), I need to specify exactly what I'm looking for because he just doesn't get subtle hints.  
When you say take them out of the group for a private talk, do you mean physically walking away from a group to chat or just a date night alone?  If you are trying to have a meaningful conversation while a group is chatting, it's just not going to happen.  I know that if a group is sitting around talking, I HAVE to be there.  I can not focus on individual conversations, especially serious ones if something else is going on.  If you are talking about alone dates, it really helps if you just tell us that you like us but have trouble communicating.  If I know someone doesn't express themselves like I do, I'm a little more lenient with my feelings.  Does that make sense?  "
3189,isfj,"Well, I'd say I have no problem at all with the non-verbal and verbal signs, on the contrary, I think I'm among the most expressive introverted people you could find, and when first meeting someone (not later), people believes I'm an extrovert. And yes, I also find it extremely hard if not outright impossible to talk meaningful things when there's other people around, and would never try it. 
Now that I think of it all, and of common patterns between the ENFPs I've met (and failed to date), it's probably that I just don't know how to get their attention properly. Even when I find the private quality time needed, like a date or an appointment, I just kind of get blocked after interpreting the non-verbal signals, kind of believe I'm making her lose some precious time and that she'd rather be at another place or doing any of the things she wishes rather than talking to me. I recon this is more a problem of mine I have to work on that any problem about the types per se, but even if I may have the same sensation with other people, I can circumvent this feeling easily. But in those ENFP occasions I feel like I shouldn't be there and I'm not receiving enough attention, even if I initially have an absolutely open and cheerful position. 
If this would have happened with just one or two random people it wouldn't have been worth noticing; you cannot be liked by everyone, obviously, and rejection is the most common. But since I do receive interest from other types (from INFJs to ESTPs, etc.) except ENFPs, it is very easy to compare them since they are basically unforgettable, and I notice the same pattern; a lack of interest and mutual connection. 
So, to get more specific; An ENFP I'm trying to get her attention. She is, well, great, magnetic, so active, well, an ENFP. I talk to her, chit-chat, get to know, and we do seem to get on quite well. I force a private meeting, I fail miserably to get her attention. I get the message, like anyone would do, and cease to try. But then, at a random day, she forces some involvement again. Then, we meet again. And again, it's like we can't find the common ground. I notice she feels sad, and I feel sad too; but later, after a time, the history repeats. 
With introverts, interest it's a bit more difficult to notice since the person needs to know and feel comfortable to you beforehand to show any signs; but with extroverts and ENFP in particular, being an Observant-Judging-Feeling person I find it very easy to catch the thoughts as you explained, via the external signals. And every time I notice mixed signals like that from an extrovert, I'm really at a loss. I guess it's my fault somehow, but I can't really find what to change."
3190,isfj,"Well, it is hard to comment on your specific situation since I don't know you or the ladies you mention.  So I'll just keep it to my perspective and experience.  I've always had a hard time dating.  It is impossible for me to date someone that I don't know well.  It feels forced and uncomfortable.  The few times I went on dates without knowing the person before hand, I felt like I had to perform.  Like there were certain expectations I had to meet and the other person was constantly judging me.  I hated that feeling.  For me, romantic interest is sparked by friendship first.  It is easier to start off with light hearted banter, fun, and excitement than to jump to the serious get to know you stuff.  Eventually, the serious stuff comes once I feel comfortable enough to let that guard down.  If that initial friendship spark isn't there, I struggle between seeking out my comfort zone, which is within the group setting or others I'm already comfortable with and trying not to hurt the other person's feelings.  I've always had better luck finding romantic partners within groups of friends.  "
3191,isfj,"It sounds like you're describing exactly what happens in a semi-duality relation. http://www.socionics.com/rel/sdl.htm (Btw, introverts have p/j switch)
You can learn to live with the differences. I can't offer any insight into her though. It sounds like she tried, too. But it doesn't seem very natural I guess?"
3192,isfj,"I think your comment is very helpful and worth meditating about, and not just for any personality type in particular but about the nature of relationships in general and what should they be / which process should they go through. Thanks for your time and help! :)"
3193,isfj,I may act like I get along well with them but deep down they make me uncomfortable. They can act super moody/bossy and at the same time very structured which bugs me. I find them to be too competitive and they always think they can take advantage of me but I dont let them. They can be annoying especially when things dont go their way. They seem to always be anxious and try to get on top of their things. They can also be selfish and inconsiderate of others feelings.
3194,isfj,"In my experience--they bring up things in a group I have told them one-on-one and I am so mortified (deer in headlights feeling) that any trust I have in them vanishes. Then they do it again and again, even if I ask them not to. I still act friendly around them, but I trust them about as much as an email scammer unfortunately :'("
3195,isfj,"One of my service officer was an estj (close guess only though she havent taken the test) and i was a teller so we work at the same bank. I was still slow in counting money as i was new. One time, she confronted me that i was unproductive but being the newbie i was i told her that im still learning but tf i was adjusting to my new environment duhhh. She was also rude, childish, judgemental and unprofessional when she confronted me. Thank the lord because i managed to switch careers and i no longer see that btch
Good thing i never got to know her because i wasnt planning to. I avoid those kinds of people . I mean it's okay to give criticism but the btch stepped over the line."
3196,isfj,"As far as I know the ESTJ is the ""supervisor"" type for the ISFJ, which makes ESTJs both attractive and admirable, and kind of frustrating and annoying to be around for a long time for an ISFJ. Sometimes it seems like the ISFJ might want to please the ESTJ, but no matter what they do the ESTJ is kind of dismissive of them and especially of their tertiary Ti logic that ESTJ suppresses with their Te.   
To read more about supervision relationships see ISFJ relationship matches with other MBTI types."
3197,isfj,"I used to like an ESTJ guy...I knew he was super ambiguous about relationships but I didn't expect him to straight up ignore it. I remember I was too scared to speak to him about it in person, so I wrote him an email. No response whatsoever, and I didn't want to pester him further about it. It wouldn't have worked out anyway since we live in different countries, but I was more upset that he didn't simply tell me he didn't feel the same way. I guess the silence was the answer.  
I have since moved on and we're still Facebook friends, but it's at a bare minimum. I also feel like I can't speak to him normally even if we talked again.  "
3198,isfj,"Absolutely hate my interactions with ESTJs. I'm not saying I hate them in general. Just my own experiences. I perceive them as bulldozing over people and their opinions (Te), and being intensely judgmental when people don't meet their perceived conventional standards (Si). Btw, the ones I've seen were unhealthy ESTJs or undeveloped so this doesn't mean I think this about every ESTJ. I stay far away from the unhealthy ones.
Generally, I think they're great at making things happen, but strictly in the way they see fit. Intense when working. Extremely organized. Likes routines and systems. Very resourceful. Popular even though they are often/can be  insensitive. They are focused on growth when their Ne develops and they're fun to be around to do things when they're relaxed. They have a quick wit and are motivated to move upwards in life. If you're a passive person, an ESTJ will probably try to snap you out of it to keep you moving if you're working with them. Not inclined to empathize but will be emotionally supportive if you explain to them want you need and when."
3199,isfj,"I was browsing in fapstronaut central and came across this post, and it got me thinking about my life. I'm a solid ISFJ and I am pretty new to their fapless ideology and it's brought a lot of things to light for me personally. This particular post though, resonated with me on a pretty subconscious level. My reason for posting here is to probe /r/ISFJ on your(our) take on the self pleasing as well as how healthy our lifestyle is. I have never known a singular standpoint on the issue and I have never worked up the gall to bother any of my local ISFJ herd with such a personal question. To be honest, I'm only curious if I'm alone in my personal failures as a man or, since I'm probably not, what are your perspectives on what they have written here? 
As a disclaimer, I don't believe Donald Glover to be the next Carl Jung, but he's offering a perspective, and that warrants some introspection."
3200,isfj,"intp here, you (isfj) guys are too nice to the point that it creeps me out, I have never seen another type that is more self-less than you folks; whereas esfp/estjs are selfish bastards, you guys give too much to other people. there's a thing called balance where you give as much as you take, i'm not saying you are people pleasing doormats but from my observation you are too caring and good to others to the point that you don't seem to take care of yourselves...anyways you guys awesome and the world would be shittier without you, don't be so hard on yourself"
3201,isfj,"Maaan, that article was rough. True, but rough. Allow me to explain. For a while now, I've been aware of my 'Nice Guy' tendencies. I knew my desire to be needed, to be in control, my inability to express feelings yet expect some kind of recognition of an unspoken need. And it killed me to see all of this in me. It made me consider myself selfish, hopeless, and perpetually alone. Based on what you've said about the post, I feel like you might relate.
But here is the problem. Life has a lot to do with perspective. Now, I'm currently studying social work in university and one of the most core aspects is this idea of ""strengths-based practice'. What this means is that, when someone is struggling, we don't look at what they are lacking but how they have grown and persevered; how they have used what limited resources they have to keep moving. 
Now, when I took the test last week and understood my ISFJ position, it made a lot of sense to me as it did to you. But all of these deficits that I saw as problems: the need to be needed, the desire to continually put others before myself, and other matters, these were all placed in a new light. They were perceived as strengths, not weaknesses. This confused me, but greatly encouraged me. 
This didn't mean that I couldn't be selfish or manipulative. I could. But rather it helped me to see that when I understood how I thought, the issues that trigger me and bring out my strengths as an ISFJ, then I could use these 'deficits' for good. Do I need to be needed? Absolutely. So I can use that to encourage and support others in so much as they need it. In other terms, in moderation. This is easier said than done and I'm starting to ramble a little, but what I wanted to point out is that you are not alone. You are not alone in your shame and worries, and that there is some hope for us 'Nice Guys'.
Apologies in advance for bad formatting as am on mobile. "
3202,isfj,"If I'm honest, I do definitely relate. I've been aware of my ISFJness for close to 2 years now and I have worked with that awareness in the forefront of my life since I came to the realization. Being open an honest with myself, looking both at common strengths and weaknesses in order to see where they manifested in my life. I guess you could say I've applied a sort of primitive understanding of strength based practice completely unbeknownst to myself. 
However, this post set me to thinking, and not very nice thinking as it were, on how I've actually been impacting the people around me as opposed to my former self-centered ways. 
Now what I like about what you said is the shift of awareness on perspective, and also your taking of a solution-oriented response. This Robert Glover guy, has an obvious negative perspective on the ""nice guy,"" be it from personal self-hate or resentment for someone else, I don't know. What astonished me was that I was so clearly described by his portrayal that I saw myself as this evil character he drew up. I guess what I took from him was that I shouldn't be a nice guy, but what then? Has my entire life been a lie up till now? I can't truly be evil, can I? I'm far too young for such a crisis. 
I've decided that it was a good thing to read since it has clearly made me aware of yet another aspect of life in general and I very much so appreciate your thoughts on the matter, ""No, lol, you're not the only dick."" Just kidding, but really  focusing on a degree of social moderation and awareness of the world around me. Thanks. "
3203,isfj,"I can't say I don't agree to a certain extent, but I will say it's not my style to completely ignore the value of listening to what people have to say. (You included haha)
Demonizing ""nice guys"" is definitely a mistake. We're not evil and we're not just trying to slither into anyone's pants. So I agree there. There's no reason that we should, or I will, give up being nice. If someone can't ""handle"" my being my interpretation of ""nice,"" then they can find someone else to be their friend. So far in life, it's worked for me and I have come to terms with the minor crisis I had when I posted this, haha. 
As for nofap, I did find that there was some pretty cool stuff in the nofapsphere, like meditating and realizing that fapping shouldn't be the only emotional release I resort to. I took up running and fap... less often. In making those little changes, I found a weird solace that I can't explain. "
3204,isfj,"Haha, I like your thinking. I agree we need a balance. The Nice Guy mentality can be very poisonous. I think something key in what you've identified is the need to realise our ISFJ mindset and the insecurities we hold which we tie up into that. Taking timidness in asking a girl out. I chalked it up to a friend yesterday that this was due to my introverted nature. He called me out on it and said it was due to my low self esteem. I believe he was right. And I think this is part of what we're talking about here. We need to shed off these insecurities which can impact those we love while treasuring our identity and relevant strengths as ISFJ.
I deeply appreciate your response. This has been encouraging for myself as well. "
3205,isfj,"i don’t like to be pessimistic or dramatic, but i haven’t been feeling myself lately. i’ve been having a bit of an identity crisis. i’m not sure who i am or what my purpose is. that’s why i’m on this subreddit. i feel like my friends don’t really understand me or know me that well. i’ve been feeling envious of my friends and it’s horrible, because i love them so much. the very least i would want is to be a bad, jealous friend to them. i’ve been losing sleep, feeling lonely, and overthinking little things. hopefully this is all just a stage and will pass soon."
3206,isfj,"Yes keep hanging in there, I got my results for my entire degree yesterday, I spent the last 3 months nearly failing a topic and thinking I'd sabotaged myself but my exam grade pulled me through. It's the biggest weight off my shoulders and was so worth it to hear I'd passed."
3207,isfj,"I've been into MBTI for about a year and a half and I've been slowly learning and enjoying the process of understanding types. But there's a very curious thing that I've noticed recently and it's that I feel a very strong attraction for INFPs, and I often idealize, idolize and look for them as role models, as something I really want to achieve, the kind of person I would love to be, and it's making me really frustrated because I feel like it's making me suppress myself. I would like to know if this is a common thing for us ISFJs or if it may be something I've acquired by my personal growth."
3208,isfj,"For some reason, the INFP's I meet and I always take a long time to really get along.  The only person who has ever hated me - and I'm not over exaggerating, I mean hated me - was an INFP girl, who just said that I gave her ""bad vibes.""  She hated me through 6th and 7th grade, and by some magic miracle had decided she liked me by 8th... never understood those rationalizations, but okay.  The thing about me with ISFP's is that we usually get along for some period of time, and when we're getting along it's great, but then we usually become less close/distance ourselves from each other more because of that huge Se-Si difference.  It doesn't seem like it'd be a big difference, but believe me, it is.  When my ex ESFP friend got together with me, we had fun, but when she got together with our ISFP friends, it was like seeing magic happen - there was an immediate connection, immediate agreement, immediate understanding that I just did not seem to have with her.  So she replaced me with her ISFP friends, and later on when they kicked me out of their friend group, they cited some of their reasoning as me ""over-thinking fun stuff"" (basically, over-thinking doing new things,) and us being ""really different people.""
With INFP's, it's more like that high Ne-Si leads me to like them, but not ever want them as a close friend.   I don't know how to explain this, but when I'm around an INFP, their Ne makes me feel... anxious in their presence, I guess?  I mean, I use my Ne too on some level, it's just that in an INFP it looks much different and there's so much more of it because it's their aux function.  With xNTP's, I kind of know what they're thinking because on some level, I'm thinking it too/can relate - ENFP's are easier to get along with because they're extroverts, but INFP's and I just seem to exist on these completely different levels.  This is a thing about me and xxFP's, our worlds and world-views and perspectives are just ridiculously different.  xxFP's feel like I see everything wrong.  I feel like they see everything wrong.  And that Fi-Fe clash is wild, and if it's not the Fi-Fe clash with xxFP's it's always something else.  
So no, I don't really idealize INFP's, and I've never met one who idealized me.  Actually, the people who most commonly seem to idealize me are ExFJ's - ENFJ's and ESFJ's, that is.  They see more in me than I see in myself, and I don't know why.  They seem to have this idea that I'm this really smart and innocent human being, and seem to gravitate to me often.  With ExFJ's, I feel a level of respect that I don't feel often with other types or with other people.  I'm the kind of person they usually like, and I like them back.  I'd say that out of every type, I idealize ENFJ's.  A healthy ENFJ is just the best person.  A healthy ESFJ, too, for that matter.  Oh, and I love, love, love ESTP's who have decent Fe - cannot get along with the super blunt unhealthy ones who just sit around all day making fun of everyone."
3209,isfj,"My favorite people are always ISFJs (I'm an INFP). The ISFJs in my life are usually open to hearing whatever weird thing my Ne makes up and will laugh about it freely. The ISFJs I've known have also been low key good at science, which fascinates me when paired with a high feeling function. One of my friends was going on to be a marine biologist because she loved sea turtles and another wants to conserve historic objects (loads of chemical knowledge needed there) to help the public good basically. It wows me because I have no skill in that area of life, and I wonder if their/your STEM interest is connected to 3rd slot Ti? Not sure if this resonates for others here. But yet another ISFJ I know wants to be a botanist. These things I've never thought about doing!
Also ISFJs are generally really nice and pleasant to be around. My father's girlfriend is also an ISFJ and she is a great bank teller, a great mother, and is super quirky in fun ways. Idk I love y'all!
Most ISFJs I know like Myth Busters. Is this a thing?
My only sadness is that the ISFJs I know rarely text/message/etc me. It's like I'm forgotten after I'm no longer around them for a period of time. I mean this in hopefully not a needy way. I mean this in a I really VALUE ISFJs and like their input. I usually send ppl memes I think they'll enjoy and ISFJs just won't answer back across the board if I have moved or no longer work where they do. I don't understand? Not sure if this is something others see in the INFP-ISFJ friendship? 
My most exasperated example is that my best friend in college who I saw weekly for two years straight stopped contacting me after I graduated and didn't message me back for a year. I did later confront her about this in writing and told her I needed closure on the friendship because she had meant so much to me for so long. She was the maid of honor at my wedding. AKA, my depression over this friendship not existing was huge and confusing. I wanted to know what I did wrong. When she finally got back to me a year later, she said it was because she didn't want to bother me by talking to me. She wrote up this whole thing about feeling guilty like she would burden me by responding to my quirky memes. And that the distance apart and the time that kept passing seemed to make her responses seem awkwarder. I was like...they were for you specifically! Why would it bother me??? We were talking for a good week solid after that and then she went back to not messaging me again for a whole year and going now. This could be unhealthy behavior or she could have just not wanted to hurt me with her Fe. She could have told me I was garbage and I would have still admired the time we were friends though. I was at that point of just needing to know the truth. I still idealize her and wish she'd talk to me but I've stopped trying."
3210,isfj,"EXTREMELY SAME. I respect their idealism--I am too critical and pessimistic  a lot of the time (what I term ""realistic"" haha). 
I admire their ability to maintain all kinds of interpersonal boundaries without explicit statements (seriously amazing).
But we do take a long time to get along, I'd say 1-2 years of weekly contact on average. And the Fe-Fi difference has produced some big clashes at times. One abandoned me without warning when I started having issues with a professional who was of the same profession as him. They didn't know each other or anything, it was that my friend took my sadness about this person as a critique of him personally."
3211,isfj,"wow I really loved this comment, I understand your reasons about not idealizing INFPs. I've never encountered any of them who idolize me either, but I feel like no one, of any type has ever felt that way about me actually haha. Nonetheless, my best friend (INFP) always tells me that I've helped her change things that she doesn't like about herself, and she always thanks me for being so patient and comprehensive with her, for helping her and giving a hand whenever she needs me. Maybe I feel like nobody idolizes me because I always feel like I'm the one giving to others, but they usually don't thank me for that or recognize my effort, but it doesn't bother me because as an ISFJ it's something I do naturally."
3212,isfj,"I really love their huge capacity of being creative, and most of the INFPs I know of are artists (who I really admire besides of the fact of their personality type). Their way of seeing the world and expressing how they see it is one of the things that make me idealize them the most, because I love the way they look at small details of life but make them seem like the most amazing thing they've seen in their life. How they make everything somewhat poetic, metaphoric, romantic."
3213,isfj,"wow, thank you so much for your nice comments about us ISFJs! well, what you mention about your ISFJ friends being good at science is very interesting to me because, in my case, I've always been interested in arts but in the technical and more science-oriented side of it, if that makes sense (sound engineering, traditional and digital animation, film editing), also when I was in high school all my friends used to hate scientific subjects, but I used to be very good at them and usually understood very quickly (except chemistry, I sucked at that haha). I think your Ti hypothesis must be the reason behind that behavior.
and oh man, do I love Myth Busters... I could watch that program all day and never get tired.
about the last part of your comment, it's interesting because one of the first strong arguments I had with my INFP best friend was because I didn't reply to her texts and I seemed very distant whenever we were on vacation or something (we used to go to the same high school at that time). She used to get really angry at me about that and well, one of the reasons because I didn't text her was precisely what your friend told you: I felt like my messages could annoy her in some way, like I could be interrupting some important activity she was doing. Also, I wasn't used to texting people first because I've always been a very lonely person, very shy too, and it was really hard for me to talk to people about anything, even if they started the conversation. After a lot of arguments and conversations about the subject she made me understand that it was more annoying for her if I didn't text or reply than if I interrupted something she was doing, and now we live in peace haha. But yeah, something I've noticed about INFPs is that you guys have a very strong capacity and need of expression, and I still feel kinda guilty for not replying to her back then, because I know she had a lot of things to express. It's a shame that your friend stopped talking to you though :( It'd be nice if she reappeared in your life."
3214,isfj,"I relate so much to this! My best friend is an INFP and we had to spend like four years of constant contact (we studied together in high school and then we used to speak everyday by text), we had many discussions because of that taking-things-personally thing, but after a lot of ups and downs we now have a very close relationship (it's been like ten years since we met)
One of the things I admire the most about them is their idealism, and as you mention, I often find myself being critical and pessimistic. They build fantasy with real life and that for me is really cool haha"
3215,isfj,Yeah I agree with these. A lot of them are good at seeing the romantic aspects or even make stuff romantic which apparently are not. My father (INFP) was a biochemistry professor and was always talking so lively about proteins and even loved some of them. He was seeing different cellular behaviors as if they had personalities. His passion was so infectious and inspiring. I think you would find them very often in academic careers. I’m sure a lot of passionate professors are INFP. He had a lot of effect on me and inspired me to follow computational biology as CS major. Even now I sometimes use him as a source of inspiration.
3216,isfj,"Interesting!! The artsy side of science makes sense. Like there needing to be a creative link in there. The stereotype is that a lot of ISFJs are nurses but I've only ever known one ISFJ nurse lol there mist be something to that.
I went to a live Myth Busters show with that old bff ISFJ of mine. I was like...they do live shows?? I went because of how excited she was.
Yeah it sounds on point then. Why would you feel like you're interrupting something? Do you feel interrupted often? My brain has problems computing this. I usually send messages at odd times and expect a response within the next few days of sending it. I usually assume ppl will get back to me when they can."
3217,isfj,"woooow, your father sounds like such an amazing person, I would definitely have loved him as a teacher, that precisely is what makes me love INFPs, the way they make even the smallest of things have such a wonderful way of being, and how they can make me see stuff in that magical and amazing way, they make me fall in love with whatever they're talking about, I'm always impressed by that."
3218,isfj,"omg same, I've only known of one ISFJ nurse. I guess that stereotype is not as accurate. And wow, I didn't know there were Myth Busters live shows!!
by the time I used to not text my friend, I felt like she had more interesting things to do than talking to me and I didn't want her to invest her time in replying to my messages, because for me she needed her space to do her stuff, I always thought it would be better if I waited for her to talk to me first, that way we would talk when she wasn't busy and whenever she really wanted to talk. When she texted and I didn't reply it was mainly because I was doing something and I forgot to text back and then it was a bit awkward. That doesn't happen anymore though, because if someone texts me and I'm busy I'll reply whenever I have time, and I would expect other people to do the same for me. Nonetheless, sometimes I just don't have anything to say and I won't force the conversation unless I reaaaally want to talk to the person."
3219,isfj,"Yeah he was definitely an awesome teacher. i would say Robbin Williams and his character in the movie Dead Poet Society was a stereotypical INFP.
The stuff you said are definitely their superpower. 
Having said that, everyone has their own flaws besides their superpowers and that’s the gist of MBTI and Jung’s theories. I don’t think idolizing people is a good idea ..INFPs flaws are mostly show up when  they build up strong feeling for some stuff when the feelings shouldn’t be even relevant and that makes them sometimes irrational and difficult to deal/talk with."
3220,isfj,"I agree with this 100%. That's something I've seen in INFPs I've met through my life, and I've had really strong arguments because of those problems, but I still feel a compromise with helping them deal with that characteristic of their personality, and it's very satisfying for me to know that I did a good job helping someone. At the end of the day, I think it's amazing how everyone has different flaws and superpowers and how we can all complement each other to make things work out in life."
3221,isfj,"Fe doesn’t feel natural to me. i have the urge to help others, and also have empathy for them, but i can quickly switch it off immediately making me very cold in a instant. when i try to act on my Fe, it feels awkward and tiring. 
i think i’m in a Si-Ti loop at the moment. i’ve seen the other post made about it but am still unsure about how to use Fe to break it."
3222,isfj,"In Socionics Fe is our “tool” function (everyone’s 2nd function is). So it makes sense you’d be able to switch it off. This is common with me. In the moment I can pull Fe out and be that sweet and charming with a hint of modesty (typical Si/Fe combo), but once I’m alone I just turn it off. It’s a bit of a chore to use on my end as well, even though I enjoy it at the same time. I think his is normal to varying degrees for isfjs (or any type with their 2nd function)."
3223,isfj,"Check out These two links it provides solid information about how to use Auxilary Fe and Tertiary Ti properly.

3224,isfj,"I was just curious to see how many people here are programmers, and if so, which aspects of computer science do you find easier to understand over others?
Do you find that our personality is conducive for the logical thinking that is required to write modular and efficient code?
For myself, learning functional languages, such as Scheme or Haskell, was very very difficult. But I had absolutely no issues picking up C# or Java. 
What do you guys think?"
3225,isfj,"I code for a small startup in Santa Barbara.  I find myself in a position where I'm good at finding bugs and making the code in general more efficient, so I'm usually placed in some sort of quality assurance position.  Picking up Java and C# wasn't too hard but I had been to exposed to it since early in high school, however, learning other languages is actually a little bit difficult for me.  Personally, when I write code, I try to be as precise and as perfect as I can, which actually hurts me a little in my overall progress. 
I'm still in school studying statistics right now which I find much more interesting, and coding tends to be pretty draining for me. Just a little about my own situation."
3226,isfj,"I typically only really understand higher level programming languages like Java, C# and Python.  I'm good a coding smaller tools and applications, but when it comes to something bigger, it takes me a long time to complete or I don't complete it at all.  I get hung up on all the little details and will constantly test every little line of code.  I like to know I'm doing it correctly at every point.  I can't just sit down code lots of code and review it later.  I think it has to do with visualizing what the code will do in my mind; I have a hard time with that.  I honestly couldn't do it for a regular job."
3227,isfj,"My Arm Architecture prof was an Isfj and he was regarded by the school as world class. I'm not an ISFJ so I'd bring my somehow working mess of code to him. Mainly for entertainment, and also because he wanted comments to describe how it would work, because a lot of the time I really didn't know how it did. He was always so enthralled because it was just so messed up yet still working. 
Then he'd show me his and it was always the most elegant solution ever. Like a 10th of the code I had. Also extremely robust, it would work well even if you had to change the parameters of the input. 
He was also way more caring than any of the other comp sci teachers and really didn't want me to drop out, so you definitely bring a much needed human aspect to the work environment too."
3228,isfj,"I just do statistical coding in a program called SAS. It usually takes me longer to figure out what to do than my peers, but once I do it, my code is impeccable. It is beautiful, and therefore when a mistake is made that is overlooked first time around, it is super easy to find and correct the error. When I look at my peers' code, I usually get frustrated because their code is so sloppy to me."
3229,isfj,"Thought some of you might enjoy this quotation... :)
""Most of my life has been spent trying to shrink myself. Trying to become smaller. Quieter. Less sensitive. Less opinionated. Less needy. Less me. Because I didn’t want to be a burden. I didn’t want to be too much or push people away. I wanted people to like me. I wanted to be cared for and valued. I wanted to be wanted. So for years, I sacrificed myself for the sake of making other people happy. And for years, I suffered. But I’m tired of suffering, and I’m done shrinking. It’s not my job to change who I am in order to become someone else’s idea of a worthwhile human being. I am worthwhile. Not because other people think I am, but because I exist, and therefore I matter. My thoughts matter. My feelings matter. My voice matters. And with or without anyone’s permission or approval, I will continue to be who I am and speak my truth. Even if it makes people angry. Even if it makes them uncomfortable. Even if they choose to leave. I refuse to shrink. I choose to take up space. I choose to honor my feelings. I choose to give myself permission to get my needs met. I choose to make self-care a priority. I choose me."" — Daniell Koepke"
3230,isfj,"We had been friends for a couple years and got pretty close the last few months. We were both pretty much loners and bonded more whem we both lost our jobs. 
I swear he had romantic feelings for me too, there were little signs. Everyone I talked to agreed that these were probably signs of romantic interest. So I opened myself up, very scary for me because I didnt want to lose him as a friend. And now won't talk to me.
I understand if he changed his mind or even never felt that way at all about me. But why wouldn't he just say that instead of shutting me out? Is there a chance that I did something else completely unrrlated to make him hate me and he just used this as a reason of sorts to finish off our friendship?
I know no one else can say whats in another person's head, but I've got no where else to turn. I lost my best friend in this and all I know is that he might have a hard time expressing his emotions. I dont know if there is something I can do to help or not. 
As much as I hate this for myself, I hate to think i am the cause of him toiling away inside his own head. I've seen how badly it effects him when someone close to him did some really shitty things. In a way i hope he's just decided to hate me and move on, just so he won't be tortured in his own head. 
I dont know what I'm asking for here, but thanks for listening."
3231,isfj,"I'm a little sleep deprived so I'm not going to try and give you any deep and insightful advice, but I will say that as an ISFJ, I can be very avoidant. If I don't know how to handle something without hurting feelings, or if I feel there's potential for conflict and I'm in a place where I can't handle confronting that anxiety, I sometimes just avoid dealing with things at all costs. There have been times when I've avoided speaking to my best friend for weeks because I've felt like I haven't been a good enough friend and can't stand the guilt and anxiety. It's a totally counterproductive impulse, but not everyone copes well :P 
As you've said though, it's impossible to know what's really going on with him unless you ask and he tells you. Whatever the cause, I'm really sorry that you're having to deal with this :( It sounds really heartbreaking, so I hope you're able to talk things out with him and figure out what's going on, or at the very least recover well and quickly💕
Edit: A word"
3232,isfj,"My husband is ISFJ, and he told me he liked me as just a friend multiple times haha. I was persistent though, and we've been happily married for 7 years now. If you think he's the one, prove it to him. :)"
3233,isfj,"Thank you for taking time to reply.
I completely understand about not coping well with things, its just very different things that i have trouble with.
In your opinion, should i try to talk to him about this face to face? (hes not taking calls or responding to texts)  would that help him feel like talking about it or would it make him feel defensive or more uncomfortable and i should wait for him to maybe come around in his own time?"
3234,isfj,"Thank you for your insight. I know that the last time we were together I didnt feel super wanted, like i usually do, even though he specifically invited me over.
I think he might be upset because a mutual friend is buying a house and he really wants to do that, was very close to doing it till he got laid off. He is, of course, happy for our friend.
It was the next day that i told him how i felt though. I didnt realize until later that the house thing may have upset him. Or maybe i had done something to upset him before that. But would he have invited me over if he were upset with me? Ive never known one time that he was ever upset with me, just a bit annoyed when i couldn't  decide about dinner.
We've never done things in a group and always seem to watch movies, listen to music or go hiking alone together. He really needs to get out into nature, (that feeds his soul)  but hasnt wanted to for a while. I've actually been a little concerned.  But there's no pushing him if he doesnt want to, he flat doesnt.
But it's more that he's broken off all communication so it would be me showing up on his door step. We have no occasion to see each other in any other setting unless i go to his work, which i could because i used to work there and sometimes drop in to say hi. But he'd be working. Plus i dont think he'd appreciate it too much if he felt i was doing it to check in on him. Plus people there always seemed to think we were dating so if that came up........if he doesnt feel that way about me, more pressure, am i right? 
In light of all that, would the occasional friendly text be something that would break through the awkwardness? Or maybe he just doesnt want anything to do with me anymore, in which case that would be more like harrassment, so maybe not a good idea.
I guess at this point i just wonder if he flat hates me. But no one else can answer that but him. Had i known this was his response i wouldnt have ever said anything.  I prepared myself for everything but this. 
Thank you for your reply. It does help me. I didnt mean to go on a rant. All our types are so different, but in many ways alike. It helps to read what you have to say, and to talk it out. It helps me tune in a little to his ""frequency"" and at least understand, even if its not fixable. Thank you. "
3235,isfj,"I actually believe that at some point he had romantic feelings for me. There were so many signs and I also know that he had a huge heart break when he was much younger. (Which  I believe has maybe kept hom from persuing romantic relationships since. Were talking  like 30 years ago.) But he doesn't feel that way about me now or anymore...which ever it is. I respect those feelings and we are still friends. We talked it out and all is well. I am so glad that he didn't just hate me or feel too uncomfortable to continue our friendship because he is so important to me. I can handle keeping him in my life as a friend. I would have  been heartbroken to lose him altogether. 
We are both mature adults and it seems we  can continue a friendship with no problems. 
Thank you so much for your reply.  It adds to my understanding of things. "
3236,isfj,"Thanks for the encouragement. I'm not sure mine is the same situation and I wouldn't even know how to go about pushing the subject without completely disregarding his feelings.  But I am soooo curious, why did your husband say he didn't feel romantically about you? Was he shy? Did he change his mind? I'm just dying to know. "
3237,isfj,"Ahh that's a really tough question, I'm not sure I have any good advice.... If you really feel prepared for the fact that he may reject an attempt to talk to him, I guess go for it? I genuinely have no idea why he's clammed up like he has (romance isn't an area where my avoidance kicks in, so I'm a little mystified by his response as well), but if you're already not talking, I can't see how a genuine and kind attempt to open up communication could hurt things. Depending on how long it's been since things went south, maybe just give it a few days for him to work things out in his head? 
My advice to everyone on every subject is to just always try to think about what the other person may be going through, and to be kind and not assume. If you do talk, use your ""I"" statements, be gentle, be open to trying to understand his perspective, etc. I don't have the sense that that's something you have particular trouble with, but the reminder can't hurt lol. It really can be incredible how wildly differently people will view the same situation. "
3238,isfj,"Hey, you might want to read up on Enneagram 9, which is a common type for both INFPs and ISFJs.
ISFJ 9s are big on comfort zones, and inner and outer peace. Any move that would ""rock the boat"" might be very challenging for them to face or accept."
3239,isfj,"He just said he had feelings for someone else and didnt like me like that. He is a generally shy person. But over time, he just kept getting closer and closer. Things like, telling me I looked lovely tonight, or rubbing my hand when we were sitting close by, etc. "
3240,isfj,"Hey, thanks again. Ive already given up on the romantic relationship. I just thought we could remain friends. Maybe he sees it differently though. Still i never would have opened up had i not thought the possibility were there on his side as well.
My thing is ""lets talk it out, be honest."" Even if it means the end. No one should have to apologize for how they feel. It does seem considerably unforgiving to just cut ties without a single word. I wouldn't have thought that if him.
Thank you, and maybe you should get some rest now. :)"
3241,isfj,"No problem! I do hope you're able to work it out, the total withdrawal seems really strange to me, too. I will do that occasionally, but only if someone has so seriously hurt me that I don't think it's possible to salvage the relationship. Confessing a crush... doesn't seem like that kind of offense to me. I hope he's willing to at least give you the courtesy of an explanation! 
And thanks, I'll do my best! :) "
3242,isfj,"He just doesn't feel the same way. I thought he would just say so, but he felt uncomfortable saying so. I wouldn't have felt that way, but we are all different. That's why i was so worried when he clammed up, i wondered if i had done something to end our friendship. But no, all is well. "
3243,isfj,"That's great that you got an answer! I hope you guys still remain great friends. I also commend your sharing of your feelings in such a candid and courageous manner. As an ENFJ, I do that too! 
If you never told it to him, you would still be agonising over his answer. Now that you know, you can move on with your life and continue with the friendship with more clarity. Congratulations, I hope you aren't too sad about it :-)"
3244,isfj,"Yes it was very freeing and I feel better and am not all that sad about it actually. I have been kicking myself for making an ass of myself, but honestly it's just like you say. I was starting to not feel or act like myself around him and now I am back to myself again. Thank you for your encouragement and understanding, it makes me feel more normal. ;)"
3245,isfj,"well I don't deal with it very well, that's for sure. I try to ignore it. I will worry about it and then try to go to sleep earlier just so I don't have to think about it lol. I procrastinate working on the problem because I just want to forget it exists. But I can't forget so I worry, worry, worry and stress myself out more and more by my lack of action.
When I finally do take care of it, whatever it is, I'm very relaxed for a moment. But then once one thing is taken care of, I start to freak out about the next impending problem. I often stress myself out so much thinking about the next problem I'm never actually enjoying myself.
sooo I will be interested to see some of the replies to this!"
3246,isfj,"I tend to do ok with stress up until a point, then I have a minor breakdown, then I'm ok again for a while. I finally had to start telling myself, over and over when I screw something up, that it doesn't matter, it wasn't my fault, or there's nothing I can do about it, depending on the situation.  Otherwise I was killing myself mentally. I actually had a mental breakdown last year due to stress. But I'm getting back to where I was before. "
3247,isfj,I ignore it until its literally in my face and then i cry. my INTP GF tends to be very upset with me whenever i fail to handle a problem (for good reason). my ignorance tactics include video games and youtube and T.V. and working lots (well over 50 hours a week dedicated).
3248,isfj,"I made rules for myself. Sick? Don't work out. Emotionally drained? Work with less effort. Mentally drained? Reduce personal responsibility of emotionally intense situations. If two of the three things I listed are an issue, absolutely no skipping on sleep under any circumstances. Before the rules, I'd stretch myself too thin and break down."
3249,isfj,"I can only speak for myself,  but romantic relationships these days are pointless.  You see I work for a Union and  it consists of a lot of traveling,  In the back of my head I don't wanna be working my ass off and having someone behind my back screwing someone else . It's almost impossible to find someone to be faithful.  It's honestly like finding a needle in a haystack .. "
3250,isfj,"I had the shitty cheating ex who broke my trust. After him I met my now fiancé. I actually met him super fast after my bad breakup and was worried what people were going to say and think I was rebounding etc. But I just had such a strong gut feeling about him that I said screw it and gave it a shot. I had huge trust issues with him at first. He was pretty patient with me but finally after about 6 months said look, I’m not that guy and I never will be - you need to either give me the shot or I can’t do this. I didn’t want to lose him, so I worked hard on myself and trusting him. I still had my issues and it probably took me a year or so to feel like I could really trust the person that he is. 
I get it, so many people are shitty. My best advice is keep trying, but ALWAYS trust your gut instinct. 
Edit: I’ll also throw out their family helped me a lot. Cheating ex - it was always weird with his family. My fiancé now, it’s been comfortable with his and the way he was with them helped me learn to trust him easier. "
3251,isfj,"I'm married to an ISFJ woman and I was also her first boyfriend. From what she said about it, maybe you just have to really wait for the right person? She was just really focused on her studies and work before we met, but we hit it off and now here we are. (EDIT: To clarify: she still is really focused on that, but now she just has a relationship.) We still have some difficulties since our outlooks and concerns are so different, but over time they've actually complemented pretty well. 
Travel and distance are difficult, especially if it's a new relationship, but ya never know. Sometimes taking the risk of getting hurt pays off!"
3252,isfj,"I was 21 before I got into any relationship... before I even got my first kiss lol. My now boyfriend jokes that I had high standards and a long checklist he had to go through before I ever deemed him “worthy” haha. Jokes aside, I think there’s some truth to what he said in that I put my relationship in a high regard, so if I see some indicator that a relationship might not work out with you, you’re automatically “not in the game” (i never really thought of it that way but i guess that’s what it seemed to other people whelp)
Ultimately, for me, if I can’t be friends with you, then we can’t pursue anything further than that. If I can’t joke around with you, if i can’t be vulnerable around you, if I can’t trust you, etc etc then I won’t bother pursuing a relationship with you. 
I’ve been with my boyfriend for more than a year now, our relationship had some difficulties at the beginning due to circumstances, but we got through that and we’re veeeryyy happy now :)"
3253,isfj,"This sounds exactly like how I'd imagine many ISFJs feel about relationships. God forbid they get in the way of good old fashioned work! And holy trust issues Batman! The paranoia is real!
I don't mean to tease, I know all that comes from life experience. Still...Come play with us! You're too fun to work all the time! 
-An ENFP male"
3254,isfj,"I am my happiest self in a relationship....and I’m not ashamed of that. So many people say “you should love yourself and be able to give yourself that happiness without a partner” and sure, you should love yourself and not RELY on someone else for worth. But the intensity of emotions I have while single are nothing compared to me being in love with someone; it’s literally life affirming. I feel like it’s my life’s purpose to love and nurture someone. It’s very important to me and so so rewarding. 
That being said, it’s fucking hard. I wear my heart on my sleeve (despite trying so hard not to). If I connect well with someone and feel reciprocation, it’s impossible to stay ahead of my emotions. I have struggled most with falling for someone too fast, becoming needy and desperate (super frustrating since I consider myself to be highly independent and self sufficient), getting frustrated when they can’t give me straight answers or understand their own emotions and ultimately end up lashing out at them (completely counterproductive and likely a defense mechanism). Then I feel like shit about myself and want to apologize compulsively. 
I wouldn’t say I have trust issues—but then again I have never been cheated on explicitly. I am just generally drawn to xSxP types who have no idea what they want and who are wishy washy with commitment. It’s the best and worst thing. Every time I’m hurt from the above scenario, I swear I’m never doing that again. So that’s my only “trust” issue. But then inevitably I find myself in the same position in the future. Oh well. "
3255,isfj,"So... a little late (okay, a lot, I'm sorry, work has been busy!), but I am finally starting to flex my AutoModerator muscles and actually getting that set up. I want to make it so that it posts weekly threads with recurring themes, but I don't want to make it the same theme all the time. I'm thinking that maybe themes could refresh every month or so, depending on how many we have.
I'm thinking we could have one about functions (or at least about Si), another one about weekly accomplishments, one to chat about work or school or whatever, one about pets... etc. Any suggestions? Throw 'em here! Thanks guys!"
3256,isfj,"Function-specific threads sound interesting!  I'll suggest adding a ""dumb questions for ISFJs"" thread for people like me who have ISFJs in our lives and sometimes have questions about them that don't really justify a whole post"
3257,isfj,"I (INTJ) recently had one of my friends take the MBTI after he expressed interest in personality types. Being roommates in college, we both are experiencing stress which would be common however, he is having problems with actually going to class which can easily become a big problem since he is currently on academic probation with the university. I want to know what I can do to assist with him getting the motivation to get up and not get kicked out."
3258,isfj,"In that case, start by talking to him. You don't have enough information yet to intervene, and ""helping"" when you're not wanted isn't helpful. Kind of you to notice--do the right thing and communicate about it."
3259,isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJs,
Before discovering Myers Briggs, I always sort of contemplated why I could bond quite easily with some people while others it was more difficult/forced. I blamed myself thinking I just had lousy social skills, but after finding out my personality type and the types of my closest friends, I made a connection.
The people I instantly bonded with are INFJ (3 of them) and INFP (2). These same people are ones I remain close to and conversation comes quite naturally and it's easy to open up.
However, I know 2 ESFPs and even though I bonded with them, I find I put up a wall around how I truly feel.
I was wondering if any of you have shared similar experiences as I have in regards to who you bond with? What personality types do you feel you make an instant connection to? I'd love to hear your input!"
3260,isfj,"My beloved best friend is an ENFP, and I've been really close with an INFP and an INTJ in the past, but those ended badly. I'm not sure of the types of my other friends, but I think a lot of introverts mostly? I like (mature) extroverted feelers best though, because I find them very welcoming and easy to talk to. I struggle a lot with friendship and conversation since the aforementioned friendships which ended badly, so it's very soothing to be around someone who's capable of leading the discussion. "
3261,isfj,"one is INTP and the other is INTJ. I have another close friend who ended up being the extroverted version of me which seemed to fit us perfectly so she's ESFJ. 
My friends that are E's I can't spend as much time with just because they have different definitions of what spending time together involves, and it feels more taxing as opposed to my introverted friends."
3262,isfj,"My wife is an ISFJ and her close friend was an INFP, but had difficulty eventually with her and are no longer close. She felt judged by my wife and kept telling her how she compared herself to her. My wife felt like her friend didn't really like her even though she spent a lot of time trying to help her and spend time with her. 
Her other two close people are her cousin and her grandma, both ESFPs. But she struggles with understanding how irresponsible they are. But they're fun every once and a while. 
I am an INFJ, and were great together! Tons of fun, lots to talk about, we love planning budgets and trips. Playing games EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE. Watching shows together and taking care of people and kids. We do however have totally different outlooks on life. But it keeps me grounded, and I help her take chances and do something she normally wouldn't. 
I find it really funny that most of you on this thread find the same types so nice to be around. Especially since a lot of websites say that we're not super good matches. "
3263,isfj,"Both my two best friends and my girlfriend are INFPs, my next closest friend is an ENFP, and a guy I dated before I met my girlfriend was an ENFP. Apparently I get on really well with xNFPs, it's become a thing lmao. "
3264,isfj,"I'll use two posts I've made in the past:
Around extroverts I tend to let them lead conversations, but around other introverts I tend to initiate."
3265,isfj,"I have 3 close friends that are all INFJs, and then some ENFPs, INFPs, and an INTP. I've also been pretty close with some ENFJs but I've recently come to realize that I don't get along with them all that well..."
3266,isfj,"I guess social in this case meaning most willing to make acquaintances/friends or just most willing to want to talk to people? (Not necessarily most talkative)
In theory it makes sense since Fe wants to sense and notice the responses from the world/people and Si means being very observant of all the details of our physical surroundings."
3267,isfj,"I think other introvert types might have different strengths in social situations. I love being out in public and observing people. But when I'm in a group and its my turn to talk, I get overwhelming anxiety if I'm around people I'm not comfortable with. My fiance however, who is an INFJ, hates the thought of being around people, but once he is, he can adapt better than I can and hold a conversation with confidence like he does it all the time. INFJs are actually commonly mistaken for extroverts."
3268,isfj,"i kind of have to force myself to spend time with people. i know that if i don't, i'll drift into isolation and detach from my friends.
i like talking to strangers though, but i don't want to connect with them beyond that initial interaction."
3269,isfj,"Many of my friends are introverts as well, and I usually find that I am the one arranging gatherings/plans, despite how much I hate organizing such things...not sure what that says about me. I don't think of myself as super social, but I like select social situations sometimes. Maybe it's just a matter of having control over the social situation. It stresses me out, but I like when things are planned ahead of time."
3270,isfj,"In my experience, ISFJs require a lot of socialization, or at least a close friend group. I know two ISFJs who are somewhat isolated and only have a few friends; it makes them really unhappy. Whenever they do get the chance to hangout with people or socialize, they get really excited/happy and then get social anxiety motormouth where they sort of talk nonstop. I never get like that. I can't remember the last time I craved random social interaction.
I feel like my social quota needs are wayyyyyy lower than the ISFJs I know. I could just talk to 2 people my whole life and be totally fine. ISFJs seem to need more than that. "
3271,isfj,"They are the most common type -- 13.8% of the US population. (ISTJ is second at 11.6%.)
People tend to socialize because they are comfortable in the environment, and a great contributor to social comfort is ""relatability."" So, assuming that roughly 1/4 of the US population is IS_J, it is likely these types, while preferring Introversion, live in a world with many people they can relate to. 
Additionally, ISFJs are Extraverted Feelers, and Extraverted Feeling often motivates one to act according to the behaviors of those around them. Almost half of the US Population prefers Extraversion, and so it makes sense that an ISFJ using Extraverted Feeling would often be in situations where they are compelled to be more social than other Introverted types.
Source for MBTI type breakdown: How Frequent Is My Type?"
3272,isfj,"I would definitely agree with this. I absolutely want to connect, but I don't want to be the centre of attention or talk the most. I like connecting by being a fly on the wall, at least to start with. I like observing and then making my way into an social interaction with some background information sort-of. I don't feel comfortable going headlong into any sort of interaction or relationship whatsoever. Maybe that is how the introversion plays a role? I know it can even appear or come off as snobby at first when in reality it's just, ""I need to take my time and collect some information before making an attempt."" Lol. "
3273,isfj,"Hello, 
I found a few months ago an interesting picture on the Internet about extroverted introverts, telling that: 
IxFJ are extroverted with emotional interactions
IxTJ are extroverted with intellectual interactions
INxP are extroverted with exploring possibilities
ISxP are extroverted with doing.
I've experienced that (as an ISFJ, and with such other types).
And it really makes sense with MBTI in general, understanding the cognitive functions. Do I feel.
Depends on what we're talking about, as says the picture   :-)"
3274,isfj,"There was a year or two in high school and college where I didn't have a close group to hang with and I consider those the worst times in my school career. While I had a few acquaintances, I guess I would call it social anxiety but I was too shy to actually go up to new people again.
However, once I found my anime group and a bunch of really close friends I got really excited and I think my social life got better with finding a bunch of really close friends slowly.
While I'm basically best friends with my brother I really like having a lot of good connections."
3275,isfj,"I'm an INFJ, but writing to see if any ISFJ is relatable to this topic 'cause they have the function of their extraverted feeling is as big as ours.
As a person with extraverted feeling, I, by my very nature, seek for emotional connections, harmony and soulful beautiful moments. However, in many business/office settings, this nature is not needed or even become bait that attracts narcissistic professionals. They feed off other people's emotions, especially people in management/HR positions, they try to control and oppress their employees, and when we show our frustration/sadness, voila! that's what they had waited for and their tidbit.
Another aspect of business is... I need to deal with cold-hearted assholes who never ever care about me or others. I am okay with technical/dry conversations with someone who just concentrates on business, but can't stand having conversations with someone who sees me just as his supply/slave, not as a human and who doesn't care about my feelings/health/opinions at all...(There's a clear line between being 'businesslike' and 'cold')
I'm not certified to teach in public school, provide medical treatments or work for church (all of which seem to demand more extraverted feelings), so I end up working with narcissistic office people, sigh.
I know the degree of extraverted feeling varies (mine is 65 %) and some people with extraverted feeling don't suffer as much as I do."
3276,isfj,"I would disagree with the INTJ one. Planning for the potential of a disaster would be part of any good plan. Assuming we think of all the possibilities, that also includes the potential of a disaster thus it would already be taken into account."
3277,isfj,"Really? I thought it was pretty accurate, when you take into account uncertainty. For me the most stressful time in the last year was when I realized I didn't qualify for the PhD programs I was applying to and I had no idea what I was going to do for an entire extra year. The future looked like a void and I just wanted to die."
3278,isfj,"Yes! Also oftentimes I'll remember a food from my childhood but when I try to make it, it just doesn't come out the same. The slightest difference is noticeable... So irritating.
Possibly has something to do with the fact that I also don't enjoy trying new foods. I am, over time, expanding my palate, but I have to do it on my own terms."
3279,isfj,"Yes, I've always been able to differentiate small changes in the food I eat. Though I don't think it bothers me unless it's my favorite thing to order from somewhere.
Often times I'm excited to see how something can taste differently and how that can possibly improve a dish or improve it upon trying to ""fix"" it. I also get kind of excited to see the many ways people can mess up a food. But I don't know why that excites me.
Though i was very sad when my favorite chinese restaurant brought on a new chef on the down low and the sauces were tweaked slightly. It was still delicious, but not in the same way I loved. I had to mix in a touch of sweetness from another dish to get it closer to the taste I knew."
3280,isfj,"Any isfjs on antidepressants? Which kind (ie class- ssri, Snri, etc; type - Wellbutrin, Zoloft, etc). What’s your experience been?
For me Paxil messed me up, made me loose inhibitions. 
Ever since, I’ve sworn off AD, but I really am considering them again. I’ve tried so many natural lifestyle changes (working out, sunshine, learning new skills, etc), but it just doesn’t seem like enough. Considering trying Wellbutrin because it works on dopamine (Paxil works on serotonin). Although I’ve heard both horror stories and positive outcomes from WB (as per all AD). So I’m terrified to really start, but on the other end, I’m terrified to never know if that could have been that extra push that makes my life even 10% more do-able.
Side note: I’ve also done therapy for a year now and plan to continue.
I figured that perhaps there could be a correlation to type and their experience on certain ADs.
In short: what’s your AD experience been? Type?"
3281,isfj,Currently on an ssri after trying a few different medications. Honestly my entire world has changed. I went from wanting to jump off a bridge to exercising every day and going on regular dates in about 4 months. There are a few annoying side effects but I'd take them any day over crying for no reason all the time
3282,isfj,"I’ve been on 300mg of Wellbutrin & 10mg of Lexapro (both low doses). They’ve done a world of difference for me. Initially I was supposed to take one in the morning & one at night, but it would keep me up at night. (I forgot which was which).... nothing other than meds has been able to help.. no side effects for me w/ either of these btw!
Good luck!"
3283,isfj,"ISFJ, diagnosed with depression and mild anxiety. I’ve been prescribed Escitalopram and took it for a little more than a month. Definitely helped stabilize my mood and stopped the random crying spree at night. Had rashes for a week which went away eventually. The only downsides were that it lowered my sex drive and that they’re expensive here. I no longer take them and haven’t gone back to my therapist. Don’t be like me."
3284,isfj,"I've been on sertraline (which I think is Zoloft, I'm from the UK so its Lustral for me) for about a year and a half now, starting on 50mg and moving to 100mg after a year. It's worked really well for me, its improved my depression and anxiety all around, from me being too depressed to leave my bed most days. The only downside I've experienced is gaining around 21lbs, but I kinda needed to gain weight anyway tbh."
3285,isfj,"Hi hi I’ve been on Zoloft for about 3 years now for social anxiety and subsequent depression. It’s done wonders for me. At first I had some annoying side effects (apathy, difficulty orgasming) but those have simmered out now that I have my dosing and time of day in which I medicate down. 
I do still have a couple side effects that bother me—drowsiness, difficulty waking up in the morning, night terrors/sweats—but I’ve put up with those. 
Zoloft has helped me really embrace therapy and work through my self worth issues that I was just too anxious to deal with otherwise. I’ve made tons of progress bc of it."
3286,isfj,"I’ve been on antidepressants for the past 7 or so years. I’ve tried Celexa and Wellbutrin in the past but didn’t really like them. Currently taking Zoloft, and it works well. Only annoying side effect for me is dry mouth - like super dry. I’m in the process of slowly weaning off of Zoloft now (with my psychiatrist’s help), and it’s difficult. I need to start incorporating regular exercise into my schedule before I completely wean off. I’m honestly kind of scared of how my brain react since I’ve been on it for so long. Ideally, I won’t have to take anything and can manage my depression with diet, exercise, social life, etc, but I need to get my crap together first. It’s tough juggling everything (school, work, exercise, diet, sleep). I know non-pharmaceutical methods aren’t enough for some people, and I may be one of those. Who knows? We’ll see how it goes. Trial and error."
3287,isfj,I’ve been on fluoxetine for years. I developed an anxiety disorder in my early 20’s and some mild depression. I’m on 40mg a day now. I was recently put on Wellbutrin as well. I had trouble motivating myself to do anything and when I did I was totally overwhelmed when I realized how much I had let slip. They’ve made a world of difference for me. I have the motivation to do more now than I have in a really long time.
3288,isfj,"10mg of Lexapro for about 10 years now... my MD and I have tried weaning myself off twice now, but my depression symptoms always returned, so looks like I'll just be a life-long low-dose anti-depressant taker.."
3289,isfj,Bupropion (generic Wellbutrin) for a few years. It definitely treats the fatigue but just that one symptom of the depression in my experience. They recommended taking it in the morning but that wreaked havoc on my sleep schedule. I found much more success taking it at night.
3290,isfj,"I used to be on Paxil and another medication that I can't remember the name of for general anxiety disorder. That was years ago. I had to stop because it caused severe drowsiness. One day I fell off the sidewalk and into traffic on the way to my mom's workplace. Thankfully the car stopped before hitting me but the driver freaked out (thought I was drunk). Stopped taking it ever since.
I wish I could say that I have better control of my anxiety, but I don't. I'm still trying to figure out something that works for me without medication. I don't have the luxury of looking into another prescription right now so I have to look at other options."
3291,isfj,"I started out taking Lexapro. I thought it really helped but it was impossible for me to orgasm when taking it. My doctor then switched me to Prozac which worked very well but it made me gain a ton of weight. The only other side effect I had from the Prozac was a lowered sex drive, but at least when I did have sex I could enjoy it. I decided to wean myself off it because I had gained so much weight. Was off it for about a year (normal depression during this time but nothing extreme). Then recently I started having suicidal thoughts again so decided I should go back on an anti depressant. I told my doctor my concerns about gaining weight. I never lost the weight I gained from the Prozac but I’ve been heavy my whole life. Constantly yo yo dieting but giving up easily because I never have the motivation to do anything. She decided to put me on Wellbutrin thinking it would help me lose weight. I’m currently taking it and didn’t really think it was helping very much until I went back to the doctor for a follow up and took a depression questionnaire. At that point I realized I hadn’t had any suicidal thoughts and that it was much easier to get out of bed in the mornings. I’m still not sure how I feel about it though. 
When I’m not on antidepressants, I definitely have my lows, but when I’m not depressed, I am a very happy, bubbly person. I never feel that when I’m on meds. I just feel...blah. Not sad but not necessarily happy either. Since I’ve been on Wellbutrin, I have had multiple coworkers/friends/family ask me daily if I’m okay. I’m just not my usual happy go lucky self. Despite dealing with severe depression, I was always able to hide that part of myself from the outside world. So well that if I ever told anyone I struggled with depression, they would laugh in my face. The only person who has ever seen me during my lowest lows is my husband and I have opened up to my best friend (who also struggles with depression) about it. So currently I am considering coming off the Wellbutrin. I miss feeling happy. I would rather fight my way through the depression and enjoy life during the happy phases, than to never feel anything at all. I’ve also noticed that the Wellbutrin is making me very angry and aggressive. Something I’ve never experienced too much before. It also doesn’t help with my anxiety. It doesn’t make it worse, but it doesn’t make it any better either.
TLDR: I’ve tried Lexapro, Prozac, and I am currently taking Wellbutrin, but I’m just not sure that antidepressants are right for me."
3292,isfj,"Of course! It's Venlafaxine hcl extended release. I went to this after trying Prozac and I think effexor? Could be wrong about that last one.
I definitely think it has made me eat more. Unfortunately I can't directly tell if that's where the weight gain was from as I started exercising heavily right as I started taking these meds. I'm up about 15lbs in 6 months but my body fat percent has stayed relatively constant.
I don't think I care too much. Honestly I think I care less somehow? Not like a lack of inhibition but more down the line that I don't mind if something doesn't go the way I expect it to. I tend to just be ok ""going with the flow"" if you know what I mean.
The only downside so far is delayed orgasm (a bit personal I know) Essentially it takes me a rediculously long time to finish. I have no problem getting an erection though. This can be an upside to some or a downside to others so I guess take it however you like. I also tend to have to go to the bathroom a little more frequently but I'm not sure if that is related. 
Hopefully I answered your questions correctly. If you want to know anything else feel free to ask :)"
3293,isfj,"I honestly don’t remember. Sorry, it was a few years ago. Either it didn’t work very well or I had an adverse effect (headaches?). But my psychiatrist suggested I try Zoloft after that. SSRIs seem to work better for me."
3294,isfj,"Hey! First time post here. I am 100% an ISFJ, and am just wondering if other ISFJs have similar attributes: 


I have zero imagination, and never really have. Even as a child I don't remember much imaginative play. 


I really don't have any interests or curiosity in the world. I am very practical and don't really live outside that.


I am awful at remembering movies, TV shows or books. Even if I've seen them/read them more than once. I know if I like/dislike them, but otherwise can't remember specific details or character names. 


Day to day, my thoughts, inner voice, whatever you want to call it doesn't really think or say too much. For example, if I'm at the grocery store, that's what I'm thinking about - finding x ingredient. If I'm in the car, I'm just driving.  


Bottomline, is I feel like a flat line and boring. And when I look at everyone else, I know they are living richer more interesting lives. 
Is this feeling and the things I described above pretty consistent with other ISFJs?"
3295,isfj,"Could this be a depression thing maybe? Like if youre kinda feeling flat all the time, idk.
I feel some similar things though. I don't really have a drive in life and not many interests. Im just content living day to day and not trying to learn and explore and further my career.
I'm definitely not that imaginative or creative. my bf is intp and his mind wanders and thinks of abstract things and weird ideas. If i daydream itll be very concrete and like grounded in reality. 
Im awful at remember movie and tv details too, like i could never be one of those people that quotes movies all the time. But i think im pretty detail oriented in other (more practical?) ways e.g. remembering where stuff is in the house or random details about friends.
Anyway, theres nothing wrong with you! Youre allowed to feel however you want"
3296,isfj,"Hmm, it’s uncommon on this subreddit but absolutely none of these things apply to me. 
I love to feed my Ne and I spend a lot of time daydreaming. 
I have too many hobbies to really have a hobby. 
My inner voice is always chiming in with intrusive thoughts. 
I delegate a lot of my mental space to remembering fictional characters. 
I consider myself a fairly ISFJish ISFJ, and I also have the depression anxiety wombo combo. 
Maybe it’s an enneagram thing?"
3297,isfj,"There is nothing wrong with you. You are you and for the rest of time there will never be another person just like you. Please trust yourself. It’s easier said than done but please don’t listen too much to what other people think or say. Everyone is going through different moments and life experiences in very much the same way you are going through your own. This makes you the beautiful person you are, and that makes everyone else the beautiful people they are. I don’t know you or your story. You know you better than anyone else ever can and you have a positive effect on this world and other people even if you can’t see it all the time. You can’t see it all the time because you are only human. Perfectly imperfect as we all are."
3298,isfj,"I'm also 100% ISFJ and none of these apply to me. The only one I almost can relate to is #1 because my imagination though decent is not as great as that of others I know but I do remember playing make believe a lot with my sister. 
I don't think anything is wrong with you. Everyone is different:-) However if your worried there is no harm in seeking help."
3299,isfj,"
Yes. I could never really remember character names or plot details even for movies that I love. And I hate that every time I tell someone I like a movie I can only tell them about the general storyline...
"
3300,isfj,"Im isfj but im imaginative yet practical like will be creative but ill save that for my intj subconcious, wait, to put it simply, I am the exact opposite of everything that you're saying. Might you be an istj or might i be not an isfj hmm"
3301,isfj,"This is probably my longest comment ever, sorry. You're not alone!
I don't feel there's anything wrong with you. I will say this with the warning that I have had depression with no cause since I can literally remember, so I don't know what's a personality trait or a symptom I've always had. 
1 - I did have imaginary friends when I was little but my mom would come in my room and say, ""if you can't get along your friends will have to go home."" Me ""playing"" with imaginary friends was just me disagreeing with myself in an empty room lmao. 
I have never liked to draw or paint anything without lines to color inside of. I can't see anything when I try to picture something in my head, it's just black. Ever since I was a little kid I remember trying to picture a glass of water in my head, and if I could do it at ALL it was constantly tipping over, I could not control it. So there was like a ghost image of a tipping over glass of water instead of just ""this is a glass of water."" So i don't feel like I really have any sort of imagination. 
I think this relates to ISFJ because I have noticed a lot of people on this sub asking why we won't talk.... but then they say they asked things like ""what kind of things do you like?"" or ""how are you?"" and got the answers ""I don't know"" and ""good, you?"" I like all sorts of things, are you really expecting me to list all of my interests? If not, you're gonna get a vague answer because I don't feel like trying to prioritize my interests in my head before I say the top 3 or whatever. Also, asking me how I am is considered small talk and you're going to get, ""good, you"" or ""okay, you"" every. single. time. Ask me, ""how are you today? is your back feeling a bit better?"" (or whatever) and you might get more from me, like, ""oh, thanks, you know I am doing pretty well. A little sore but I've been stretching and I think yoga might be helpful but I haven't really gotten into it."" I just can't think up things I don't have to say if that makes any sense at all.
2 - I like reading. I like watching things. I don't want to go outside. I don't want to chit chat. I don't want to go see a movie or go for a walk or stroll on the beach... they have no purpose to me. I will walk to the store or something but ... just go for a walk? Why? I'd love to go see X Movie that I want to see, but just go to the movies as something to do? Why?  
3 - This is not me at all and everyone hates me for it. EVERY story or joke I have relates to a TV show instead of friends because that's who I spend more time with. :( LOL. I can say them word for word, but it's because there are maybe 5 TV shows that I watch, over and over. (30 Rock, Arrested Development, Archer, Brooklyn 99, and Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia with a little bit of Bob's Burgers... and it's been that way for at least 3 years). I don't understand people who have seen like every movie and watch current TV and stuff, though. 
4 - Totally me. I'm going to the store for this ingredient not to plan my wedding in my head while I walk around or whatever. See, even the way I talk about daydreaming shows I kind of don't know how to do it... lol. 
5 - I could probably go the rest of my life without having sex but I do crave the intimacy with certain people. Sometimes I am like I need sex and I need it NOW but that's like... two or three times a year maybe. Sometimes it's just a way to be closer to someone because like...I literally couldn't be closer unless I WAS them. 
There's nothing wrong with you! It depends on how it makes you feel. Do you get sad that you don't watch TV and stuff? Then watch more TV and try to find something actually compelling that interests you. Or read something you're interested in - it doesn't have to be books it can be articles, blogs, subreddits, etc. 
""Richer more interesting lives"" well what would that mean for you then? I mean, I see a girl who used to be my neighbor on Instagram all the time and she's a super beautiful model, in Bali, at clubs, in weird rich mansions on hills, etc.... I never see a picture of her with a friend. Would I love to be that good looking physically? Of course. Would I want to go clubbing 4 nights a week? NO! Would I want to not get to drink what I want at those clubs 4 nights a week so I could stay that hot and club 4 nights a week? NO! Would I want people taking my picture that much? Absolutely not. Does she even get to see where she travels if she's always traveling? She must be tired so maybe it's a blur of one touristy spot where she poses after another. I'm just guessing but it seems exhausting. 
I'm more satisfied here at my computer with the whole world at my fingertips than I would be out living her super rich interesting life. Do I like myself? Not really but I know myself. So I don't think it's necessarily a lack of self esteem like some people have suggested. I could try to live her life but I don't want to, it doesn't interest me. I could probably do some things in my life to like myself more and have a more interesting life. I could read more, maybe watch another show I enjoy here and there, get closer to one or two more friends so I am a bit more social but without having to go out, etc. 
There's nothing wrong with you, don't worry. Just live a life that makes you satisfied."
3302,isfj,"I personally don't relate to 1-4 at all. 5, a little. But yeah, like 3, for example-- everything seems to remind me of a movie, or a song, or something. I think in connections, for some reason. But that's partly just because those things are a huge passion of mine. Arts and hobbies, too-- I'm always wanting to play around with a new creative outlet. I would think that some ISFJs are more creative than others, though. We're still all individuals, after all.
I don't think there's anything wrong with you-- maybe you just need to explore more though to figure out what makes you tick."
3303,isfj,"I can relate to feeling boring at times in my life. Especially during low times in my life where I have fell into depression. I do think one problem we can have is that we compare ourselves to others and that causes us to think they have great lives and sell ourselves short. The truth is though we might see or think they have a great life but we don't know their full background (Ex. They could be putting on a smiling face when they are going through a divorce) . I know it can be hard not to compare ourselves to others but I think it's important that we develop self-confidence and realize that everyone at some point in their lives has had issues.

Yeah, don't have that big of an imagination
I have actually had lots of interests when I was younger I liked maps and geography and now that I'm older have other interests like solving jigsaw puzzles or just being into MBTI to better understand how people work.
Yeah, one misconception of Si-doms is that we remember everything perfectly. This is false and we tend to remember things that made an personal impression on us.
I actually think a lot sometimes to the point where I can have trouble sleeping
I can't relate, haven't been in a relationship.
"
3304,isfj,"First off, this is guesswork on my part.
My experience is that it might be quite normal that some people are like you describe and others, like myself, think a whole lot during the day, rarely actually thinking of the thing I'm actually doing. I believe it's okay and just natural that we're all different in these ways. I have a friend who don't say much and he is quite simple overall. I'm able to have interesting deep conversations with him and I quite like the way he is. He seems rock solid and simple and I really like that. If you want to change why not just start a few hobbies or any other activity that are brand new to you.

3313,isfj,"What are some questions that I can ask my isfj female friend every so often that would help her open up to me? I don’t want to come off as providing a routine checkup, but I also care for her a lot. 
What are questions that you like to be asked that “give you the permission” to keep talking without second guessing whether you want to be heard or if you’re boring the other person? 
We go out every week for a walk so she can take a breather and stretch her legs (she doesn’t exercise much). But sometimes I feel like she wants to say something or express something but she ALWAYS holds back. I don’t know how to conduct myself in a manner that conveys “let your hair down”. I mean, I do know how to conduct myself but—- there’s a lot she’s bottling up. 
Backstory
Yes, I love her. We talked about it. She doesn’t feel the same way. She one of a kind and I still want her in my life for as long as possible. 
We go out every so often and have a great time. 
About 2 years ago, I thought we could be something special but another girl came into my life and I started dating her (the new girl). We thought we would get married. My ISFJ friend told me later after we broke up that she cried so hard when I attempted to move away to another state with this new girl. 
When I asked her why, she said she was going to miss our friendship. 🤨?
I’ve tried to move on out of our city to bigger and better things (we just graduated  college) but things didn’t take off as planned. 
I fear I have conducted myself in a manner that leads her to believe that I’m not consistent. I’ve assured her that I don’t want to leave and I’m no longer planning to (another long story): this conversation took place 2017. 
We just started going on these walks last September. 
My backstory is spotty (and maybe unnecessary?), but I can fill in the gaps with questions. 
We talk about all kinds of things, but none of her fears. 
She’s an enneagram 6 if that matters. 
Also: is there anything else you suggest I can do now that I’ve shared this backstory?
When we go out, we just walk on the track, chit chat about nothing, grab frozen yogurt here and there, and go to the movies."
3314,isfj,"I have this issue - kind of -  it’s really hard for me to talk about my self or my issues without feeling like I am burdening someone else. I’ve gotten a lot better about it over the years and my friends have helped with this. Simply by prefacing their question with, “I’ve been thinking about you...” followed by whatever they want to ask me about. This works for me specifically, because it sets the stage that the conversation is already about me, so I feel okay to talk about myself. It’s nigh impossible for me to make it about myself of my own volition. So my friends have to do it for me, lol.
It didn’t happen overnight, but really through repetition of that kind-of phrasing - it became a cue for me to express feelings. 
I don’t actually think the requited/unrequited love story matters much here. As long as you are being genuine about wanting her to open up and talk about how she feels with you, then I think you’re good to go. You care about her, so rely on that. You’re a good friend for asking for advice about it though.
Hope that helps."
3315,isfj,"You have a complicated history, and she says she doesn't feel the same way as you do, which is probably why she is holding back. So I'm thinking that you might never get what you want here. Sorry. No one wants to feel they are number 2 (you stopped dating her because of someone else you wanted to marry). So the closeness you had (?) will most probably never come back. You can still be friends, but my guess is that she will not let herself go deep with you ever again.. (If you know what I mean, not sure if that makes sense in English). 
Sorry for the negative answer, but I know how I would react.. and she might be similar to me. (Edit, or she might not be.. :) I'm a Enneagram 9)"
3316,isfj,"Oh, sorry to confuse- we never dated. We were just friends the whole time, I'm just trying to reach the plateau of friendship we were at before I started trying to leave our town. It wasn't me dating my ex that was the problem, I think it was me trying to leave (actually leaving for a couple months, thinking it was a final goodbye, then ending up back in our town again because of a failed venture. This happened three times). 
I assume she has already said goodbye in her heart already. But what I'm trying to do is be a good friend to her during the times that we go out every week; I just don't know what kind of questions to ask.
But I'll take your advice to heart."
3317,isfj,"Ah ok! Sorry, I misunderstood. 
My next question then would be: Were your ex ok with you being so close to this girl back then?
And about questions.. I would ask about things she really care about. What interests her the most. ISFJs don't like talking that much, but still love talking about things we care about. But about getting her to open up all the way.. I only do that to my husband, so not really sure what it would take otherwise.."
3318,isfj,"I don't think my ex was (looking back). I'm one of those guys that have a lot a female friends, it just been that way since childhood. My ex knew that when we started dating, but didn't know that beforehand. Looking back though... I think if she ever thought any girl would be a threat--it would be this ISFJ."
3319,isfj,"I have no problem helping people. But when it comes to my own problems, I can't seem to dig myself out of problems. It's like I become stuck in my head, with my problems, and I start to become cynical about everything. Do any of you guys feel like that? Also, is your first natural instinct is to expect the worst about anything? Sorry for the grammar mistakes."
3320,isfj,"Mmm, I mean, I can help myself by analyzing my problems and trying to come to a singular best solution. I do find helping others MUCH easier than doing that, though. I find that I'm often hard on myself for making mistakes, when I wouldn't mind if it were someone else doing that."
3321,isfj,"Totally feel identified with that!!! Although it's getting better with time. I quickly jump to help others and approach solutions step-wise and rationally. On the other hand, when I'm the one struggling, I catastrophise everything, I cannot put apart the pieces of my problems and get buried in them, I can get highly emotional. However, I always push through, although usually a bit of support from my family and partner is required"
3322,isfj,"I am the same way. I am incredibly hard on myself and constantly overanalyzing everything. I also take other people's feelings into consideration way too often and then leave myself out to dry. In summary, I am always missing impossible expectations I set for myself and not setting any expectations for others."
3323,isfj,"Hello,
I just finished my fourth year of my English Honors degree, and I thought I wanted to pursue law after graduating, but the more I study for the LSAT, meet lawyers, and visit law firms, the more I feel like a legal career doesn't suit me. I did a personality test, found out that I'm an ISFJ, and found that an attorney is one of the least popular careers for an ISFJ. 
I'm also doing well in my English degree, but I can't see myself writing essays for the rest of my life (i.e. I don't think I'll enjoy becoming an academic or journalist).
One of the jobs listed as being most suitable for an ISFJ was an interior designer. As I've always loved design, art and the concept of space, I'm now considering to pursue an interior design degree. However, that would take another 4 years which I'm not sure I'd be able to handle financially. Instead, I could pursue a masters in elementary education which would only take 2-3 years. I would also be more likely to find a job. 
I think both jobs have their pros and cons. I love the idea of designing spaces for people, but daunted by the idea of having to deal with the meticulous architecture details. I also love the idea with working with children, but I get physically worn out very easily.
If any ISFJs are in either of these careers and could provide me with more insight, I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading this lengthy post!"
3324,isfj,"I am in the same boat with you and Im 25 years! Ive been struggling with this decision since I was a teenager and over the years Ive been narrowing down my options through getting advice and exposure and research. Its not easy decision what to do with the rest of your life and  its an important decision, so you might as well take your time. 
I just completed my personality test and realised that im ISFJ also. I tried teaching and it was exhausting to tell you the truth, the kids were wonderful but the work I had to put in was not easy. I taught grades 7-9 and It was tiring, but thats just me. I started college but had to put it on hold for financial reasons, fast foward almost two years later and I have not changed the field I want to continue pursuing studies which is good, because I was all over the place before. 
With all of that being said (sorry I am easily distracted and can get carried away) I think you should not pressure yourself too much which deciding, write down a list with TEN (10) top careers you find most interesting and narrow that list down to FIVE , after which you can do your research, ask folks and browse the internet and look at salary scales and so forth and HOPEFULLY you'll find what you need to focus on. It has been working for me and I hope it does for you as well. BEST WISHES TREESTATION :)"
3325,isfj,"Totally in the same boat. It's a really difficult thing, but the best thing you can do is keep going until you find something that really clicks. 
As far as an actual method to trying to find a career, all I can really say is ""who do you want to be?"". In your heart of hearts, what is that you want?
Think of 15 year old treestation and recall what it was that they wanted to be. I know money is a practical, real life constraint but it's really useful to just set it aside for a moment and ask yourself where you'd like to be and what you'd like to be doing without any question to how feasible it is. Once you've actually answered that question, you can move on to how you can get close to that in the real world. 
I don't know if you've ever listened to Alan Watts, but I find him particularly motivating, especially when you're trying to think about who it is you want to be in life. 
What do you desire?"
3326,isfj,"My mom tried to push me into law school. It was one of the most stressful experiences of my life. The fact you wanted to do it on your own is promising though.
When I did have to consider what I would do if I went to law school and just followed my mom's wishes -- was what would I want to do with a law degree? One thing I thought of was grant-writing. If you do enjoy to write, you can pick something you are passionate about and join a company/non-profit/whatever as a grant-writer and try to help them earn more funding.
Personally, I started as an English major then switched to Environmental Sciences. I'm currently a part-time Environmental/Nature teacher at a non-profit conservancy. Soon I'm going to be starting a second part-time job as an assistant librarian. The teaching job was very stressful at first -- I would honestly have nightmares before going in to teach and I would also imagine anything that could go wrong. But now that I have been doing it for 3-4 years, I am much more comfortable and it has really helped to improve my public speaking (at least to kids, if not to other adults lol).
edit to add: I also really enjoy working with children. When I was looking for a second job, one of the things I really considered was if I would be helping kids or not. I know it can be physically wearing to be around bubbly balls of energy, but I find when I'm at work and teaching I'm 100% into it and I'm excited to be getting them excited... it's only once I get home that I collapse haha."
3327,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply, I am new to reddit and now learning about it.
I did not pursue studies in the education field as in six months my contract ended and by that time I gained enough experience to know that I love kids but the stress that came with teaching was too much for me. 
I eventually got a job at an insurance company where I worked for five years and after that I realized that I really do prefer a field where I have lots of wiggle room, to be free and and be my own boss to some extent.
While I worked I was back and forth with deciding which field I want to work in and I eventually settled for Information Technology. I know that's broad but I am using that for my foundation and I will branch off into further technology fields in the future. That may not work for everyone, but I believe its the best plan for me.
I love the I.T field and I believe that I can operate independently and confidently in it.
With that being said, since you like the arts field and design as well as children, I believe you should definitely ask a college student or a professional in both fields (Interior design and education) if you still cant decide, give yourself some time, people change, their interests expand and changes too! Dont rush and in the middle of a degree you want to quit. Just take your time and find a field that makes you happy so it never feels like work.
BEST OF LUCK. Let me know how it goes. :)"
3328,isfj,"I'm not sure I really understand the essence of Si or Se.
You can think of Ti and Te as follows: 
Ti: x^2
Te: 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9 etc etc.
When I think of Se descriptions it is typically like...5 senses data. The object is blue for example. How does Si perceive ""the equation"" of blue? This is poorly worded but basically I'm just curious what the timeless themes of Si are...how are they presented cognitively?"
3329,isfj,"Si is more subjective than Se. For Si, the pancake never tastes exactly the same. It’s not just a pancake, as Se would see it. It’s what comes with the pancake. It’s layered. It made me feel inflamed. It made me feel a sugar rush. It looks yummy, but this time the pancake has butter, last time it had berries. Ugh now I’m so chubby from eating all those pancakes. This time the pancake tastes less dry than last time. To Se it’s simply just a pancake, no comparison to past. To Si, it’s what the pancake means to them, physically, internally. It’s a comparison for future experiences with the pancake or something similar. It compares and contrasts. It’s deep. It’s sooooooo annoying (this is coming from an isfj). For once I’d like to try a pancake for what it is, not for what I make it out to be or how it relates to other pancakes, or sweets, or similar or dissimilar experiences.
Obviously the pancake could be anything in the physical world and how t relates to the subject. This is why it’s hard for isfjs to manage physical environmental changes (in theory). We go deep with our experiences, every little detail is noted. Did this make us feel anxious? How? If we experience too many physical things it would be impossible to store all that information.... or at least overwhelming. But Si has to, inherently. However this is where development of lower level functions come into play."
3330,isfj,Ok let's say an Si user attends a party. Si would compare and contrast that event against other similar parties they have been too see if the present situation is likely to be familiar and whether one should engage or conserve. Take that concept and apply it to the blue color and Si would compare and contrast that color of blue against other colors of blue from its memory to see similarities between the objects. I hope this helps. 
3331,isfj,"I've always thought of Si as a reference tool that ties into lived experience more than anything.  For your example, if I see something blue, I rapidly refer to all previous experiences of seeing something blue in order to quickly categorize that shade of blue.  It's a way of efficiently predicting likely characteristics of new things.  So, a new blue shirt might be ""Crayola cerulean blue"" or ""favorite blanket blue"".
I'm not exactly sure what your Ti/Te example is supposed to mean so maybe I'm off base here."
3332,isfj,"Homie, this is facinating.  Here is what I get so far:
Se is X = Pancake, Y = car, Z =  dog
I believe Si would be X to the nth degree. 
For someone with Si to truly, fully understand pancakes they would have to eat every pancake. No pancake is ever exactly like another. It's like multiple universes really do exisit spawned from Si. LOL
I thank you for this. I'm desperately trying to understand my ISFJ gf better, so I can be more understandng of what her needs are so I can be more supportive.
This reminds me of how into mashed potatoes I am. They are never the same, ever. 😍"
3333,isfj,"I'm an INTP with savior Si so I may not be qualified to answer but I will anyway. Si is the personal impression of a sensory experience or real life idea, an example of this is the positive experience you may get from spending the 4th of July with your family that you haven't seen for years and really like,  this positive impression may give you an inherent fondness "
3334,isfj,"I'm an INTP with savior Si, I'm probably not qualified but I'll answer anyway, Si is the impression you get from a sensory experience or idea. It's commonly associated with a persons memories and values. An example of Si would be the positive experience of Spending the 4th of July with your family that you really like but rarely see. This may manifest itself in having a grown affinity for the 4th of July and fireworks as well as positive feelings and memories associated with similar circumstances/experiences later on. A personal example would be having a strong work ethic because one of my idols was an extremely hard worker and I was inspired to emulate him because I liked and respected him so much. "
3335,isfj,"I'm afraid I haven't developed Si as much as I'd like however
Si: ""I saw, I heard, etc""
Si might be considered the meditation function.
To conciously use it you'll wanna shut your brain off like with Se.
Se IME stems from asking ""what"" to shutting off your mind and using all senses at once. It feels surreal."
3336,isfj,"I agree with this, but I have a hard time understanding how this would be represented by a symbolic subjective image or thing which you perceive. For example, if I taste 19 pancakes, Si is not simply those 19 pancakes layered over one another. That would be Se simply comparing Se to other Se. Si SHOULD be a mechanism from which you can derive the Se values at any data point much like the equation in the op of x^2 vs 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 etc etc. It would be a symbolic image which represents a pancakes sensations almost, but idk how that would be presented cognitively."
3337,isfj,"You might check out my post over on the ENTP forum I made. Everything in it can be deduced directly from this model of Xi(Fi, Si, Ni, Ti) vs Xe and an understanding of cognitive function stacks in terms of ""the auxiliary serves the dominant"" as opposed to ""the auxiliary works seperately but is used less.""
In other words, when in the aux position, everything Ti is framed in Ne terms. While when Ne is in the aux, everything Ne is framed in ti terms."
3338,isfj,"I'm aware. But how does Si information compare to Ni information? How can someone compare N data to S data? My understanding is from dave superpowers : Intuition is imagination, sensing is 5 sense data"
3339,isfj,"I like to think of it in terms of a supervised machine learning model: The basic idea is that you have a model (e.g. ""a pancake should be: crispiness x, sugariness y..."" Im a bit out of my element here with pancakes, but you get the gist. I want to describe a pancake with variables.) That is our model. And when we get new data (we eat a new pancake), we update the model of pancakes according to our impression of the current pancake compared to those before (so, to the model). But its not like we have values stored. It is feelings of ""this is not as sugary as I'd like"". "
3340,isfj,"That seems right. Stuff happens for me in order. I think, then the possibilities come, then order then I feel.
So with mashed potatoes: I see them, maybe decide to smell the, wonder what they will be like, then I taste them and I do compare them to all other mashed potatoes I've eaten and then I feel about it. happy or dissapointed. and I'm left with that feeling.
I think the ISFJs are tasting and comparing then feel happy or dissapointed but then they think it over and look at the possibilities if it just had more salt. They aren't left with the bad feeling necessarily.
I like the idea of using someone else stack to get through something difficult. When I get stuck feeling my gf can help me out of it. :) first she gets emotional too, but then she thinks our way out and we make a plan for ways it can be better next time. her Ti and Ne are handy that way because they kick in after the emotion. While Im left with nothing after, so I get stuck being an emotional mess. :D"
3341,isfj,"Perfect. Now, how do those images present themselved to you. I'll give you a description of Ni and Ne first so you can compare your Si to Ni.
Suppose theoretically that you were living at the brink of the revolutionary war. Someone comes up to you and says ""who do you think will win the war?"" An Ni dom is going to perceive a universal timeless image from the collective unconscious. I'll use the theme ""son usurps father."" Been passed down generation upon generation upon generation. So the Ni dom perceived ""son usurps father"" and then make an assumption(hence subjective) that the US can holistically be represented by son and england can holistically be represented by father. The Ni dom thus says ""The US wins"" very convincingly because he believes it to be true.
How would an Si representation of an object compare to the Ni image of ""son usurps father?""
Ne dominants on the other hand do not make this assumption that the US=son, nor england=father. Instead they think ""well the US could win, or england, or france could sweep both of them after they tire each other out, or a treaty could happen"""
3342,isfj,"Do you visually see your Si subjective ideas of them? In other words, if you label salesman as demons, when you open up the door for one do you literally see a demon-esque figure? Does it influence their literal 5 senses qualities?"
3343,isfj,"No it doesn't, not at all. Never. Not in my head. If I were to open up for a salesman that I thought of as a demon, I would just have that thought in my head, but it wouldn't influence what I was seeing in front of me.."
3344,isfj,"I think Ni would have a picture appear of the thing they would describe or have an essence as a demon, like visually a picture.. but Si would rather have..   thoughts,,like nonvisual thoughts about the object or thing, with emotions attached to them? 
Man I don't know. Very interesting to have this conversation with you by the way..!"
3345,isfj,"I'm a really emotional and a passionate person. To the extreme. 
At work, when I'm criticized, or I'm told that I'm wrong by a co-worker or a customer, and I want to cry and become angry. But most of the time, I smile, I nod, and I apologize, even if I didn't do anything wrong. I don't like conflict. My family was just full of conflict. I moved out and decided I will always try to avoid conflict if possible.
I push through the day without breaking a smile, and when I get home, I'm depressed as fuck. But I honestly refuse to show my anger "
3346,isfj,"I've done it a couple of times. I always get kinda messed up afterwards, like I'm unbalanced and that gets me down. So yes, I do it more than I should, it's really convenient sometimes. But I'm also aware of the emtional ""cost"". As with everything else as an isfj, balance is key."
3347,isfj,"yeah. my parents don't like me being so silly as a kid. well they did think it was funny but they also stomped it out because they believed that someone more serious and focused will have a more successful life. not i'm in some weird limbo between the two. but when i'm serious, i'm unhappy and i doubt myself."
3348,isfj,"Yeah, pretty much this. Multiple times, I've come home from work and immediately burst into tears because of it. I sometimes wonder if I'm in the wrong career: as much as I love programming, it's such an INTJ-dominated field that I feel out of place.
Oh, and on top of the situations you described, I've got another example of repression: I bottled up my gender issues for decades until things finally came to a head last year and I started doing something about them."
3349,isfj,"So I'm dating this girl(ISFJ) and my first impression was that she was calm and reserved and didn't let much people in. But every time I get suspicious about something it turns out my suspicion was right. It's usually about guys who like her snapchatting her. Or some guys texting her at odd hours, 2am-6am. And when I call her out on it she says it's nothing and then when I ask her if they have any kind of history it turns out that they either have confessed their love to her or were in a small relationship type thing. She insists she wants to be with me and wants us to be long term but I can't trust her or take what she says seriously when every time I dig, I find new things that are unsettling. I open up to her about any possible concern she may have but doesn't reciprocate. She's very sensitive and almost started crying when I asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship. I don't know what the hell is going through her head. Hoping you all could clarify for this analytical INTJ."
3350,isfj,"My best guess would be she likes the attention and had trouble admitting it or letting it go. She doesn't want to seem shitty so she tries to hide it, but keeps doing the shitty thing because it's socially rewarding. She can talk to who she wants I guess, but if you've expressed that it makes you uncomfortable and she's not respecting that, on top of being so dodgy about the behavior? I think you should probably be carefully evaluating what you're getting out of the relationship and how long you're willing to put up with this type of behavior for it. "
3351,isfj,/u/lemontongues hit it on the head. sounds like she has some negative habits/social emotional issues in her she finds uncomfortable to deal with and is avoiding. and also avoiding/denying any conflict that those things cause with you.
3352,isfj,"Also, chances are, as an INTJ, you're a lot like me, and want to know where the relationship is at the moment so you can adjust your priorities as needed. 
This gathering of intelligence is important to us, but it can come off as pushy.  If an ISFJ is trying to avoid something, then bringing it up is the best way to make them more uncomfortable."
3353,isfj,"Let me just start off by saying that if you got up to the point of asking for marriage, then attempting to learn to better communicate NOW rather than before makes the situation seem as if you are either over thinking about not screwing up when you communicate or feel as if you're losing previously held value in conversations. If I had to give advice just listen closely to whatever she says, ISFJ's feel good when they know someone's listening to them.
As to what she needs from you, if she said yes to your proposal then she's got everything she NEEDS. A better question is what does she want, that's something only you should decide."
3354,isfj,"I would think you two should get along as famously as my ISTJ husband and I get along. You have the same functions as us, but with Te replaced by Fe. 
My husband and I are a project team. We work together towards common goals, to make our lives the way we both want them. We set financial goals together, and goals for how to get chores done and keep the house clean, and even for personal things like hygiene, exercise, and healthy eating. We build strategies and follow the plans we make, and reevaluate regularly. 
I don't think you're going to have similar goals to us in your relationship (although you'll have the same categories of goals) because you'll have different strengths and weaknesses than we do, and different priorities. But you should both be able to communicate well with each other. 
Your main difference will be your Ni and her Si. Generally, she is likely to be more focussed in the concrete, and what actually exists and can be seen and heard and so on, and you're more likely to be focussed on what could be. 
My suggestion would be to make sure you're aware of your fiancee's values and needs, and that even if you can't provide them directly, you respect them. But, that's good advice for anyone I think. :)
I hope you two have a happy life together. "
3355,isfj,"I think it would be some upsides and some downsides to dating a person with my same personality. 
Upsides:
We would probably both take the relationship seriously
We would both probably be caring and loyal mates. 
We would also enjoy a nice and quiet lifestyle.
Also, we would probably be accepting of each other’s flaws 
We would also put a lot of time and effort into the relationship.
Downsides:
The relationship might get boring overtime since we both would be risk or change averse. 
It might be hard to even initiate this relationship at first since ISFJs are known for being shy and reserved when it comes to meeting new people. 
Since we have similar strengths and weaknesses, we won’t complement each other. 
This might also make it difficult for us to grow and develop into well-rounded individuals. 
I know the say opposite attract but have any of y’all dated another ISFJ. Would any of y’all date another ISFJ? I would love to hear some stories and experiences. Thanks "
3356,isfj,"I dated another ISFJ for a short time, and I ended precisely because of it. He was a wonderful person and one of the most caring people I had met, but it felt like I could read his mind too easily. There was no surprise, and nothing we could really learn from one another, at least that’s how it felt at the time. I could always understand exactly why he was doing or saying what he was doing/saying, which sounds like an advantage, but sometimes you find their flaws are exactly the same past ones you had, and sometimes they’re bigger
It was also really frustrating because I ended up having to initiate all the plans, which we clearly both preferred not to be the one to do. Honestly, I could go on for so many reasons why dating another ISFJ wasn’t my cup of tea but, hey, circumstances are different which each ISFJ. It’s always worth a try. "
3357,isfj,"Great question!
I have not dated, however I have worked with a few.
As a fellow introvert who prefers listening than talking when I'm meeting a new person, it's tough. You have two people who are shyly examining each other wondering who will make the first move.
Honestly we are fantastic people once we give each other a chance. ISFJ's are notoriously difficult to get close to, but once we establish that rapport and realize the other is a genuinely kind person, things go swimmingly.
ISFJ's are GREAT coworkers, btw. My absolute favorite to work with professionally. Unsure about romantically. It could work theoretically, since we generally are better with people similar to us, but the other comments here say otherwise."
3358,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ, and I've had 3 ENTP boyfriends so....nope lol I find myself more attracted to extroverts because I need that extra push to drive me out of my comfort zone. Also I feel like the combination of two ISFJs would be A LOT of emotions but also a lot of repressed feelings/emotions, and the communication would suffer because neither party would want to express their issues. I think relationships are about balancing and challenging each other and while being with someone who understands how you fundamentally operate would be nice, ultimately I think it would get boring and/or lead to resentment."
3359,isfj,"I did date a male ISFJ for a little, but he was too boring and conventional for me. I crave differences in a relationship and for my SO to push me out of my comfort zone....which didn’t really happen. "
3360,isfj,"Well, they all ended lol but honestly I felt most compatible with them because they kept my emotional side in check and challenged me to break out of my comfortable routines and try new things. The only real issue I had is that they can sometimes be insensitive because to them debates are not personal, and I sometimes felt that when they'd disagree with me it was a personal attack."
3361,isfj,"MBTI doesn't dictate what jobs you'll do well in. Both my boyfriend (ENFP) and I (INTJ) are nurses and we're almost opposite types. 
As long as you care about your patients and learn the medical knowledge (it's not easy), you can be a good nurse. "
3362,isfj,"I'm still surprised that it's common among ISFJs to feel lonely. And it adds to the fact that I don't feel any of the meyer briggs personalities fully describes me, although ISFJ is the closest.. 
I might not feel lonely at the moment since I have a husband and 4 children, and a group of close friends. But even before I got a family of my own I rarely felt lonely. The only time would really be when coming home late at night to a empty house, knowing some of my friends did not, since they went home to their husbands. Other than that I rarely felt lonely, both when alone and when socializing.  "
3363,isfj,Yes. It makes me sad that I'm the listener for many of my relationships but I don't have many who will listen when I need them to. Watching tv or looking at your phone while I'm talking is not being a good listener!
3364,isfj,"Imo the best things about being an ISFJ are that we have a mix of being practical and people oriented. I like the humility we have. And the great loyalty. And just general stability.
Unfortunatley there is a problem of not saying No when we need to. Thinking of the big picture and taking more initiative can be a problem too."
3365,isfj,"ISFJs care deeply about other people, which is a great quality that leads to our altruistic nature and our desire to work at things that practically and sustainably help others.
However, I feel like we can care a little too much, which can lead to anxiety/depression. (I was diagnosed with GAD within the past year and my counselor told me, ""I don't think you need medication, I think you just need to learn to care a little less."" Lol.) There's a balance between caring about/helping others and recognizing that you can't solve everything - in fact, by trying to solve all of someone else's problems, you might be hurting them in the long run by depriving them of a lesson they need to learn themselves (always helpful for me to remember).
At least, that's been my experience as an ISFJ."
3366,isfj,"The ISFJ is very simple on the outside. We care deeply, deeply for others, and love to feel appreciated for doing so. Another positive has been my memory and practicality, in both the workplace, and in high-intensity situations. I'm somehow always able to keep my composure in times of turmoil. 
On the flip side, I'm only good when thinking/acting on my feet. Forget about planning for the future, I can't even plan how my next day will be. Another downside is our intuition; personally I overthink situations in a billion different directions, until I'm crippled from thinking too much about what may, or may not come to fruition. 
Hope this was useful, fellow ISFJ's :) "
3367,isfj,"I'm confused about the ""people oriented"" part. When people act like idiots I have no problem with not giving a dam about them. But when I see people suffering whether by sickness, or abuse, or by injustice I am overwhelmed with empathy to the point of depression. 
I definitely have ""big picture"" issues. I don't see it at all. :-/
Saying the word ""no"" has been the bane of my existence."
3368,isfj,"How can you keep thinking of the big picture and yet be unable to say no when it is needed? 
I find it contradictory, and thus can not derive any meaning for it isn't expanded upon here. Unless you're fine with these contradictions, or there is some flaw in your beliefs, in which case the second statement is the conclusion of itself and of the first statement. "
3369,isfj,"Putting others before myself, Goes in both categories i suppose.
As well as Door slamming, Being able to cut someone out of your life without a second thought is nice. But also awful trying to open the door back up to people you may want a relationship with, or feel you should not have door slammed.
Having the ability to just well, sit in peace with my thoughts without the need for social interaction. It's nice here and there though."
3370,isfj,"Hey guys! I was searching about this in this subreddit, but I haven't found anything.... so I was curious which MBTI type do you prefer romantically? :)
My weak spots are ENTPs,hehe. Ahhh... I would just listen them all day long... I seriously admire how their brain works. "
3371,isfj,"ISFJs and INFJs, generally. They're the best fit for this NTP. :) Actually, realizing that I had a romantic preference for introverts was one pivotal piece of evidence for me when I first began questioning my type. I'm still not sure which NTP variant I am, but I've actually heard ""Please never stop talking"" from an ISFJ gal before, for what it's worth. :)  "
3372,isfj,"xNTP types. It's such a ridiculous match, but it's so great! I've been with my INTP for nearly 9 years and we are so different, but we both know each other's personalities so well. He's logical and I'm emotional. We compliment each other and together create something very well balanced. 
If any of you have xNTP attractions, I would say to go for it and hopefully you'll find a totally opposite, yet incredibly thought provoking person to share your emotional insights with! "
3373,isfj,"Probably ESFPs tbh. They're so freaking confident and ""cool"". They can make you feel like the most important person in the world. And, everyone around you seems to be in complete awe of them.
ENTP's I started to admire more as I got older. I found them to be quite dorky and weird in my youth :P "
3374,isfj,"No particular type to be honest
I've liked different kinds from ESTP to INTJ to ENTP to I think it was INFP?
Honest for me I see the appeal in all types and its kinda more I just like who I can make a good connection with in some way haha"
3375,isfj,Cool. I fall for entp/intj/ENTJ because i like to control them(it's fun). Anything NF are my pets/mistresses. ISFJ feels like marriage but whether it lasts depends on me (i hate breaking it off with ISFJ)
3376,isfj,"INFPs/INTPs, but I’d say I like feelers more. INTPs tend to not be a good match for me, specifically regarding personal values. 
Either way, both of these combinations can be difficult. INFP are not very good at expressing their emotions and tend to not want to discuss issues that might come up. They also are a bit impulsive with their emotions and don’t think them through often before making a decision. However I think they are so sweet and think a romantic relationship (if you work through some patches) can work out. 
INTPs and I have amazing chemistry, but the last one I almost got in an relationship with I realized would not be a good match long term for either of us. We were similar, yet so different at the same time. "
3377,isfj,"I am attracted to introverted guys in general, but I think there is no certain MBTI type that I quickly fall for. I tend to fall for a guy when they show me that they are interested to me more than I am interested with them and when there is a mutual attraction and similar interests. But to give you an idea, my ex was an ISFx, he’s my first boyfriend and we’ve dated for 4 years. He was kind and a gentleman but we are not intellectually compatible so I lost interest and fell out of love.
After dating IRL, I tried online dating and the first guy who showed interest to me was an INFx, but didn’t workout since he wasn’t interested in a relationship. Next guy was an INTP, didn’t workout because he’s from another country and dated another woman IRL and told me about it, I didn’t want to stay friends so I blocked him and completely erased him from my life Lol. And currently, an INFP who never stopped messaging me until I replied and consistent with his interest and communication with me. We are now considering making our relationship official next year because we are exclusively dating and I have this feeling that he’s the one. I just can’t stop overthinking and overanalyzing the relationship sometimes because of our differences, and I fear rejection and being unhappy in the long run if I choose to be with him, but we’re always able to talk things out calmly and he understands my emotion so it’s really good. I can say that I am really starting to fall in love with him though he said “I love you” first. :)"
3378,isfj,"I do really admire ENTPs in some ways too....although they usually piss me off after a while due to their lack of awareness. I’m very strongly attracted to ISTPs physically. ESTPs always get my attention since they are often the center of attention and I like their unemotional strength. ESFPs are great too. 
I’m very strongly J so the P types are refreshing for me....particularly xSxP types. Their chilled out personalities put me in a relaxed and peaceful state immediately. 
I also have a soft spot for INTJs. They are fascinating and have the sexiest minds. 
I dated an ISFP once, but that didn’t work out. He was too “soft” and gentle for me. 
Types I don’t click with well in a dating sense: INFJ (although my best friend is...), ESTJ, ESFJ, ENFJ, fellow ISFJs, ISTJ"
3379,isfj,"Fair question! I wouldn't say that it has nothing to do with cognition, but it's definitely not a perfect correspondence.   
I think about it from the perspective of cognitive functions. So if I consciously value Extraverted Feeling and Introverted Sensing but have less-than-stellar skills of my own in those domains, it would make sense that I would be drawn to people who exemplify those particular energies or cognitive attitudes. And the road goes both ways. Developed ISFJs tend to seek out and put their stamp of approval on Ne and Ti, while I bond with INFJs mostly over our shared Ti-Fe axis.   
Also, to be fair to myself for a minute ( :D), I had already been questioning my type for other reasons, one of which being that I had been typed as an ENTP by some MBTI YouTubers. I had a eureka moment where I thought, ""Maybe this is why I adore those darned ISFJs."""
3380,isfj,"Fun doesn't mean successful lol. Also, ""control"" is just from my point of view. They can view me as a pet when I feel like i have power.
So not sure who's controlling who. We walk over people our whole lives so it's rare to meet someone to challenge us. ENTPs do that more discreetly. "
3381,isfj,"are any of you in relationships/were in relationships with INFPs? from what i've seen online, ISFJs tend to be some of the rarer people who seem to really like INFPs (not all of you obviously, but enough that it's piqued my interest). and just today i've heard of two happy INFP-ISFJ relationships!
i'm also just generally interested in how MBTI relates to compatibility, so feel free to share any interactions you've had with this type :)
if you know you and/or your partner's enneagram, please share that as well"
3382,isfj,"My best friend is an INFP.
We definitely have a really strong connection, somehow.
I don't know if we would be compatible romantically, but we definitely get along really well as friends.
He's very sensitive, and he's always extremely supportive and kind whenever I'm going through anything. "
3383,isfj,"I'm an INfP 9w1 that had an ISFJ girlfriend for a little more than a year. You should note that I've fairly balanced F-T functions (53-47%), ergo the small F. I don't know how that affects me.
She's really cute and caring.
Unfortunately it wasn't really a good match as our love languages differed to much. Gifts and actions don't matter to me, as an INfP I just crave a deep mental connection that I couldn't get with her. She actually said that it was evil of me to not want gifts because she likes to give gifts. Probably a descendant of Santa Claus.
To illustrate the difference: She's a loyal dog. I'm more of an individualistic cat. 
Which matches what I read another place by a fellow INFP: too superficial, caring, materialistic, clingy and leave no space.
In general I don't think it's a good match, your best qualities aren't appreciated by (most?) INFPs :-/"
3384,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INFP. My ex before him was an INFP as well, the one prior was an ENFP. I find myself being friends with a lot of INFP people these days but dating them also tends to be a trend. 
Anyways, I definitely found myself drawn to him when I first met him. Kind of difficult to get to know, natural INFP thing. But once I started to get to know him more as a person as well as a lover I felt really at home almost. We connect on many, many levels but I find that we have the same thought a lot. We'll be sitting and he'll suggest we do something I was just thinking of. We're drawn to the same things, we'll point something out that the other was already looking at and etc. 
I feel like I expect him to know my feelings and know that I really like him and when I don't do or say things to make it clear he feels neglected. I also have a hard time putting my feelings and thoughts into words for him so he's often left out in the cold about what's on my mind.
INFP's are just really amazing.. I feel a connection with them naturally and always enjoy my time with them."
3385,isfj,"Another INFP E9 happily married to an ISFJ! We get along rather peacefully. He is sensitive to my feelings and is a loving man. I don't know his Enneagram officially (because he isn't a fan of personality tests), but he's probably a 469 tritype. 
Our main disagreements are Fi/Fe misunderstandings, and my preference for new when he prefers the tried and true. Also, if I get in a Te mood, it can be quite harsh."
3386,isfj,"I'm not sure about INFP but I recently connected with someone who is an INFJ.. And the communication is practically flawless.
To be honest, I've not felt a connection with anybody else.
Is there really much of a difference between the two?"
3387,isfj,thank you for sharing! i love hearing about good INFP-ISFJ connections. because i'm so fascinated with MBTI/enneagram trends... do you know both of your enneagram types? i've found that INFP 9s are the ones that most tend to end up with ISFJs. 
3388,isfj,"That's what my test came up with, I think he'll differ slightly. He seems less tolerant of keeping the peace than myself heh. This is really neat though, I appreciate you sharing this and having an interest. "
3389,isfj,"nope, it's a different but complementary personality system to MBTI, more focused on how to overcome individual struggles
https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/how-the-enneagram-system-works/
ISFJs are mainly 1s, 2s, 6s and 9s. INFPs are mainly 9s and 4s (can also be 6, 5, and rarely 1). 
the enneagram tests are not foolproof, but it can give you a jumping off point:

i hope this helps!"
3390,isfj,"I decided to make a post about this because, well, for the longest time I've disliked a lot of art. I don't think I'm great at painting or drawing, and these were always pushed upon me by my mom. I never grew up practicing any instruments and still have not learned. And I've always felt kind of bad, because a lot of my family is great with art.
Anyways, I picked up a cross-stitch kit from Michael's and I finally got around to trying it out. And I really am enjoying it! The kit provides everything and instructions -- it's not a free-form art piece but rather there's instructions and as long as you do what the instructions say, it will come out looking good. I have been enjoying it, unlike any other experience I've really had with artwork (and my family really enjoys getting home-made artwork as presents, so I have a lot of stress making their presents normally). Also if I keep practicing with a few other kits, I think I could move on to doing more personal pieces by looking up patterns online and mixing-matching + picking out my own thread colors. So it would be more of my own art rather than just a kit from the store.
Another thing I'm trying out lately is kind of like scrap-booking? But basically making cards for people with simple images on them (flying pig, moose silhouette, simplistic hummingbird) that I've traced and cut out of scrapbooking paper. It's ""art"" but I'm not painting/drawing and it's so much less stressful for me.
I'm not sure if anyone else has struggled with the ""traditional"" arts like I have, but just wanted to share my experience I guess."
3391,isfj,"Never could get cross stitching down. Can't draw on my own for shit, I can't be creative that way. However, I did pick up knitting about 6 - 8'years ago. Switched to crocheting about 4 years ago. I'll never be perfect at it, as I have issues with patterns and even remembering how simple stitches work sometimes, but nothing gives me more of a sense of accomplishment than being able to give my coworker a blanket for her upcoming baby. It's a wonderful feeling when you have people constantly asking you to make something for them. It's a thrill Ina no of itself."
3392,isfj,"ISFJs are known as being creative but I know I am a sequence learner and need step by step directions. So cross-stitching and crocheting makes sense to be good hobbies although I never got around to trying them. I had a wonderful art teacher in school so I got really into drawing and using pastels. I also took up guitar recently. Thanks to YouTube tutorials and my boyfriend, I am learning a lot but I am so shy and I have little time to practice so I know I'll never be too great at it. You have made me interested in cross-stitching though! I gotta try it out."
3393,isfj,"My two best friends are an ENTP and an INTP and we get along surprisingly well. Textbook descriptions of ENTPs and ISFJs make it sound like we would never, ever get along but we manage to balance each other out quite well. I've complained to my ENTP friend about how I feel too much and he joked that ENTPs don't feel anything so I guess that's the kind of perception I have of you guys. You guys seem to be very confident and have a carefree attitude that I'm kind of jealous of!"
3394,isfj,"My N and S are 50/50 most of the time, so sometimes I'll take a test out of boredom just to see if I have changed very much in a certain amount of time, but depending my mood, I switch between INFJ and ISFJ. "
3395,isfj,"What other types do you test as?
Types are not the end-all be-all definitions of our selves, personally I think it's possible that people can be borderline between types depending on personal development and and stages of growth. You may want to read up on the functions behind your types and see what/if they have anything in common. Your answer may lie there."
3396,isfj,"I mostly tested ISTJ, actually, but it wasn't until I met with a counselor and she asked me ""what if"" scenarios that offered clarity to me and said that I came off as Feeling. Took another test she provided, twice, and got both ISTJ/ISFJ. 
Also, I'm only slightly more S than N, but it's never flipped. I'm thinking I got this notion that I was ISTJ somewhere and just started answering questions accordingly instead of really thinking about it. ISFJ just feels more right."
3397,isfj,"Is anyone been in a situation where you

accidentally been insensitive to loved ones to the point they get really upset with you
You gave a wholeheartedly sincere apology and not to make the same mistake again
They forgave you and are on normal speaking terms

But you still feel guilty even 1-2 weeks after the incident + said apology? It doesn't happen often for me but I've been feeling this way recently.
It doesn't help that they only visit me once a month (I live by myself in an apartment) and I ruined an experience for them while I was here. We're very close otherwise.
I know they appreciate/love me otherwise but I just get scared they'll hate me and/or hold this incident and bring it up every so once in a while.
I feel like this relates to feeling guilty after a mistake and wanting to make it right but at the same time I don't want to go overboard and smother them when they're just the type that just want things to go to normal.."
3398,isfj,"It has happened to me too, that I have a remaining feeling of guilt even if all the issue is resolved.
You have to realize these anxious thoughts you are having are not of any help, they only harm you, and they are not an accurate representation of reality. What is real is that you apologized, they forgave you and you are still friends and appreciate each other. It is real also that everyone makes mistakes, moreover if they are distressed or having a bad time. So now you are the only one left to forgive yourself and move on. Try to disolve the negative unreal anxious thoughts and substitute them by the positive real facts about these friendships of your. 
Maybe the best you could do if you are unable of disolving this thoughts by yourself (I would give it a bit more time though)  is to have a laid-back sincere talk with your friends to make clear everything is solved and they are ok."
3399,isfj,"I never promise it to not ever happen again unless I can give assurances for it. It eases me quite a lot on frustration and guilt.
I remain ashamed of myself, though. And regardless of the pain I caused, even when I didn't caused any.
""Ruined an experience for them"" ? What it's supposed to mean ?
Sounds codified. My mom lives next door, visiting me randomly. We're fine seeing each other on a whim, sometimes for barely the reason of just spending quality time together.
I don't fear disappointing anymore, now it's this way between us.
You don't have to fear being hated if they truly love you.
Why not ask them ? You put yourself on a limbo between not knowing how they took it, and being afraid of asking them.
If they love you, either they'll reassure you if it's a rather mundane mistake, or give you honest feedback on how to do things better next time.
If they love you, they know any pain you caused wasn't intentional and tied to your character. They'll forgive you and help you to become even more of a good person than you are.
The hardest is really to forgive oneself.

EDIT : Argh. I need to state my legitimacy.
I lost the count. My father is supposed to be a loved one, but only hatred and disdain remains in my hear to him. It gives you a good idea of what I'm taking about.
I've been on war my whole early life. Nearly until I became adult.
I told you that my apologies were really only about asking for forgiveness. I don't say ""I'm sorry"" anymore because of how much I used to say those words. Forced.
They lost their meaning to me. That's why I also tell people to apologize only when they do need my forgiveness.
As the rest is easily forgiven or forgotten.
You do want to keep that relationship alive, but remember they have to want too, for it to live.
Well … As much mistakes done inevitable ends up to weight, in my story. He passively aggressively routinely thrown me scuds and planted traps to my intention, until he did the mistake of taking me to Japan.
He have been always trying to bend me into a shape I can't assume. There, he realised I was too strong for him to hope that anymore. But he refuses to face who I actually am. He told my mother he'll divorce her because he can't bear me anymore.
This is his last mistake in his role of a father to me.
I'm not all white, but I don't need his forgiveness anymore. Just bailing out is an option for you.
It's also why I'm always wondering when people just act like if anything happened. It means a lot to you."
3400,isfj,"the past is in the past. resolutions have been made. all there is now is for new good experiences between the two of you. build new over the past instead of ""fixing"" what's already been apologized and forgiven for. be a friend, be a good person, be open, and be caring. it's good to be those things so you might as well do them. and being those things will make you and those around you happy. there's nothing more you need to do than that."
3401,isfj,"I'm a ISFJ in my mid-twenties who has semi-recently been broken up with by my boyfriend (who I believe to be an EFSJ). We were friends beforehand, and then dated for a year. We had talked very seriously about marriage and our future. He blamed the whole break up on himself, struggling with self-worth and wrongly seeking female affirmation, all the while praising and complimenting me for who I am as a person. 
We said we would remain friends while he went through his identity crisis, but he told me I'd have to be the one to reach out to maintain the friendship because he needed to focus on himself and didn't want to give me false hope that we would definitely get back together at the end of all of it. I tried for the first two months, but never really felt like he was trying to invest in this friendship he claimed he wanted. He was always excited to see me in person, but over text, fb, etc. he was always very disconnected. Now, we haven't spoken in a month and I feel devastated -- not only that the relationship is over, but also he doesn't even seem to want to be friends. But that might just be me over analyzing. My personality wants to keep reaching out to him and stay loyal, but as a ISFJ woman I just so desperately want to be pursued and affirmed in someway (no matter how small). I feel like everything has been so vague and unclear, and that's why I'm going crazy. 
I know as ISFJs, we have difficulty with change and letting go of the past. I also know we hold relationships as such a high priority in our lives, to the point that we would be willing to wait forever for someone we love. I guess I'm at a loss right now. Especially, when he told me how great I was, but now won't initiate any interaction with me...and somehow, I'm the one who feels guilty about that. 
I feel like I'm ranting, but can anyone relate to any of that? Any advice? Any suggestions? Any experience with ESFJ's to know what's going on with him? How do we ISFJ's handle these kind of break ups? Because I really feel all over the place. "
3402,isfj,"break-ups are hard, especially if there isn't an obvious reason.  how he acts shouldn't be taken as a reflection on you or on the now-past relationship, so don't feel guilty or wonder why.  i find it's easier if you make some physical and emotional distance after a break-up.  trying to be friends immediately after isn't really fair to either person (especially if you still secretly want to get back together).  you can still value the past relationship and feelings - just remember that it's in the past, and you need to keep moving forward."
3403,isfj,"It's really, really difficult, if not impossible,  for most guys to remain friends after. We can't easily disassociate the emotions we feel with just being friends after; it's very ""all or nothing"" in that sense (either we're with you, or we're not. There is no in between). There are rare exceptions, but this is usually the case.
I don't have any advice with how you can cope, all I can say is don't feel bad. You didn't do anything wrong, and there was nothing you could have done to alter what has happened.
I'll leave you with one of my favorite comics and hope you'll feel slightly less shitty in time.
Gl hf ♥"
3404,isfj,"I feel for you girl.....I tell my ISFJ wife when she gets into this sort of brain loop that I want to use my shrink ray and turn her into a baby sized version of herself (not baby but adult proportions just baby size) and put her into a snuggie and carry her around all safe and warm.  
I will say this.....if you are anything like my ISFJ then you are smart and your brain is good and will figure this out in time.  Just be patient and believe in yourself.
She loved the song ""All Ends Well"" by Alter Bridge.  
You got this girl, just be you....be authentic and believe in yourself."
3405,isfj,"ESFJs, while genuine, are fairly shallow in the sense that it is difficult for them to be in unhappy situations. They generally do not enjoy getting deep into discussing for feeling intense emotions/ideas. He may have said he wanted to be friends with you because he knew that would make you happy (because ESFJs are definitely people-pleasers), but actually being around you and feeling sad is too much for him. The loyalty of an ISFJ can be their greatest strength and their greatest weakness. Wanting to believe the best of someone and wanting to give people second chances (and third, and fourth, and fifth for that matter) often causes more damage than intended. ISFJs tend to have very kind and pure intentions; however, there are plenty of people out there who do not like to or do not want to deal with feeling bad about something. An ISFJ continually being forgiving and kind will often make someone on the receiving end feel worse even when the intention is to make them feel better. All that being said, keep being a caring person, but recognize when to move on and let others be in charge of their own emotions. And (difficult as it may be) really try not to take it personally. "
3406,isfj,I'm an ISFJ and I dated an INTJ for almost 3 years. We broke up about 3 months ago. When it was good it was very good and when it was bad... Well I was crying all the time. INTJs seem to be more grumpy then most people. Or at least mine was. It ended on good terms. At the end of day we loved each other very much but what we wanted out of life was too different. Its hard but I wish you luck! 
3407,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INTJ. We have to try like really hard. Our communication sucks. At the end of the day I just end up complying with everything he wants. 
Not everything sucks but it's very hard to be true to yourself in this kind of pairing I think. "
3408,isfj,"ISFJ here, dated an INTJ for a while (9 months).  Picking each other's brains and talking about things was a lot of fun, but I couldn't for the life of me pick up on an emotional connection from him, and he wouldn't communicate with me, so it ended up being really frustrating for me but he wouldn't get why I was feeling that way."
3409,isfj,"Cognitive Functions!
INTJ:

Introverted iNtuition
Extraverted Thinking
Introvered Feeling
Extraverted Sensing

ISFJ:

Introverted Sensing
Extraverted Feeling
Introverted Thinking
Extraverted iNtuition

INTP:

Introverted Thinking
Extraverted iNtuition
Introverted Sensing
Extraverted Feeling

ISFP:

Introverted Feeling
Extraverted Sensing
Introverted iNtuition
Extraverted Thinking

So yes, INTJ-ISFP and ISFJ-INTP are theoretically ""easier"" pairings since they use the same cognitive functions and because of that will have an easier time to communicate with each other.
While an INTJ-ISFJ pairing will have a much harder time because they communicate in completely opposite ways. That said of course with enough work any pairing can work, some just takes a little more effort. The gain in this is that the functions can compliment eachother, unlike an INTJ-ISFP pairing for instance where half of the cognitive functions are in the ""shadow"", so they might have trouble in areas where those functions would be a great help."
3410,isfj,"Got two friends. Good people. They tend to be stressed about social situations. One friend forces herself to hangout with people but is stressed and hates attention. The other sometimes just heads back home halfway to a party. 
Both are idealistic and hopeful. They want to believe the best in people and look for reasons to. As an ISFJ, it's nice to spend time with that kind of optimism. 
They are happy and feel relief and comfort to be open about themselves when talking with me. and I force myself to that for personal health, but it's a lot easier with them. Their optimism and good will is disarming."
3411,isfj,"I personally feel like I'm inexorably drawn to INFPs; my lifelong best friend is an INFP, and at one point I was crushing super hard on a cute INFP girl.
I love their gentle nature, which makes them easy to open up to right off the bat. I love their whimsical ideas, which helps liven up boring, pragmatic me. And I admire the fact that every INFP I know can create awesome pieces of art and poetry, which I couldn't do to save my life."
3412,isfj,"Just reading your response was very heartwarming. :) 
Would you say that in the early stages of when you first met them, there was a particular vibe about them where you just knew you guys would ""click"" well together?"
3413,isfj,"first impressions were different between the two. the one that forces herself to be social clicked immediately. we both put in the work to see if we could be friends and it paid off. plus we noticed right off the bat that we share a lot of feelings and experiences.
the more shy friend took some time since she is shy. also we live very different lives so there is less to click on that. it is when talking about politics and our individual dating lives that we clicked and formed a friendship."
3414,isfj,"I can imagine both scenarios happening, depending on the social ""flavor"" of the INFP! 
I am very much like your first friend in regards to having a warm social presentation and am interested in befriending a male ISFJ. His kindness and thoughtful mannerisms caught my attention. Once I started showing special interest in him, I noticed he's very quick to reciprocate to me and often even mirrors my body language. He is a wallflower type personality, very mellow and good-natured. 
As an INFP I always try not to come on too strong to people. From an ISFJ perspective, how would you feel about a person gradually approaching you like this? 🤔 I feel that with every time we meet again, there is progress in the quality our interaction but it's just a slow process. (Which is lovely to me.)"
3415,isfj,"Guise, you can look on my oldddd posts as I continue struggling to figure out a path (along with doting on entps :DD). Got a (what I feel) is a worthless Bachelors, got a ""respectable"" job right after college. Had anorexia, dropped out of life for a few years and got in majorrrrr debt with medical bills. Decided to get into the fitness industry and was a PT for a bit. Now I'm back in the industry I went to college for and it's eating away at me, being sucked into the 9-5 life. I'm trying to figure out some side paths. Any non 9-5 side paths that have been meaningful to my fellow isfjs? One new hobby I've been doing is actually creating personality shirts (yes this is a bit of shameless promotion, but humor me? may remove if not okay). But yeah, I've specifically been obsessed with mbti, socionics, all things psych and this has been a new fulfilling hobby: https://teespring.com/stores/personal-apparel (let me know if you have any requests and I'll see what I can do :D).
I think this really satisfies my inferior Ne, but obviously I can't make a living doing this. I'm also planning to take personal classes on digital marketing so I can find ways to make creative endeavors not only personally fulfilling, but hopefully financially. So I guess, outside of shameless promotion, I'm asking - has any isfj succeeded in a non traditional, totally entrepreneurial venture? Advice (outside of stop promoting on forums :P). 
Thanks my lovely fellow isfjs!

3417,isfj,"Overall I work in the IT industry.  Currently I do product technical support so I have to deal with answering phones.  At first it was hard for me answer a phone cold, but now I'm really good at it.  It's just if I'm in the middle of something else it becomes an annoyance.  I think my strong point in being a ISFJ is I'm really organized and get stuff done with quality results.  I take pride in being a ""goto"" person for colleagues who have technical questions about something.  I'm also really fast at learning anything new; I've found this really only relates to things I really enjoy doing (Like computing)."

Our main focus is Socionics but we do talk about Jung Theory, MBTI and Enneagram to high regard.
We’re overall a chill bunch, we have a serious focus towards typology and would like to have many others to discuss it with.

3423,isfj,"My very best friend is a estj, we have always learned from each others differences, he draws out the more brutal logical no bullshit kind of attitude in me while i make him feel at ease to express his inner feelings and emotional side than he would ever dare share with others that are not as close to him. We are planning on getting married, he is my definiton of the feeling ""home"". I know he will be a strict but ever so loving parent when that happens for us, so i couldn't feel more secure about my selection in a partner, lover and a future coparent."
3424,isfj,"My older brother is an ESTJ. I think very highly of him for his intelligence and his ability to remember so many things pertaining to history, politics, ect. (Not sure if that is an ESTJ-specific trait, but it is definitely a major highlight of his personality.) I have had to get used to being told (very bluntly) when I'm wrong and exactly why I'm wrong, as he always holds strong but thoroughly thought out stances on things. He is also EXTREMELY self-disciplined and holds others up to a similar standard, which again I admire, but it can get a little too stringent at times. I would say he is the most reliable and emotionally stable figure in my life."
3425,isfj,"ISFJs often look up to and admire ESTJs, but there is also strain in the relationship based on ISFJs being sensitive to ESTJ's dominant Te function. In socionics this relationship is known as supervision, where the ISFJ is ""supervisee"" of the ESTJ, so spending a lot of time with ESTJ can lead to low self-esteem in the ISFJ: ISFJs and other MBTI types.       
I knew one ISFJ girl with an ESTJ mother, but their relationship wasn't any healthy. Her mother is over-protective of her and thinks that her daughter cannot do anything right on her own (typical ""supervisor"" reaction to their ""supervisee"") so her mother didn't want her to attend school and move out of the house to live on her own. She thought her daughter lacked in diligence and organization (""supervisor"" seeing weak point of ""supervisee"" which is Te for ISFJ). Her ISFJ daughter responded by having emotional meltdowns and becoming very depressed and emotionally manipulative, since she didn't know how else to loosen her mother's grip on her.  It took the rest of the family and ISFJ's ISTP brother to explain to the ESTJ mom that she needs to loosen her control and encourage her daughter to become independent instead of sabotaging her attempts at growing up."
3426,isfj,"Hi ISFJs! I'm a 24f ISFJ and although I know our type has very good traits sometimes I'm tired of being so self defeating and feeling overwhelmed by every difficulty I encounter. I also have a hard time when socializing with new people because I'm worried about what they'll think of me. I feel that I'm really reluctant to change because of fear of failing but this time I'm willing to try. I want to be more social, not being afraid of saying my opinion and having the attention of others.
So my question is, have you ever been in a similar situation, where you have seen the need to change? Have you been capable of doing it? I've read that personality types cannot be changed and I feel like I resent my way of being, but I find really difficult to believe that I cannot change that.. Soo yeah, let me know your story! "
3427,isfj,"i try to change all the time. i think the first thing i did was i learned to look at life a specific way. every moment is one of a kind with no take backs, like a test. but also every moment was like a study session for a future exam. 
and i needed to emotionally shift my focus from the feeling of going to a party as a test of ""are you socially capable?"" into studying for a future social interactions. the stakes become lowered. mistakes become more acceptable. and it become easier to understand mistakes as learning experiences.
i try to think of meet the robinsons."
3428,isfj,"well no personality types can't be changed but that doesn't mean you have to adhere to every little stereotype or that you're bound by them.  we make up such a large part of a population, yet none of us are the same, so it makes sense every isfj will be different too. some more introverted, some more assertive and so on. you can change the latter but not your type.
i used to have social anxiety and i do still struggle with saying my opinion sometimes, but i just kind of let myself do it. i know it's really hard and i think i will regret it, but the only way you can do something is to ... do it? the more you do it, the more your mind will understand it's not the end of the world if you do do it, so you'll get the confidence to continue. if that makes sense."
3429,isfj,"This is a pretty boring answer, but: therapy. I went through a really rough patch right around middle school, but through determination and therapy I was able to become a much calmer, more mature and appreciative version of myself. Lately I've been backsliding a lot because of trouble treating my ADHD, but once I get started back on ADHD meds, I'm getting my ass back in therapy again. 
And about the social anxiety, I'm not great on that front either, but one thing I do to try and relax myself is really examining my thoughts and evaluating how much time I spend thinking about and judging other people. Because honestly, it's not that much, and the judgments are rarely ""Ugh, what a piece of shit, I hate that person so fucking much."" Maybe it's a passing, ""Hm, I liked that shirt,"" or, ""I hope somebody tells them they have something in their teeth."" Something pretty mild that I'm bound to forget within a few hours, anyway, and I do think of myself as a pretty judgy person.  
Other people probably judge you similarly! Sure, a few people are bound to hate you, but that's just kind of statistics lol. If you do your best to be a nice person, most people will probably have a mildly to moderately positive impression or just hardly ever think about you at all. We're all our own favorite subject lol. 
Anyway, I hope you can figure out a strategy to help you work through this! Being an ISFJ has its ups and downs just like any personality type, but you can stay an ISFJ and still improve yourself! Just the fact that you want to says to me that you'll probably succeed, since a desire for self-improvement is already more progress than some people ever achieve lol. Good luck to you! "
3430,isfj,"Yes. There have been a few times in life where something clicked in my head, and I changed. I did what I felt was necessary in order to overcome the situation. I wouldn't call it changing my personality though. I've always been an ISFJ even when I've been more bold and social. I've always interacted with the world via Si and Fe, and that's something that won't change. The lesser functions will improve and mature over time."
3431,isfj,"I don't think I've changed but more or less adapted.
I'm 26 and I would go through a cycle of the things you are describing. I would feel scared/nervous/etc to be more open, but I do end up trying. Afterwards I just go back into a ball of anxiety.
Over the last couple years, I've kinda just mellowed out somehow. I've accepted what and who i am. What's helped me out these days are hobbies or something to ""obsess"" about. For me...I've fallen in love with a Korean pop group lol.
Whether or not this will be beneficial for me in the long run is unknown. For now I may not love all of myself but I can't let it slow me down. "
3432,isfj,"Yes, you are right. I usually see every difficulty I have as if it was an exam and shifting my focus into trying to learn from each experience and mistakes I make is truly helping me. But I have to make an active effort on maintaining this type of mindset. Thanks for your input! "
3433,isfj,"Thanks for your kind words! And yes I did therapy and it helped me a lot but with that therapist I reached a plateau phase, so I decided to leave it after a while and try to improve on my own. One thing I'm seeing that helps me is focusing more on what is happening on the ""outside"" and try not being so self absorbed in my own thoughts, that usually are counterproductive and judgmental. "
3434,isfj,One time it was to not be so shy and make more of an effort to talk to new people. Another time it was to stop subjecting friends to the ebbs and flows of my depression; I would be very social and then suddenly withdraw for long periods of time. 
3435,isfj,"Jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, and/or cardigans in some combination depending on the season, all in neutral or dark colors, and the only pattern I wear is stripes. For shoes, either sneakers or my plain black boots. So, pretty boring and utilitarian. I do have a soft spot for thigh highs and fun underwear though lol."
3436,isfj,"at work i wear a polo with khakis. i try to show my geek pride with a comic book polo. outside of work in public i wear jeans with fandom t-shirt (harry potter, comic book, adventure time, etc). at a friend's house or my house i wear the same shirts but with similar themed boxers.
i wear black workout shoes for every occasion except for funerals and weddings. and i wear sandals in the summer.
and when i'm cold i pear a hoodie. most black or dark blue. many also geeky."
3437,isfj,"On a daily basis, I just like to blend in. Jeans, tee shirts and cardigans, or a nice sweater. I usually pair it with casual shoes, like ankle boots or Keds.
If I'm feeling more daring, I'll wear a dress, or something that stands out a little more, but that's pretty rare."
3438,isfj,"I've got a lot of colorful clothing. However for work it's mostly a black/basic color hoodie with jeans and skate shoes, sometimes a dress shirt or a pullover. In my free time I can also be seen wearing snapbacks. I guess my clothing very much depends on if I am at work or not."
3439,isfj,"I tend to keep all my clothes as long as there are not irreversible stains/damage. I still wear things from grade school, I'm small. I find clothes I really like then never let them go. I prefer dark clothes. I'm a big fan of thigh highs, knee highs with a skirt or shorts when it's nice out. I wear jeans when it's cold. Also super into sweaters. Anything comfortable is good."
3440,isfj,"I have noticed an ongoing trend over time, and I'm not sure if it comes with my depression, or my personality type.
My loved ones are my absolute #1 priority. Their happiness is key to my happiness, and because of that, I end up dropping everything to help them, whenever possible. What the issue is that often, I find that I am NOT their first priority, if a top priority at all.
I tend to have near-constant breakdowns about this issue. I rarely come to others with my problems, but when I do, it means I am in DIRE need, and in that case, I tend to get ""helped"" as much is easy for them, before they revert to their #1 priority (whether it is their S/O, work, school, etc)
Is it my fault that I take these things so seriously, and that I give myself away so freely? Or am I surrounded by ass holes?
Is it my personality type? Or is it my depression that makes this so painful?"
3441,isfj,"ISFJ here with depression as well. I sacrifice a lot for the people I care about, and not getting the same in return can sometimes be extremely hurtful and cause breakdowns. But for whatever reason I keep forgiving them and reverting back to being their helper! 
It's part of our personality to be overly generous like this and it makes it hard to understand why others aren't the same way.
Like you I also try not to come to others with my problems. I remember finally asking for help with my depression when I was 14, and having it be trivialized. This was a personal experience that contributed to my refusal to ask for help throughout my life."
3442,isfj,"It's pretty much your personality type :)  You help others and it might involve you sacrificing your happiness to do it.  It can be hard to say no, especially as an ISFJ.  Don't be afraid, instead of saying no, proposing another time to help them.  Ignore that feeling like you are letting them down if you do this or say no."
3443,isfj,"I had to learn to make peace with the fact that people are very different from me. With the fact that I can't expect people to do as I do. I can't expect people to put as much effort toward others (or me) as I put into them. Just as they can't expect me to be as extroverted or as naturally intuitive as they are. Or they can't expect me to be better able to take care of my immediate needs as opposed to focusing on the needs of others (as we isfj's are prone to do).
And I had to make peace with the fact that I like being there for others and i like helping people. And that the enjoyment i get from helping others is worth it. and it's ok to enjoy it without the expectation of getting anything more in return, without any strings."
3444,isfj,"Its just who we ISFJ's are... It sucks I know but I had to learn the hard way that everyone appreciates our hard work and generosity in their own way. Us taking care of a friend when they are sick could be reciprocated by said friend giving us encouragement. Everyone responds differently. I know that I wish people do what I do for them but it's never the case because we often give so much.
Don't worry, you are not alone. Don't let these feelings get to you and change who you are."
3445,isfj,"So, I met this person at work, she just transferred here from a different area, and immediately, she and I connected, we began lengthy conversations, shown similar ideals, and constantly making and holding eye contact. 
We have recently begun to spend lots of time together, both texting and spending large quantities of time hanging out. Often spending the whole day driving around aimlessly or facing deep into stories and conversations. 
She and I have both expressed that we find ourselves growing close to one another, much quicker than normally happens with us. I have definitely begun to experience deep feelings for her, and I feel as if I already have a close bond to her. She has told me many things that she says she doesn't usually let other people know, and I'm extremely honored to be the recipient of these inner feelings. 
I have told her that I am experiencing these feelings, and that I would like to start dating, and she has told me that she isn't ready for a relationship quite yet. And I respect her decision. I hope to eventually win her over, if such a term is correct, and I understand that it will likely take time and effort. 
I want to show her that I would make a good companion, as I would a friend, and I worry about making the wrong decisions or jumping to the wrong conclusions. Overall, I would just like some advice for being a good friend and eventually significant other to this person. 
Generally, INTP personalities aren't very good with the more emotional aspects of other people, and I understand that ISFJ have very emotion-centric personalities. Any input would be appreciated "
3446,isfj,"The most rewarding relationships I've ever had in my entire life have been with INTPs.
The bond I've had with them has been unlike what I've experienced with any other type.
INTPs are fantastic, in my opinion. I really can't speak highly enough of you folks.
My most recent (and longest) relationship was actually with an INTP, and while we did have some areas of conflict, I was still blissfully happy with him right up until the end, and I still think of him very fondly.
I've only ever felt that way toward INTPs. They just hit me right in the soft spot, and it triggers all my warm and fuzzy feelings. 
When things were good between us, they were really, really good. We shared a sense of humor, we had similar life goals, there was loads of love and affection.
However, the biggest struggle we had was with communication. I'm a very upfront person when it comes to conflict. I like to bring up my concerns immediately, and hash it out before it has a chance to fester or grow into a larger problem. He had a tendency to shut down and stonewall me during conflict, which made it extremely difficult to work through any problems. He often felt that I was attacking him personally, regardless of how hard I tried to keep it about the issue at hand.
I don't know if this was due to a difference in personality type, or if it was because he had severely low self-esteem, and it was easy for him to feel unworthy of love, or a number of other possible circumstances.
I do know that INTPs often have trouble understanding and expressing their emotions, and that can be frustrating for an ISFJ, because that comes very naturally for most of us. INTPs could easily grow frustrated with our sensitivity, as well. 
There are most likely going to be instances where her feelings get hurt, unintentionally, by you. Everybody is different, but in my case, I sometimes was hurt by his very blunt honesty, though it was also a trait that I grew to deeply love. ISFJs are pretty sensitive people, and once we let somebody in, it's not difficult for them to hurt our feelings, especially if you're not naturally in-tune with that sort of thing. Most of us are pretty understanding about it. A genuine apology can get you a long way in forgiveness.
I guess the best advice I can give you would be to just try your best to be gentle with her. Don't filter yourself too much, you should still be able to be yourself with her, but things will go more smoothly if you can try to phrase things in a gentler way than you might normally put them to other people. Try not to get frustrated if she seems irrational or overly-emotional. We use feelings to function in the world just like you guys use your logical brains, and it's going to be difficult for either of you to put yourself in the other's shoes.
The best way to navigate through this is with very open communication. If you appreciate her, tell her. If she does something that hurts or frustrates you, tell her (as gently as you can). If she does something that makes you feel happy or appreciated, tell her. If you need something from her that she isn't giving you, tell her. It's going to make it much easier on both of you, when it's direct and straightforward like that.
Over the long run, ISFJs and INTPs can grow a lot from each other, and you can help develop each other's inferior functions. It can be an incredibly happy pairing, if you're both willing to work at it.
As far as winning her over goes, most of us are pretty simple that way. :) Be nice to her, compliment her occasionally. If you can observe and notice little things that other people may not, it makes us feel really special. All of the cheesy, traditionalistic methods would probably win us over pretty easily. Flowers, candy, cute pickup lines. 
I always loved the very direct, slightly awkward flirtation from INTPs. They're pretty obvious about it when they like somebody, and it's really adorable.
Good luck. 
If you need any more help, let me know. I'd be happy to help.
TL;DR 10/10, would date an INTP again. Be nice and talk about your feelings. "
3447,isfj,"As an INTP who was badly burnt by an ISFJ, I urge you to proceed with caution. As HBerry has said, communication will make or break your relationship. 
That being said go for it, carpe diem brochacho!
Love, your INTP brother"
3448,isfj,"Honestly this post kind of freaks me out. I'm an isfj senior in high school. Sophomore year I met an intp (we are both straight guys). And we instantly became extremely close, had a lot of close chemistry, became best friends. We both agreed that we had become close really really quickly. It feels like the only major difference here is the attraction. Yes I realize that's an oversimplification but the concept stands. 
As for advice, the other person was spot on. I think you just have to stick it out and show her that you can be compassionate too. This intp friend struggled a lot in his last relationship with expressing his emotions and expressing sympathy/empathy when this was something she needed very much. Keep that in mind and try to be more expressive than you might usually be in general. 
I wish you the best of luck and I trust it will work out great!"
3449,isfj,"Thank you so much for your insight, it can be really stressful for me, as when I'm still in the crushing phase of a significant other, my mbti mirrors more of an INFP. What is usually calm and logical in my mind becomes chaos and emotion, and I act irrationally. But once I get past the phase, and get comfortable with the other person, I can calm down. The whole honeymoon phase of being in love for me is extremely emotionally and mentally taxing. "
3450,isfj,Well it sounds to me like you're on the right track! I'd recommend persistence: pursue her as a friend and see what that can blossom into. If she really has feelings for you she'll probably change her mind if you keep at it
3451,isfj,"Hi, ENFP here with inferior Si. I noticed that I often forgive people that I date very easily because of memories that I have about good times they've had and when they were good to me, rather than how they make me feel in the moment. Even if I'm angry at someone and ready to write them off, a few days later I'll get nostalgic about some sweet memory and how they were acting before and I'll forgive them.  Is this because of Si or is this just a human thing? "
3452,isfj,Depends. I hate smokers any time but If some former smoker claim that he quit successfully drug he get my full respect even bigger than some dude who never put cigarette in mouth. I can forgive people past if there made some progress or they found their wrongdoings. Si drills other past and try to compere their present and that's how I value people. I don't like some loud self claiming dudes with 'potentials'. I just care what was and what is. I don't care much about future of certain person.
3453,isfj,"ah ok. I suppose it's also about how you want to remember someone right? Like if you want to hate them, you'll draw on negative memories, but if you want something to work, you'll draw on positive memories?"
3454,isfj,"wow  -so interesting - thanks for explaining it that way. it's interesting because as an ENFP, my Ne cares a LOT about the future. so I wonder if my Ne and Si are constantly trying to balance each other out. "
3455,isfj,Yeah that's how it work. Those functions are part of recognition loop in MBTI type. People have recognition loop and thinking/feeling one. So every person is able to think abstract and think concrete but they often rather not to.
3456,isfj,"Back when i was in college and as part of their recruitment process, I took a personality test before getting an offer letter from a company. There was no result or description of my personality after the test completed - the results were just sent to the company 
Anyhow, now I have reasons to believe that the company divides it's employees into teams based on the test results. 
(i)There were two sides to the office - one was a lot smaller than the other, I was in the smaller side. 
(ii)Now that I look back, 100% of the interns on the smaller side were introverts - that number is about 70-80% for other employees. 
(iii) R&D department was on the smaller side along with two other teams and Susan Cain has mentioned t in her book hat companies fill their R&D departments with introverts. 
(iv) All the events (eg. Fun Friday) were organized on the bigger side - it was optional for everyone - but since we were in the other side, it was easier for us to concentrate on our work.
What are your thoughts on this?"
3457,isfj,"I guess that is a pretty neat way to distribute interns since they clearly don't care about each person's aptitude (which I sort of understand, college students aren't very skilled and experienced yet). I think they wouldn't use this technique when hiring actual employees. 
Personally, I don't like thinking that my personality is possibly more important than my work, but I get it. The company values ""office harmony"" "
3458,isfj,Yeah... There was a lot of harmony between me and my team mates.... But at the same time there was also a lot of clashes between me and people from the other side - that's the whole starting point which led me find this out...
3459,isfj,"I just scoured her profile on 16 Personalities and the descriptions are insanely spot-on. As a parent, my mom is incredibly thoughtful, loving and self-sacrificing. She's ALWAYS putting other people first without considering her own needs, which she often doesn't recognize as valid. Balance is generally something she struggles with: she gives too much of herself. 
Her emotional needs are very different from mine, in that she craves constant contact with loved ones, particularly immediate family. She needs a lot of affection and reassurance to feel happy, but this isn't something I can give to her at the level she wants - as an INTJ/possible aspie I find consistent interaction (even with family) overwhelming. 
It's not so much the contact itself, but the quality and frequency of contact. She communicates on a very emotional level, while my tendency is to rationalize. She wants a high level of connection all the time and fixates on feelings often, which can feel draining and suffocating for me. 
Our communication styles are just very different: she speaks with her heart, I do with my mind. Ultimately it leaves her hurt and me frustrated, when neither of us had bad intentions to begin with. We're simply different but misunderstanding each other. 
So, ISFJs...how can I make her feel loved and fulfilled given our differences while maintaining healthy boundaries? 
I'd really appreciate your insight - thank you for reading."
3460,isfj,"First of all, I think it's really nice that you are posting here to try to help your relationship with your mom, you're a great son. Are you familiar with the 5 Love Languages? It helped me in my relationship with my INTJ boyfriend when I realized my love language is words of affirmation and physical touch. I thought he didn't love me because he wasn't as good at telling me how he felt or being overly affectionate. When I found out he expresses love with Acts of Service, and I thought of all the times he helps me (daily), and other people, I realized he was a very loving person. Perhaps if you could show your mother the differences between love languages, it might help her understand that you love her, but just express things differently. It could help her not take things so personally. I know it is hard with our types not sharing any functions at all to understand each other. I hope you guys can find a way to compromise that works for both of you. Let me know if I can help further. "
3461,isfj,"Perhaps this piece can help: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/3yu7lk/isfj_the_unsung_traditionalist
I am an INTJ, so I understand your frustrations. We do not understand Fe mainly because we cannot practice it, it seems quaint and prone to self-destruction, but it is essential nonetheless."
3462,isfj,"Does she know about her personality type? That helped the ISFJ in my life big time. I got her into it by showing her the Google Images results for my own type [INTJ], and then she had to know what her type was. From there it became clear to her that others just have their own needs and that can often account for any disconnects.
I wouldn't be so sure about this. I mean, there's at least a chance that it's just your Ni talking. I believe that just about any INTJ can practice at Fe and get extremely good at it. It's not an easy function to empathize with at first (Socionics does a good job explaining why), but if you study the helpful role of Fe in society it will start to clear your internal INTJ Ni/Fi hurdles and the outline of the challenge will become more clear to your Te. That is the goal in any INTJ learning process: Get the issue out of the open and separate subjective INTJ Ni/Fi facts from objective truths.
It could be as simple as scheduling automatic emails to touch base and let your mom know you love her. (BTW Fe is very susceptible to fulfillment through slightly-clever software) Or remembering special dates. All the family births and deaths. Asking her questions about her favorite memory of [whatever] from time to time.
Pretty soon this all adds up like the ""emotional bank account"" you hear about. Boundaries become much, much easier to manage as long as you use words like ""I love you and miss you but X"" or ""I know we talked about this and I am very sorry but for honest reason X I need to Y. Maybe it's an INTJ thing.""
Often a hurt ISFJ will play the blame game (see ""Survival Games Personalities Play"") if they don't get what they were hoping for. This and other related behavior can start to manifest to an INTJ as manipulation, dishonesty, all those Fi-breaking things. However remember that Fi is a poor response pool for INTJs and Te is really needed here to help the relationship become a successful one--just not Te directed at her, so much as Te that helps you discover specific, efficient ways in which you can fill her basic needs and establish loving boundaries.
Hope this helps. Sorry for any INTJ preachiness. :-)"
3463,isfj,"I could maybe give you some advice if I knew about more of what you are needing/where your conflicts arise. Like I commented for OP, with an INTJ boyfriend I've learned a lot, studied the hell out of the type. I have a close friend who is also INTJ, so she's taught me a ton as well. Feel free to comment back or PM me if you'd want to talk more. "
3464,isfj,"Just read about ISFJs and try to understand them. Be considerate and remind her of your feelings for her regularly. Tell her how much you appreciate what she does for you/others. It may just be me, but I need some reassurance almost weekly. We’re pretty simple though. Just don’t take her for granted, I guess. It’s a really good sign that you’re reaching out now. You sound like a good one :)"
3465,isfj,"tell them what you're going to do before you do it, or else the isfj will jump to conclusions. tell them that you appericate them, and value them. thank them. and don't criticise them with your Si parent.. or do it, but don't do it too much. I think that if you two communicate with each other, and explain why you do things, and tell them what you're going to do, ...I think it can work out !:) pls don't bring out your infj superego to them.. I don't think they'd like that poetic justice being thrown over them. of course,  if they deserve it then bring it on lmao.
sorry if this is inaccurate. I'm an amateur in this."
3466,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ. I would say it's a pretty simple job keeping us happy. Just let her be a part of your life and make her feel like you need her. I'd also suggest finding out what her love language is and doing at least one thing daily in that genre. It looks like some confirmation/affirmation is already suggested, but I'm Quality Time/Physical Touch and I'd much rather have a daily hug than a daily compliment. Knowing which means more to her could be important."
3467,isfj,"I'm dating an amazing ESTJ! 
Honestly you'll be fine, I think ESTJ and ISFJ go really well together.
I think the only things that you'd need to watch out for, from my own experience, are 


overanalyzing or focusing too much on something negative; we tend to get overwhelmed with criticism and negativity easily, even if it's not intended to come across that way. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells, but it's important to compromise. My boyfriend and I took a while to figure out how to criticize and handle criticism from one another, respectively. In regards to overanalyzing, when we first started dating, my boyfriend asked a lot of questions; I know now that he was trying to get to know me better, but a lot of us are very reserved and it can feel like we're being cross-examined. 


we have a tendency to sugarcoat things and beat around the bush. If you're like my boyfriend, this might drive you crazy. I got better at being direct with him after he reiterated a few times that he strongly preferred it and made it very clear that I wasn't going to upset him by being direct.


on that note, you might want to try being a little more indirect with her depending on how healthy she is and how well you know her. We have a lot of feelings.


also if you can, open up about your emotions and give her opportunities to take care of you somehow. We're suckers for that.


Best of luck! "
3468,isfj,"Thank you everyone for the advice! Very, very helpful. My biggest concern is getting her to comfortably share her feelings. It took me a long time to understand how strongly she feels things and how her emotions can change throughout the day (I stay pretty even keeled throughout the day). I'm working on understanding her and not pushing too hard. You guys are great!"
3469,isfj,"Don’t steamroll over her.  Give her a chance to speak. Don’t always assume you are right. Listen to her insight (she notices a lot of things and has important input). Be mindful of when she needs a break or some space to decompress. Snuggle her, kiss her and remind her of how special she is to you. Make decisions together and don’t always take control. 
That’s great that you care and are willing to hear what she needs to be fulfilled. Assuming you aren’t super domineering and willing to change/cater some things towards her needs, I’m sure this could work. "
3470,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ and I love listening to how people feel, it’s like you want to confirm if the person is also feeling what you are feeling. 
I also like to talk about how I feel, but feel bad when I share too much or care that I share too much and it’s boring"
3471,isfj,"I open up most when I’m in the physical presence of a loved one—particularly when I’m snuggling or touching them. Sometimes I need time to think through and process my thoughts/ how I want to state something...so don’t rush me. In general we do LOVE sharing emotional things with those we feel comfortable and not judged with, so I’m sure she will get there eventually. 
I feel like ESTJs are problem solvers (?) and ISFJs certainly appreciate solving a problem. But our emotions are less logical and we can become super irrational with them. So keep that in mind too. We will probably really appreciate your help in trying to rationalize and get to the bottom of our emotions, but recognize that there will be times where we will be too wrapped up in them and unable to fix in a given moment. Revisit at a later date :) "
3472,isfj,"Heya fellow ISFJs, sorry if this has been posted before. So yeah simple question, what is your love language?
If you don't know, you can take a little (but fairly long) test here. :)
My highest one is Physical Touch, and a close follow up is Quality Time."
3473,isfj,"I got a 1st place tie between Quality Time and Physical Touch, followed by Words of Affirmation. 
Sounds about right. 
I just want to find that one woman to love and spend the rest of my life with, and I'm not afraid to show my love for someone special through words, actions, and meaningful physical contact.
I don't need gifts, or anything of the sort. 
All I need is to know that the woman who I will love, above anyone else, feels the same way.
Now I just have to find that woman, instead of ones whose hearts already belong to someone. "
3474,isfj,"Acts of Service -
Probably worth noting that I only had 1 in Physical Touch. Which is an improvement from when I took this test 5 years ago and got 0."
3475,isfj,"Looks like there's a trend of physical touch and quality time being at the top. I suppose Si has something to do with it?
7 Physical Touch, 7 Quality Time, 6 Acts of Service, 6 Words of Affirmation, 4 Receiving Gifts"
3476,isfj,"Late to the party. I'm DEFINITELY Physical Touch (I get so clingy with my friends it's terrible) and Quality Time. And in situations where it'd be weird to touch the person (not in an inappropriate way, grow up), I rely fully on spending time with them. "
3477,isfj,"Hey there! Hopefully I can get some thoughts on this.
I met this ISFJ online, about a month ago. We're both gay guys (probably doesn't matter). We're close in age. I live in the US and he lives in another country.
I've gotten to know him so well. We chat all day long, and we talk to each other almost once a day. We exchanged pictures and all that a little after we got to know each other. Throughout my time knowing him, I've gotten closer to him than I've gotten to anyone in my life. Even my best friend IRL that I've known for almost 10 years... I feel more comfortable and connected with this person online.
I asked him to take a personality test and he's an ISFJ. From my experience with him, he has a lot of deep feelings about me but I've always been the one that has had to show interest. I've always had to show him how I feel before he shows me how he feels. When I finally brought the conversation up with him, he told me he loved me, and since I have deep feelings for him too, I agreed to date him and eventually meet within a year or so.
My question is, is it normal for someone with this personality to develop such deep feelings so fast? And why did he say he loves me so soon? Or is it not too soon?"
3478,isfj,"I'd say it's pretty normal for ISFJs to develop very strong feelings fairly quickly, but we rarely show that to people unless they express their own feelings first, or we feel very comfortable around them.
I've been dating an ESFJ for just shy of 5 months, and he's had to initiate everything right from the start, pretty much. I was too shy to do anything out of fear of rejection. Even now, when we see each other, I'm still a little hesitant to touch him first, and I'm much more reserved about vocalizing my affection, even though I may be feeling great warmth towards him.
We're in a committed relationship and I'm still afraid to hold his hand unless he does it first. ISFJs are typically very private about our emotions, both positive and negative.
In my relationship neither of us have said ""I love you"" yet, but I definitely could've after the first couple months, it didn't take long for me to feel it. That being said, I don't think I'd say it to someone I've only met online after such a short period of time. At that point, I worry that it may just be projection on his part. 
I'm not gonna say there's a set timeline for when it's too soon to say ""I love you"", but realistically, one month of only online interaction isn't really enough to know whether or not you love somebody, because you can hardly know them as a person. I met my boyfriend online, and while he was mostly the same in person, there were a lot more sides to him than I got to see online, and I definitely didn't feel like I really knew him until I got to see multiple sides of him in multiple different scenarios and situations.
I would suggest proceeding with caution. I'm not saying that this is the case, but often times an early warning sign of an abusive relationship is moving things too quickly, and the abuser putting their partner up on a pedestal and projecting an unrealistic view onto them. He may very well love you, based on what he's seen of you so far, but most healthy people don't rush into the ""L"" word so fast like that."
3479,isfj,"As an ISFJ, that sounds a lot like how I would behave. If he said he loved you right after you mentioned that you always have had to show interest first, he was most likely trying to meet your needs and be the one to initiate. That certainly doesn't discredit the affection he has for you, but may have been a factor in his expressing it so soon. While all ISFJs probably differ on this, I typically develop deep feelings quickly. Hopefully this gives you a little bit of insight!"
3480,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ as well and I have had personal experiences with developing deep feelings extremely fast. 
My first real, legitimate crush crept up on me out of nowhere and intensified extremely quickly. I'm talking, within the first week of knowing this person. Because it came so quickly, I can see why you are questioning whether his feelings for you are genuine. That being said, I believe that once you meet someone you have an amazing connection with, time is irrelevant. "
3481,isfj,"In relationship with ISFJ. I've found that people of this personality type can be very committed and loving in a relationship. The hard part is that at least in my case, an isfj needs to first hear about commitment and feel devotion before they open up. 
To summarize, I'd say your situation sounds fairly normal. If you treat this guy right, then I imagine he will be extreamly loyal and caring towards you. "

3483,isfj,"Thanks for the long response. That's an interesting perspective I didn't consider.
Luckily, he only said it once, and it was when we were discussing feelings about each other. I think he really wanted to tell me a lot of things, but was very hesitant to do so. He was excited, so maybe he realized later that he shouldn't have said it. Ever since then he has been saying he really likes me. I've also looked for other red flags, such as using ""pet names,"" and I didn't see anything else to worry about. I'll most definitely be proceeding with caution though.
I did ask him why he likes me, and he gave a list of very specific things. I'm not quite sure what you mean about projection, but I assume you mean he is projecting what he wants in a perfect relationship? I did consider that, but I also know that there are a lot of specific things that he has paid attention to about me and my personality.
At any rate, thanks for the advice. I'll have to see where it goes."
3484,isfj,"Oops, sorry for the confusion. I'm just telling people in this thread that I've had to express interest first. I didn't say that to him. When it comes to him, I just had to ask him if he ever thought about our future together, and he was a little hesitant, but that's when he started telling me his feelings about me. He told me he didn't want to say anything because he wasn't sure how I felt about us.
Thanks for your response though. I really appreciate it."
3485,isfj,"That's interesting. I also feel deep feelings about him, but I've known him for so little. I'm definitely surprised that I could connect with someone so easily. That's interesting to hear about your experience. Thanks!"
3486,isfj,"I've noticed that with pretty much all of the ISFJs I've encountered, they are always really warm and friendly and suggest meeting up or doing something in the future. I get along with some of them pretty well and could see myself becoming good friends with them. However, when I actually contact them about hanging out, they seem kind of reluctant/avoidant and tend to ""disappear"", become kind of dodgy and stop replying. Am I misreading their politeness for friendship? Do they actually not want to hang out and are just saying it to be nice? Twice?! I am an ISTP and need help with this stuff so any insights will be appreciated. :)"
3487,isfj,"Hmm, that seems kinda weird.... I think we definitely do go out of our way to be as nice as we possibly can, so that part isn't super surprising? Like, if I don't know someone super well or haven't spent a lot of time with them I'll maintain a super sweet and friendly face 24/7 unless I really hate them lol. But in my case, while I might be like ""yeah totally!"" if they suggest we hang out even if I don't really want to, I would never extend the offer myself unless I really meant it. Social interaction is so tiring for me that I wouldn't wanna put myself in a position to upset one or both of us by making an offer I didn't mean and wouldn't want to follow through on. 
So, I think ISFJs 100% do hide behind a polite and friendly mask a lot of the time and may very well say things just to be nice or avoid hurting feelings, but this particular instance seems weird to me. The niceness and the avoidance make sense to me for ISFJs in separate instances, but not when you put them together like that. I wish I could tell you more, but I can't imagine what they were thinking. I hope you have better ISFJ luck in the future :( "
3488,isfj,"Hi, can you describe or give examples about HOW you are asking them to hang out? It sounds like you're probably trying to engage them in a way that makes sense to you but not to them. That does sound more like the polite non-response I give if I'm not extremely interested in hanging out with someone. I wouldn't mind hanging out conceptually, so it wasn't insincere, but I might not want to once it becomes specific.
For myself, when I meet someone, I rarely get excited about the person right off the bat. Si-doms like us need to warm up to the person and share experiences with that person first. A considerate E or an alluring N who pays specific attention to me will get me a little excited but that's about it. An ISTP, well.. I don't often find a lot of.. THERE, there. ISTPs tend to be really reserved and don't open up about themselves, which ISFJs appreciate - if we decide we like you, and want to learn more about you, and then you resist sharing your thoughts/feelings/emotions, we're pretty apt to give up quickly.  An ISFJ wants to latch on to ""I have a situation that I don't know how to solve."" An ISTP is going to want to fix his stuff himself and tell the ISFJ ""Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?""
Also, one-on-one hangouts with an introvert I don't know super well can be really uncomfortable. Because of my Fe, I often feel a pressure to act more E than I want to, and try to entertain and keep the conversation going, which can be draining.
I have two pieces of advice for you, one hard (for a IxTP) and one easier but more time-consuming. The hard one is: you could try to perceive if the ISFJ is friendly/interested in the first place on the first meeting, and if you want to be friends with that ISFJ, try opening up about a few of your feelings. Unless you've become more comfortable with your Fe, this is probably gonna be super hard. Talk about something that makes you happy, or frustrates you, or subtly indicate that there is a simple, specific problem that the ISFJ can help you with. (Going too complex/general right off the board - ""I'm lonely and need a friend!"" - might scare us off.)
The easier one is to be nearby the ISFJ in a group setting long enough for us to feel an affinity for you even if we don't get excited by you. Like, are they into D&D? Sports? Music? Board games? ""Hey, me and a few friends are going to play board games Saturday, would you like to come?"" is likely to be more successful than ""Hey, do you want to hang out on Saturday?"" It's not something I'm necessarily proud of, but once I view someone as part of my ""pack,"" I'm more friendly to them, even if they don't excite me. I remember past experiences with them, and my brain goes ""Yeah, that was pleasant and comfortable. They didn't do anything that made me feel uncomfortable or awkward. I'll probably have a good time hanging out with him."""
3489,isfj,"I'm occasionally guilty of politely agreeing to an offer to ""hang out sometime""  but then not proactively trying to plan any get-together. Usually this is because of one of two things: I'm either scared that I won't be a good enough conversationalist and will bore/disappoint the person in question (if it's someone I admire), or I perceive the person in question as being flaky, a bad influence, or draining to be around. 
On a more general note though, I don't find myself dropping compliments or saying nice things to people just for the sake of being polite. I'll compliment you on some aspect of your personality, talents, or appearance only if I really do admire that thing and want to know more about it. "
3490,isfj,"just look at that some of the words in the head in the top right corner.
cooperative, considerate, follows rules, low key, devoted, service minded, conscientious, kind, honor commitments.
these are traits of someone that does things because they feel they have to based on kindness and adhering to or enforcing certain expectations to ensure people are ok. it's an act of kindness and care taking.
and kindness is different from an open hearted love. it's... based in not wanting to hurt and wanting to help, but it's not always based in truth.
even the idea of being a good caretaker. it's like a parent. parents are....they're like people that build protective bubbles around little people in order to control what enters their lives to protect them. and parents are supposed to slowly build these kids up in a controlled way in order for them to live without the bubble. 
but isfj are caretakers for everyone they deem worth or able to be caretakers for. that never ends until we know the person doesn't need it. but we'll do it and assume it's necessary even when it isn't.
so the actions this person has been doing can be a way of protecting people from the hurt of rejection. it's dumb. it's unnecessary. it's dishonest to others and to ourselves. and it's hard not to do that for us. 
it's probably also in some ways protecting ourselves from rejection too. and it also keeps the peace, ensuring everyone can stay cooperative. and it keeps things low key. and if we do make a commitment, we'd have to stick to it, so there is a lot of pressure there.
but on the other hand, just pressure the person to hang out. and they'll agree to it because of the same exact reasons. and as they eventually open up and feel more comfortable maybe friendship can bloom. or not, maybe they suck. maybe you suck. I DON'T KNOW EITHER OF YOU, I CAN'T ASSUME!
this person hits on some stuff from my past. i had a problem where i'd try to do this with people all the time. and sometimes some people end up to me being like a black hole that sucks up all my time and energy. had to grow out of it and set boundaries, and force myself to open up past nice and into real honest compassion."
3491,isfj,"With time, feelings are hurt regardless. I'm not saying nobody should care, just that I've become a bit more of a pragmatist with a perspective that run through a couple of years.
I fear running out of time with the ones I love the most. I believe sparing them my cynicism and my pain is probably one of the worst way I can think of to spend my time with them.
As strangers are potential friends to me, too, I believe I'd regret treating my (eventual !) SO coldly because of any lesser standards I hold for strangers.
And if I have nothing to do with someone, I'm positive they'll realise really quick nothing matches.
A pragmatic warmth instead of a warm pragmatism, if you will."
3492,isfj,"Thanks for the detailed response! I've just contacted them about getting a meal together, which is something I've done before with them. And when it comes to opening up/sharing, I don't really have a problem with that except that I feel like ISFJs don't like to pry deeper into what I'm saying? So the conversation just kind of trails off after that."
3493,isfj,"Sincere question that'll appear as crudely trollish (I want for once ask for forgiveness about that. I never do because I believe, as a rule, I'm in my own right, and I want to show respect and consideration, this time. Elevate the debate, without claiming for a better moral ground I don't have.) :
You live it well ?"
3494,isfj,"And that's a fair way of looking at things. The over-performed niceness absolutely is a coping mechanism in my case, and not something that I'm proud of. When I have the energy to pay attention to it I try to work it down a bit and let my actual personality show through, but that takes a lot of effort and bravery, so it doesn't always happen. I'm also working to make the kindness more genuine so that it doesn't feel so performative. 
But, this is also just me personally. I've had some experiences which I think I may have let make me more of a doormat than your average ISFJ, so I'm probably a worse example to go by than a lot of people here lol. "
3495,isfj,"An ISFJ will generally not pry deeper unless you stoke their curiosity or seem to be someone they should probably get to know if they're hanging out with you regularly, or unless you engage them on something they're interested in. Si-dom almost certainly has a few pet interests that shouldn't be too hard to figure out if you know much about them at all. If you share that interest in any way, ask them questions about it or show curiosity about it, chances are they love to talk about it, especially if it's not personal/emotional.
And when I say pet interest I mean.. VERY specific. I have to remember to say that to other types. It's not usually ""I'm into video games, all video games!"" It will typically be ""I'm into these 4 video games, and I have played them for ten years."" I still regularly play Civilization II (from 1995!), and also Mario Kart Double Dash (from 2003!) with an ESFJ and ISFJ friend of mine. It's not ""I'm into all music!"", it's ""I'm into these two or three genres, and within those genres I specifically love these 10 bands."" This is why others often find us boring.
I'm not gonna lie, ISFJ and ISTP are pretty tough friendship matches unless there's a really strong shared interest or are being facilitated by an E in some way. Both types tend to be pretty reserved and don't make the first move. Until they warm up to you, if you really want to be their friend, you might have to do a lot of the heavy lifting. And yes, if they just aren't feeling it, they will probably default to not responding rather than giving you closure or telling you directly that they're not interested. It's a bad habit that Si-doms subconsciously judge others as superficial or not in touch with themselves if they don't see something interesting going on under the surface. You can tell if the ISFJ seems really tied to polite, warm, friendly, smalltalk mode that he's probably not thinking there's much to you.
Here's an article that should illustrate what I mean.
Acting like an exciting, alluring superhero who needs certain support is not very typical for an ISTP, and an ISFJ is not likely to try to infiltrate your life, and they probably won't be very intrigued by your nonchalance."
3496,isfj,"I understand that perfectly well. I'm not as brave as I like to believe. I've been quite a dirty coward in the past, and I'm trying to atone for it. It's failures I really want to learn from.
Your experiences can become a lesson for us all. A lesson about strength of character and bravery, as it seems."

I did a bit of research on that topic, but didn't find anything meaningful (searched through google scholar).
I was wondering if I could find correlation (and perhaps causation) from psychological types to the type of underwear worn.
Here's the survey.
Feel   free to comment on those questions aswell (with your MBTI type   identified) if you want. I figured this sort of survey would be okay   since there was a fetish survey a week ago on /r/MBTI. Hope it's alright!"
3499,isfj,"Wouldn’t it be more related to your body type or what you can afford. I’ve tried boxers but just hate how they ride up my leg, I’ve tried Kmart brands and even Calvin Klein and still felt the same. So I just stick with briefs and they’ve done me well"
3500,isfj,"If you're ISFJ, I have no recent ISFJ submission, which means it must've bugged. 
I don't really need it, but I thought that since underwear is something that is hidden from view (mostly), functions could be a big part of the decision process. For instance, Te might want the most practical, Fe might want what's fashionable at the moment, Se might want something very practical... I'm not sure exactly where this is going, but I wanted to see if I could theorize anything over the data :)"
3501,isfj,"One of the many unique things of (dominant) Si is our ability to be very attentive to the details and changes of our immediate physical environment
This can cause a lot of neat traits about us that I feel like can be a positive thing for others (such as easily remembering the little things about others you care about, being very patient and loyal, etc)
How does your Si (and perhaps with your Fe) positively help you with your life or do positive things?
Im trying to think of other ways to use Si better outside being confident in my patience, loyalty and actually legit enjoying doing the small repetitive needs that not many else like to do."
3502,isfj,"I use it with Ti in order to improve accuracy of thought. i feel like every piece of information, every detail i notice is a lego block and i'm constantly putting these blocks together to form conclusions, trying to make them as perfectly and as smooth as possible. I'll find a piece, find a spot, stick it in, and do that over and over all day about everything.
I use that together with Fe to get good at reading emotions via facial expressions and tone. So i know when a friend is in distress even if they're trying to hide it and i've become good at certain bluffing games like Coup or Resistance."
3503,isfj,"Hello! 
I am seeking advice/ clarification on ISFJ behavior. We have been friends for a year now, met at work, and shared romantic interest which faded away for a few months when I stopped working as much because of school responsibilities. Now that I am working more again we see each other more. 
I am confused about ISFJs and their typical love language/ signals. Ever since we met we felt comfortable sitting close to each other and joking around. He would stare at me a lot when he thought I wasn’t paying attention, so much that other coworkers would tell me that he obviously liked me. 
However, I have been very direct with my advances which has brought him more confidence to compliment me more bluntly BUT he doesn’t admit that he likes me. 
All of my coworkers say how he gets “stuck” around me and I’m the only person he asks for help or hugs/ seeks affection from. 
I don’t understand! He’s terrible at texting so I assume he’s not interested so when I stop giving him my attention he seems butt hurt. I don’t understand, I feel I put way too much effort into initiating. Any ISFJ insight would be useful, dunno if ISFJs are really that shy or if I should just give up and poor my energy elsewhere. 
I’m also a very emotionally intelligent INTJ, in the sense that I’m not insensitive or purely logical and care about what others are feeling. He’s very logical to the point that he acts more ISTJ-ish but he keeps testing as an ISFJ. 
Update 1: I decided to be very direct and explicitly ask him out on a date! No confession of feelings yet. 
Update 2: ISFJ is much more confident and blunt about planning our first date. We are going to the Zoo. "
3504,isfj,"A) tests aren’t the most reliable way of determining MBTI type
B) Hard to say. I know as an ISFJ I personally would be very hesitant to tell someone I liked them if I wasn’t very sure the friendship would survive it. I have a lot of trouble figuring out if someone could possibly like me and I tend to end up telling myself “it’s all in your head, don’t embarrass yourself,” so unless you’re very sure he knows how you feel, like, you’ve told him directly, I wouldn’t just assume he’s picking up on your signals. I’m willing to initiate things, but I need to feel a certain level of comfort/safety before I will, so it might be that he still feels insecure and is afraid to actually make a move. "
3505,isfj,"Dated isfj before, isfj Male excels in texting! Loads of messages every day. As an INTJ, I’d recommend you not to be emotional invested at the start. Honestly I never initiate chats/talks/meetups with mâles unless he’s my family or colleagues or ppl I have to contact in order to get practical things done. "
3506,isfj,"Can you clarify on not being sure if the friendship would survive it part? What would make you feel comfortable/ feel safe? 
I really like him but I don’t want to invade his personal space or make him feel uncomfortable so I try to be strategic in how I approach him which makes me tired. 
I haven’t explicitly said “I like you” because I would rather wait until I feel that he is sure he likes me? Haha. I just give obvious clues like asking to hang out, touching (not sexually), and compliments on his appearance. "
3507,isfj,"Hello! My direct advances have been compliments and touch (not sexually) which have been reciprocated and initiated. I haven’t directly stated word for word “I like you” because I want to be more strategic and wait until there’s no question that we both feel the same. I don’t wanna say it and he is unsure or uninterested or make it awkward for him. I have to tip-toe a lot around him but I like to think my advances are obvious but I’m starting to think I underestimated his obliviousness...
Out of curiosity, what problem have you encountered with ISFJs? ( I ask because of your first sentence). 
A bit off topic, what level of comfort have you experienced with ISFJs? Even though they aren’t N-dom they have a very soothing effect on me and I have read that despite being physical contact averse types, that barrier tends to not be there between INTJs and ISFJs (I have noted this with 2 ISFJs so I don’t have enough subjects to see a commonality with this experience). 
Thank you for your time and comment! "
3508,isfj,"Why not initiate and why avoid emotional investment? Out of curiosity.
Surprisingly, this ISFJ male likes it when I take initiative (so far) and he sucks at texting (so far). We both rather talk in person which is when the chemistry is strong. 
I’m less stereotypical INTJ around him and he acts more like an ISTJ. He is highly intelligent and practical it’s refreshing. "
3509,isfj,"I have been doing much of the same, re: compliments and touch, but I don't think that's enough. I think ISFJs are much less willing to take a risk on the uncertainty of someone reciprocating their feelings or not, so I'm expecting to be the one to tell him how I feel and move from there. The only problem is that INTJs are the same, or at least I am. I do not do well with uncertainty, and the thought of telling someone about my feelings without knowing how they feel fills me with dread. I guess it could be compared to evidence, in which the little things are all circumstantial evidence, and actually saying it out loud to their face is hard evidence. Its always possible to attribute circumstantial evidence of their feelings to them just being friendly, just flirting, whatever, and I know that personally, I won't act on something that weak. Also, you have the additional complication of gender roles, in which the man is expected to confess to the woman, but ISFJs are notorious for Not Doing That.
Lol, so I (25, M) met my (""my"") ISFJ (26, M) last fall on a trip with mutual friends to the woods. He flew from the east coast to the west coast for a week, and we actually ended up sleeping in the same bed and holding each other all night right before he flew back home. I kept in contact via text, but not very good contact, because I tried dating a couple (which didn't work out very quickly). Anyway, end of February he up and fuckin' moves to my hometown across the country to room with our mutual friend despite not having a confirmed job or anything. Which I could not believe because he's an ISFJ and all. The first time I saw him at their housewarming party we were pretty flirty (I THINK???) but I didn't know how to behave around him and so I think I was more distant than he thought I would be, which I think then made him pull away. I live two hours away for school, but I've been home a few more times since then and trying to read the signals between us has been driving me nuts. I graduate in like a week and a half and move home, so then we'll be living in the same city and all and it'll be easier to, idk, pursue him.
My plan with him is probably just to tell him how I feel at an appropriate time, and then either offer to go on a date sometime, or tell him that if he asks me out I will definitely say yes. My worry is that if I ask him out, he will say yes simply because that's the easiest choice and he has problems with avoiding conflict. Even if he says yes, I'm still going to be wondering if he actually likes me or not. So the other option would be to put his mind at ease by unambiguously letting him know how I feel, and then letting him decide if he wants to ask me out or not. Although that also carries the risk of him being too anxious to ask me out and not doing anything about it, at which point I will do nothing because I think he hates me now. So I need to find a balance somehow. Ha. Haha.
As to your question of comfort- I really don't know. I had a fairly unopinionated view of ISFJs before him, and maybe its just a halo effect, but I know I like him, so I must like ISFJs? Positively, I like how conscientious they are, how kind they are, and how they like to keep the peace. Negatively, I am conflict averse and he's VERY conflict averse, so things might get swept under the rug and build up. Physically, I avoid touching him because I don't know how he feels, and because I get physiologically aroused being near him, and I try to avoid that discomfort. I've been trying to work on casually touching others, since research shows that it has positive social benefits, but I can't bring myself to breach that bubble for some reason."
3510,isfj,"Do not invest yourself unless he’s proven to be worthy of the effort. All males like girls to take the initiative. My experience with isfj male, he’s extremely good at texting and took the initiative texting every day, sometimes voice calls etc. Being intelligent and practical is his style. But it doesn’t mean that this person is actually reliable. See what he does for you when you are in difficulties, see what his attitude towards others at the same time. Isfj Males are probably Nice to Every One around. If it’s the first stage of a relationship, as a fellow intj i suggest you to be yourself and observe until he proves himself to be worthy of your emotions or devotion. "
3511,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply, I was hoping I would get insight from an ISFJ before answering to have new insight on how to tackle our struggle. 
Your strategy seems like the best one, about telling him that you will say “yes” if he asked you out buuuuuuut maybe be more suave about it. 
Hilariously ( to me at least) I’m putting myself in an ESTP, ESFP, ENTJ mindset on how they court ISFJs since they tend to get them out of their shells quite easily. 
They’re all very suave and direct, and when I’m like that around “my” ISFJ I tend to get the best responses. 
Hopefully we get ISFJ insight. One person mentioned that they are hesitant in pursuing a person if they feel the friendship won’t “survive” it and being insecure about the other person’s feelings towards them."
3512,isfj,"I see, thanks for the advice! We’ve actually been friends for a year now so he’s proven himself to be someone I trust. He’s been around me when  I’m moody, sad, annoying, mad, anxious etc. I’ll definitely keep your advice in mind since males can be deceiving in these sort of situations... gotta keep my emotions in check... "
3513,isfj,"Oooh, acting like a ESTP/ESFP/ENTJ is a great strategy. I know I can be very charismatic/suave for short amounts of time, and I've been working on letting myself be less uptight and able to look like a fool in front of others. It take a lot of energy, but it also definitely seems to set others at ease. I think consciously overcoming inhibitions and/or ignoring insecurities would help a lot in setting an ISFJ at ease. I think I'll try to adopt that strategy moving forward.
Although I can definitely relate to being hesitant to pursue a person because the ""friendship"" wouldn't survive it. But that just goes back to uncertainty about the relationship. Why don't relationships survive one person confessing feelings and the other not reciprocating? Awkwardness? How can that risk be mitigated moving forward with confessing of feelings? I suppose that's why initiating a relationship is so difficult for us in the first place, with both parties trying to minimize negative outcomes with the other person.
Yeah, it's too bad this hasn't gotten more replies. Maybe cross-posting this on r/MBTI would bring in a more diverse set of opinions, although I would definitely like to see more opinions from ISFJs here."
3514,isfj,"I’m happy to read this. Yes, overcoming inhibitions around people allows others to feel more relaxed usually, also adding more casual touch helps a lot psychologically as you mentioned in your initial response... give him something to think about for the next few days with his dominant Si ;) haha. 
When I act more assertive like an ESTP around this ISFJ I make him blush A LOT. It’s fun even though I’m internally blushing from such straightforward behavior. 
Get your charisma going and tell me how it goes ^^ 
I’ll be doing the same, hahaha. "
3515,isfj,"I thought we'd do a theme for the next few weekend threads of our cognitive functions. Starting with our dominant function of Introverted Sensing. I plan I weekend doing future posts regarding our other valued functions of Extroverted Feeling, Introverted Thinking, and Extroverted Intuition. Sometimes online descriptions don't get the full picture of how we use cognitive functions so I wanna hear from ISFJs about the functions from our perspective. Here's how Introverted Sensing works from my perspective.
Dominant Si

Go to for everything and can do this in my sleep. I'm constantly comparing and contrasting between past and present without even thinking about it.
Highly aware of internal bodily sensations. Like hunger, thirst, and fatigue. I don't think I could let a whole day past without eating or drinking.
Great memory for facts and details that made an sense impression on me. (Ex. If I value a relationship with someone I will make an effort to remember most of the facts and details about them.). Common misconception is that dominant Si users have a photographic memory this is false and I tend to remember the facts and details that made an personal impression on me.
Highly aware of changes in my sensory environment and think about the potential positive or negative impact the changes have on me.
My brain is similar to internal filing cabinet and all of the important facts and details are in their proper place.
I enjoy creating career plans because I want my future to be similar to the good memories of past or even better than the past.
When I learn about a subject, I can break learning down into manageable and sensible steps to learn the information in an effective manner.
Overtime, able to become an expert in a subject due to incremental learning over time.
Can get overwhelmed with too much new sensory information and change because of not being able to post process it all. 

​
So fellow ISFJs how do you experience dominant Si?"
3516,isfj,"I'd say that I definitely am aware of how other people perceive me.  I'm always conscious of the face that I'm making, how a person is reacting to me, and what other people ""generally"" think of me.  I know, on some level, what I can do to make someone like me more, or become friends with them, even though I don't always act on those thoughts.  It's often said that NFJ's are great at reading people, but I think as an ISFJ, I'm pretty good at reading people too, even though I do it differently.  I mostly read people when I want to figure out what they think about me, or if I'm interested in them and want to know them better.  
So, other ISFJ's: are you aware of what people think about you?"
3517,isfj,"I sometimes feel like I might be too self aware or sometimes irrational in the way people might think of me and my actions. I think I definitely worry abt it a bit too much, I like to think I don’t care and I’m pretty confident but sometimes I become concerned if I upset or annoyed the people around me even if I don’t necessarily like that person. "
3518,isfj,"I feel like I'm pretty good at reading people, like how they are feeling and if something is amiss. However when it comes to how they perceive me, I know vaguely if they hate/dislike/like/love me but not how they see me. A
 friend I've known since I was little told me how he perceived me & how people generally do. I was like ""really??? Waat??"" "
3519,isfj,"I am to an extent.. and can read people, to an extent.. 
But it largely feels like I cannot truly read people, nor can I know what they are thinking and I also feel like I have not much control over how to change my own expression on my face.. "
3520,isfj,"I'm aware of direct, in-the-moment thoughts by reading other's facial expressions. In regards to how they REALLY feel about me...I have no clue. As an introvert and someone who has some social anxiety, I get super nervous talking to people over the phone because I can't see their face, which is ironic."
3521,isfj,"Well, depends on what you mean by reading people - I think that we're great at reading the emotions of others, and knowing whether they like us or not.  I won't know though, for example, if someone has a crush on me - I might suspect, but I won't know.  I've noticed that we can easily sense romantic chemistry between other people, or how close two people are - I can tell when two ""best friends"" don't like each other much based on the way they're interacting, or when two best friends genuinely admire each other.  I always know when someone's been gossiping about me after I've talked to them (uncomfortable looks, an unintentionally judgmental face, etc.)  For me, it's always facial expressions, and I'd imagine it's a similar thing for other ISFJ's.  Facial expressions tell me everything I need to know about a person.  I'm usually able to read between the lines if I'm trying to figure out the facial expression someone is making, and I'll come to some sort of conclusion (""Alana has made this face toward me twice... if she disliked me, she'd be different about it.  She was different about it with Cindy, who she very openly dislikes.  When I pass by her friends in the hallway, they give me these nice but also uncomfortable glances.  This is a new development.  Alana talks about me, doesn't she?"")  I never outright state my conclusion, because there's always the chance that it's wrong, but I know.  After I've been told something about a person, I'll start reaching conclusions about other things. This is, again, something I've noticed in other ISFJ's - knowing to some extent, but not wanting to say it because what if we're wrong and we embarrass ourselves? I've noticed that NFJ's are more comfortable with stating their conclusions in a polite way.  I suspect that Ni-Fe makes them certain, while my Fe-Ne makes me pretty sure but still sure that I could be wrong."
3522,isfj,"This is extremely relatable!  I'll sometimes notice I've either made someone unintentionally uncomfortable (well, not exactly uncomfortable, but more that I've ruined the vibe of our conversation and made them a bit judgy of me,) and I'll think about it for the rest of the day.  I'm starting to care a little less as time goes on - I've found that most people aren't going to see you and just think, ""Yesterday my conversation with her was sooo awkward lol,"" and so thinking about that helps me deal with it better."
3523,isfj,"I'll know if they hate/dislike/love me too, but I can usually figure out how they perceive me when I analyze their reaction to me.  ""Oh, that person was squirming around me a bit today... they looked uncomfortable.  They must be uncertain about me in some kind of way - maybe they just haven't gotten to know me well, maybe they've heard something about me."""
3524,isfj,"First of all, thank you for thoroughly explaining everything. 
I know for me, I’m pretty good at reading people’s emotions, but I know a lot of people I found nice back in the days of school-many people said were mean…
With facial expressions, can you still tell if someone is faking it? Like pretending to be nice to you? Or have a neutral expression, even if they’re angry? Do you know when people are using you?
Hmm, idk, but for me, I normally assume people who are concealing their emotions etc. don’t want to be asked what’s wrong, so I say nothing or something along those lines.
I know a lot of people would take you guys for granted-be there, done that. I guess I thought you wanted to help me, rather than seeing it as your duty to help me-if that makes sense. I’m guilty of asking an ISFJ for help-after reading this sub, I feel like I’m probably burdening him-but don’t worry! I’m backing off "
3525,isfj,"You have to go into conversations remembering people are focused more on themselves than they are on you. And if you do manage to embarrass yourself, you are much likely to remember the impression than they ever will."
3526,isfj,"Hmm, would you say that you can see chemistry between people/how close others are to each other, or how they interact better than you can see what they think of you?  I find that I'm great at reading people, but I also tend to usually know what they think of me because I'll analyze the way they react to me, and use my Ne to limit down the possibilities.  I'll always have a feeling, but I like to be certain."
3527,isfj,"That train of thought makes sense to me and is something I would probably think also. I always observing people's reactions to me and others to make sure we are cool. 
I'm referring to like a conclusion someone may reach about me. I made a new friend recently and I know that she likes to be around me and finds me funny but had no idea she thought I had a ""spicy"" personality until she told me so. I asked my longtime friend what he thought and he said, ""your more straightforward matter makes people think you have a strong personality when I wouldn’t necessarily classify it as strong so much as a frank understanding of what makes sense to you and what doesn’t."" 
The fact that they perceive me as spicy or frank is something I could of never come up with myself. "
3528,isfj,"I can usually tell when someone is pretending to be nice to me, or using me.  People think they're subtle about it, but when the expression isn't easy to figure out, the eyes tell all - when someone is being fake nice to you, unless they're very good with manipulation, they'll have this sort of gleam to their eye.  I get the vibe that they're using me, but even though I'll know they're doing it, I'll usually do what they want because I don't want to be mean.  If I get an uncomfortable vibe from the situation, I'll know.
And it's not that we don't want to help you.  On some level, I do see it as my duty to help people, but it does come from a genuine place - a healthy ISFJ wants you to feel good, and we won't resent you for needing help, unless we know that you're using us."
3529,isfj,"That's very true!  I think that I'm in my head a lot.  I spend a lot of time when I get home thinking about my day, analyzing what happened, thinking about what's changed in my day, etc.  I've found that I worry a lot.  From what I've read, other ISFJ's can relate.  I HATE inferior Ne anxiety."
3530,isfj,"Could not agree more especially when I’m heading off to bed, that’s what I’m doing, analyzing myself and my entire day. But yes I also agree that I’ve gotten a lot better and have realized that most of the time everyone else is too busy worrying about everyone else noticing every tiny thing that could possibly be wrong about them to notice any tiny thing that could be wrong about you... at least that’s what I tell myself when I start to overthink 😆"
3531,isfj,"You're right.  Of course, some people will focus on your flaws, but something I tell myself when that happens is that if I'm one of the things they choose to talk about, they must not know how to make interesting conversation.  I'm not going to pretend that I've never talked about someone before - I think most people have, whether they realize it or not - but if all someone has to talk about is other people, I feel like it tells more about them than it does about you."
3532,isfj,"http://www.reddit.com/r/entp/comments/1w3ihi/what_is_your_relationship_like_with_isfjs_our/

This post over on /r/entp made me curious to see what you guys think of us. It amused me that some of ENTPs said they couldn't stand ISFJs and some said they went ahead and got married"
3533,isfj,I'm from the ENTP board and I just want to point out that ISFP and ISFJ get mistyped as each other frequently.  ENTP gets along very poorly with ISFP.  Please take some of the comments with a grain of salt.  
3534,isfj,"My boyfriend is also an ENTP and I've never gotten along with anyone better (and I mean anyone). Our temperaments are yin and yang, and it seems to enhance our relationship. We're serious and talk about marriage periodically."
3535,isfj,"My mom's an ENTP, and we've had our struggles. I mean we love each other and have a good relationship, but she ha high expectations of me in some areas and always wanted me to try new, better ideas where I really wanted to just stick with what was already working for me (NP vs SJ). We fought a lot in that direction. It's rough but it's kind of interesting as well"
3536,isfj,"It's subtle.  Here are things I really look at.
Perception of the past
ISFP - Their thinking relies on information from the moment.  Yes they can think about the past, and they might every now and then...  But they really use information from the moment.  They tend to value pop culture over tradition.  They might value traditions that are still ""in"" such as Thanksgiving.  They don't really value thinking about all the ridiculous possible futures and will instead spend a limited amount of time thinking about the most likely future.  How much future thinking is a maturity thing.  
ISFJ - The past is their pool of knowledge that they use frequently as a means of deciding what to do in the current situation.  They are also very aware of the moment, but they actively seek the past  as a bank.  They tend to be a tad more traditional.  When they think about the future, there is a little bit more uncertainty to it.  Again, how much they think about the future is a maturity thing.  
Emotional processing
ISFP - This is hard for me to explain because this is literally the opposite of me.  I understand it as ""making decisions based on emotional flow.""  They likely are able to think about how peoples emotions work in a very fluid way.  When growing up, they likely had trouble knowing what emotion they were feeling.  They tend to not care about how things like cars or computers work, and in fact frequently have difficulties with trouble shooting those things until they get a little bit more mature.
ISFJ - From what I understand, it is making decisions based on clear emotional states.  Someone is ""angry"" or ""sad"" or whatever and you are thinking about that.  This is where the comparison to fluids in the ISFP description comes from.   ISFJs have ""solid"" emotions and typically are more black and white with things like trust.   They think to their pasts and think ""I felt X.""
Stereotypes 
ISFP - very concerned about appearance(doesn't mean they want to look like a barbie doll.  They still choose their look), super focused on maintaining harmony right now (when unhealthy, may put off conflict in unreasonable situations), I find their emotions unpredictable and impossible to deal with (definitely bias on my part).
ISFJ - very concerned about nurturing and maintaining health.  Still concerned about appearance, but often times the subject is something or someone else, they also care a lot about maintaining harmony but will break harmony to maintain ""long term harmony"" such as tradition (this is a point where ISFP will give in for the current harmony), and their emotions are more distinct (though harder to shift into new emotions).  "
3537,isfj,"So I've taken the test many times and it never deviates. I am an extremely caring person, go out of my way to make everyone smile and be happy, always want everyone to have a good time etc. etc. The problem is recently I started reading about incurable brain tumors in children (summer project for class next year) and I feel like it is contributing to my depression. I just feel an overwhelming amount of sympathy, why them, it's not fair, feel bad for the families, and on and on. Its not really normal as I've never met these kids. Like I will think about them multiple times a day and almost cry because I feel so bad for them and I feel helpless in the situation. Like I just wish I could fix it. I guess my question is how do I turn this off and not get so emotionally envolved? It's strange I don't really cry during movies bc I am able to see that it is fake, but anything like this in real life I clearly don't handle well..."
3538,isfj,"Look into other awful things in the world that also effect you to this level. Find so many that you have to force yourself to realize that there is no true fairness in nature or the world. And realize that we can only do the good we can everyday. 
Collectively we can make the world better and maybe even fair where we are able to. But we can't expect fairness to come out of nowhere.
Some kids are brought into the world having happy loving parents. Some into abusive households. Some born horribly sick. Some born a little different from societal norms. Some born having advantageous genetics to society's standards. Many born into countries that take advantage of their citizens or into slavery.
Place hope in the change you can do and the change people strive for. See that our literacy rate is higher world wide than ever before, starvation/death by dehydration is a world wide low, wars is also at an all time low, education is at an all time high, life expectancy is at an all time high. And understand that people have been working together, slowly trying to make things better throughout history. And try to be a part of that. And find peace in that hope."
3539,isfj,Find a reputable cancer research charity and set up a monthly donation. Sure it's still sad but you'll at least feel as if you're contributing and trying to solve the problem. It will take a little bit of it off your shoulders. 
3540,isfj,"Maybe you should volunteer at an organization that helps children with cancer.
Side note: I once watched someone die on the side of the road and I couldn't help them because I didn't know CPR. Instead of feeling sad I decided I was going to change my life to do something about it, so the very next day I decided to become an EMT. I now know CPR and I get to save people on a regular basis."
3541,isfj,"Its probably not your personality type, its that you're a deeply caring person. I do the same things, more like try to completely avoid painful things and I'm not isfj. 
But I'm sorry i dont have a solution. I just dont think you should wish you were something you're not. But i do understand that it's painful."
3542,isfj,"Take the way it makes you feel and use that as fuel to change it, that's what I'm doing with all the BS that's going on in the world right now. And yeah, I'm not able to make HUGE strides to where I want to be in terms of my effectiveness on the world, but at least I'm doing something."
3543,isfj,"Volunteer at a local hospital and watch people heal. If you are younger, you might consider going to college for nursing. A lot of nurses are ISFJs and you will be in great company and understood. You could get a letter of recommendation and scholarships for volunteering your time and actually using your summer to get ahead. Good luck. "
3544,isfj,"And then begin to silently resent it because you don't want to cause conflict or hurt somebody's feelings?
I'm one of my only friends with a car and I also make more than a lot of my friends so I often end up driving everybody around and covering people for food if they don't have money, although people don't generally do the same back...
I'm honestly usually happy to do it but sometimes I resent it because I see myself as the ""responsible"" one, and sometimes find myself judging other people's spending habits even though I don't want to (ie he just spent a bunch of money on weed and now that invite to the mall is clearly just so that they have someone to drive them there and not have to spend 2 hours on the bus, yet I know they're not going to give me gas money because they invited me to hang out... etc).
I guess I'm also a bit of a people pleaser because I have a tough time saying no. I live in a town where the bus system is abysmal but a lot of young people don't drive, as well as there only being a lot of minimum wage jobs. Anyone else?"
3545,isfj,"Yes. I've had to accept that I genuinely enjoy helping out more than others will ever think to help me. And resisting or refusing to help would make me feel unfulfilled. HOWEVER it does cross the line into being taken advantage of (which you describe!). The hardest thing for me is to differentiate the moments when I'm going to enjoy helping a friend and when i'm going to feel resentful about it. One thing that helped was identifying how my different friends show their appreciation/friendship in return. It might be in different ways than I do for them and therefore expect (acts of service). If a friend reciprocates in a different way or clearly isn't just keeping me around because i'm ""nice"" then its all good.
I've slowly learned to avoid or deflect the situations that are truly going to make me feel taken advantage of. By deflect I mean, someone asks you do to something and you propose an alternative that works better for you (different day/time, different location). It's not a flat out ""no"" and shows their willingness to adapt to your preferences. "
3546,isfj,"Seconded. Just learning that everyone is different and has his or her priorities and sometimes the schedules don't work out as you'd like. 
I just flat out say no to things I don't want to do anymore.  It's gotten mentally draining to try to make everyone happy. Just a small group of close people is enough for me to spend my time and energy on. "
3547,isfj,"Good to know I'm not the only one, hah. Sometimes I think I'm just really conceited and like on a high horse but people tell me how responsible I am all the time. 22 is a rough age to be basically an old lady. 🤣"

3549,isfj,"So for many years I've learned to distrust reacting on my emotions right away and also became very practiced in how I express myself in order to be understood and make arguments so that they are effective. it's a skill i built up in dealing with my emotionally abusive and narcissistic parents. 
If someone were to say something mean or something that upsets me, I would digest their words to figure out why it was said or what was the real meaning of it. then i'd go over in my head what about it i don't like and then how to talk to the person so that they can understand what i don't like about it, that the thing i don't like makes sense, and why it would be beneficial for them and to those around them if this person were to alter how they act in similar circumstances.
and i can do this through high stress situations. but i don't show it on my face, in my body language, or my tone. i don't want to escalate the situation, and i want to be at maximum persuasion for a long term effect, and the best way i find to do so is through a calm demeanor and through making simple points, and kind of stroking a person's ego a bit on whatever their strongest positive trait is, and basing my argument around that trait and that perspective. and it's kind of stupidly martyristic of me to always be doing this i guess. i'm very ends-over-means and take-the-high-road about it.
but it comes with a draw back in that it takes a lot of effort for me to do that. it sucks the emotional energy right out of me. and also, when i do it, it requires me to show calm, even when i'm not, even if my heart is racing and i just want to yell at the person. and this ended up being a problem with my ex girlfriend. even if i said i disliked something, it was hard for her to really comprehend how much it was a problem for me because i did not show it in my expressions or tone, only my words.
i don't even know what i'm trying to get out of writing this. advice? understanding? something. i just know there is a problem and it's not quite concrete to me yet what it's exact nature is so i currently can't even try to find a solution."
3550,isfj,"ENTP here to link the dots, and push on the wrong buttons.
Lets see : 

Emotional Withdrawal

Because : 

Parents with narcissistic tendencies.


My 500+ comment Karma on /r/raisedbynarcissists is clear about what to do : 
You need to feel safe, before anything. You need a home, and I'm sure you've come to find your parent's isn't any home.
I'm emotionally drained, too, because I get nothing from no one. It's literally like being out of fucks to give.
So, safe place, and people who can give you some love and warmth, basically."
3551,isfj,"i live away from them now and i consider my friends my real family. 
though i guess i work with my parents, so that sucks. 
and now i'm thinking about the idea of a home with people who i can feel warmth and loved from and just the idea of what that feels like is getting me to tear up.
ok...yeah. you're right. i need this."
3552,isfj,"Don't stay with them. Never and in any case.
Why ? You still have some loyalty to them, when they never had any to you ?
It's meant to make you whole. To heal your wounds.
You can do neither if they keep any kind of bearing on your life.
There's no shortcut. It's basic needs : they appear in Maslow's pyramid."
3553,isfj,it's because it sounds so amazing. the idea of it. going home and feeling loved and like i don't have to carry this tension around all the time. so i can just act how i want to and just be accepted for it without tightly controlling myself.
3554,isfj,"also, that was a long time ago, and they have gotten a lot better since then. they recognize a lot of what they did was wrong and are earnestly trying to be better.  but i live alone because i can't deal with them all the time and they still fall back into habit. when they do that i explain to them how what they're doing is wrong or abusive or irrational. and they try to adjust. 
i guess i'm taking on the role of their therapist and it's unhealthy for me to do so because i'm not a therapist, and it effects me emotionally, and i need to focus on my shit too."
3555,isfj,"It can be real. I don't have to do that anymore, myself.
I still keep some paranoïd reflexes inherited from when I was abused, but I'm aware when these reflexes are triggered, and what red flag triggered it.
Above all, you'll learn how to love and trust someone else. And how to love and trust yourself. It's priceless, because it just needs you to believe in it, and act towards making it real.
It's not easy, but just never forget you deserve it."
3556,isfj,"That's why No Contact is advised. It's also to protect oneself from attempts of manipulation.
You need to rebuild your boundaries before enforcing them consistently.
And before that, you need to take care of your needs.
Why not just take a break for that ?
Keeping composure ask for gigantic efforts and energy.

Take time to read what I already wrote : I weight each of my words, and edit often, when I've found a better formulation."
3557,isfj,"i work at their company in a managerial capacity. they want me to take over the company when they retire or die. and i've expressed my deep desire to leave the company and work somewhere else. so we've settled on setting up the company in such a way that it can be sold, even though they are still trying to convince me to stay. currently each of us works about 3+ jobs. i do engineering, production management, and purchasing as my main jobs. i also handle the IT, shipping documents, some inventory tracking, any special projects, and replace sick people on the manufacturing line should the situation call for it. but iono, i don't think i should be crying around my employees. can't hide that from my face, even if i did it in the bathroom."
3558,isfj,"I'm sure you have that right. Best is to ask an attorney before leaving.
Personally, I would have left without second thought, but I'm an idiot.
it's impossible to handle that much responsibility. You're putting your health at risk.
Well I think you should.
My father never cried in front of me, even when the situation called for it.
My lacrimal canals are so dry I can't even cry even if I wanted. Don't be like me. Showing vulnerability in front of people who are under your responsibility is the best way to show you're human like them, and can be taken as an example.
I think it's exemplary, and not some kind of character flaw.
It's indifference and a lack of empathy that are to me. "
3559,isfj,"Isfj male in college, and it seems I don't meet women who I'm interested in ever. I'm starting to wonder if it will ever happen if I'm not being gregarious. Just wondering if any males have met their (loving) wives by not being the gregarious type, and would like to hear if you sucked it up and talked to pretty strangers"
3560,isfj,"Not my wife, but my girlfriend who I intend to marry. We met through a mutual friend who we both kinda hang out with on occasion, but happened to be the same occasion on that night. I thought she was cute and funny so I asked our mutual friend for her number and we went from there! Eventually I got the courage to ask her out on a date and then did the typical, “well this was fun, we should do this again sometime!” and she just kept saying yes!"
3561,isfj,"Another work around is asking your buddies for an introduction. Ask them to have a think of who to match you with...and you can start with something you are interested in...say you watch Better Call Saul....then take it from there. :)
If you get to the point of frustration...you can channel your energy in improving yourself (like getting to the point of being able to start a conversation with any stranger --- potential relationship interest or not)...and working on the projects your excited about while widening your network. Repeat the introduction request...until you find your right match!"
3562,isfj,"My ex husband is an ISFJ. When I studied his friend was a roommate of me. He walked upstairs, we looked each other in the eyes and the spark was there immediately. We have been in a relationship for six years. It was a wonderful time and we still have contact. 
I was the one who had the courage to go to my roommates room with the lamest excuse ever. He took the first step for my number and a date."
3563,isfj,"I did online dating in University. I had a ton of trouble with being romantically bold in person due to shyness and confidence. I had more success researching profiles with shared interests, and having time to think about handling text based conversation helped me a ton. It's been 8 years since I met my amazing wife and I am one happy man :D"
3564,isfj,"I imagine this is a feeling a lot of ISFJs have....that moment when you know you are deeply in love with someone and not sure if it’s fully reciprocated but you don’t even care bc your feelings are so strong and you need to express them fully. That’s where I’m at now. 
It’s such a beautiful feeling, having that much love and affection and care for someone; feels like it’s my life’s purpose. But I also hate it bc I know how hard I fall when shit goes wrong. 
My current partner of about 5 months (ISFP) really struggles to concretely express affection through words. His body language would indicate to me that he feels just as strongly as I do, but also he claims he has never been in love with anyone before. 
I have no problem interpreting my emotions and once I understand them, I feel like I need to express them. I told him I loved him last week, to which he didn’t say much (which I expected). I’m not concerned that he didn’t say it back—I know words are hard for him. I’m moreso concerned that I’m being stupid and irrational and I’m mad at myself for putting myself again in this position that I desperately want (to be in love) yet am so scared of. 
When I care this much about someone and they hurt me, it’s ugly. Out pops this angry, petty, bitchy, demanding version of myself that I don’t even recognize. It’s almost like I put so much trust into them that it feels like the ultimate betrayal when things go wrong (ie breakup) and I backlash. 
Not even sure why I’m posting this. I suppose just wondering if any other ISFJs can relate? "
3565,isfj,"I think it’s only normal for us to feel scared when we really love someone, because it takes awhile for us to fall in love but when we do, we fall HARD and we are aware of how much it would hurt us if it doesn’t work out the way we expected to. We hate uncertainties and we have high expectations, because we also want our feelings to be reciprocated, and the fact that your ISFP isn’t big in words of affirmation, then I think it stems from that. ISFJs are big on appreciation, affirmation, and reassurance. I’ve learned that it’s always better to ask your partner about how he really feels about you than to overthink on your own and assume things that are far from reality. "
3566,isfj,"Is this written by me? Kidding aside, I can fully relate to this. I have always felt this way in the few times I have been in love. To me, to love is to trust in them so much that you give them the power to hurt you but believe that they won’t willingly do so. I know you’re not looking for advice and just probably want to be heard. I am hoping that everything turns out for the best in this relationship of yours. Being in love and being loved in return is one of the most wonderful experiences one can have and you’re brave to still go on despite your fears. I’m rooting for you."
3567,isfj,Being in love can definitely be a strong feeling for ISFJs. I can relate to what you said about strong feelings that need to be reciporcated. I do value being honest with someone when I have strong feelings for them. I think you guys need to have an honest conversation where you talk about how you feel so strongly about him and are wondering if he loves you back. I always love it when I help someone and they thank me for all the hard work I did. 
3568,isfj,"I'm an INTJ and something I appreciate very much is a direct answer to a question that begs a specific type of response. I am dating an ISFJ and it seems that when I ask her things that concern me, like guys that hit on her or guys that message or Snapchat her she looks like a dear caught in headlights. From what I've read and heard, ISFJs are supposed to be very loyal and honest. 
From where I'm standing as an INTJ her lack of coming forward with information that would put me at ease is a form of dishonesty. If there is nothing to be worried about then it should be easy to say it, right? There shouldn't be avoidance behaviors. Can you guys walk me through your thought process to let me know if she's actually being shady by playing coy or if you keep EVERYTHING internalized. I don't think I can handle that, if I feel that I'm right about something, I'll put my neck out there to prove it or learn."
3569,isfj,"I'm not sure this has much to do with personality types.  I think cornering a girl overtly like that never works out well, and doesn't look good when you show insecurity by asking those things.  Women communicate different than us and, as much as it can frustrate us men, there's nothing we can do about it."
3570,isfj,"ISFJ guy here. If you are insecure in your relationship, you need to cut it out. A girl can't control who hits on her. She should be able to have friends, even if they are guys. Check yourself first.
My sister-in-law is an INTJ. Her logical mind is abstract, confounding, and unrelenting. Relationships have not gone well for her. That said, here's the best I have to help you out.
She is afraid you will assume the worst and cut her off with an explosion; or worse, go after the guy in question. Yes, there will be avoidance behaviors especially if you're all in her face. We hate conflict. It's like popping pimples. We'd rather not do it if we don't have to. Lots of times we're glad we did, but it sucks arguing with someone. If you think you're going to force anything with infallible logic, think again. ISFJ's have their breaking points and their bad side is long and deep.
My last bit of advice is: ~~Read up on~~  Study your conflict resolution."
3571,isfj,"This sounds pretty spot-on imo. We're very loyal, yes, but I think at least in less mature/healthy ISFJs, the honesty mostly stems from a place of wanting to be truthful to avoid conflict over lying, or sometimes even just wanting to be viewed as a good person. But if we feel the honesty actually poses more of a danger to those goals than simply keeping something to ourselves, we absolutely will clam up, at least in my experience. 
Because personally? Sometimes the truth is just not pleasant! Sometimes I dislike or resent someone for a reason that has nothing to do with them and which they can't do anything about. Should I make them aware that I feel that way about them? It's certainly not going to improve anyone's life if I do. I have some shitty habits and things I do and feel that I feel guilty about, and which I worry I would be judged and looked down on for, so I keep them to myself. 
My ego is invested in being a kind, sensible person, so if someone wants me to talk about something that would put my image in conflict with my ego, I would certainly need reassurance that they weren't going to go ""Wow, seriously? You feel that way? Jesus that's gross, why would you ever??"" after I made myself vulnerable. And not necessarily reassurance just from words, but proof from day-to-day life, because lying or underestimating a person's capacity for weirdness/questionable decisions/etc is easy. 
So after all of that, basically yes, what they said above, prove she can trust you with less-than-pretty truths and she'll probably open up more. "
3572,isfj,But why don't I feel like I can rest easy? She makes me so nervous as if almost any time I'm asked anything remotely probing it's like I'm gonna find out she's actively cheating. I've told her that from the moment I saw her I was crazy about her and my feelings have only gone down hill from there because she doesn't appear to express how she feels about me. Maybe she just wants to be with someone who wants her more than she wants them? This doesn't go well for INTJs. We're bleeding hearts for those we care about and expect reciprocated openness. How do you feel about someone opening up to you and expecting the same back?
3573,isfj,"Firstly, she doesn't even sound like an ISFJ.
Secondly, people are all different. All ISFJs are different. I think it's a reach trying to get into a mind of a cheating ISFJ, vicariously, through the non-cheating ISFJs on here. Some people here would never ever put themselves in that kinda situation.
Third, your relationship with this girl, ISFJ or not, lacks 2 essential elements: trust and communication. It sounds really unhealthy to me and I'm not sure why you're staying with someone who doesn't seem to respect you."
3574,isfj,"I dunno, I really can't tell you what's going on in her head. I do prefer honesty and openness in relationships, but it's easy for things to become complicated and twisted, especially if you're bringing other baggage into a relationship. Like I said, I know that when I'm in an unhealthy place, it's easy to give in to the temptation to shove things down and repress my feelings and honesty for the sake of avoiding hurt feelings or rejection. So I genuinely don't know what she's up to that she feels so reluctant to share. Maybe she's cheating, maybe she's indulging in a hobby she's embarrassed about, I really don't know. 
But I thought this situation sounded familiar and checked your post history, and I do indeed remember your last post. And in the name of honesty? This doesn't sound like a healthy relationship. Her continual secrecy is obviously really distressing you, and if you aren't able to sit her down and have a straightforward conversation and get some answers out of her, I think this is going to be a situation that continues to be draining and stressful for you. I know that's probably not something you wanna hear, but if I were advising a friend, I would say that unless you can have a big come to jesus conversation and everything suddenly turns around, it's time to dump her; you can do better and you deserve better. She might just not be a good fit for you emotionally. "
3575,isfj,"I browse this sub a lot, learning about ISFJs.  As an ENTJ, I can say we are strongly different in our approach.  I know Alpha from our ENTJ forum.  Good guy.  I'll give my unsolicited opinion here, we aren't a match in friendship or romance.  The emotional outbursts, the passive nature when intellectual conversations arise, the way an ISFJ is exhausted after a full social day, etc.  
I've had my fair share of interactions with ISFJs, and while they're nice people with huge hearts, we are way too overbearing and domineering for them.  "
3576,isfj,I convinced one of my friends to take the myer-Briggs test and she tested for isfj. She doesn’t really get what that means and asked me to explain it to her. So I thought who better to ask for an explanation then other isfjs. 
3577,isfj,"Hello everyone,
I’m an INTJ/ISFJ girl new to the forum and I was wondering if you all could offer some insight on a situation that has been troubling me for a while now.
In my freshman year of high school, I met an ISFJ male at school.  Every day, he would walk across the whole cafeteria to eat with me in the opposite corner, come sit by me in the library, and always waited with me by the lamppost after school.  Through his persistence, we became close friends.  He trusted me to the point of telling me very private secrets about his past.  I eventually got him a job working as a gardener and farmhand for my parents.  One day, he told me that he liked me.  I replied that his feelings must not interfere with his work, and I declined to give him a definitive answer back.  To complicate the situation, my parents decided to give him a truck so that he could commute to work without constantly having to rely on people to give him a ride.  On his eighteenth birthday, I gifted him a laminated four-leaf clover I discovered in the woods behind my house.  A few weeks passed, and I addressed the topic of his feelings for the first time.  After a bit of flustered banter back and forth, I admitted that I liked him back.  He was planning to return to his home state of Kentucky upon graduation in May, but he said he would stay in ILif I wanted him to.  We never formally spoke about this occurrence again, though I occasionally saw him when he worked at the farm over the summer to build a livestock pen.  Most of our interactions were through text or chat sites, as I was rather busy that year.  My mother was extremely overprotective, and would not let me freely interact with friends, especially not guy friends, without supervision.  He once tried to ask my mother if I could go hiking with him or if he could drive me home on early dismissal days, but my parents always refused.  Meanwhile, the livestock pen was taking quite a while to build, so my mother would often ask him how much longer it would take.  She began to put pressure on me to hurry him, and finally I wore out and went off on him during a text conversation.  In the heat of the moment, I told him I was upset that he did not come to work regularly and that I got the impression that he never considered me a friend (my mother’s idea). He was quite affected by it, and I felt rather remorseful afterwards.  We made up the next day.  After that, he texted me every time he was working to let me know he was.
To give you an idea of our drastic background differences, I am the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants and he was a Scotch-Irish country boy from the backwoods of Kentucky. In my parents’ traditional culture, interracial relationships are forbidden, and I mentioned it once to him.  He became very angry and the conversation was never brought up again.
Fall arrived, and I returned to school.  We had a series of spotty conversations, always abruptly stopped because he was busy doing something.  I could never figure out what he was occupied with, but I did not want to become a burden of annoyance so I never ventured to ask.  I messaged him one day with my regular greeting, and he sent back on the chat site: “Hey, I don’t think we should talk on here anymore.  I work 9 to 5 every weekday and the stock pen has taken so long that I don’t want to risk upsetting your parents.”  Though I felt a cold weight drop in my stomach, I replied with a terse: “Okay, that sounds like a good idea.”  He responded with “Yeah, sorry.”  That was September, and it was the last time we ever spoke.
He was killed in a workplace accident a month and a half later.  The day after, I was called down to the school office.  It was his sister, and he told me that they found in his pocket the clover I gave him and she gave it back to me.  She told me that my friend had told their dad that he was staying in town to wait for me to graduate and turn eighteen (I was fifteen then), though he wouldn’t do anything without my parents’ permission, namely my father’s.  I went down to his hometown for the funeral, and I was surprised that his relatives in Kentucky recognized me, saying that he often spoke about me.  However, I don’t know if his feelings changed since the time he’d told his family in the summer.
I know that it is impossible to know what was going through his mind, but he was an ISFJ and I was hoping that you ISFJs could help me make light of this situation that has been troubling my mind.
Some questions:
Why do you think he stopped talking?  Was it because of the weight of responsibility, or was it because he no longer cared?
Was he planning to date or was he wanting a marital relationship?
Would he have re-established communications?
Thank you for any insights you may offer."
3578,isfj,"I think he cared, but was trying to move on. Isfjs are often really into marriage, so most likely of he was into you, the thought crossed his mind. He probably wouldn't have restarted conversion because he wouldn't want the conflict
I could be wrong, but dating an isfj for 4-5 years has taught me my specific ones thought process"
3579,isfj,"I'm so tired of worrying about and not being able to let go of things not under my control. There are things that I've said and mistakes that I've made that I can't take back, and even though I've learned from them and should be able to move on since I can't do anything more about it, my mind keeps circulating back towards it. Similarly, there's something I've lost, and I just want to forget that it ever happened, I don't want this to stick in my mind either. I want to be able to move on from what happens. 
Does this happen to anyone else? How do I cope with it? "
3580,isfj,"ISFJ also. Yes, this definitely happens. One thing I have found is that often the best way through a shitty situation is directly through it. It's not easy to accept your mistakes and actually get over them, but I've found that if you just distract yourself they build up. You'll start to reject specific things that may relate to whatever it is that you're trying to get over (eg. If it's a relationship and you had a special song, you may now start to reject that song/band and try to shut it out of your life). 
It's not easy, and there will be many moments of feeling alone and full of regret, but accepting these things and being mindful can help you not make the same mistakes in the future. You're not a slave to your past, and you can still control your future, so don't let that escape your grasp as well. "
3581,isfj,"ENxP here.
You go towards what you look at. Just focus on your future projects. Distract yourself.
I know that well, as not only sensors have to deal with mental inertia. In fact, my mind is made of those loops.
How to break free ? You'll have to imagine and build that life where you're free from that. And build it stone by stone, brick by brick.
I won't lie, I gave up, like most. I chose just to build my life so I'm happy with it, than getting rid of something that so essential to my thinking.
Is it somehow a useful advice to you ?"
3582,isfj,"I'm curious to know if I'm the minority here, because I don't. I believe love is a choice and there is a threshold that certain people will meet to ""qualify"" as someone you can spend your life with. I ask because my boyfriend (INFP) does believe in soulmates, but he also doesn't believe I am that person. This hurts a lot considering my own views on the matter. It feels like he has chosen not to love me...I'm sorry to burden you guys with this. I just need to get it out...I'd really like to know your views on this, if you don't mind :)"
3583,isfj,"I don't believe in soulmates, no.
In my opinion, love is a choice.
That shallow, fleeting feeling of butterflies and fireworks in a relationship doesn't last.
That's not love, that's infatuation.
Love, to me, is choosing to stick by somebody through the thick and thin. To love them regardless of their flaws or drawbacks.
Obviously the initial attraction and chemistry has to be there to begin with.
But once the honeymoon period fades, it's an active choice to love and stay faithful to a person, which for me, honestly isn't challenging at all.
Too many people are expecting to have the fireworks last forever, and as soon as it starts to fade, they think they've fallen out of love.
It's a pretty naïve view on relationships, and a lot of them end unnecessarily because of it."
3584,isfj,"I don't believe in it either, I personally think that believing that there's just one person in the whole world who'd be perfect for you is ridiculous. It sucks that your boyfriend thinks you're not ""the one"", I'm sorry, I hope he changes his mind."
3585,isfj,"Yes, or rather I believe that there is someone in your life who you will meet who is the most compatible with you.
I may already have met her - it didn't work out. Everything since has felt like settling."
3586,isfj,"I believe in soul mates, but I don't think they are what most people believe them to be.
A soul mate (in my opinion) is someone who flows well, seeming perfectly, through mind and body.
That person you meet and instantly feel the chemistry between the two of you.
This indicates that I believe one person can have more than one soul mates in the world.
Love is something that is up to you.. You can choose to love anything and anyone you want, as long as it's in the moral parameters you choose to withhold.
I choose to look at love the way it's described in 2 Corinthians.
Love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.  It is not rude, it is not self seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.
The verses go on.
Now, the honeymoon faze is a real thing XD
Chemical reactions can faze out... But it's up to the both partners to keep it going.
If you are a soul mate, that shouldn't be an issue..  But if you're in a relationship with someone who emotionally isn't fit with you, that'll be a problem.
Get what I'm sayin?"
3587,isfj,"Hi r/ISFJ,
I'd really love to see what you guys think about being honest with ISFJs. 

While I'm also generally curious my main motivation is that I managed to screw things up with an ISFJ girl I really liked last year and I told myself if I cared about her I'd leave her be (which I did). 
Now she's back on the periphery (at work) and is being friendly, which is tough as I've been trying not to show it but I still have a lot of feelings for her. 
Every part of me (ENTP) wants to be up front and tell her how I feel so I'm not hiding my motivations but out of care for her I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable, so I have to ask, is honesty always the best policy? 
Things went to hell before when I realized how much I liked her and got anxious/afraid of being honest for fear of scaring her away and I know how personally she takes dishonesty (as do I). I never expected to see her again and I've worked so hard on improving myself since (partly) out of guilt for that whole situation, so I want to handle things better this time.
Thankyou for reading!"
3588,isfj,"Hey bud,INTP here.
You might have been inavertedly rude with your truth. To us NTPs, truth is the #1 priority but i've come to realise that we often tend to burn people with our truth and then turn around and think ""if they were hurt then they were just weak"". 
Yes truth burns and i understand that it's pretty much our duty to embrace it but no everyone likes the truth. To a lot of people, good/bad is more important than true/false. Either way, i know that i often hurt people i care about because i get irritated by their behaviors and just lay down the truth in their face, like i see it. I don't see why they don't like it, i see the impact it has afterwards.
My current gf is an ISFJ. I can always be honest and tell her the truth UNLESS it is directly linked to one of her bad behavior patterns or an action she is ashamed of. Basically, im always right and she knows it but doesnt want any ""i told you so""."
3589,isfj,"""If you’re in a relationship with an introverted sensor, you need to always make sure that you’re committed to giving them a good experience. Make sure that they’re comfortable at all times. If they’re upsetting you and you need them to change, make them uncomfortable. Do the opposite, obviously.""

3590,isfj,"I have a lovely friend who is an ISFJ. She's there for me when I need someone, and she's not afraid to talk about the dark sides of life. She respects my silence when I'm thinking and contemplating. I feel like she understands me and doesn't at the same time. As someone who longs for a connection, I love having her around because she cares outwardly. I see it when she's nervous. I see it when we talk. I see it when she leans a bit closer than usual when we're working on something together (totally platonic) because that's how she says, ""I feel safe around you"". Also, I just realized that I need more friends who are girls (I'm a dude). Anyway, you guys are great."
3591,isfj,"I've been good friends with an INFP for years now, he's great.
I love how emotionally intelligent you guys are, and he's really the best person I could go to when I'm feeling down, or I need some advice. He's very thoughtful and wise, and he makes me laugh like crazy. We just have a special sort of bond where we can be totally ourselves around each other, and there's no judgment.
INFPs are pretty great friends for ISFJs, once we can get past the surface differences between us, I think. :)"
3592,isfj,"ISFJ Free Insights - From  My Personality Test 
​
ISFJ Strengths
ISFJs are naturally practical, dependable, and flexible. When interacting with others, they are warm, kind-hearted, and generous. They enjoy nothing more than spending time with friends and family. They are accepting of others, but often hold grudges against those who have wronged them in the past.
Although it may take a while to get to know an ISFJ, they make excellent confidants. They always are there for others, offering a shoulder to cry on after a bad day. They have the ability to develop strong bonds with others very quickly. They also have the ability to connect with animals and children easily.
ISFJs are very practical and observant. They are more concerned with the real-world impact of things, rather than big, complex theories and ideas. They prefer to rely on information they can observe, rather than intuitive feelings.
ISFJs are very responsible. They hold their values very strongly, and are willing to put in the time needed to make the world a better place. Oftentimes, their values are based on traditions, rather than lofty ideals.
ISFJs live in a world of possibilities. They love trying new things, and have developed very refined tastes. They appreciate things that are aesthetically pleasing, and take pride in decorating and organizing their home.
​
ISFJ Weaknesses
ISFJs often seek out the opinions of others, but may have a hard time accepting criticism. They may become reliant on others’ approval to validate their self-worth. Others may view ISFJs as overly-sensitive and emotional.
ISFJs enjoy helping others, but for some ISFJs, this may translate into trying to change others. ISFJs must always remind themselves they can’t help everyone — they can only help people who want their help. This tendency may become particularly troublesome for ISFJs’ romantic relationships. They may initially enter into a romantic relationship wanting to help someone change, but may become frustrated when their romantic partner can’t change.
ISFJs strongly held values, coupled with their responsible nature, gives them the drive to work hard and meet their obligations. However, ISFJs must always be aware of what the driving force is behind these obligations. Oftentimes, ISFJs can feel obligation from social expectations, rather than an internal desire to change the world. They must not fall into a routine of helping others at a cost to themselves and their own wellbeing.
ISFJs’ strong desire to “belong” means they may be overly concerned about their social status. They may become preoccupied with how others’ see them, and this can potentially be damaging to their self-esteem and character. It is critical that ISFJs take time to think about their own needs and desires, rather than the needs and desires others have for them.
​
ISFJ Parenthood
ISFJs recognize the responsibility that comes with being a parent, and rise to the challenge. Their responsible nature makes them excellent parents who are willing to do whatever it takes to take care of their child. They respond quickly to their children’s needs, and love the feeling they get every time they help their children. ISFJs are always their children’s biggest cheerleader and advocate. Their children always know they can go to their ISFJ parent for help and advice.
ISFJs are great at setting boundaries for their children and enforcing the rules. Sometimes, however, ISFJs can become authoritarian parents. They can be somewhat controlling, but only because they want what is best for their children. ISFJs must remind themselves that making mistakes is just part of growing up, helping their children learn and grow.
​
ISFJ Romantic Relationships
ISFJs’ dependable nature makes them excellent romantic partners. They may take a while to open up, but once they do, they are eternally loyal, trustworthy, and loving. They are not just looking for a casual fling — they want to find a long-term, committed relationship.
ISFJs are willing to give a great deal of time and energy to their romantic relationships, but their relationship will not thrive unless they receive the same amount in return. This is especially true of receiving affirmation from their partners. In fact, ISFJs often seek affirmation from their romantic partners, as well as their friends and family. They often become preoccupied with what their partner thinks. They will fish for compliments, and can be very sensitive to conflict within the relationship.
​
ISFJ Friendships
ISFJs make very loyal and kind friends, and are always there for a friend in need. ISFJs are always accepting of and willing to help others, even those who have very different personality types than themselves.
Once ISFJs make a friend, they work hard to maintain their friendship. They are always looking for opportunities to spend time with their friends.
​
ISFJ Work Habits
ISFJs are very giving and are willing to help others when needed, and this is apparent in the workplace. ISFJs are great team-players. They enjoy working in groups, and are both flexible and practical when doing so.
People with this personality type have trouble dealing with conflict, and will to go great lengths to avoid conflict. Although they may seek affirmation from others, they are very sensitive to any negative feedback. Oftentimes, ISFJs take negative feedback very personally, and will harbor a grudge about it later on.
​
ISFJ Career Paths
ISFJs are very in-tune with others’ emotions. This, coupled with their dependability and organization, makes them well-suited for careers in leadership or administrative roles. They tend to seek out and enjoy careers where they can directly help others and see the impact they’re making every day. They often are well-suited for careers in child care, management, counseling, administration, health care, public relations, and teaching. ISFJs’ eye for aesthetic beauty, coupled with their organizational skills, also makes them well-suited for careers as photographers or designers.

3593,isfj,"Hi, I know few of you guys yet you guys are one of my favourites.
I find an issue is that my close ISFJ friends don't continue conversations with me, especially if they are too philosophical or heavy. Not implying that they are unintelligent, because they are very intelligent, but rather, I think they find it irrelevant or too touchy.
They enjoy small talk — knowing about my life or the lives of the people around me, even if they don't know them.
Questions I have are:


Do you zone out because those topics are boring to you? 


How do you like someone to carry a conversation?


Why are you reserved even with your most loved one? How can your partner ease you into opening up?


Thank you."
3594,isfj,"Thanks for taking time to write this question! 
I would say that deeper, intellectual conversations are less important rather than boring(it sounds the same doesn't it?). I don't know about other ISFJs, but for me I don't really like it when there's a potential for another side to argue a point. If someone is talking about the creation of the world, I don't want to give my input in fear that it would be opposing their views or potentially causing discord. That basically works against Fe and for that reason I, personally, don't like those intellectual conversations. 
In terms of how I like people to carry conversations, I like to know how their lives are going. I enjoy listening to their ups and downs of the day and then asking questions based on their responses. I also enjoy just listening them talk about their interests and hobbies. I will also ask questions based on their responses. As stated earlier, if their interests consist of those deeper multi-sided topics, I can only do so much before I try to switch topics. 
Opening up is a weird concept. Again, not sure about how other ISFJs view it, but I feel like I need permission to speak. There are many friends that I won't really speak my mind to unless I'm prompted. I feel like if they don't ask, then they're not interested and thus won't acknowledge my opinions on a topic. I know that isn't usually the case, but that's how I feel. The times that I like to open up are when my opinions line up with others' opinions. This assures me that I won't cause any serious discord or unnecessary arguments. One thing I should mention is that I will open up more(without prompting) to those that I have daily connections with. By seeing a person consistently, I feel like they observe me on a daily basis and better understand my ups and downs and it will be easier for me to open up without explaining a lot of backstory(less talking too). So for example if I'm at school, I would open up more to someone that I sat next to because they could ask me how I was doing and what my day was like and I could follow up the next day which then could open up many avenues for conversation. 
There's a lot more I could talk about and this is already pretty lengthy. If you have any more questions feel free to reply or PM me!"
3595,isfj,"I zone out mostly because, like mentioned above, it's not really relevant to me; however, recently I've discovered that if I am interested in the topic I might zone out because I need to really sit, think, and formulate my ideas before continuing the conversation. "
3596,isfj,"I'm on the contrary, I personally like talking philosophy/new ideas (I mean, we can't all be the same person right?). 
For me it's weird, I don't really like small talk, but I naturally do it. It's my fallback conversation with people I don't really know/aren't that close with. In the end, it is basically me asking questions and the other person answering. However I can't sustain such a conversation because on the back of my mind, I feel it would be boring for the other person. I think us ISFJs are the type of people that draw closer to people who cater to our interests, and I personally deem those conversations fulfilling. 
As for your third question, I won't speak my mind because of personal insecurities. In my environment, talking feelings is barely done, if not, none at all, so I fear people around me would view me as that ""feelings"" guy. I reserve them unless I'm prompted to speak, which quite frankly would probably never happen. "
3597,isfj,"You're spot on about us (well at least me) not liking talking about philosophical/heavy topics. I only feel comfortable talking about them with my brother who I am quite close to, and even then, I sometimes shut it down because I don't want to deal with it.
The biggest reason I think is that I just don't want to offend anyone with my opinion. It's too touchy as you said. Also it's just frustrating to talk about philosophical things because there is no RIGHT way that the thing can go. For example if my brother and I are talking about time travel... like something about that frustrates me because there's too many possibilities of how the laws of time travel should/could work.
I RARELY zone out when I'm talking to people. Usually I listen intently and I can bring whatever was talked about up like months later if needed. I just don't always contribute to all conversations. The only time I start to zone out a bit is when my brother talks about tangent universes or string theory... things I just am not too interested in or are too philosophical for me again. I try to understand them but I think it would take me a long time to get it and I don't want to bother my brother by making him explain it in simpler terms, or several different ways.
It's hard to say what will help me open up even with my most loved ones. I have trouble expressing my emotions in words sometimes, so I just don't do it. There are people who I have trusted before, but I have shut out because they seem to not want me to confide in them, or they have done something ""wrong"" in my eyes. Example of this would be my dad who cheated on and left my mom a year ago -- it was inherently wrong what he did. And I can't get into any personal conversations with him now. Well even before that he is my other example of being reserved :P. I have come to him with problems before which might seem minute to other people, but to me it was a big deal, and he offered no help or feedback. If an ISFJ is asking you for help/advice it's taken them a lot to do so! At least for me, I hate asking for help.
To add onto that, this might be because of the way my parents conditioned me, but I feel like I don't want to open up around other people because it will burden them. This might partially be the whole ""you're making me feel bad because you feel bad"" attitude my parents had toward my anxiety, which basically made me just shut up and bottle my emotions up. And if I can't open up with my immediate family... I can't do it with anyone else. (Unless it's anonymous online lol).
So I guess the best way to get an ISFJ to open up to you is to establish a lot of trust with them and show that you are not judging them for anything they say. You can always get on my good side too if you bring up something I had said in a previous conversation and ask how it is going. Sort of like showing you care in whatever way possible. You gotta make ISFJ's feel appreciated :D and then they will give you the world if they can.
I'd say try starting small with the whole trust thing like... ask what their favorite food is or something. Even little things like that for me I get iffy about whether I should really tell people or not. Because do they even care? Or do they care so much that it will anger them if I say the wrong thing?
That's just a bit of my thought process. I'm not sure if it goes for all ISFJ's. Maybe it is in line with the extremely anxious ones though lol
Edit: I know this long but I thought of one more thing! A lot of the times when I open up, I will do it jokingly just to test the waters. If the person agrees or takes the ""joke"" seriously I know it's okay to talk about with them. For example I will sometimes make really dark jokes like about my dad leaving or my dog dying... I have an ISFP friend who doesn't even acknowledge these, an ISTP friend who laughs at these and will bring the topics up later (which I like because it shows they listened), and an INTP friend who will take it more seriously and be like ""that's really sad/horrible"". I've opened up to the INTP friend the most about deeply personal stuff. Again, maybe that's just me though!"
3598,isfj,"""The times that I like to open up are when my opinions line up with others' opinions""
Agreed! 
As an ISFJ, I also find myself opening up in different manners when it comes to who I am speaking with. If I still find myself caught up on making a good impression on someone, I will, like you said, only voice my opinion if it is in agreement. 
However, if it is someone I see more frequently, like my peers from my classes, I am less likely to be careful with what I say as they have seen me go through cycles with my moods and such. It's interesting how different parts of my personality become more prominent depending on who I am speaking with. "
3599,isfj,"Hmm, well, for me, with my really close friends, I don't find myself stressing frequent communication. If anything, I find constant texting and such to be a hinderance to the relationship; I begin to pick up on subtle differences (ie. longer time to respond, brief texts, etc) and take them to heart to easily, meaning I somehow find a way to blame myself for those changes and convince myself that they will negatively affect our relationship, regardless if they do or not. 
When I don't stress frequent communication, I get less wrapped up in my thoughts and am able to simply enjoy our time together when I get the chance to see said person. That being said, I wouldn't completely drop my friends during periods of time I won't see them, a casual Snapchat or something suffices. It also means a lot to me when the other person is the one reaching out to me, as sometimes it's hard getting myself to reach out. Hope this helps!"
3600,isfj,"Someone asked me to take this test (animalinyou.com) and I did. It's pretty short and easy. I was surprised by how well I thought the result fit me (given that this is a kind of silly test...) Just wondering if anyone else has taken the test and what your result was, and if you think it's at least vaguely accurate.
I got ""mountain goat"" and I admit, I think it fit me well other than the watching soap operas part. But I do feel as tho I do things to try to understand others better.

""Mountain goat personalities are very much loners. Observing the goings-on from their unique perch, they are consummate voyeurs and when mingling with other terrestrial animal personalities they feel uncomfortable and vulnerable. After brief forays into their world, they must return to their place of security.""
""Mountain goats are not risk takers and need to feel solid ground beneath their feet before making any major decision.""

edit: I also just took the test again (changed one answer) and got ""Mouse"" as the answer, and I think that could also be a pretty fitting ISFJ answer."
3601,isfj,"A lot of my friends are ENFPs, so this is based solely on my experience with them. 
They seem to get bored easily and move on to other people to entertain them. When I was not working full time we would always hang out, but now that I work full time and have a pretty busy life, they have moved on to other people who can fulfill their social needs. They always come to me for advice, but usually wouldn't listen to the advice I would give, and when I wanted to talk about myself I could tell they were not listening. So it was a bit frustrating at times. 
On a positive note, they are extremely easy to get to know and I have a lot of fun with them. Within the first day of meeting them, we were already fast friends. I really appreciated that I didn't have to work hard at forming a friendship with them. They are very nice people and could make friends with any one. "
3602,isfj,"My ISFJ friend is dating an ENFP and they are great together. A wonderful, precarious balance. I think her biggest frustration is the fact that his plans are rarely plans more like... ideas or guidelines. This is a typical conversation.
""When will you be coming over tonight?""
""Sometime after 8pm.""
""So, like 8:30? Or 10?""
""Dunno.""
This frustrates her, but it also helps her relinquish her tight hold on strict plans. She is the type who would plan every step for the next week (month/year/decade) while he is the type to go with the flow. They balance well."
3603,isfj,"I am not a casual dater and I have recently lost a very important relationship to me that I thought would last a lifetime. Please feel free to send me your advice on dealing with yourself post-breakup.
How long does it take to feel ""okay"" again? "
3604,isfj,"I read your posts and your ex displays signs of a personality disorder. Borderline/ narcissist. At the very least, he is a controlling, manipulative, and abusive person.
I am sorry that you are hurting, but I want to encourage you and tell you that you are FREE. Life only goes up from here!
I suggest you check out /r/exnocontact and /r/bpdlovedones to see if anything resonates with you. He might or might not have a disorder, but many people on these two subs have had to walk out from abusive relationships. It is a good place to commiserate and find ways to move on.
My advice? Find yourself again. Do not lose your personal identity. Spend time with yourself, find out what your boundaries are. Surround yourself with people who actually respect you and treat you well. Once you find yourself walking on eggshells and playing the push-pull, walk away.
You are lucky he left you, and left you fast. I know this is not what you want to hear, but you deserve better. You do."
3605,isfj,"Please feel free to send me your advice on dealing with yourself post-breakup

Turn the page, move on, destroy/remove everything you own from your ex partner, at least that how I did before. I have difficulties living in the past because usually the past sucks.
You have to go forward.
How long does it take to feel ""okay"" again?

Probably never entirely, but if you follow my advice above, usually it's quite fast.
Some of my exes think I'm heartless for forgetting all about it ""so quickly"" but it's what's most effective for me."
3606,isfj,"Tomorrow will be 8 months no contact for me. I feel much better at 7 months mark. I keep repeating to myself that he doesn't feel the same way that I do. It takes two to tango. No matter how strong I feel, if the other person doesn't feel the same way, then it will not work. Even though I think the relationship will work through growth, compromise, and miraculous things we can do in my perfect mind, in reality he chose to end it and I have to accept his decision. Make a list of why the relationship didn't work and what you don't like about the relationship. Keep the list and when you want to contact him, read it. I still miss my ex, but the pain and sadness are finite and last only a while.  "
3607,isfj,"In my experience, it goes in phases. It takes me a couple days to be ""fine,"" but then overall several months to be ""okay,"" probably up to a year to be ""good."" I am good at dealing with things right away, getting back into hanging out with friends, going to work, distracting myself. However, there tends to be a pendulum that swings me back from okayness to sadness for a while. Just keep on doing what you do and try to remember that you are strong enough to get through it."
3608,isfj,"I'm still dealing with the lingering effects of a somewhat traumatic friend-breakup that was similar in the sense that I really did think we would be together forever, but I guess I can tell you what I now think I should have done? 
Basically, I think I should have let myself grieve more. It's something I'm very bad at doing, as I hate crying, feeling irrational, feeling like I'm bothering others, etc. I never really let myself feel sad about it after that first night, but I definitely should have instead of forcing myself straight through to anger. I felt like I needed the anger to propel myself away from the relationship and keep myself from wallowing or giving into the urge to reach out, and in that regard it definitely worked! But even two years later I haven't been able to fully let go of my feelings and free myself from the trauma of the relationship ending so suddenly and horribly. I think if I had given myself more than one night to cry and wonder and regret, maybe I would be more fully over it by now. Or maybe not, it's hard to say. 
So I guess my advice would be, definitely don't try to get back in contact, avoid checking on their social media (that's a great way to make yourself feel like shit), but do take as much time as you need to mourn. Try not to let it consume you, keep your day-to-day life moving as much as possible, but reach out to people in your life who you feel like you can confide in and don't be afraid to talk about it with them. And remember that this breakup, as much as it may hurt, can be a form of self-care. You can take this as an opportunity to make sure you're giving yourself back the love you were putting into the relationship, and to appreciate the love you get from your friends/family/etc. 
Anyway, I'm really sorry you're going through this and I hope you're okay soon 💕"
3609,isfj,"ISFJ Male. Hey, yeah... I don't know of anything that sucks more for our type. I'll try to weed out the practices that adversely affected me and only give you the helpful ones. You can PM me if you want to hear the bad ones to avoid.
Feeling ""okay"" again? It's been different for me, once it took about 6 months, a couple other times it took over 5 years. I know... probably not what you want to go through.

Give yourself time to grieve. Not just after the event, regularly. If you need to be alone, cut everything off and take the time to process for a while. Even if you don't make progress, at least you are letting go of pressure that would otherwise build until released on someone.
Talk with friends about all the feels and that person. This exercises your Fe in a healthy way and gives a outlet to the inevitable stress these other practices are going to incur.
Take the painful step of destroying everything that you have kept of that person. I know, I KNOW that isn't what you want to do. DO THE THING. Texts, photos, letters, connected objects... everything you can.
Disassociate memories. Yeah, this one is even harder. Sometimes all I want to do is remember how someone loved me in a particular way and just stay there for a few minutes (ends up being more than a few). Do your best to remember that is gone now and something similar might be found in another living person. Possibly something better... believe me, that is possible. I found it when I didn't think it existed.

Pray. Seriously, prayer and meditation can do WONDERS.


This last one is something new I am trying and I'm not sure the data is conclusive yet: Activating shadow functions during pain. We use Si-Fe-Ti-Ne right? Activating Se and Te seem to help me somewhat, at least temporarily. Se as in blaring favorite music, cooking a NICE meal, having a scotch or glass of wine (never more than 1, it's NOT healthy to do more when in pain... if you don't have the discipline for this yet, just skip that one), or going shooting/martial arts. Te activity in anything that forces me to think rapidly and not over think any particular aspect. Debating a topic, reading a book without pausing to consider like normal, and some types of video game. Keep in mind these kinds of activities will drain you... for the moment, they seem to help when used as a ""bandaid"" to keep me functioning normally. If you notice self destructive behavior, cut that off like a cancer.


Hope I could help, sorry for your pain dear."
3610,isfj,"I cannot keep myself from thinking that if I tried more, or compromised more, or was better at this or that that I would be able to make the relationship work. He chose to end it also and he will often text me to criticize me. 
I thank you for your comment and thoughtfulness."
3611,isfj,"Thank you, thank you, thank you. I have cried nearly every day since he left, but it is often in my car or as I lie down to sleep. I have mourned him and everything I lost in losing him but it doesnt seem to relent. Every day it is painful. He often contacts me, and I have contacted him, but as soon as I end contact with him, he will text me. Usually it is criticism for something I have done. I haven't even brought myself to delete our pictures yet. I am working up the courage, it just seems so final and I dont want it to be."
3612,isfj,"I gave 200% to my ex. Crossed lines I wouldn't cross before and he still left me, claiming we were incompatible. But you know, I read stories of other people's relationships and some of them also break up even though they are compatible. People, who wants to be in our lives, will stay and they will not leave us. "
3613,isfj,"No problem, any way I can keep someone from going through what I've been through is worth the effort. Not everyone has close friends to lean on during these kinds of situations, and if you don't have alternative tools the pain can cycle for a long time. Hope you are better today :)"
3614,isfj,"I read your posts about your relationship and pretty sure you are in a similar (or were) situation as myself. I get constantly yelled at and told I am the problem in our relationship. I am ISFJ and I know for a fact I have done everything in my power ... in my entire being ... to help my partner not be so abusive. He's either highly manic trying to do too many things for me, tell me what to wear, where to go, sign me up for lessons in something I once mentioned years ago, leaves the cheese out all night, constantly splitting, everything is a trigger for his anger. This is an ISFJs worst nightmare. If I can find the opportunity/window to escape one night I will wait for it. Do not ever go back to your BF you will always regret it. Never changes."

3616,isfj,"Extroverted Feeling (Fe) can be a chore, for me, as I run one million miles out of the way to accommodate someone. 
I over emphasize with people when we're face to face to the point where I love them completely all faults included, only to step away and realize again they are still terrible.
That paradox makes me feel two-faced.
I'll listen to a conversation and empathize so intently, never thinking of what it is that I want to say back, never having my own agenda in mind, seeking only to understand completely, that when it's expected for me to reply I have nothing to say.
My strengths; super empathy, kindness and low self orientation seem to be perceived as a disadvantage and weakness in this world.
Anyone relate? Anything about Fe you enjoy instead?"
3617,isfj,"Having Fe third, I can understand but not totally relate. (PS: However I had a lot to say apparently)
It's likely you (ISFJ, followed by INFJ and maybe ExFJ) are the most prone to being unable to say no, and finding yourself doing things you would rather not agree to. To add to that natural propensity, people are probably more prone to turn to when they want something than any other type, because you always appear to be up for it (best case scenario), or because you're easy to abuse (worst case scenario).
Ultimately, you will need to force yourself to say no. Realise that you are going above and beyond what is generally expected. Realise some of the people that you do stuff for are using you (whether voluntarily or not). I always ask myself ""would they do it for me?"". Then I usually end up doing more for people than they'd do for me, but it's easier to accept not going out of your way for them, or not going the extra mile. For starters, if you can't say no, at least stop offering help to those people.
Go and see about setting boundaries in r/INFJ, the subject comes up fairly often and they might have better insight than me.
Listening without thinking of what you'll answer is often suggested as a way of creating actual conversations. The silence once they stop talking and you are poundering and maybe coming up with something else is not ackward if you accept it. Just don't feel rushed to say something, let it be there, it's fine I swear. People can see you actually thinking about what they said, and they mostly like it. At worst it will push people to expand more. 
Having learned/discovered/developed Fe later I love it. Ti can tell if an idea is logically consistent, but there's no measure of how valuable/important/meaningful something is outside of F functions. 
I guess it can be overwhelming to have that scale be so strong and based on other people. I guess you need to learn to also take care of yourself. 
Again, something I've seen recommended multiple times in INFJ and that probably applies: journalling, talking to yourself in the mirror or even video journalling. They help apply that Fe to yourself and focus on taking care of yourself (eg you know you could see it and advise against it if another ISFJ was going to far to help others, way clear than you see it when you do. The same will happen when actually looking at yourself, apparently)"
3618,isfj,"I’ve been struggling with this same thing recently!!!! 
I do enjoy sharing in others happiness!! (Who doesn’t!)
-either nothing to say or what I suggest (which makes sense to me) doesn’t apply to them "
3619,isfj,"i relate to kindness such as when there are visitors, i would invite them to eat with our family. Other than that, when someone needs help in their final output i would send right away my copy. I can also read other peoples emotions too. 
For the weaknesses, well, passive aggressiveness and i choose my battles well to avoid burden and burn out. Im picky especially when meeting new people and i find it hard to trust someone . Even though im already close to that person, i wont say much about my business. Sure i can open up but in bits and pieces only. Usually i end being a listener. I can be judgemental and yet at the same time be open to new ideas
low self orientation is very true to me lool but thats because, for me, ive learned to get used to it. It just sucks to have low self esteem."
3620,isfj,"I've been trying to provide support for her since her sister was murdered. My mother doesn't think that she has much going for her, because she is divorced, she doesn't have a job and her last abusive boyfriend just committed suicide. She can't catch a break and unfortunately I'm running out of positive things to say to her to motivate her.
What would you want to hear? What can I say/do to help an ISFJ in need?"
3621,isfj,"OP, your mother needs to see a therapist.  Unless you have some sort of graduate degree in psychology, you are not equipped to help someone who is suicidal.  You can be there for her, love her, try to get her up and out of the house, but she desperately needs professional help.
I commend you for being your mother's support, but helping a suicidal person is a massive undertaking if you are not professionally trained to handle situations like these."
3622,isfj,"You can definitely provide support for her but I feel like she's been through a lot of traumatizing things that may be better discussed in therapy. Might be good to try and suggest therapy of some sort, just talking to a professional might help. It's hard to say what I wanted to hear when things were really bad for me, I didn't exactly want to hear that it was going to get better but I did want to know that I was loved and cared about. What does she enjoy doing? Find time to be with her and do something you both enjoy perhaps, just letting her know that she's not alone can be a real help."
3623,isfj,"ENTP here. We usually make decent therapists. Speaking of, your mom needs to see one stat. You may need to call a hospital and put her on a 72 hour suicide watch/psych hold. Her sister was murdered. That was an awful, horrific thing that happened to her and no one is trying to lessen the pain or diminish it or ask her to move on before she's ready, but if she does this, that murderer and that awful man who terrorized her for years? They'll win. Not having a man in her life doesn't make her life meaningless. She has children, she has a vast existence in front of her. She can do anything. I think you guys should pack up and move and restart somewhere else. Get away from the awful memories of that place, at least for a while. I'm not saying never come back, but maybe give yourselves a few years away from that place to heal. Taking yourself out of the equation through death doesn't stop the source of the pain, it just ensures that what caused it will take the one last thing it has to take from you: closure. Cutting it off doesn't improve upon your life. The only way to be at peace with yourself is to work through it. Her sister would want that. I know when I was going through a really awful time The Perks of Being A Wallflower helped me. Antidepressants helped my brother. We accept the love we think we deserve. Just try to remind her she deserves so much better and do what you can to help. “At times the world may seem an unfriendly and sinister place, but believe that there is much more good in it than bad. All you have to do is look hard enough. and what might seem to be a series of unfortunate events may in fact be the first steps of a journey.” -Lemony Snickett."
3624,isfj,I can't help but feel upvotes are inadequate for confirming this advice so I'm commenting to lend my agreement. As someone who previously dealt with these same issues I am endlessly grateful for the support my therapist provided me in my time of need.
3625,isfj,"I make sure everyone is taken care of. I can be extremely sad or worried about something but if a family member/friend is not dealing with the same problem well, I’ll hide my emotions so I can help the other person deal with it.
I have changed a lot over time. I used to be very emotional about things and life has taught me to be a bit tougher. I tend to hold the tears until I am on my own."
3626,isfj,My grandmother was ill recently and my parents and I took time off to take care of her. This is probably something that I would assume goes without saying for people in a similar situation but it was just natural for me to take on more responsibility around the house and at the hospital (translating for my family). My parents eventually had to return to work so I ended up skipping a lot of my classes and fell behind. Overall I was as calm as ever when I was taking care of my grandmother but got stressed when my grades started to drop. I don't know what that says about me; was I more worried about school than my family?
3627,isfj,"The way I deal with crises can be very hit and miss, sometimes I can be very focused on the issue at hand, or I can end up letting the negative emotions take over my mind and quickly become very stressed. And unfortunately I can have a tendency to become a bit controlling during these situations."
3628,isfj,Paralyzed by fear for a while. Coaxing self to set aside emotions and “act” because someone else needs me to be logical and supportive right now. Will try to maintain a strong facade while suffering deep inside. Eventually will recover but emotions swept under the rug will resurface and wreak havoc internally from time to time.
3629,isfj,"I've been in ""crisis situations"" because of several familial/health-related issues. If is someone I love who is in need of help, I will do whatever is in my hands, take responsability and, as others have said, it's almost an autopilot thing. I put my needs in second place. However, when I'm alone at home, I can start overthinking the situation and see it from a catastrophic point of view, breaking apart. I deal with my meltdowns in private, I don't like to worry people who surround and appreciate me (just my poor SO who lives with me). If I'm on a personal crisis, the management is very different and not as efficient, there is when I need ""external"" help because I'm not able to clearly see the way out."
3630,isfj,"I am excellent in a crisis. Assuming it’s not my crisis haha
I am level headed, calm and collected. I am great at sensing the needs of others and responding to them appropriately and quickly. 
I also work in a medical profession so am great at that sort of crisis too"
3631,isfj,"For me it depended on who died. 
When my dad died I hid. I stayed in my grandparents guest room until the paramedics took Dad away. And I still have hard days 4.5 years later
With my grandpa I was pregnant and couldn't travel at the time so grief was different and drawnout. 
My grandma on my other side of the family recently passed and it hits me harder with each death. But I just stay busy and focus on the Lord as much as possible."
3632,isfj,"This. I recently had to take a friend to the hospital for a psychosis. I'm glad that I knew what to do in a crisis but I had some trouble at work the next few days due to the stress. I ended up confiding in some other coworkers I trust, and calling the EAP my work offers, and eventually I was able to get my own emotions in check too."
3633,isfj,in a crisis i tend to hit your latter option. I usually end up overreacting and being so sick with worry i can’t actually focus on anything except that thing. I become a bit controlling as well. Just trying to do everything I can to make something work that’ll help. 
3634,isfj,"The original reason i made this thread is because my cat was screeching in pain and meowing like he needed help... And in my current situation i felt helpless since i couldnt drive him anywhere both because i dont have a car and license.  It worried me sick and made me curious what others do in a crisis. 
Also, bad news is he didnt live much longer after that. I still grieve for him and miss him dearly. He was the best friend i ever had. "
3635,isfj,"January last year I met my current girlfriend who I plan on proposing to toward the end of this year.
In June my father passed away. I had to take over his company and take on a huge work load to keep the company alive and ensure the survival of our income and the continued employment of my 20 employees. I moved in with my mom to look after her. 
My sister and my brother in law (who pitched 4.5-5 hours of work a day 5 days a week after my dad died, who have helped with the company years ago but for the past few years have been getting paid to stay home while not actually doing any work) demanded 25% of the company along with the ability to work less and from home or they'll cut me and my mother out of their lives. They say that me and my mother are emotionally abusive to them and that in order to make up for that, and to show that we respect them and their boundaries, we have to give them 25% ownership of the company. Which I find doesn't make sense because that won't solve what they're saying it will solve. It sounds like they're being manipulative of me and my mother while we're grieving. Anyways, they made the ultimatum and when my mom decided that we can't please them, they cut us out. But they still live in a house that my mom owns and pays their utilities for, she also loaned them 60K for my brother in law to but his dad's condo in order to rent out for money on the side.
I'm not allowed in that house anymore. It was where I lived together with my cousin and a close friend before my dad died. I left to live with my mom and they moved in. I've been taking care of my cousin for a year before then, and now have to text her and meet up with her to see if she's ok. My friend that lives there was kicked out of his prior home. He's going through a divorce and I've been helping him with his depression. Now he's there, depressed, and I know he relied on me a lot but I can't help him since i'm going through so much and also I'm not allowed over there anymore.
I now live far from my friends and support and therapist, I no longer have the freedom or time to work out regularly, I had to quit my boxing classes, and I loss a lot of weight immediately after my dad died only to gain it all back plus some through stress eating. I've lost a lot of my strength and muscles I've spent so long trying to build.
I've been able to reduce my work hours from the first month of 98 a week to about 50 a week. I'm juggling engineering work with sales and inventory management and purchasing and production management and IT. And i'm still trying to find ways to reducing it so I can get back to my healthier life style from before. It's getting there. Slowly. And I just have to hang on. And also get married because I'm in love. I think I just wanted to vent and maybe have a moment of self pity, shared the with other ISFJs."
3636,isfj,"((hugs)) I am so sorry for your loss and congratulations on your impending nuptials. 
Who legally owns the business? Was the 60K loan documented, did your mom make them sign for it etc? ISFJ's get taken advantage of due to their kind natures.
I think you & your mom will have less stress in your lives if you cut your sister off, evict them from the house and rent it out for extra income, and demand payment installments for their loan. You both are enabling their poor behavior. They'll never learn humility & hard work if you and your mother baby them. Trust me, they will come around after awhile - they might cut you out of their lives for a few months but quickly come to realize that you guys are the only family that has their back❤️"
3637,isfj,"I agree with cutting them out. But my mom wants my sister back in her life.  But she's  grieving my dad still. I'm trying to get my mom to let go of my dad and let go of my sister to let my sister and brother in law live their life on their own away from us. i think we'll all be happier that way. They have my brother in law's family. And I don't think I can trust someone anymore after they do something like this. I can't let someone like that back into my life. ""give me money or i'll leave you. and if you choose money, that's your choice and your fault for putting money above me"". that basically what my sister said to my mom a few months after my dad died.
Right now, me and my mom own the business. The loan was just a loan between family, there is no documentation or anything. I don't think we'll get it back and i doubt my mom cares if she gets it back or not.
But on the day my sister cut us out, she made my mom sign something having to do with them living in that house. We don't know what it is, she didn't give a copy to my mom, and my mom was too distressed to read it. She just...signed it. My mom only understood that it's supposed to be something that lasts a year regarding them living in that house. This was back in october, so we can get a lawyer to deal with this. but again, my mom doesn't want to do anything like that. so we have to wait until october to kick them out.
also, thank you, I'm very happy with my girlfriend. she's been with me through all of these difficulties and seems to only love me more."
3638,isfj,"I'm not inclined to strike up conversations with strangers. When I am, with a cute girl for instance, I don't know how to. If I somehow do, I quickly run out of things to talk about. An awkward silence is always inevitable, and typically lasts until it kills the conversation. Also, to make matters worst, I generally don't like talking about myself and find it hard to open up. Is this a problem from anyone else, and even if not does anyone have any advice for me?"
3639,isfj,"Social interaction is a thing you can learn (to improve). Mainly by doing it more often. The reason you are not inclined to do it is because you feel discomfort while doing it. And that motivates you to not do it. Which keeps your inexperienced. Which keeps you feeling discomfort whenever you are forced into a situation where you have to socialise.
In order for that discomfort to go away, you will have to do it more often. You'll have to push through that barrier of discomfort and get more experienced. The more experienced you are, the more comfortable you will feel doing it. Talking to strangers in public may be a bit weird, but there is no harm in talking to people you meet online. I occasionally come across people on diablo 3 (ps3) who also happen to have a headset. End up rambling for hours on end while farming rifts or bounties."
3640,isfj,"This is a big problem for me also. To make it worse, I find that I'm extremely picky about the people I am interested in enough to want to talk to. But then I often don't know what to say or how to convey that I want to get to know them.
Anyways, like Yhhdrazzil said, talking online can sometimes be easier and that's where I've had the most luck feeling comfortable enough to talk."
3641,isfj,"Hello lovely people!
So my mom is an ISFJ and all her life she’s sacrificed herself for me and my sister. Nonetheless, she’s had a great career, she makes a fantastic doctor, she’s among the best in our country in her niche because of her amazing work ethics.
The years of my adolescence were very tough (I am 22 now and I’m mostly past my issues, but I was suicidal twice, I went through depression, self harm, EDs, it was a whole mess) and they definitely left a scar in mom.
She struggles with depression, but she tends to overwork herself and suppress her feelings instead of taking the time to find more healthy coping mechanisms. I think she would greatly benefit from therapy and she even found a therapist she would trust (the one I went to when I was struggling with EDs and my mom became friends).
I would like her to take a bit of time for her mental health now that my sister and I are both adults, but she is very reluctant to the idea, and I think that’s because of fear rather than lack of time or energy.
Is there anything I can say to her to convince her?"
3642,isfj,"I just started therapy a couple months ago (1x/week), and it’s been really great for me. The biggest reason I did it is because I saw how some of my issues were affecting my boyfriend and family. Going was largely for them and to make sure I could be a better person, but now I do it for both them and myself because I see how helpful it is if that makes sense. So maybe voice if you feel her depression is affecting you or those around her, and I think her Fe will want to make a change, for the greater good if not for herself. But as niklii said, definitely start with how much you love and appreciate her. "
3643,isfj,"It’s great that you are concerned about your mom. Just tell her that you and the family want what’s best for her and that you love her. Also, mention the effect it’s having on the people around her that will appeal to her Fe. Tell her the benefits therapy could bring her in her life and how it could help her have a better work-life balance. "
3644,isfj,"Just remind her how wonderful she has been to take care of you and your sister. Now it’s your turn to help her take care of herself. If you were depressed, wouldn’t she want you to see a professional too?"
3645,isfj,"So I'm 22, and I know I'm quite young, but I've only been in two serious relationships (10 months and 6 months). The first ended because he wasn't making an effort, the second ended because it was long distance and we both have anxiety that was kind of feeding off of the other and making it worse. I'm still friendly with both.
Anyways, that out of the way, a lot of my friends are in relationships, living together, some have kids, etc and idk, it seems nice but I'm finding it really hard to find someone, if that makes sense. I have a steady job and a car and my own place and a cat, and somehow it's really tough to find a partner who's on my level... if that makes sense? I just want to date someone who's equally as responsible and has the same ability of transportation so that I'm not always driving.
I dunno, I guess I just want to hear other ISFJ's experiences about this."
3646,isfj,"I've been single for about 5 years now. I've had many dates and short relationships (2-3 dates) over the years and I've just not found someone that I want to really invest in and have a long term relationship. My friends say I'm very picky but I just feel like I've been unlucky in not finding someone that is on the same wavelength. 
For reference I've had relationship in my early 20s that lasted 3 years. I'm pretty straight with women and move on if there is no chemistry after 2-3 dates. I'm only interested in long term so I don't want to mess around and waste time like some people do. "
3647,isfj,"I'm a ISFJ 22(F) been with my man for 2.5 years. I had avoided dating for a very long time because I I found it far too difficult to find someone who I was compatible with yet attracted to at the same time.  
I have always wanted a long term relationship, no games. I wanted to build my life with someone. Get a home, get married, have kids and live happy ever after. That's the goal. 
After a couple weeks of chatting online I thought he wasn't into me at all but then he asked me on a date. We met up in the city under the clock tower and the SECOND I laid eyes on him I KNEW without a doubt that he was special.  I had butterflies; nerves and excitement fill my body and that had never happened before. Still happens every day I see him to this day. 
Any who, two and a half years later and we are both still very smitten and planning our future together.  We share the same end goals, views and values and that helps alot. His a similar personality type so I think that helps too. We both hate parties, are quiet introverts, etc
They say opposites attract but I can't see myself being with a extrovert. They wouldn't understand our need for quiet time or that we don't want to go out all the time. It's okay to sit in silence and just enjoy each others company.  Extroverts wouldn't understand that. 
Never ever give up on finding love. It can and will happen for all of us. It'll most likely happen when you least expect it :)"
3648,isfj,"Yes, and I don’t regret a thing.  When I was in my 20’s, I had had one serious relationship.  Now in my early 40’s, I’ve had a total of two serious relationships and several not so serious ones.  (I don’t like wasting my time being with someone I know I don’t have a future with.) My second serious relationship is a keeper and we’ve been married about 18 months.  Like you, I wondered if I’d ever find someone or if my standards were too high.  Keep looking for the qualities you want in a person.  Eventually, you’ll find them and it’s okay if it takes time. "
3649,isfj,"I've been with my husband for 10 years now, we met at 22.
Personality wise we're a bit different but in ways that complement each other and we still love spending time with one another. We're also on the same page about the ""big stuff"" (kids, faithfulness, life goals, money etc).
We'd both been single for a little bit before we met. I'd kind of given up tbh but I'm glad we found each other."
3650,isfj,"I've been dating my boyfriend for almost six years. We were friends first and then it grew into something more. He's also an introvert, so we are okay doing our own thing in the same room but not speaking to each other. Before that, I had dated guys that were either immature, selfish or I felt like I couldn't trust them. "
3651,isfj,"Long term relationships are hard to find. They're of course what I'm looking for. But what I want in a relationship keeps updating as I date more. Every girl I dated before my current one was short lived. I'm now in my first long term relationship.
I was 23 when I sought after the first girl. I liked her based on things that i realize initially creates attraction for me: fun, shared interests, and she was actively interested in what she works on. Then after that didn't work out I realized that stuff was nice but I much more needed responsibility in a partner or I'd go through a repeat of what happened (she very openly used me yet without fully understanding she was at the time). 
2nd girlfriend was more responsible but also had shared interests, was fun, and actively interested in her work. And after the 2nd girlfriend I realized that I also really strongly needed someone who can share openly what they think and feel or we'd grow distant. I still consider her a friend but I can't date someone who doesn't tell me what's going on and also needs to act strong all the time, especially when they're falling apart. 
3rd girlfriend fit all those criteria. And after the 3rd girlfriend I realize I also needed someone with more emotional maturity and an openness to listen and understand others. Or we'd argue all the time.
Each girl I dated I wholeheartedly try to make it work and to make it last. But when things don't work out I try to figure out why. And so I've learned that shared interests are nice but not key. Emotional openness and maturity, a sense of responsibility, and a willingness to listen to understand others are what's most important for me and to build a relationship with me.
Each experience creates a more in depth understanding of what would create a longer relationship with me as I keep growing and changing. To help me find someone who I feel like we can start growing in sync with one another. And I think I found the person at the moment. But only time can tell.
Also I just read this comic this morning and it's related:
https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/the-talk"
3652,isfj,"At your age it is more about the age than the MTBI type honestly, you're going to want to find a single dad or a nice older gentleman because none of the men your age are going to have their shit together like you do unless they're a very type A personality - in my experience. So rather than end up a stepmother or something, I would just keep keeping yourself awesome and moving forward and keep room in your life for someone but build the life that doesn't require them.
I am 28 single and I think I always will be as my last boyfriend, who I thought I would be with forever, had a drug induced psychosis that just... never went away? He is not who I knew and he is paranoid and mean always and hallucinating, etc. So now I don't trust that anyone I meet now isn't just going to flip a switch like that if the partner I knew for 5 years could. Which is a huge struggle because I care deeply for people and get attached very strongly and don't want to be alone the rest of my life. But I also never want to go through that again either. :/ "
3653,isfj,"i'll be 35 and i've been single for like uhm14 years? Since then i couldn't find someone.Had a couple of tries just always wanted me as a friend,probably because i'm having social anxiety and i'm too introverted.
Most of the girls i liked or tried to date i already knew homehow (ex-classmates,friends' friend,living in a same town, etc.),but most of them settled in or moved so i'm pretty out of options because trying to date with a person i never knew/talked before (like tinder or someone i never met before)  feels impossible for me right now.Maybe i just lost interest in dating or i donno.
For introverts i think it's double as hard to find a partner,maybe because we are not that easy going as extroverts."
3654,isfj,"25 and still single! My casual dating life is pretty active, though. I'm trying to enjoy it while I still can. Same as you, I'm still young and I have ""a lot of broken hearts yet to experience,"" as my mother so lovingly advised me."
3655,isfj,"Since I was 15 I was in a 4/5 year relationship with an esfp (high school to early college). Then a 6/7 year relationship with an isfp. Now going on 3 years in my current. Sounds like I have a problem being alone though writing this. Part of me wishes I had more adult life single... but I adore my current entp bf. 
My advice is just enjoy life and let it happen organically."
3656,isfj,"I’ve been with my husband for about 9 years now. We met in college when I was 18. He’s an ISFP, which I think offers some balance. He’s not nearly as organized or task-oriented as I am, but he’s nice to be around and we always have things to talk about. I have always dated introverts, I think an extrovert would be too exhausting for me. I think you have to make an effort when it comes to friendships and be open to meeting new people. We were good friends before we started dating, and I think that can be really beneficial. "
3657,isfj,"I’m a 24 yo female. I had a 2 year relationship, then one that was less than a year...
My now current relationship is 8 years and we just got married in September. Took a few tries to find the right one, but we’re very happy :)
Edit: my situation is probably more rare because we started dating in high school "
3658,isfj,"I just turned 22 and I’ve been in a healthy and loving relationship for more than a year now. He’s my first boyfriend and everything I ever wanted and more.  But before I got in a relationship with him, I wondered if I my standards were too high or something too. But a lot of people around me were in unhealthy relationships and the like and I didn’t really want to set myself up for that kind of thing so I avoided those things entirely, I never even tried dating apps haha. 
When I first started talking to my now boyfriend, I didn’t really think we’d end up in a romantic relationship (sure i had a crush on him but that’s beside the point lol). Initially our conversations were only thru online means but we kept talking and talking in what we thought was just friendly conversation. When we finally went on a date we just couldn’t have enough of each other from that point and now we’re here, more in love and happy than ever haha. There’s a lot of other details in between that I didn’t include (lmao at ISFJs and details) but I just find our story so funny hehe. 
Anyway, my boyfriend and I are fully committed to growing as individuals and growing as a couple. Just keep working on yourself, OP, and your SO will come around soon enough and it’ll all be worth it. It was for me :) "
3659,isfj,"I’ve been with my husband for about 9 years now. We met in college when I was 18. He’s an ISFP, which I think offers some balance. He’s not nearly as organized or task-oriented as I am, but he’s nice to be around and we always have things to talk about. I have always dated introverts, I think an extrovert would be too exhausting for me. I think you have to make an effort when it comes to friendships and be open to meeting new people. We were good friends before we started dating, and I think that can be really beneficial. "
3660,isfj,"Blah. Maybe. Seriously, I'm not even type A, my parents were just immigrants who worked very hard and instilled hard working values in me. I just keep thinking that if I can do it, it can't be that hard to find someone else like me... But apparently it is..."
3661,isfj,"30 and still single. Ditto on opportunities. I get up in the morning, I go to the gym, I go to work, I come home. I'm a homebody. I hate bars and don't care for hanging out somewhere other than my home, which is something I assume most folks in this sub can relate to. Would just much rather be home."
3662,isfj,"Plus if I do feel like going out and go to a bar the guys AT the bar... they're dudes at a bar, like..... no... it's always some creeper too not some lawyer or surgeon or something you meet at a bar or it'd be different lol. "
3663,isfj,"When I have enough supplies for a trip (even a single-day one), it makes me feel very secure. This could include having enough money, food and water, an extra iPhone battery and a charger, an umbrella or raincoat, or anything else of the like. 
This also happens to me when I'm safe at home during a thunderstorm. I feel very safe and secure, even more so than during calm weather. 
This does not, however, manifest itself in terms of having a plan. I don't usually plan out my single-day excursions in much detail, and doing so does not give me much security, only anxiety that I won't make everything on time. "
3664,isfj,"Definitely. I also get anxiety about being late, I always give myself plenty of time to get places. I don't usually take a lot of stuff with me - but what I do take I obsessively make sure I still have it with me. Making sure I haven't forgotten anything makes me feel secure."
3665,isfj,"Absolutely... I have been trying lately to go with the flow and push the boundaries of my comfort zone, but I think I secretly conspire against myself and I'm actually always prepared. The fact that I've thought about it probably means I've prepared, somewhat mentally, for being unprepared. Ah jeez."
3666,isfj,"Not really. I do always have enough food and water with me, but that's more because I eat and drink a lot.
When going from A to B and having to be there in a timely manner I do want to know exactly what the travel scheme and back-up option are though. If it's just a hike after which I go back it doesn't matters at all. "
3667,isfj,"I’ve been dating one of you guys for little over a month and your great people. You’re very loyal, great at remembering things about me and just very kind overall. I have a concern though. You guys never seem to ever have a conversation, when I talk to you and ask hey what’s going on there is nothing. It feels like he is nervous to say the wrong thing. I don’t get it. I would love to hear about what you’ve read about or some current affair that’s going j in the world just to spark conversation. But he works 2 jobs and is always at one and so nothing new really happens outside of that. I have to ask very specific questions to get any answers. Sometimes if I ask like what kind of interesting thing is happening with people at job A then they’ll tell me but never will that come out without a specific question. I just want to have a natural conversation where I don’t carry it all. It’s a little tiring and I have found myself thinking I want to spend time with other people a little more because I’m getting bored having to put in all the effort. Everyone says you guys take time to open up, but how long? He also is very complimenting of me, but only when I ask what he likes about me and he can go into it. But there is never a random time he is telling me what he likes about me unless I tell him first or ask. I know this sounds like he may not like me, but I know he doesn’t because he’s never once turned down an opportunity to be around me and I’ve never had such a loyal partner. I just feel bad because I don’t want these negative thoughts about him but I also can’t be the one who does everything forever. So advice I am looking for is what makes you guys start talking. Or how do you feel comfortable enough with a person to speak your mind and thoughts without being asked first."
3668,isfj,"Well for me personally, all you have to do is capture my intrest . For example: asking questions like ""how was your day?"" Is pretty simple. And it's nothing wrong with that, however once we answered your question we have nothing else to add. You see I'll work in the construction industry. Mainly heavy equipment operations. If I told you, one of my co-workers tipped over the Skid Steer, 9 out 10 that would grab your attention. Including it would keep the conversation flowing natural. So here's my two cents. Find a topic you think your boyfriend would find intriguing.  It could be about anything really!
Edit: This might not apply to all ISFJ's, but saying off the wall comments or funny shit would open us up! I'd know it does for my black ass. Lol! 😂"
3669,isfj,"I personally really like talking about hobbies. I have found it pretty hard to talk about work on a regular basis with partners in the past because my jobs tend to be pretty repetitive. I generally like learning about people much more than I enjoy talking about myself, so I find myself asking the questions. I would much rather focus on others than myself."
3670,isfj,"If I am not interested in people at job A or what happened at job A today, and that's what you ask me about... you're carrying that conversation. If you ask me about what I am watching or reading or a hobby you'll ask me to shut up. 
I don't mean to sound harsh but I talk when the conversation is interesting to me and I care about it. 
Maybe just... try waiting for him to say something first? People who constantly ask me questions to fill silence end up getting more silence because now I'm tired of talking and we didn't even get to the deeper part. I hate small talk and I have noticed a lot of ISFJs do too. 
How are you/how is your day ""good, you?"" that's always going to be my only answer, even if I am having a bad day. I might say, ""it's a day"" if I am in an awful mood and I am comfortable with you. I never say ""freaking awful!"" because that's not what I feel like people want to hear from that question."
3671,isfj,"True we don't easily open up to someone unless we really like them, it may take a while for us to open up.  IMO a month isn't that much time to fell comfortable enough to open up.  We also like to have deep conversations about topics like our thoughts and feelings, so initiating in small talk is usually a chore for us.  I would give it some more time before I bring it up with him, he just might be hesitant to bring up certain subjects."
3672,isfj,"From a non-ISFJ POV, I can say take things slow and steady, be patient! (Trust me it works, I'm a pretty impatient person, but impatience isn't going to get you anywhere with ISFJs.)
It probably varies, took me about a year-give or take (of being friends)
Not right away, but ISFJs are actually very good at taking jokes and very good at dishing them right back-you'd be surprised. Let them open up, don't force them or constantly ask them about things if they're not ready to share them with you
TLDR: BE PATIENT! Good luck :)"
3673,isfj,"I think ISFJs take their time when it comes to communicating. It took my boyfriend a few times of slightly one-sided  communication before we really took off conversing about whatever stuff. I was a little guarded at first haha. So yeah, like everyone else is saying, it’s a matter of patience. 
Although I find having shared experiences, especially new experiences together, can jumpstart conversation :)"
3674,isfj,"Lot of good answers here. I agree with most of them; I usually don’t talk (at all) if I have nothing interesting to say. I hate small talk and internally want to scream at another “how was your day”. You need to ask the right questions. However when I’m comfortable around someone (I need to feel a connection) and feel like we have shared interests or hobbies (although I don’t have many) I can be quite a chatterbox and surprise even myself with the amount of energy I put in the conversation. 
Do you know what he likes to talk about? Do you think he’s at the “comfort” stage yet with you? Have you considered starting a conversation around this infamous list of questions? A lot of topics on this list will get any ISFJ to talk if (s)he feels comfortable enough with you. Plus added bonus you get to know the person quite well with these questions so you have stuff to talk about in the future."
3675,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ, and I think I can give some insight: 
I sometimes worry about saying the wrong thing and making an ass of myself, so I need to feel safe with someone to start opening up and being myself. 
Are you talking about things he's interested in? Or can he articulate the things he's interested in and talk about that? I know I can be hard to talk to because I really don't like talking about myself. I especially don't like talking about my job, or making small talk. I get more excited talking about things I'm interested in, like music and books and movies. 
If you don't ask questions, does he talk at all? Sometimes I just really don't have much to say, and I'm fine with comfortable silences. Usually if there's enough silence I'll start talking, though. Are you giving him space to open up, or do you feel like you always have to keep the conversation going? 
Do you really need a lot of compliments to know he likes you, if he's showing you how much he cares by doing other things? I compliment my partners a lot, but some of us can be obtuse about that. Still, I think actions speak louder than words here and if he definitely likes you if he's continuing to hang out with you.  
It definitely takes me a while to get comfortable with someone. A little over a month isn't a very long time at all. Even if I really, really liked a person it would take me at least that long to start warming up to them."
3676,isfj,"Personally, the things that I do don't seem to be interesting for someone else. Rather, I think that they're interesting but since I think the other person might find it uninteresting or boring, or that I won't know how to tell my things in an interesting way, well I just don't share. I much more prefer to listen to other people talk about their day and ask them questions about them"
3677,isfj,"Just open up and talk to him. If you truly want the relationship to succeed and work, sometimes it’s best to just be open about how you’re feeling. As an ISFJ myself, I might feel a little upset hearing this at first but I would value the honesty and feedback. How are things going to change if they don’t know something is wrong in the first place?
I hope things turn out okay!"
3678,isfj,"It might be because he just doesn't want to talk about his day! Who knows... but if people ask me that I just say ""oh it was good"" not bothering to go into detail because I don't wanna dump my problems on people. He might just not want you to worry about him"
3679,isfj,I’m just kinda at the end of the rope with the lack of communication. Makes me feel like he doesn’t like me but then acts like he really does when I imitate stuff. I just can’t be the main communicator in a relationship stresses me out.
3680,isfj,"ISFJs seem to rarely start conversations (from my experience, not quite sure why that is, but they are also happy to continue the conversation), I notice that they tend to be more likely to start conversations when it's one-on-one. 
I'm sure if you express your concerns with him, he will give you an explanation as to why and you both will probably be able to come up with a solution together. Communication is key in relationships-talk to him about it."
3681,isfj,"About to celebrate 2 year dating anniversary with an ISFJ. We are both looking forward to a quiet night at home after work, but any suggestions on how to make the night extra special? We've had a complicated relationship and I want her to know how much I love her and how she is my future.
I'm an ESTJ if that matters."
3682,isfj,"Think about things she has done for you. People usually give gifts they like, and speak in their love languages the most. Anything thoughtful, that she had mentioned in the last. It the smallest gestures that mean so much. What makes her go Awwwwww and tear up? What does she say she wishes you did or did more of?! Also telling her 'she so your future' is beautiful! As an ISFJ I LOVE tradition. So my INTP boyfriend has been really good about traditions with me. Like I had never watched the Godfather. So he made it a big deal and we watched it and had Italian food. Another on of my favorite is going back to places (like one of our first couple of dates we went to a bar) so to celebrate we would get food from that place and watch something at home. Or even having a drink there and playing pool and then coming home. But my favorite tradition is on Valentine's day we watch horrible horror movies, and get (usually Mexican because it's out favorite) and celebrate with tiramisu. Or I love it when he wakes up before me and makes a simple pancake breakfast and comes home with coffee or tea. Really, thoughtful gestures go the furthest. Also, I love pictures?  "
3683,isfj,"Massage her, i know i love me some massage from my man (He's a ESTJ as well) offer to cook her dinner and let her relax in the sofa! Take over her part as the caretaker and make her feel special by pampering her like that! Hope this helps :)"
3684,isfj,"I have fallen for a girl for a year now ISFJ.  3 months ago, she told me she liked me as well, but I didnt accept her and avoided given her a straight answer because I have to go overseas for half a year for exchange. I dont know why I did that(regret), maybe because I wasnt confident enough at the time. But since leaving, I am now overseas, I found out she was extremely hurt and was crying alone for many nights because she thought i didn't like her and rejected her. After finding this out, I cant stop myself thinking about her. Then last week, she told me she was talking to a guy about all the sadness and found out he really cared for her. I told her my feelings and now she is conflicted. Is it over for us? and she just doesnt want to hurt my feelings, so she's not telling me she's with him? Should i try get her back or will this hurt her more?"
3685,isfj,"In my opinion, if you show dedication to her without being overbearing and prove that you'll be loyal even if you go overseas or something, I believe it can work.
Just balance between showing you do want her but giving her space when she needs it."
3686,isfj,"i don't think it's over particularly but will take a lot of work.  i've been in a similar situation (as the girl) and it made me question everything about the relationship afterwards because i just felt so rejected and hurt and was worried they would do it again. i mean, i really don't want to be in a relationship where intentions and feelings aren't made clear, i need them to share with me how they feel not keep it to themselves because that doesn't make me feel better. it makes me question what you're doing."
3687,isfj,"In my opinion I think it's best to let her go. You've already done damage and ISFJ's have a tendency to get entangled in relationships they know are bad for them, but they do it anyway because they are so forgiving and loyal and want to help fix whatever issue there is. If she had trouble with long distance in the past, I think it's also in your best interest not to become involved with her."
3688,isfj,"There were sooo many considerations. She had just left her marriage which didn't go well. Extremely ugly breakup. Her family still didn't know she was divorced. I didn't want her friends to feel like she cheated, or divorced because of me. She would be humiliated. She divorced because of long distance. The man was too actively monitoring her, I'm clingy so I might do something similar and it would not work out. I really didn't have the confidence to provide her with happiness as I am still studying, with no job."
3689,isfj,"It's up to you what you do from here. If you want to be selfless, you should let her go and hope it's for the best. If not, you need to work on yourself so you can commit to her more and provide what she needs (emotionally or whatever, I don't know her personally). Do you absolutely see yourself with her for the rest of your life? Or are you not ready to settle down? Can you commit to a long distance relationship and all the trials that come along with that? For all you know, you might be dodging a bullet by letting her go. Seems like there's already some drama being stirred up."
3690,isfj,"Hey there, hope you don't mind me attempting to pick your brains for a minute - I got good participation levels from other MBTI groups so I thought I'd extend it to all groups and try to get a more representative sample. FYI - the study is not collecting personality type information.
My dissertation for my masters in psychology is looking into one possible explanation for avoidance behaviours in forming intimate relationships. If you are 20-35yo and keen to contribute to my study then you can do so by following the link below. Any questions give me a shout, also I'm happy to discuss and hear your thoughts on the subject off the record if you want! It should't take too long but you're free to stop at any point anyway. It may cause some emotional distress as it involves some self evaluation so if you experience any discomfort and would like some guidance please get in touch.
I will leave the survey open until the end of this week.
Cheers!

3692,isfj,"It is nice to see another ISFJ that has been diagnosed with ADHD. Tell me, Friend, what is it like for you when it comes to being an ISFJ with ADHD? Do you have the same problems that I do when it comes to focussing?"
3693,isfj,"Hm I don't know if it's ISFJ related but I definitely have a focusing problem. My work and life in the workplace is very easily affected but for some reason not in relationships. I'm also very indecisive, scares I'll make the wrong choices. What kind of problems do you have? "
3694,isfj,I really really don't like pranks. They make me anxious and uncomfortable and it's also really hard to gauge if someone's going to be upset or inconvenienced by a particular prank. I'd just prefer to stay away from them.
3695,isfj,"I’m not an ISFJ, but my mom is and she has firmly stated how much she dislikes practical jokes many times. She’s got a good sense of humor, but she finds practical jokes to be offensive and definitely not funny. Now I’m wondering what type would like them. My best guess would be an E**P? "
3696,isfj,"I love scaring/pranking my sisters but that's it. I hate when people play weird mind word games with me I dont think it's that funny, I do scare easily and dont mind that sometimes cause it can be funny."
3697,isfj,"My #1 character is Akari Mizunashi from an anime Aria the Animation. She's a very idealistic and cheerful/friendly person. She always finds enjoyable/positive things about even the most mundane of events/things and is just a generally very open-minded and very positive person. I look up to her in these regards.
Another character I really like is Dwight Schrute from the Office. He's an overly by the books and serious business type of guy and a lot of the stuff he says is just hilarious."
3698,isfj,"I have many from different series!
1) Vaas Montenegro from Far Cry 3.
2) Booker DeWitt from Bioshock Infinite.
3) Jim Halpert from The Office.
4) Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty.
5) Dipper Pines from Gravity Falls.
6) Garnet from Steven Universe.
7) Nick/Ellis from Left 4 Dead 2.
8) Trevor Philips from Grand Theft Auto V.
9) Ayla from Chrono Trigger.
10) Stitch from Lilo & Stitch.
There's no order. I like them all for different reasons. I also just wanted to do 10 characters. There are probably more."
3699,isfj,I tend not to have favorite characters or any that stand out to me most of the time. Davos Seaworth from the Song of Ice and Fire books so far has been one of my favorite characters ever as I've always really strongly identified with him.
3700,isfj,"In no particular order:
(1) Selina Meyer from Veep
(2) Lin and Suyin Bei Fong from Legend of Korra
(3) Azula and Katara from Avatar: The Last Airbender
(4) Dr. Sofia Lamb from Bioshock 2
(5) Marshall from United States of Tara
(6) Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series

3702,isfj,"i'm usually a go with the flow type of person (even if i have a shit ton of things that i want to do and end up doing nothing at all) but lately i've been thinking i should start focusing on something, mostly career-wise so that i can (hopefully) support my family better in the long run. do any of you feel/think the same? how do you keep yourself centered on a goal?"
3703,isfj,"I’ve always been really goal-oriented. It’s helpful for me to have tangible endpoints to confirm that I’m on the right track or at least moving forward. I don’t know exactly what I’m working toward right now and it makes me feel really lost, like I’m just treading water. "
3704,isfj,"I am shitty at decision making. What worked for me in the past to achieve a goal was to turn the way there into really braindead habits. There was no question if, why or how I would do something. It was just something that I did. End of story. When you put the time in continuously you will reach the goal."
3705,isfj,i'm very goal orientated. i don't want much in my life. but i do want to be able to afford a family and i want to live a happy and fulfilled life. and i am dedicated to doing the things i believe will help me toward those goals.
3706,isfj,"I've come to realize i'm not goal oriented at all. And i've found out in the worst possible way: While working for the thesis that i need to obtain my title.
Usually i work well with projects cos i get a deadline from my bosses. The thing here is that i have no deadlines for this, just the one i may decide for myself. And ive donde this twice already, and twice i haven't been able to do it."

3708,isfj,"*Not in an ISFJ/ISFJ relationship but...
I can't really imagine being in a relationship with another person like me. I think another ISFJ would drive me mad. I would understand another ISFJ better than I do my INTJ boyfriend but I couldn't see myself being able to deal with them. (Maybe I am just a bad ISFJ though, don't really like myself much because I wish I was less emotionally-driven and less prone to keeping feelings in/not being able to let go of things).
On that note... Do any ISFJs here have ISFJ/ISFJ friendships? I don't believe I've ever met another ISFJ (at least well enough to type them). I do know a few Ni-Te dominants kind of well though (INTJs and INTPs)."
3709,isfj,"Same here, never met another ISFJ since i found out about types midway last year. I would love to have one as a friend to see what it's like from other's point of view of me.
As for OP, i know your post was ages ago but i were to be romantically involved with another ISFJ the way i am i think it could work, except the meeting part. I am not the type to start a conversation with someone i don't know but after that i can be very comfortable and mostly open with others. I like my space and being alone but 1 other person for any amount of time i don't mind, anymore and i get sick of them"
3710,isfj,"Hey you guys! 
For a couple of years I thought I was an INFJ. I mean, I did a couple of tests on a lot of different sites. Untill I did a test a couple of days ago to 
find out they think I'm an ISFJ.
So.. me being me I started watching YouTube videos and looking up this subreddit and I guess this is my place. 
Finally I can relate to all of those posts!
So... Hey!"
3711,isfj,"Welcome! I also used to test INFJ when I was younger, but as I learned more about MBTI it became clear to me that I was textbook ISFJ. It's my personal theory that N is extremely over-tested, for a variety of reasons, so a lot of self-proclaimed INFJs are really ISFJs. (Same with INTPs and ISTPs, ENTJs and ESTJs, etc.)"
3712,isfj,"Hi there, friendly neighborhood INFJ here with a question. In Jung’s eyes, according to Psychological Types, the biggest issue for any type is the inverse of the dominant, and not something like the inferior function; surely a weakened function but certainly not the enemy as it works together with the dominant(again, in Jung’s eyes.) So in my case when a strong Ne user pops off with some possibility mumbo jumbo and comments on something like “anything is possible” I literally just.... oooo I bite my tongue, but often times I just disregard almost entirely what they’re saying. It’s not until say an ENTP drops down to Ti and Fe that they would ever really have my attention. I’m wondering if something similar happens with an ISFJ? Would any of you consider the advents of Se to be.... preposterous? Like, the complete rejection of your past, your tastes and images from before, senses so strong that one might as well still be there, due to Se being focused only on the here and now. Like, someone who had an arguable complete disregard for rules and procedures if the “moment was right.” Would you have any examples, I would really appreciate it? 
I have an INTP cousin that explains what it’s like at some level, to taste a burger and have it not be ‘that one’ burger, among other things. But he would not even consider Se due to it being in the blind spot, but an ISFJ would - so I’m actively curious on how that works. Maybe how you’ve noticed it differentiate between say even an INFJ since an INFJ would use Se at some level, or perhaps an instance where you’ve come across an ESP, or anything really? Any insight would be appreciated."
3713,isfj,"I appreciate the response, I think that as well, although maybe we just know cool people. To clarify though, I wouldn’t think Ne are anything but solid people, although I’m usually optimistic about anything concerning people, only that when say an Ne, mostly dominant Ne, insists on a certain point in regards to ideas, some part of me goes “Nuh uh.” 
I kind of get the gist that your preferences and routine have been getting the better of you, perhaps recently, and I wish you well on that note. "
3714,isfj,"Sorry about that, I just revamped it; it was pretty bad. 
Hmmm I see, I think that would fall under Ne(if you’re an ISFJ.) Would you say that someone who disregarded rules and procedures and protocols on the fly, as an Se might, to be... may I ask how that might go? "
3715,isfj,"Yeah, although being stubborn is likely more coupled with our Ti; I’d say the Ni v Ne is something else.... because Ne could be considered stubborn as well, but since the dominant will always be the goal I don’t think stubborn could be the word.... at least, god, I hope not. 
But I probably should have said, “People who completely ignore all rules and procedures.” Probably would have helped a bit more. "
3716,isfj,"Anyone know their Enneagram type? I took a short test online earlier that typed me as a 2 / 4 / 6 and I just took a more detailed one that typed me as
Type 6 - 10
Type 5 - 10
Type 4 - 8.3
Type 2 - 8
Type 9 - 6.3
""It is common for instance, for female Sixes to mistype as Twos, especially if they are identified with a helper role, but Sixes have a much more ambivalent attitude towards relationships than do Twos, who generally know exactly what they want.""
""Fives tend to be shy, nonintrusive, independent and reluctant to ask for the help that others might well be happy to extend to them.
Type 2 is still really high for me, but the others outweighed it. I feel like many ISFJs would be 2s though so curious for any input. Here's the link to the longer test I took...
[And actually, after reading their description of a 2, it feels a bit not right to me... also included is the note: ""Females, of all types, are bound to recognize some of the dynamics of type Two in their personalities, as such qualities have been socially reinforced.""]
Thanks again and hope you find the results interesting like I did :)
edit: I also really liked this website's descriptions."
3717,isfj,"I am an ISFJ and have fallen hard for an ENTP. Currently we are having communication problems. I am afraid to express how I feel at times because I feel that he will start to withdrawal from our relationship. Everytime I attempt to discuss something regarding feelings or our relationship I feel he brushes it off and changes the subject as if he really does not want to discuss it. I feel that we are stuck in this constant back and forth dance. It also seems that as soon as things start feeling like a real committed relationship he pushes away. I am really struggling with the p's lack of follow through, and consistancy. I feel often blown off or forgotten when we make plans. I tell him that these things bother me, and yet they continue. All I would like is a phone call just to say something has come up, so that I am not waiting around and wasting my time. This makes me question how he feels about me/us, and if I should really trust him or not. After 6 years of this, I am at the point where I do not know what to do. He says he cares yet I feel that sometimes his actions do not show that he does. Lately he has started messaging me a lot trying to get me to respond to him, when I have backed off from the relationship, almost to the point of not wanting to try anymore. He calls and leaves me messages trying to set up times to see each other, or offers to bring me dinner. He says he just wants to hear my voice, etc. Previously in certain conversations we would have he will tell me a little about himself, and make it a point to say ""this is me letting you in"", yet I feel that it is only a tiny bit of information. I feel that although he knows so much about me that I hardly know really anything about him. Has anyone ever had this experience? Should I give him another chance or should I stop trying?"
3718,isfj,"I am an ISFJ in a long-term relationship with an ENTP. One of the strongest aspects of our relationship is communication. If you are struggling with this, I would consider re-evaluating your MBTI type, as the other poster said, or think about coming at this from a non-MBTI-specific perspective. If you want to keep this relationship going, I would strongly suggest couples counseling. You guys seem to have difficulty figuring it out by yourselves, an outside professional would probably help. If it doesn't help and things don't get better...well, you know what to do."
3719,isfj,"She's a quiet ESFP. I've seen this kim = isfj all over the net and I'm baffled who started it. I don't see Si or Fe with her. Whenever a situations awkward she tries to ignore it rather than keep the peace. From what I've seen she only cares about harmony when it directly involves herself... I do that too lmao! 
Ive always thought Brittany snow and Maggie Gyllenhaal are good examples of ISFJs. What do you think about them as that type? "
3720,isfj,"I currently work in pest control, I like helping people, investigating problems, fixing problems, and the most important aspect is having the freedom to do what I believe needs to be done without a manager standing over me and the autonomy I have of when to take lunch/bathroom/which stops to run.
What I don’t like is the 12-14 hour days, having pesticides get on me, never knowing if a service will be added to me at 2pm that adds 2-3 hours to my day, always having to act like it’s “4th and goal, super bowl, game is tied” every single day, tired of dealing with bedbugs and roaches, plus all types of weather. 
I tested as infp a month ago, but the test I took in a book says that I’m an isfj, which describes me to a T. Now, They say do what tends to come easy to you, and things that people compliment you on, besides “Computers” I don’t think I have anything 
I don’t think I’m that good with computers anyway, it takes me half a day to search google, I get frustrated give up and come back days even weeks later. To think I had to do that with a boss demanding faster and faster completion timed, not to mention I don’t want to ever work 2nd shift again or ever work 3rd shift (adhd medicine in morning let’s me actually get to work plus I’m very routine and feel a little foggy if it’s thrown off), add in the constant interruptions and the assumed zero down time to just recharge and work in a burst of energy, I think I’d be just as miserable as I am now, maybe more because I’d be new and more likely to be fired. 
I know this sub is smaller than the one I thought I was, but hopefully someone out there can offer some sage advice "
3721,isfj,"I'm in no position to give any advice to you, but what do you like? Try to explore all the options, or opportunities available to you. May take time, but I think it's for best if you explore your opportunities and then decide. "
3722,isfj,"ISFJs tend to be good providers, that's why I believe many of us choose a career path such as nursing where you have to support and care about other people. Nevertheless and regardless of the MBTI type, nursing isn't the only option available. I'm currently trying to find my way into IT because I've always liked to fiddle with computers ever since I can remember. IT is a vast field, there are plenty of options if what you want to do is deal with other people's computer issues. I would actually like to do nursing or similiar jobs but since IT is my passion I'm trying to go that way first. In the end no one can tell you for sure what you should do because only you know what you like to do, and if you don't, it might help you to try new different things and see what sticks."
3723,isfj,"im so sorry
If you dont want your current job, i suggest you reflect and find another one that suits you the most.
Finding a new career is great but take note that you also have to spend dollars to travel to companies depending on travel distance if you want to get out from your miserable job. I suggest you stay like couple of months and earn money and when youve already earned enough funds to take care of yourself, thats the time you should give your resumes away to companies on linkd or jobstreet. 
It will take time and patience though.
are you earning well or is your salary below minimum?"
3724,isfj,"I’m in automotive repair and have been for nearly 20 years. It’s a nice balance between extending care, being detail oriented, and largely not having to deal with the general public. Also pays pretty well because it’s been seen as a “lower” skilled profession for quite some time so there aren’t many people interested/qualified to do it and is in high demand in a lot of locations. 
Think of it as nursing, only the patient is mechanical and might only get one occasional visitor. "
3725,isfj,"Recently I thought about dental assisting, massage therapy, barber, phys therapy assistant, but the idea of touching people I barely know gives a weird vibe to me. Not to mention I can barely remember the customer’s nameI just serviced, so while it’d be fun to be the scrub wearing guy I think I’d feel too terrible if my lack of functioning memory caused someone to be hurt. "
3726,isfj,"slight problem, I don’t really know ;_; ever since I was little I basically played video games, or watched tv, and most of the things I read up on now I’m not sure if they’re genuine interests or something that could be a career. "
3727,isfj,"I started studying for my net+ cert because I have no other qualifications other than “muh family computer stuff”, but I stopped because I do not want to be in a call center job with a boss always hounding me and plus the only jobs that I can find are 70minutes away 1 way. "
3728,isfj,"Nah, you get used to touching people. I’m very socially awkward. I forgot a patients name during an emergency situation the other week and completely blanked. Point is, we’re human. You get to know people. It’s alright. "
3729,isfj,When I was looking to switch careers I went and had some professional career assessments done along with some personality assessments done through a psychologist. It really helped to define what I could do well as an introvert. You might want to check that out. 
3730,isfj,Yeah those kind of jobs suck so much I'd rather be stuck in retail. The better jobs require more work experience and sometimes even a degree (which I will probably never get) and certifications only matter so much sadly.
3731,isfj,"The main issue would be barriers to entry, I work 5-6 days a week and don’t get home till 7-8 at night, plus I can’t exactly quit or find a job that pays what this one does without a degree or certifications "
3732,isfj,"It depends on what it is. Nursing school kicked my ass so if I’m not on fire all the time I don’t feel right. I went into critical care, so it’s always stressful all the time. I can process things until it’s a patient population I’m not used to, such as surgical patients. 
It’s worth noting most PAs are in dr offices, which aren’t overly high stress. "
3733,isfj,"It was covered by my insurance since they were administered by a licensed therapist. I know almost every community college offers those services for free or low cost as well. 
It was pretty eye opening for me! I learned that aside from being an extreme introvert I also registered on the OCD scale. It really made me aware that the job I was in was never going to work long term and why it was causing me anxiety. I learned that I’m best suited for a quiet computer job. "
3734,isfj,"In the past couple years, I have developed a confidence in my personality after accepting my introversion; I always had thought it was a bad thing.  Not sure if that is relevant to the topic, but maybe it is.
After accepting who I am, I've been doing my best to meet new people because I know everyone has something to offer.  My problem is ACTUALLY getting the motivation to open up conversation with people.  I hate small talk, but I know it is necessary to get to more in-depth conversation.  The times that I have great conversation with strangers, I feel fulfilled but the rate I converse with them is sporadic which doesn't lead to consistent increases in conversational skills.
How do you get motivation to talk to new people and/or create that small talk that is oh-so necessary to go deeper?"
3735,isfj,"Try and find something you both have in common and are passionate about as soon as you can. So maybe start off asking about their music tastes, hobbies, etc. Once you find something in common, keep talking about it and let the conversation flow naturally until before you know it - you're talking about a completely different topic. 
Although it's always very difficult to get into a good conversation with someone who is quite blunt, unwilling to share and doesn't go into detail..."
3736,isfj,"No seriously, you guys are amazing! I know a few ISFJs including close friend and my mom, and you guys are awesome 👏🏼 much appreciation 
Very similar to me but also much more caring and warm towards others. I even observe you just to learn from you. 
Sometimes I think i need ISFJ rather then ESFP/ESFJ"
3737,isfj,"An idea that us new mods had was to start discussion threads within the subreddit. I decided that a weekend discussion thread would be a good way to start it off! So, because I am not very creative today, I'm just going to do a generic ""how was your week"" thing.
So... Chat away, folks! :P"
3738,isfj,"This is such a lovely idea! Thank you for kicking this off =)
My week has been good, overall. Transitioning into a new role/career path at work, which has me nervous, because it’s something new (gasp, change!!), but excited to be more of a specialist, and to grow my skill set. 
I am facing some pretty tough depression, the likes of which I haven’t seen in years. Definitely have two parts of myself that are at odds - the rational adult who knows that recovery from depression takes equal parts compassion and work, and the juvenile part of me that just wants to fester and pout and not put any effort into feeling better. Depression can be like an annoying sibling sometimes - gotta live and grow with it, even when it really gets on my nerves. 
Nonetheless, I am very glad to have some decent insight from previous bouts of depression, and to have patient, loving support from my partner and friends, so in a weird twist, this week also has me feeling incredibly fortunate and grateful. The people in my life are pretty fucking wonderful. "
3739,isfj,"Whew, it was a long week. For some reason I am still transitioning back into working after being off the week between Christmas and New Years.
Does anyone have any neat weekday night ideas? I am looking for some new things to do after work, outside of the normal trivia night etc."
3740,isfj,"My week started out pretty bad, stressing over tests and such, but ended up pretty nice. And the snow we were supposed to get here from lake effect (NW indiana here) only happened to be about maybe 2-4 inches. Instead like a foot. Also, Season 2 of The Punisher released yesterday. I've only watched the first two episodes but I'm enjoying it! "
3741,isfj,"Hello!
My week was pretty alright. Busy but now that's it's a 3 day weekend for my job for Martin Luther I get extra days to relax and study up on Japanese which I've been doing more consistently recently."
3742,isfj,"I’m all for any kind of learning class - just have the most exposure  to cooking ones.
In my experience, it’s a really great activity for a group, too, if you have friends that would be interested. A good alternative to the typical hangout activities. Great conversation starters throughout, ways to praise/support others, and if people don’t feel like talking, it’s okay because you’re working on making something! 
I’ve also attended cooking classes that were more about a subject matter expert presenting/doing the work, so it’s kind of like practical learning through theatre? One I remember fondly was a pit master class - the bbq was delicious, and we all walked out smelling like a campfire =)"
3743,isfj,"That’s nice to hear! I’ve read mixed things online.
I would be super interested in a SME one, but I should probably be enrolling in remedial cooking classes before even considering. "
3744,isfj,"I noticed this trend for myself (I'm an ISFJ) being attracted towards ENTPs (I didn't know initially about types or anything, found out later) and was wondering if any other ISFJs are attracted or highly attracted to ENTPs? (Opinions? Good/Bad)"
3745,isfj,"Entps are funny, smart, and interesting. They have a lot of strengths that I lack, which is cool. 
I can tell right away when immature ones won't be true friends though. Sometimes they don't really value people as ends unto themselves, but just as stimulus opportunities for them to perform and reinforce their identity. Since most entps I know are immature like this I honestly find none of them ""attractive,"" just cool people. "
3746,isfj,"I admire ENTPs, but I've never been attracted to them. My brother is an ENTP, so maybe that has something to do with it. :)
I think they're really funny, intelligent, sassy and ambitious, but I also find them to be a little bit overwhelming, and slightly argumentative. I don't find them to be a super compatible type, for me personally."
3747,isfj,"I had my best friend of many years figure out her type today and she is an ENTP! We get along pretty well because we have very similar opinions-- hence little argumentation. In social settings, we're nearly opposites and balance each other out. 
However, ENTP's are not people i'm typically attracted to in a romantic sense because in my experience, they can sometimes be overbearing."
3748,isfj,"Interesting! I always struggled with maintaining relationships and wondered why you know? But i don't think it's always as cold as that, using people to reinforce my identity no no no. 
I think we just get excited by new people and that doesn't mean the other people in our lives are less interesting, we just like to meet new and move on and forget and more new and move on and on. The close friends I do make, I keep. But I've always kept close circles and found that people I wouldn't think of as close friends would be confusing the relationship they had with me.. food for thought. "
3749,isfj,"Aaaah.
The ol' ""tongue is spaghetti"" problem. I have the chance to have to choose between puns and crap to say, because I'm indeed short wired for that.
It doesn't depends on the quality of what I'll decide to say, because I'll never be able t say it, once it's ""acceptably good"". It would be far too late.
It's about what I prefer as a person. Usually it's dad jokes or crappy references. Nothing of really high quality. It's just I happen to say them with a large goofy grin, because I amused myself with it the couple of seconds between when I thought about it and the time to say it.
The from has much more impact than the content for most people. I had hard time to accept that lesson.
Like everything, if you don't have some sparring and training often enough, you just lose it.
It doesn't comes naturally to me as it does to most ENTPs.
You assumed well. I'm usually more of an ENxP, but I gained back my Ti the last couple of weeks.
It sounds like you struggle more against than with.
I'm not sure how I see the difference yet.
Hahaha.
Not as much as Fe. Think of Ne as a sword. It's meant to cut though bullshit and masks. That isn't something appreciated in social events."
3750,isfj,"That's when our lateral thinking comes in play. You don't need to have a conversation to maintain your conversational skills.
Who said we knew what we were doing there and didn't made fool of ourselves ? =)
We learn to maintain a collected facade, older, though.
I think I'll tell you the big secret. Most of us read the jokes. Internet is of course the best opportunity for that, but the oldest of us read encyclopaedias and dictionaries.
Why ? Because nothing more ironic reading the formal definition of ""asshole"" or ""gangbang"". 
The rest is only made of free associations. It's there we're short wired.
If you read witty crap, you'll say witty crap. Even as a Si dom.
No struggle in the first place then. 
Nah, you don't. That's what makes me the most angry about our social order. It's shallow and materialist.
Even a deeply thought incisive one liner is at best treated like a dad joke. At worst, nobody gets it, and just ignore your work.
I don't know if it's because I became a cynical idiot, or if our world is crap, but this kind of thinking sound carefree and innocent to me.
What kind ? Mockeries ? Cynical/dark humour jokes ? Dirty jokes ?
I like irony. The purest form of intellectual humour, in my opinion. And too often mistaken for shallow sarcasm.
There's a distinction to make in all that. But I think you already noticed what I'm doing there.
Of course they do. Being nice is being a naïve."
3751,isfj,"You just have ti say something new to them to be interesting. It's easy when people are arrogant enough to think they know everything.
I'm like that, too, oddly.
""good content"" is boring. If you put so much work in something to the point you loose all that makes it's essence, and even it's identity.
That's no good.
Yup. By using our power of association to make people want to try to get past the shallow excuse of thinking they take as reality, by imitating it, and parodying it in times and other.
Our jokes are nothing of that. It's just excuses to enjoy the utter nonsense we're facing daily.
We're known to take a third option when we're put in front of a choice that is made of two dull/painful choices.
I'm known to chose the strategy of the minimal effort, because my life is dull.
I don't think you'll see a Ne dom doing something they know they don't enjoy really soon.
Technically speaking, we're the most capable of all types, in primary tertiary loop.
That obviously don't mean it's a good thing.
Most of the time, ""adapting"" means just running away and never return. "
3752,isfj,"I'm a college student and there is this professor that I really admire. Luckily I got to take a language class with her for 4 quarters but I never even managed to start a conversation with her. the closest I got was going to her office hours this quarter and asking for help. Then a couple days later after i ran into her walking to class. I saw her but I was wishing she didn't because I am just that awkward and didn't what to say to her. Anyways, I guess I gave her a ""I'm too good to talk to you"" kind of feeling and kind of screwed up my chances to get to know her in person. Now she probably thinks i'm a stuck up ass. I don't know why i care so much about what she thinks, she's only my professor! I'm not hitting on her but I just hate myself when I screw up relationships with someone that I really want to get to know. Is this an isfj problem or is it just me? "
3753,isfj,"Hey, I have this problem A LOT. My therapist calls it ""mind reading"" and basically it's me assuming I know what the other person is thinking (and that what they're thinking is usually negative). What you can do to combat it is first, realize that it's happening, and second, think accurately. Remember that phrase. Not think positively, think accurately. What's actually going on in your teacher's mind? A few possibilities:


She comes into contact with dozens or even hundreds of students a day and doesn't have time to wonder what each of them thinks about her.


She knows that you are a quieter person and is totally okay with that.


She does think you're stuck up because you didn't say hi to her in the hall.


She didn't notice you when you passed her in the hall because she had other things on her mind (grading papers, what she's eating for lunch that day, problems with her family, etc.).


Now out of those four...which seems most accurate? I think you know that three out of those four are most likely the closest to the truth.
I hope that helped a little. I tend to overthink things and assume people hate me, but the reality is, that is really not the case 99% of the time. This exercise jerks me out of my tendency to dwell on inaccuracies."
3754,isfj,"My professor definitely saw me. We were walking up the stairs and she turned and smiled at me opening her mouth to say hi but she took a look at me, didn't say anything and then walked faster ahead of my through the doors. She didn't even bother to hold the door open for me. "
3755,isfj,"Curious if anyone uses any kind of drugs (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, psychedelics, etc.)  Also what your experiences are with it, why you use said drug, and how often?
To start:
Marijuana; Daily (college student); lets me relax, helps with stress, probably do it too much or at least I think I might, become couch locked causally and don't have motivation to go do anything
Shrooms and LSD; Couple times; seeing what it has to offer, I'm extremely interested in psychedlics because of the visual experience and the way it allows your mind to work, interested in the way everything works and debate how this was all created
Alcohol; weekends; I enjoy it because it's easier to talk to girls as an introvert but it's usually extremely hard to talk to girls still. Beyond to allow me to talk to people in general sometimes more."
3756,isfj,"I do not currently use any drugs or drink. 
Marijuana: Did not like, I would do stuff and not know what I did until after. It was as though I couldn't process what was happening and do stuff at the same time. For example, if I went to the kitchen and got some ice cream and went and sat back down I wouldn't know that I had ice cream until I was actually eating it. It would trip me out. 
I miss drinking though, because I become more social and confident. I can pretty much talk to anyone about anything and I become very happy. I am usually horrible in social situations, because if I get too overwhelmed I become anxious, cannot carry a conversation, and make myself small (shoulders in, arms folded, head down, etc.)"
3757,isfj,"Tried marijuana, but never really got into it. It gave me headaches and I would always feel nauseous so I gave it up pretty quick.
I've used molly twice and plan to continue using it in the future. I'm pretty particular about how often I use it though, ie. a minimum of 6 months between rolling to give my brain time to recuperate. Both times have been incredibly fun as the raves I went to were spent with good company.
In terms of alcohol, I don't really touch that. I'm really particular about the taste of drinks, so I usually can't take more than a few sips before I have to set it down. I'll do it at kickbacks or parties (read: where I have to be social), but I won't go out of my way to have it. I like that it gives me courage to talk to people though."
3758,isfj,"Marijuana : Not at all.  I can't stand the smell; it's worse than cigarette smoke.
Shrooms and LSD:  Not a chance.
I'll have a beer or an overpriced sugary concoction when I go out to eat with other people, but rarely by myself.  It would have to be a special occasion for me to have any sort of alcohol in my refrigerator at home.
While I probably appear dull and boring, I do have my reasons.  I tend to think people have addictive personalities, and my bloodline in particular.  All of my father's four brothers were alcoholics at some point in their lives.  My father was the exception, who strayed far past alcohol and turned to cocaine.  He kicked the cocaine when I was young, and in the later years of his life before he died, turned to rely on pain medications.  These occurrences have sort of built a ""fear"" in me about substance use, which was pretty much already at a zero anyway. 
I also don't like the idea that I need to be reliant on anything to do what I'm fully capable of doing on my own.  An example being that I've lost sixty pounds, which I was able to do through personal changes.  I still have some way to go.  I didn't want a pill, surgery, or some gimmick.  But this doesn't mean that I fault anybody that does; I'm just not sold that marijuana would help me do everything with a multiplicative increase in efficiency.
This two reasons are mainly why I stray away from any use of any substances."
3759,isfj,"It's surprising I don't see more of this because I was told depression and self destructive behavior / substance abuse were hallmarks of IxFJ and INFx types.  I know it is for Enneagram 4's.
Anyways for me:
High school - Mostly daily weed and pharms like Adderall
Senior Year / 1st Year Out of School - That ecstasy phase
The last few years - Opiates.  Lots and lots of opiates.
Plus experimentation with everything else."
3760,isfj,"yay greens too much, 32 years old, programmer, semi-loner.  unfortunately more than 1oz /month
loved shrooms but had an extremely harrowing experience involving wandering the streets of berkeley in a dream-reality state and ending up in the back of a police car and then strapped to a gurney in a hospital and feeling like i was in hell before subsequently coming around and realizing i was just in a hospital, and calling my friends and getting back to the frat only to be awoken by a call from my parents who had flown in overnight a thousand miles because they received a call that their son was in the hospital and no more, and subsequently having to lie to my parents about basically getting roofied at a party even though i'm a guy. lol.. blah 
alcohol not so much.. it makes me drowsy and i don't like the feelings so much unless i have a social drinking situation that amuses and interests me in which case alcohol + weed + nicotine.. feels so good.. damn
salvia.. love salvia and the complete craziness of consistency yet incomprehensibility of vision that it always produces, but don't do it more than once every few years it seems.  wonder if i'll ever do it again
nicotine.. sweet sweet goddamned nicotine.  i am filthy i smoke the cigarette butts of my roommates.  sorry to disturb you all"
3761,isfj,"Hey r/isfj! 29/F here. I've recently got typed as ISFJ and have been reading a whole lot about the whole MBTI thing and how I interact in my relationships with others. I used to keep a blog and when I read back on my posts everything I've written about rings true to being an ISFJ.
tl;dr: 29/F/ISFJ. 2 dates with INTJ male - far too invested. Close friend (rightly) criticized getting invested too quickly and bending over backwards to accommodate people and pushing friends aside. How to handle emotions and expectations without become full-on cold hearted bitch?
A little background into myself - I've always been overweight and had very poor self-esteem and self-worth. About a year ago I embarked on a journey to lose weight and I'm about halfway there! The confidence boost has been amazing, but I still feel very weirded out when people call me pretty/hot/attractive. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but sometimes I just want to hide in my cave again. Anyway, a byproduct of this is I've been trying out online dating again. My last relationship with an INTJ male really messed me up - but I'm optimistic and will keep trying. 
My problem though, is I find myself getting attached to people too easily. My heart speeds far ahead of my mind and after just the first few dates I'm already thinking there's something more, and will accommodate my schedule to prioritize new relationships over older established friendships. An example: met an INTJ guy twice, and after that I texted him saying I'm having fun getting to know him and would be keen to do that in person more - I tried very hard not to use any language relating to relationships/dating but I think he too started overthinking it and read (quite successfully) the subtext of my message. He said that it's definitely feeling more platonic now, more than anything else, but regardless he does still want to meet up. At this point I just said that I know quite early on what I don't want, and I haven't made that decision about this yet - but if he knows that it's only ever going to be platonic to PLEASE, please let me know. We scheduled to meet up this weekend and I haven't texted him since. I appreciate honest communication - I hate playing games and I am terrible at reading cues, so I tend to lay my cards (and my heart) on the table pretty early on (although maybe yeah 2 dates is a little premature).
I showed the conversation to a close friend and she ripped into me over this, basically saying that I should stop being a doormat and that guys should have to earn my time rather than handing it up so easily. I agree with a lot of what she was saying, but to say I wasn't hurt by it would be an understatement. I told her that I recognize and agree with her points but didn't want to discuss it because my current first instinct was to get defensive and try and explain everything away. I was also thoroughly mortified by my recent interactions with the guy (mentioned above) and now I'm not really looking forward to seeing him, or dating anyone to be honest. I feel like I haven't got a grip on how to approach potential relationships healthily and maybe I shouldn't be let loose on the dating scene. Basically feeling like a failure all round.
Sorry for the wall of text, but what I'm asking, in essence, is how to chill the fuck out and not let my emotions go into overdrive. How do I find that balance in shielding my heart while staying true to myself? I am definitely capable of going full cold hearted emotionless person (not that I'd be particularly happy) but it seems to be either extreme for me - how do I find that middle ground?"
3762,isfj,"best way is to do you and be unafraid of going after what you want and being yourself. screw subtext. ""i like your face, let's date"". don't wear half your heart on your sleeve, worrying that you have to pull it back if things don't go as your expect. full heart that shit. be like ""2 dates have been awesome! and i really like you in a romantic sense"" and if he's like ""i feel platonically about you"" you can be like ""well that's how i feel, so that sucks. this ain't gonna work out i guess"". it's just a bump on your road toward going after what you want. and what you want isn't a specific person, it's being with someone a certain way. figure out what that type of person and type of relationship is and shoot for it. fearlessly yourself."
3763,isfj,"That's exactly the type of attitude I had approaching this - but on some level I recognize that it can be a little unhealthy - simply because I feel like I shoot myself in the foot every time, and things sometimes just need time to develop.
I think inside I am a little bit of a hopeless romantic, and believe that if it were the 'right' person it shouldn't be complicated - that the other party will respond just as enthusiastically and positively. Doing it this way just seems likely that I will crash and burn a few times along the way (or FOREVER! :|)."
3764,isfj,"You might crash and burn a few times. You pick yourself up and you keep going. I am also a hopeless romantic, falls in love super fast ISFJ. And my husband? He's an INTJ. Believe me, I've crashed and burned more than once. It has made me a more caring and compassionate person.
You do you. Fall in love fast? Own it. You are a worthwhile person, and not everyone has such an open heart. It may hurt like hell sometimes, but I bet none of your friends ever doubts that you care about them."
3765,isfj,"I've noticed a shift in my S/O. He's more quiet, less excited bout things that used to make him happy. I can fell his energy shift, and just a general loss of interest. (idk maybe its just me his over lol). but otherwise, if this was you, and you had a S/O that could sense you've changed, how would you want me to approach you? or would you even want us to? I don't want to seem.. sensitive that I feel affected by his change but I guess I am worried I am tip toeing around it and it's too obvious to not address, but I dont want to offend him."
3766,isfj,"This may or may not help, its definitely going to be situational: My SO is an ISFJ and every time he gets stressed he closes himself off and is noticeably distant. I have had quite a few conversations with him over the years about this and each time he will reassure me that it has nothing to do with me. He just needs time to get through his stress and his way to handle it is through being reserved. I've come to accept it now and he always ends up getting through it. "
3767,isfj,"I do this as well. I need time to process, analyze my thoughts before taking any action. It's a me problem, and I don't wish to burden people close to me, when it's normally an internal thing.
When we reach out for help, that's when we've exhausted all our options and trust you enough to ask."
3768,isfj,"Don't be put off if he says he's okay, but is still acting stressed. He may just not want you to feel burdened or put any stress on you. Maybe ask him if he's stressed, let him know you're there if he needs any help and then let him deal with it himself. "
3769,isfj,"This self inflicting cycle is our way of showing we care by not burdening you with our issues at hand.
If you insist on doing something, find out something he likes to eat or do, leave it there and let him be. He'll appreciate that you understand him by doing that and will find some way to thank you after it's over. Coaxing him to open up after he says he's fine could cause him to close up further more. "
3770,isfj,"Let's just say I have a problem... An apology problem. I say sorry too much. It's been pointed out to me by many people. For example, earlier this year I was taking Calculus and would often go to my professor's office hours... During this time, whenever I wouldn't understand something I would say apologize to him. He finally told me: ""You aren't supposed to understand this stuff, that's why you're here! Don't be sorry about it."" I also apologize for tons of random little things, I can't even think of any offhand... Wait, got some -- sometimes I will end a post with the phrase ""sorry for such a long post"", when I am being very emotional I will just tell my boyfriend ""I'm sorry I'm being so emotional/stupid/etc"", when I am taking too long finding my debit card at the register I will feel bad for the cashier and customers behind me and say sorry...
I also recently read this (source): Of all the types, ISFJs find it hardest to be assertive. They really don’t like conflict and they positively like to be seen as “obliging”.  But other people can easily take advantage of this aspect of an ISFJ’s character. This can then further undermine an ISFJ’s confidence and add to the stress in their life. Some ISFJs can also become overly apologetic for themselves and their actions.
Just wondering if anyone else here might have similar experiences :)"
3771,isfj,"I definitely relate to this! I am an over-apologizer, especially for emotions...I tend to feel like it must be an inconvenience/annoyance for other people to be burdened with my feelings, so I often will follow up a reaction or an expression of negative emotion by apologizing for feeling that way (sometimes with an added bonus of downplaying my own feelings as invalid or crazy... It took me a long time to recognize how unhealthy that is!) "
3772,isfj,"Yes but I'm actually a Canadian. They called me out on my accent in LA. Sorry, you probably wanted an American eh?
I'm pumping out the apologies and eh, but I didn't get to use an extra U in anything :,("
3773,isfj,"Guys, ok, I legit do need help. I have a friend who is an ISFJ and she's sweet and kind and stuff, but holy hell is she an emotional basket case. I like her and I want to be friends and stuff, but she kind of... glommed onto me? I get stuff in the middle of the day that goes something like this: 
Her: omgomgomgomg I messaged Jake 2 hours ago and he hasn't gotten back to me yet. I think he's ghosting me. 
Me: It's the middle of a work day. He's probably just busy. 
Her: goes on a really, really long rant about all the ""signs"" he's been showing that he's been pulling away, even though she's only known him for about a week at this point
Me: Nah, you're just over thinking it.
2 Hours Later
Her: He messaged me back 
Next day: SAME EXACT CONVERSATION
And I understand that she's not the most secure person and I'm not trying to be unfeeling, really I'm not, but this is actually exhausting. I flinched this morning when my phone shot off a notification. I know I need to say something to her, but she's sooooo sensitive and I don't want to hurt her feelings. I do want to stay friends with her, but I need space and I need to not be her emotional crutch all the time. Please advise. "
3774,isfj,"She sounds like me, lol. And no therapy won't help. I just ended up paying my therapist $150 a week to listen to this sort of thing. (She's ENFP and my sister is INFP.)
But I think you're wrong in her treating you like an emotional crutch. She really just has all these thoughts and feelings and needs to let them out. She doesn't really want your help other than being a sounding board. Any advice you give won't be useful to her cause she'll just do what she wants anyway.
So yes if you want fewer messages from her, you'll just have to tell her that. Or start responding less and she'll adapt or ask you what's wrong. Trust me, the last thing we want to be is an inconvenience."
3775,isfj,"Tell her to see a therapist, seriously. She's going to ruin all of her relationships if she keeps it up. Imagine how destroyed she'd be if Jake dated her, got to know her, and then decided to leave her. If I were you I'd show her Jordan Peterson videos, make her practice basic social skills. Toughen her up, she can't afford to have that be her norm, shes going to implode from normal life happenings. Maybe tell her to get a dog and to make sure to train it WELL. watching Youtube videos, not her own way; she'll turn that dog into a nervous yapping wreck if she does it herself."
3776,isfj,"As much as I enjoy being in relationships, I ultimately find myself liking who I am more when I am single. I tend to make too many concessions to see my partner happy, and I lose sight of who I am in the process. "
3777,isfj,"Sometimes I wonder if I’m doing too much for my partners and have to remind myself to take care of me, too. But I’m working on it, and I’m also finally being pushed to be more assertive and outspoken in my relationship (which is usually really tough for me), so that’s cool "
3778,isfj,yes I know what you mean. Its difficult to see yourself becoming enslaved to the affection of another person. Its like throwing quarters at a bottomless abyss hoping that one of the quarters will land and make your wishes come true. 
3779,isfj,How do you fix that? I was left a while back and this was their explanation. How can a person that loses sight of themselves in the relationship have a relationship? You tend to like yourself better when your single because of it does that mean you can't be in a relationship then?
3780,isfj,"Honestly, I haven't dated anyone in a year because I'm too busy progressing at my hobbies, improving the house, training my dog, etc. I think I have these problems because the other person isn't a good fit for me. Everyone has to compromise on how they spend their time in a relationship, and it gets harder when you don't have enough hobbies or quality time expectations in common.
For example, the last person I dated had a completely sedentary lifestyle who had indoor hobbies. I have physically active hobbies and love my pets and the outdoors. Although his personality was great, it slowly crept into this status quo that I resented. I started spending less time at the gym to be with him. Less time at my house because he was more comfortable at his. One day, I thought, wtf I am doing here with someone who wasn't willing to compromise to be in MY life? I'm not here to be placed in someone's girlfriend slot.
I learn a lot from these kind of experiences. I know next time, I'm not going to sacrifice who I am to make someone else happy. Also, I know I want someone who is equally as accommodating as I am. If you read about ISFJs, many of them tend to give too much and not receive much acknowledgment for their actions. If you find yourself dating someone like me, try to be empathetic and recognize they would like to be a receiver too, even if they're not vocal about it (and this can be said for everyone, not just me). Ask them questions to show that you are interested in their life. Plan dates that you know they will enjoy. Encourage their hobbies and try them out as well. Reciprocate!
Hope that helps! :-)"
3781,isfj,"She was my partner of 5 years lol. But you actually did help me a lot. Because i did exactly what you described. I would often ask her what she wanted and liked because all of our future plans or goals where always ""whatever you want to do"" and I never liked that. I didn't mind (and actually loved) that she wanted me to take the lead in issues because i have always had a dominant personality and it clashes a lot with partners i have had that are the same. But I didn't want to feel like i was dating myself, or with some sort of puppet with no opinions of her own. I wanted to incorporate her wants into my own and make ""new"" things together, but she never had any.
And i just realized she really didn't. In your case you saw your self giving up hobbies you liked and just end up doing the things he wants to do while slowly giving up your own. But in her case she had no hobbies or wants to give up or anything like that really. She was young when we first got together (i was her first partner) and most of her teenage life was spent helping her sister fight leukemia. She never really had any hobbies or goals or anything of the sort. I guess after the incident she realized that.
Thank you this was actually very helpful!"
3782,isfj,"I'm sorry. That must have been very hard for you. It sounds like she has never felt independent before or had cultivated a sense of self. You seem like a good partner, and I hope it all works out for you!"
3783,isfj,"Probably the most difficult thing that has ever happened to me lol. I felt she needed to ""find"" herself, I always wanted to be the one to show her those awesome things she might like. But I understood she needed to do it alone, she ""needed"" too, so she could cultivate a sense a self that wasn't mixed in with mine, just to find her own self. Now I understand the why a little more, thank you!"
3784,isfj,"Well i have pretty much always been an introvert. I used to spend lots of time alone because where i grew up there was zero kids on my block, just a lot of older people. About 6 years ago I decided to make a solid effort to hopefully find a girlfriend and make more friends in general. I have succeeded in making a lot more friends, I have a group of friends that I regularly hang out with on Saturday nights. I find it difficult to be alone sometimes. I still consider myself an introvert when it comes to groups of people and conversation, but I feel a little depressed now when I can't interact with people on a daily basis. I take college online which doesn't really help. So do you guys think I have changed? Or am I still an introvert that maybe appreciates people more now?"
3785,isfj,"I'd guess you've hit some comfort zones with you happen to be around at the time or places that bring out your E side a bit more.
For me personally, I can be a little more out-going around small groups of friends I know well, and at my place of employment I do just fine, even with people who are my polar opposites.  We tend to play our ""part"" in our current surrounding or situation and are a bit more versatile, which can make us difficult to ""type"" in the first place as we often say just what wants to be heard.
I'll go into my barber shop and I find myself ""changing my colors"" and my ""hey"" suddenly turns into ""hey yaaaallllllll"".  It does help the E come out a little more.
It's possible that you've built confidence for sure, but a change from a full blown I to a full blown E may be slightly unlikely.  I don't suspect a hermit in his own home for forty years often, even given enough time, will be running around on nude beaches."
3786,isfj,"Enfp here, we ride the border between I and E. I've spent loads of time sure I was one or the other so I'd say it's definitely possible. People can change over time especially when their conditions change. It might be worth taking the test again to see if there is a change."
3787,isfj,"Of all possible ""changes"" in type, switching from ISFJ to ESFJ is the most possible.  Other changes are incredibly difficult and are only accomplished through intense trauma or through extreme dedication.
All of these letters are short hand for what cognitive processes you prefer over the other possible options.  Your top two processes are introverted sensing (Si) and extroverted feeling (Fe).  Your amount of ""extrovertedness"" is simply a balance of those two functions.  Which one are you using more?  Maybe it used to be 30/70 and now its 50/50?
Ultimately, to me it sounds like you are still an introvert.  The key for me was 
And even after you say...
I think this just shows that you have learned to enjoy your Fe a little bit more now that you have people you are comfortable with.  You like using it some times.  
But that doesn't mean it is now more dominate."
3788,isfj,"Late to the party, but you REALLY shouldn't try to change from an introvert to an extrovert. There's no need for it. I'm sorry you think you have to be extroverted to do/have what you want: I'm an INTJ (so we're basically shut-in robots, a-la stereotypes) who has a girlfriend, a social life, plays in a band, and work in the Renaissance Faire for a few months out of the year. A lot of those things tire me socially (bar the girlfriend and sometimes the band) and I need to take a rest from them, but it doesn't change the fact that I can do that kind of stuff, and it doesn't change the fact that I love doing all of that. 
You can be social and still be an introvert- what YOU are, are shy. Get rid of the shyness. Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise. You want to get along with people? Learn (like most introverts have to, I guess) how to pretend to socialize. It's more or less easy (there's not much thought into it). As you socialize you'll find a few gems of people that you should stick with. Keep those. That doesn't mean you can't have alone time- alone time is AMAZING. Use it doing whatever. Reward yourself with it after socializing or something you want to get better at."
3789,isfj,"A lot has changed in those months after I posted that. I have truly embraced being an introvert. And I don't consider myself shy, I USED to be painfully shy in highschool and I worked hard at not being shy, but I am still an introvert. I don't start conversations and only speak when I have something of value to add. I met a girl a few years ago and she is one of my best friends now, because we totally have the same personality as each other. she is introverted but social as well..
I have a small group of friends and we hang out with each other 1-2 days a week. Don't have a GF yet but I did find an extremely cute introverted girl that I have a crush on. Unfortunately I think it is kinda difficult for 2 introverts to hook up. I asked her out and she said yes but her school keeps her out of state a lot and to me she doesn't seem overly excited to initiate anything.
I think you misread my post, or I didn't explain it well enough. I didn't want to change, I was just asking if it was possible. I didn't know you could be considered an introvert and still be social, which I am.  I still need time alone. I have a friend who always wants to do stuff with me because out where he lives not too many people live around him. So he has been off for a few weeks and I have done stuff with him nearly every other day. I had to make up an excuse not to hang out with him. I just needed time alone."
3790,isfj,"This kind of doesn't make sense.  P and J are not on a scale and are not things you can increase or decrease.  They are a statement on which of the middle two letters is extroverted.  Then the first letter tells you if your extroverted function is dominate.
So with ISFJ, we see that your two preferred functions are Sensing and Feeling.  Your judging function is extroverted (your J), but you prefer your introverted function (your I). 
This means that your primary mode of thinking is the introverted sensing function and extroverted feeling is your secondary function.  You use both of these together to take in data (the perceiving function) and then making choices about that data (the judging function)."
3791,isfj,"I don't really know how to explain this but whenever I go to places or school, I rarely actually meet someone who's into things I like or simply people with a similiar personality I can relate to. This is pretty much the main reason why I've got to know my best friends online.
What do you fellows ISFJs like to do or where do you like to go?"
3792,isfj,"i do things i like doing and happen to meet people there. when i talk to them i talk in a way that is natural to me and act in the same way. and if people click with how i talk and act then i hang out with them a little more than others. and eventually that can turn into a friendship. if the friendship keeps growing into a close friendship, then i make sure to upkeep it by hanging out every once in a while or calling them on the phone every few weeks or months. 
it's how i've met all my friends."
3793,isfj,"I'm not sure what other do, but I seek out clubs and groups to meet people. I met most of my friends in a fiction writing workshop, eastern music group, and a game playing group. I met one other isfj at that game group, so that's two! The rest were filled with mostly n and t types. But I feel so much kinship with infps so it's not a problem. "
3794,isfj,"I search for groups/clubs that cater to my interests. As a huge baseball/soccer fan, I've joined meetups to watch my favorite teams play. Its easier for me to open up with a group of people that I know beforehand have the same interest as I do."
3795,isfj,"I’m a ENFP and 2/4 of my best friends are ISFJs! They are both super sweet and caring and I know if I ever needed help they would do everything they could to help. They both are super smart and really hard workers (we are all in grade 12 and they are headed towards medical school and veterinary school respectively)
It took quite awhile for them to open up and they both tend to minimize their own problems and don’t like ‘burdening’ others with their issues even if the other person (me) wants to help them.
I was just curious to see if any ISFJs had any ENFP friends and what it was like becoming friends with them and just thoughts about ENFPs in general."
3796,isfj,"I have a close friend that is ENFP. She's great! She's honest and tries to be direct about things with me, which I value greatly. We kind of watch each other's back. She's thinking 5 years down the road, and I'm thinking of what to do now to get there. She values that about me, because it can be tough for her to achieve big goals.
It's tough to let her help me, but I've learned to let it go. If I don't let her help, I'll feel like I'm giving too much. Feels good to have someone take some of the burden. She's also good with helping me realize the flip side of things.
It's a nice balance."
3797,isfj,"My brother-in-law is an ENFP. I like being around him, but I find him a little bit intimidating at times, even though he's younger than me. He's very good at inspiring me to do new things and try new hobbies. I think he's a mess and shake my head at him good-naturedly all the time, but I love him."
3798,isfj,"My cousin is an ENFP. She's pretty cool and I love her excitement and general optimism about life. I definitely feel like I can talk to her about some things I'm going for and she'll try to emphasize and help me. She also tends to be very honest with me about things which I apperciate. She always tries to make time for her cousins by reaching out and scheduling events. She also values family strongly in that she would do anything for them which I really respect in her.  However, we do have very different personalities that can sometimes create conflicts. Where she tends to be spontaneous, not careful, and loud I'm the opposite in that I'm more quiet and low key. Also sometimes she can over rely on her Te and become super blunt which I can find a bit pushy and desperate. I really apperciate when her Si comes out and I think she enjoys it when my Ne comes out. Overall, though she's one of my favorite cousins and I wouldn't trade her for the world."
3799,isfj,"I had an ENFP as a best friend for a while. Unfortunately, we just weren't compatible. We for sure have different priorities, and I couldn't deal with how much she jumped from one activity to the next. I didn't feel like I knew who she was. I felt like I was boring her every time we had a conversation because I dont explore as many new things as she did, I enjoy the routine. Ultimately she just drifted from me. We'd have lovely long in depth conversations when we managed to hit on the right topic, though. That was what I loved most about her. "
3800,isfj,"I don't have any friends who I've typed as ENFP's, but what I can say is that I have loved most of the healthy ENFP's I've met!  The only ENFP's I don't like sometimes are the ""talk-nonstop"" type, but even they're still charming in their own way!  "
3801,isfj,"How does she help you pull out your Ne?  As INFP I feel like I irritate my friend's Ne to a gigantic extant.  She denied it for like 3 months but a couple days ago I caught her off gaurd and yep she admitted it.

3803,isfj,I don’t know if she really pulls it out but I do enjoy some of her Ne humor. I also admire it in her knowing that I suck at it. I try my best with it (it’s just hard to use since it’s so unconscious for us). 
3804,isfj,"My interpretation - your Ne is the inferior function so it is just naturally engaged by being around an Ne Dom. It's not like she pulls it out of you, you just get atuned to the Ne and the fact that theirs is Dom and can do most of the work allows your Ne to feel comfortable coming out as well and exploring safely "
3805,isfj,"A few years ago I asked for advice on here about an ISFJ friend of mine who grew more and more toxic and keep pushing me away. I met up with her yesterday and it was great. She had changed drastically and apologized for how she had pushed me away and for her toxic behavior. 
She is trying to be more open and forgiving to others and to not let a judgmental mindset dictate her day to day life. and she wishes to reconnect and be friends again. I was worried about her for so long and can finally feel relief that she was able to pull herself out of her downward spiral and that she found a path to be happy and accepting of herself and others.
I am so unbelievably happy about this and just wanted to share this with someone without it being like gossiping to other people in my life. 
old post from way before about this: https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/3p473m/im_an_isfj_and_i_need_help_with_another_isfj/"
3806,isfj,"My mom is an ISFJ I've tried to learn how to appreciate and love her very much but there are some draw backs.. I am an INFJ and her and I are WORLDS apart. I like philosophy, reading, logically analyzing EVERYTHING to the best of my ability, psychology, and I ABSOLUTELY eat up knowledge. She's slowly realizing that I'm okay and good as I am. I definitely don't feel like the daughter she wanted.
I spend most of my time in my head and I will peak out at the world every now and then but everytime I do with her it's difficult. Being around her takes EXTREME amounts of work and effort. I love discussing things but she doesn't find the things I do interesting. She's not logical on ANY level but she always thinks she knows what she's talking about. She's very emotional and has our best interests at heart but it's so HARD to interact with her. She turns herself in circles with any sort of reasoning and I don't know where to begin. 
She doesn't know how to adapt a little to me and doesn't understand that she isn't adapting. She is just soaking up my energy. I always have to mirror her behavior to be around her. I don't want to always do that. Can't I be myself?
HELP!"
3807,isfj,"me and my mother are both ISFJ and i have the same problem with her. the best way i have to deal with it is to stop expecting certain things from her. 
1) understand that she isn't logical and that expecting her to be logical when she isn't doesn't make sense. 
2) understand that it's ok that i (as her offspring) am more logical and reasonable than she is and that's ok as well because we were exposed to different life experiences. This was a hard expectation to realize because it was a weird transition from being the kid to being the mature person for me.
i have a friend with a toddler that just recently informed his mother that the dog doesn't have horns. he was so surprised by that fact. and she's understandable of her kid saying adorable but clearly wrong and dumb things. the kid hasn't learned certain things yet. and neither has our mothers. so when she starts saying her stuff, imagine an adorable jabbering toddler.
i also want to say that i'm sorry she doesn't show interest in your interests. that sucks. it's also a problem i have with my mother. i've stop expecting that from her as well. "
3808,isfj,"My mom is an ISFJ too. I definitely recognize your struggle. I've always been her 'mother' instead of the other way around. Even when I was a kid or teenager, she couldn't follow my thoughts and interests. For example: I lent her money, said they should search for help and everything. (Financial problems.) I was just almost more responsible and the 'wisest' one. Saw the outcome of things faster, connecting the dots and stuff like that. 
She loves me, but is also very self centered. I don't see her very often, since that sucks energy so much. I love her too though. It's still my mother and sometimes I can see she really tries. She often calls me when she has trouble, but never really listens to me. 
I recommend try to accept that you two are worlds apart. Do something together instead of talking. Play a board game for example. My mom has a total different IQ, maybe that is different between you two too. She is way more superficial and focused how she comes over on the outer world. 
Fun thing: my friend is an ISFJ too, but I could get along with him right from the start. We have deep conversations also. He can't always follow me through the end, but is always very patient and tries. He was once (first time) typed in the test as INTP. So maybe that is the difference. But since that one time always tested as ISFJ. "
3809,isfj,"Thank you SO much! This helps a lot. I'm always trying to help her along and expose her to more but she shuts down. It always takes me by surprise because everyone is normally receptive to me. She'll listen to things about social media and music and friends. (don't think about those/I keep my friends in my head) I thought she hated my guts because she listened to my other sisters.
When it came my turn she'd brush it off. Until I realized that I'm just interested in more intellectual things! I'm glad you could answer that question for me because as soon I realized that was the case, I was LOST. It's also weird because my sister who is 2 years younger (also ISFJ) gets along with me more than she gets along with anyone and it's because I am so gentle and understanding with her. When I talk about deep stuff she kinda just nods along but always confides with me. It's the same trying to get on topic with her. Because you said that now I'm realizing why she won't get ""close"" with me. NEITHER OF THEM DEFINE CLOSE THE WAY I DO. 
Neither of them understand my relationships either. I do the whole ""happy with silence but speak and share facts/poems/stories."" MY WHOLE WORLD JUST STARTED TO MAKE SENSE
They just don't like new things. They don't like being corrected by facts, hearing about theories, don't have the ability to think beyond a certain point and I can't help them.
I would be sad if I were them. They are missing so much. They just don't have those experiences and they have to get them themselves. "
3810,isfj,I agree with this. Normally I just sit and listen to her talk. She doesn't think to deep so I will share about my day/converse about my sisters/talk about random useless stuff and she is happy. My little sister is an ISFJ but she has tested as an ENFJ so I can get deep with her and she listens and follows and tries. 
3811,isfj,"Hello,
Can you give examples of situations in everyday activities when the combination Sí - Fe is very useful and examples when it can create issues?
I'm thinking of common situations like driving to work, buying lunch, doing house chores etc"
3812,isfj,"I think of Si as taking in the present and comparing it to past experiences and Fe as group harmony. 
So a positive example would be, ISFJ has a slice of cake and enjoys it, then recalls having cake in the office and how much everyone enjoyed it, so to make everyone feel good, ISFJ brings in cake.
Negative would be, ISFJ is working on a proposal and recalls the last proposal being submitted late and how stressed and upset everyone in the office was, so ISFJ takes extra time, effort, energy to ensure it is done, so that no one is stressed by it.  I think those are two decent examples."
3813,isfj,"Si-Fe makes us great gift givers. We know people well and remember a lot about them, and we know how to make people happy. Seriously, I win Christmas every single year.
The biggest negative it ever caused me is its ability to hide things under the rug, things that should be said and dealt with. Si leads us to remember how painful a past experience was, and Fe allows us to smile and pretend that nothing is wrong. I'm willing to bet that a lot of Fe users are actually quite depressed and anxious, even though they put up a brave face to the world. And the source of that anxiety / depression is probably something that happened before that really hurt."
3814,isfj,"These are my two weakest functions, but by observing an ISFJ friend I think it would be the absolute best for family events planning.
Negative would probably be public speaking like in a university assignment about something technical, maybe?"
3815,isfj,"Thanks, those are good examples.
So, looking at the first example, since ISFJ usually has a well developed Si, it would have a high standard for what a good cake should taste like. It is sensitive to smell / taste and can recall past positive experiences which both are great in this situation. 
When giving the cake to the co-workers, everyone enjoys the delightful cake and the group harmony is at its best. 
I hope I made an accurate analysis. "
3816,isfj,"Things that ISFJ hide under the rug, what might those be. Are they linked to the sensitive Si sensors like smell, taste or are they more memories of any past situation that was an issue?
For example, if something is messy (affecting Si) and needs cleaning, could it become an issue eventually leading to anxiety if not dealt with?
Another example, let's say that you dislike driving in the dark (since you had an bad experience with it as a child). You are in the car with a friend, who is driving, it's getting late and your friend is getting tired and wants you to drive. Would it be a situation where you accept driving even though you really don't want to? "
3817,isfj,"I can't speak for other ISFJs, but I love public speaking. Fe is the ultimate public speaking function, after all. Fe helps you successfully read a crowd or any social situation, really. I can see how most other functions could easily be irritated by public speaking."
3818,isfj,"I mean, those are pretty mild examples. I mean like having a mental illness brought on by your memories of bad experiences in the past and not reaching out to the people in your life for help. That's Fe, not wanting to burden others.
It could be caused by anything. A relationship that left you heartbroken. Parents that didn't love you or abused you. Maybe just a single instance of someone insulting you. It is exceptionally hard for an Si-dom to forget strong emotional situations. I can still remember hurtful things said to me in middle school and still have some emotions tied to those memories. That's just part of the Si experience."
3819,isfj,"I deserve the same kindness I give to others. 
I deserve to forgive myself as easily as I forgive others. 
I should not judge myself harshly when I do not judge others at all. 
I deserve to worry less about the future and focus more on the present. 
I should give the same patience to myself as I give to others. 
I deserve to treat myself as well as I treat anyone else... 
I have had so much stress lately, and multiple people tell me that I am too hard on myself and I need to be as kind to myself as I am to others... Has anyone else had luck with this? I understand that the people who have told me (boyfriend, step-dad, mom) truly mean it, but I do not know how to. And I know how nice and kind I am to others (not to brag) but I have always been so cruel to myself... How do you go about appreciating your own worth and being kind to yourself? "
3820,isfj,"I understand what you are going through, and I think quite a few of us on here are the same way. At least I now I am. Now, I'm not going to say I am always kind to myself, I'm very critical of myself. Something I like to do when I get frustrated with myself is write in my journal, just take some time out of the day and write. Now, after I am done writing I will go back and read through everything I just wrote, usually I will realize that I am getting worked up over silly little things. What works for me might not work for you, and I still am very critical of myself but it does help :)"
3821,isfj,"I think it's in our nature as ISFJs to have lofty goals for ourselves and feel disappointed and ashamed if we fall short.  One thing I've been practicing is allowing myself to treat slip-ups as learning experiences on the journey toward the ultimate goal rather than as failures.  When you widen the timeline for a goal, you give yourself more chances to succeed - and ultimately, to reevaluate what constitutes success.  I have a broader definition for the word than I used to."
3822,isfj,"I'm hoping since we would have similar blind spots, we can help/encourage each other through this. I'm very new to feeling resonance with this personality type and feel a bit overwhelmed after reading up on some of the pitfalls we are most prone to. I feel kinda dumb that I lived for 38 years without being aware of all this. I think it will be nice to just write out all the things we need to work on and have a group of people in the same boat as a support group!"
3823,isfj,"One of my biggest weaknesses is not being able to express my feelings/opinions if I suspect it could lead to a ""conflictive"" situation.
I also have issues when evaluating my self worth, for example when it comes to my value as an employee. Sometimes I don't value my own achievements the same way I would value others'.
The good thing is that being aware of my weaknesses really helps when trying to solve them.. But sometimes it's not easy and I cut myself some slack.. :P"
3824,isfj,"I feel like my biggest blind spot is other people haha... I always feel like I'm very self-centered, honestly. I'm trying to learn to be better, but a lot of the things that seem to come naturally to other people (or the kind of other people I admire, at least) are things that would never occur to me. The way they check in with others, finding gifts for people, reaching out so easily.... 
It feels really shameful to admit, but I just don't think about other people that way. When I look at an item I think about what I think about it, if I like it, not who else in my life might. When I see other people, I think about how I feel, what I want to tell them. It's really hard for me to get in other people's heads and think about what I could be giving to improve their lives as opposed to the kind of relationship I want with them or how I want them to perceive me. 
I dunno, that might just be a me thing as opposed to an ISFJ thing, but I'm curious if anyone else relates to that feeling. I don't think I usually behave selfishly, but I think selfishly. "
3825,isfj,"One of my big weaknesses that I've been trying to work on is being more assertive about my needs. As an ISFJ, I have this feeling like it's my duty to sacrifice my wellbeing for the good of others. This isn't necessarily a bad urge to have, but in some situations it's totally unreasonable to act on it.
For example: if my work partner asks me to take over a project for him, my first inclination is to say yes, even if I am completely overloaded with projects of my own. I also have a friend who will message me at all hours of the day asking me to help her write college papers, and I always feel obligated to help her, even if it's extremely inconvenient for me. She often tries to make me feel guilt for not helping her (in a passive-aggressive sort of way), so in the past I usually caved and helped her.
It's good for ISFJs to remember that some people do, in fact, try to take advantage of our generosity, and it's totally ok to say no to these people!"
3826,isfj,"My post reminds me of this from the book The True ISFJ by Truity:
""Under the calm exterior of an ISFJ there will often lay a bubbling cauldron of disapproval and discontent.""
So other personality types are not like this? It's something specific to us? I would definitely agree that I'm my own worst critic and a very tough one at that. This is one of my biggest challenges and goes along with the perfectionist in us."
3827,isfj,"Thinking out of the box and being creative when it is needed.  
Isfjs tend to be a victim of their own mind  due to their lack of innovative ideas to fight their mental demons and win them quickly. "
3828,isfj,"From An Essential Guide for the ISFJ Personality by Sandy Peterson:
""The ISFJ sibling, friend, colleague, or lover often won’t say how he really feels about certain issues. They repress their feelings or don’t show their emotions because they are very private people. They keep their reaction to themselves and are never vocal about it. As a result, the ISFJs can become stressed, and their inability to express their emotions freely could affect their mental and emotional health.""
From personalitypage.com:
""They are truly warm and kind-hearted, and want to believe the best of people. They value harmony and cooperation, and are likely to be very sensitive to other people's feelings. People value the ISFJ for their consideration and awareness, and their ability to bring out the best in others by their firm desire to believe the best.""
""More so than other types, ISFJs are extremely aware of their own internal feelings, as well as other people's feelings. They do not usually express their own feelings, keeping things inside. If they are negative feelings, they may build up inside the ISFJ until they turn into firm judgments against individuals which are difficult to unseed, once set. Many ISFJs learn to express themselves, and find outlets for their powerful emotions.""
We take more care of others than our own selves. I didn't realize how dismissive I've been of how I feel."
3829,isfj,"This page 
http://www.personalitypage.com/html/ISFJ_per.html 
sheds some light on this, although I'm still working on understanding this  blind spot of ""other people"" better. I think it's related to being unable to care for our own feelings and being so giving to others, and when we don't get the same in return, this is kind of our way of shutting down and healing for ourselves. "
3830,isfj,"Even knowing that a discussion can be calmed and productive for both parts it still causes me some stress. I have some hypothesis why:


I am not quite comfortable being in the focus of attention and in a discussion people usually is very attentive to what you have to say to refute it or not.


That makes me anxious because I want to express myself in a clear and assertive manner but normally I am too emotional (I can easily cry if I am distressed or angry) or my thoughts come out in a disorganized way. Then it comes the shame of sounding stupid. 


I think I worry too much for what others think of me and I don't want to have a bad relationship with anyone. In my mind,  a discussion/conflict can lead to that situation more easily.


I know it's not a healthy way to deal with it. Normally avoiding conflict leads to finally having a bigger unspoken issue that explodes and make my fears come true haha. I am working on that though"
3831,isfj,"Idk, which is why I wondered at the end if it's an ISFJ thing or a me thing. It could be related to being Si-dom I guess, since we filter everything through our own knowledge and experience first and foremost, but it could also just be unrelated to type. Hard to say. "
3832,isfj,"I am asking because for me it is the fear of public shame/humiliation, and rude people seem rub it in a lot more and make you, at the end, feel bad about yourself and question my abilities. i can't really relate to just not wanting conflict for the sake of disliking conflict, if you get what i'm saying. it's more a ""me"" problem than a ""they"" problem"
3833,isfj,"oh shit you did. i missed the shame part. i have terrible attention to detail 
when I think someone hates being the center of attention...idk in my mind perhaps it's like me- like they wouldn't mind it if they were more confident in themselves, but actually the social phobia-ness is what prevents that desire. OR literally there are people who don't have any sort of social anxiety, they just don't care for attention and prefer it simply because they find it shallow (or something else). I usually take it more literally like in my second sentence to avoid being short-sighted and solipsistic, so I tend to assume in my head that it's nothing like how I am lol (hope this makes sense)"
3834,isfj,"Would love to hear from any ISFJ attorneys that enjoy their job and find it to be a good fit. Currently working at a law firm as a corporate/M&A associate and, for a number for reasons (unpredictable assignments/hours/expectations, irrational business folks) have realized this isn’t for me long term. Am wondering if there are any ISFJs out there that have found satisfying attorney work outside of a law firm setting!"
3835,isfj,"I’m an attorney working in a corporate law firm practicing in electronic discovery and information governance. I quite like it as there is a project management aspect and I get to work closely with others using my people skills. In my previous job I was practicing civil litigation and I really disliked it. Being in court was really stressful for me because the situations were so confrontational and oppositional. 
I would say that in a few years I may want to consider leaving the firm and hopefully practicing in house. The pressure to docket as many hours as possible and the difficult partners can get really stressful at times. I think there have been moments where I’ve thought that I was not cut out to be an attorney, especially as an ISFJ who doesn’t like confrontation. However, I’ve found a niche area that I quite enjoy that will keep me going at least for the next few years at my firm. "
3836,isfj,"My sister is an ISFJ attorney who is no longer practicing law--she has moved into administrative work at a school. 
However, while she was practicing, she worked in estates and trusts, which struck me as a very ISFJ-friendly field within law."
3837,isfj,Thanks for sharing! I think I’d like my job a little more if it were more team-oriented (as you describe above). I’ve had the same thought about in-house but wonder if the pressure of demands from business partners (which would likely be unpredictable) and having to cover a broad area of issues where I’m not an expert would be problematic. Thanks again!
3838,isfj,"I think if you work in-house for a big corporation there would be a fairly sizeable legal department. You probably would have other attorneys to support you if there was an issue outside your expertise. 
Have you considered working for the government? I have some classmates that went that route and enjoy it. I think the culture is better and the hours are more 9-5. Might be a bit of a pay cut though. "
3839,isfj,"Hi everyone.  I was having a pretty nice day, seeing someone improvement in myself over a week, and the day ended badly because of a specific event, and i was bummed, but when I when i stumbled upon this subreddit, i was so happy to meet more people like me, and more importantly, more ISFJs since i don't know any others in person.  Hope you all enjoyed this video."
3840,isfj,"Oh cool CelebrityTypes made videos of some types. I like all the animations and pictures. I hope they make videos of the other types sooner.
The descriptions they had and pointing out things that people may not know like how much we our inner impressions are matter a lot.
Getting lots of satisfaction that I was able to help and see someone grow is something I really like a lot.
Paints ISFJs in a very very positive light.
Thanks for the post."
3841,isfj,"A common thing about ISFJs is that we have very few real close friends but we get very attached to those.
That said, do you also tend to have a lot of acquaintances or people that you are in good terms with and can have small conversations when you meet (whether online or in real life?)
I only have a small group of really close friends but I feel like I have a lot of acquaintances whether it's through facebook or random other online forums."
3842,isfj,"Yes, this is definitely true for me.
I have a few people in my life that I value tremendously, and I can really open up to them. It's a small circle, but they're very important to me.
On the flip side, I have a fairly large pool of people I'm friendly with, but I'm not very close to them. I enjoy hanging out with them, but it's more shallow and distant, and while I enjoy their company, I don't really go into anything deep with them, and most of them could probably fade out of my life and I wouldn't be particularly upset."
3843,isfj,"Yup, definitely true for me. I have a ton of acquaintances. And with most of them when we get together it feels like we're close friends. Then I have maybe one friend who I'm incredibly close with and am always talking to."
3844,isfj,"I'm kind of the opposite. I have a small group of 7 people who I interact somewhat regularly with and think of as friends, but no real close friends. Outside of those 7 people I really don't have anyone."
3845,isfj,"Does anyone else find themselves feeling guilty a lot?  I hate remembering things I've done that were wrong, but it seems like that's what I spend a lot of my time doing.  I sometimes wish that my morals weren't so strong... can any other ISFJ's relate?"
3846,isfj,"It took me years to come to terms with the fact there are friendships I had in my life that ended and it wasnt entirely 100% my fault.
Feeling guilty about something every day is the norm for me, but most of the guilt is personal and I think that's easier to handle than guilt involving other people."
3847,isfj,Every time I read some meme articles about mbti types and neurotism it always indicate that ISFJ is on the bottom of being neurotic which it makes me thing. I always score high on neurotism in another meme tests like Big Five. So what is the truth then? ISFJ is full of bad emotions due to 6th position Fi or not??
3848,isfj,"Actually introversion and neuroticism seem to be positively correlated ... as extroversion and happiness seem to be positively correlated. 
(I'm not making any claims about causes here ;)
...so you can certainly be a neurotic ISFJ ...
...but it also doesn't mean you MUST be one. 
​
I wouldn't trust the meme articles, they're more fun than factual. Also,
I don't think this is true at all. You can be an ISFJ that has strong negative emotions frequently, or you can be an ISFJ that doesn't, depending on a lot of environmental factors and hereditary brain chemistry."
3849,isfj,I score low neuroticism. The 6th function is called the critical parent in Beebe's model. I think how my Fi critic works is wanna to be authentic in the harmony created via Fe. That critical parent function can come out during times when I wasn't creating true harmony and being fake. I think that can lead to these bad emotions.
3850,isfj,"Aka one of our complete opposites, both in terms of functions and being extroverted as opposed to introverted
ENTJs can be harsh and honest with their words but ultimatley they mean well (especially if they're 'healthy ones')
The only real experience I have with one is an online friend I voice chat with often. We have similar views on things so we get along pretty well and I think he actually respects ISFJ types well."
3851,isfj,"ENTJ chiming in.  
An ISFJ female was highly interested in me and I was on the cusp of being interested so we did a couple friendly coffee gatherings amongst hanging out in a larger group.  In the end I walked away.  
Why?
1) Wouldn't be 100% honest with me
2) Played games to figure out my feelings
3) Shit tested me (don't shit test ENTJs)
4) Would ask my friends what topics to talk to me about (just ask me, no?)
5) Would act disingenuously uninterested to get a reaction
6) Would try to get me jealous by talking up interests of other men 
That's my experience.  In the end there's nothing I could relate to with her.  Her feelings dominated her thoughts, and logic took the last backseat in a minivan.
I think we, ENTJs and ISFJs, could be a match but we're dominating and brutal with our opinions and thoughts.  We never mean harm or disrespect.  Time is precious don't waste it on useless niceties.  Be honest with us and you'll have us at hello.  "
3852,isfj,"Maybe... But I don't think about it enough to think about it like that. I'll compliment somebody genuinely on their achievements if it's something they are proud of. If somebody is complaining, however, I have a hard time being genuine with my sympathies. Usually I feel like people are complaining about something they have the power to change so I don't understand why they complain instead of fixing their problem. "
3853,isfj,"Not generally. If someone did something well I normally do tell them great job etc etc. If I see them bragging about their own accomplishments I'm more likely to downplay what they did, tho. So I don't mind heaping on the praises to other people as long as they aren't being dramatic and begging for praise/attention. "
3854,isfj,"Constantly and with (unintentional) enthusiasm.
If ever praised for anything even if I'm not consciously like ""oh god no, don't even"" I will speak negatively regarding the trait they're praising.
""Wow that drawing is so beautiful, you should have an etsy shop"".
my response: oh gosh, that seems like a lot of effort, and I doubt anyone would even shop there. It's quite an intimidating process.
what my response should have been: Oh! Thank you so much! I'm always so worried some some going to think I'm egotistical :s"
3855,isfj,"I have a problem. As an INTP, I often go straight from Ne to Si. Because of this, I have trouble taking action like an SP. Ne is what I like to call the ""in a sec"" function for NPs. Si is what I like to call the ""just in case"" function for INPs. They're often either future-oriented or past-oriented and become increasingly more in their head. NPs can take action, but they're often just chasing reward. When they try to jump into a cold shower, there's a mental barrier in the way. At best, they'll ease themselves into it.
SPs manage to take action easily. They're present-oriented. When I say ""present-oriented"", I'm not referring to the limiting of future and past-orientedness. The present is its own thing just as the past and future are. When you're in the present, you're IN the present.
When Se is being used, it's as if they're immersed in the extroverted world in the present, immersed in sensations. They see the black and & white, not what's going on behind the scenes or the inner workings.
I once activated my Se. The mental barrier was virtually non-existent. I reacted MUCH faster. I'd set my intention and do it. I was IN the moment. It's as if I was looking at the external world outside of my head as if I, as opposed to being in my head, was in the extroverted world IN the present. The book I had been wanting to read but haven't touched in months was easily picked up with virtually no mental resistance.
I've tried getting ISTPs and ISFPs to explain how to enter this state of mind, but I think there was a communication barrier. They were having trouble articulating with precision. They explained it but in an Se way which isn't informative enough for me. I'm not sure how ESXPs will be of much more help.
How can I get through this communication barrier?"
3856,isfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/esfj] ""Doers"" VS. ""Thinkers""; ""SPs"" vs. ""NPs""

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
3857,isfj,"The more and more ISFJ's I talk to the more I'm sensing that the MB profile is very shallow, only describing the hospitality and openness of ISFJ's. 
How do you think you differ from your type description?"
3858,isfj,"INFPs are an interesting bunch from the ones I experiences. The nice ones are REALLY nice, sometimes nicer than I'll ever be.
However there are some that are very very passionate about what they believe in. Sometimes I feel like the way the argue or say things in a surprisingly condescending or negative tone unknowingly causes unnecessary stress or they just don't care. "
3859,isfj,"The woman I have a crush on is an INFP. She definitely has some very strong beliefs, but they line up with mine, so I'm all for them. She's very kind and I feel very natural around her. I don't have to feel like I'm walking on eggshells or have to watch what I say. 
She straight up asked me how I felt about her, which really surprised me, but it was great. She's a no-nonsense kind of person and I find that refreshing. I'm often too reserved and afraid to say what I really want to say. With her, I know she doesn't like hiding my thoughts, so I say what's on my mind and she accepts it. We're not together because we'd prefer to wait until we're ready, but I could see her and I being able to strengthen one another. She claims she's too blunt, so maybe I could help her with that, while I need to speak my mind more, and she can help me. "
3860,isfj,"They'll do the condescending/negative thing when Fi triggered and when they can't communicate any more honestly than inf Te passive-aggressiveness.
Most of them don't seem usually in ego mode like that though"
3861,isfj,"Hey guys I'm your exact opposite ENTP, and I have recently fallen for an ISFJ. What should I do to get her attention? I read somewhere that my NT is too critical and I may not be sensitive enough so how do I best not step on your toes? And what humor makes you laugh?"
3862,isfj,"I've been with an ISFJ for the better part of 10 years and we are getting married soon. We never fight, though I enjoy debating I debate for the intellectual stimulation of it. I have no need to always be right. she and I don't fight and we worked well long before we knew about these personality frameworks.
She is great at the things I'm not. I'm great at the things shes not. When I forget the little things shes there for me. Our relationship is easy to be in, we are like puzzle pieces that fit together.
We are more fluid than the categories we are placed in. Two people of the same combination may not work. But we are both attentive and emotionally intelligent. Just because its not the first thing I consider doesn't mean I completely blind to it. We also just so happen to agree on most things in the first place anyway. The only thing that I have basically logiced out for her in recent memory was why it was fine to put a backpack on the table as opposed to in a chair at that table.
Thats it, something that minor. We make life changing decisions together where we basically agree in the first place so it's very easy that way. This is of course hit and miss with any given couple. As far as being sensitive enough its honestly simple. You as an ENTP are supposed to be able to intuitively size up people right, and usually in seconds. Imagine if you've known that person for years. I can always tell how she feels and I consider my actions accordingly. We aren't super complicated. when she's feeling down I'll cook her some food and we'll spend some extra time hanging out that night and I'll talk to her about her and all the things that come up. We'll watch one of our favorite shows or even just read and say nothing at all. Just being right there is all it takes sometimes. I get to learn more about her every day and the little things in her life she doesn't usually get the chance to talk about. Don't we all like to be listen to regardless of personality? You're ENTP, not autistic (I don't know maybe you are I didn't ask), just be a person and if it works it works if it doesn't it doesn't"
3863,isfj,"Dude, I married an ISFJ long before we knew about mbti and it's actually quite a lot of hard work. I'm just so abrasive and she HATES debating. My world view and approach to problem solving are so radically different, that it's a constant battle to not upset the her (and for me to not get frustrated). My honest opinion, is that unless she is ""The one worth sacrificing for"" it may be best to move past it. She might be your perfect counterweight in all the right places, but your personality type will most likely cause her distress while she gains nothing. Basically, you need her structure and sensitivity; but she may be better off without you."
3864,isfj,"Well, ISFJs are definitely more sensitive than ENTPs but even then, we all have different levels of it. Some of us are extremely sensitive while others can handle criticism, etc better (something I'm trying to work on). It's best to just try to avoid saying anything that could come across as offensive, and not being critical about anything she likes- at least until you know her better, and how she handles these things.
I, personally, laugh at all types of humor. Puns and dad jokes are high up there, even though I pretend to be annoyed at all the ones my INTJ boyfriend keeps making... Of course, all ISFJs have different opinions on humor.
As for getting her attention, try just talking to her and show her respect. Don't speak over her. Be nice. Try not to debate or ""argue"" with her beliefs or opinions (you might not see it as arguing, but we usually take it that way and it causes us a lot of stress and she may feel like you don't respect her opinion/beliefs. A bit stupid of us to assume that, now that I think about it- but we can't help how we feel. And we feel A LOT). 
Like someone else said, it will be hard work and your personality type may distress her (I can't see myself dating a stereotypical ENTP without going crazy) but I think any two personality types can work. There's pros and cons with each. You probably will spend most of the time walking on egg shells if she is one of the more sensitive ISFJs. But it's worth a try. If she ends up liking you back, she'll put in a lot of effort to keep the relationship. We like to mate for life. So if you're only in it for short term, it's best to just let this one go. If not then I say go for it!
Good luck!"
3865,isfj,"Me and my friends joke about some messed up stuff, but I'm a guy so I sort of don't apply here. The scale can go to either side of easily offended or easily humored. 
For a tip, we generally like having a fair say in things rather than being ignored, so listen to her closely. You'll know the best course of action from there on what to possibly do. If you want to try something new with her, tell her about it, surprises generally don't go over too well with me (it might apply to other ISFJ's as well)."
3866,isfj,"Attention wise -- Speak to her first. Put yourself out there, because at least for me I hate to feel like I am imposing on someone/bothering them. I also am not great at opening up to people, so I can make a lot of smalltalk but it doesn't lead anywhere often.
I am very sensitive. I take things way too personally. Try to understand her feelings and don't negate her emotions. My current boyfriend has to constantly remind me ""it is okay to feel how you feel."" Try not to be overly critical -- if she says something you know to be incorrect, don't just be like ""Uh, you're wrong."" Break it to her very gently lol.
Humor -- I actually really like inappropriate humor. Someone says ""Oh wow, that's a big hotdog"" I will turn to my boyfriend and do the look like ""haha dick"" and then snicker. I'm not into knock knock jokes or that type of thing really, more like the unexpected humor of things that weren't meant to be funny."
3867,isfj,"I am in the exact same boat as OP, this thread is great!  Thanks for everyone's answers.
Any specific advice I can steal from y'all?  Me and my girlfriend will be long distance (1100 miles) until this fall.  Anything you think I can do to keep us going strong would be greatly appreciated :D"
3868,isfj,"My boyfriend is an INTJ as well, and loves puns/dad jokes. I'll usually be like ""...oh my god"" but then laugh at his jokes... Also I agree with the other stuff you said.
In terms of debate -- My boyfriend has told me that is just something he enjoys and I'm like ""how do you enjoy this?"" but he will actually ask before starting a ""debate"" with me and he says he likes it because it's not an argument per se, he just likes hearing my opinions/how I think about things. One example debate was a discussion over how I thought the amount of money professional athletes get paid is super ridiculous and we spent about 30 minutes talking about it before I had to tell him I was just exhausted."
3869,isfj,"Oh my goodness! That's why my SO hates my dad jokes/puns? Seriously though, I'm one dumb INTJ and do you ISFJs really dislike the dad jokes that much? Do you also hate the debates that much? They're so stimulating!? Also is there anything you wish your SO knew/understood better about you? "
3870,isfj,"Tl;dr: she said it'd be better for the both of us if in the long run if we end the friendship; that it's not about incompatibility, it's about being separate individuals. I'm a sensitive, needy and attached ISFJ and she's this cold independent INTP. Some time ago, she said I'm still free to message if I really need her because I'll always be a friend to her (and she knows I have very, very, very few friends), but at the same time also told my other best friend to dissuade me from reconnecting and patching things up with her (...the hell though?)
I still feel so fucking frustrated and sad about it. I liked her a lot, I really did. And she's the second person I ever truly let inside my core. I thought I'd moved on, but... shit. Sometimes when I think about her, all I could feel is anger and frustration. But, there's always that ""I still want you back, I still want things to go back the way it used to be"" feeling in me. I'm still hoping for it. Shit hurts."
3871,isfj,"It takes time. It honestly takes a lot of time. Time doesn't always heal but it makes things a bit easier to deal with. 
I know how it feels cause I went through something similar with a long time friend ages ago. The situation was a little different but, i know the feeling. I cried a lot. Many many many months. The remembering and processing sucks, I think especially cause we're ISFJ's and when we get attached and let someone in, it hurts like a mofo letting go. Be it for the best or the worst. 
What I suggest is to give it time and go through the motions. Especially focus on yourself. Do things that make you happy and hobbies that your passionate and and you want to pick up. Go out for little walks with music or something to clear your mind. 
Focus on you right now. There are so many people out there that you can make amazing friendships with. Healthy and wonderful friendships. Who want to be in your life and care about you. Only until the past year I've met friends that feel like that and damn does it make a difference. 
But I tell you, it hurts now and it may even later. But soon it will only be a memory. Just a memory to be left in the past. "
3872,isfj,"I’m in the same situation, my friend ended it all two weeks ago. I’m doing well at the moment but it’s still in my mind daily. I get so attached to people and it’s so goddamn hard to let go of anyone, even if they weren’t worth my time... "
3873,isfj,"I used to really take criticism hard...then I went through art school. I think the biggest thing for me was figuring out how to use the criticism. I look for any way I can to improve on what's being put down. Of course, I still take it personally sometimes, but I use that offended(ish) feeling as motivation to do better."
3874,isfj,"I am having to work through this myself, over the last year I've been working on taking things less personally. I've had to kind of almost train myself to think before reacting. I think about the criticism (or anything else that upsets me for that matter, rude people, an odd tone a friend uses, etc), and first think about where it is coming from. 
Is it true that it is something I need to work on? If so, I'm good at beating myself up, so I have to tell myself that it's okay, and that I should be thankful that they pointed it out so I can work harder on it (even though it sucks to be confronted with something like that).
If i think it is coming from a place without good intentions, like someone being hard on me for something that isn't true, or just trying to get under my skin, I have to make myself realize that it's not me, it's about them. They are having a bad day, or going through something personal that is causing them to want to be a dick for no other reason.
It's taken months to develop the mindfulness to remember to think before reacting, but it's made a huge difference in my life and relationships. "
3875,isfj,"I am really bad at taking it personally. I have some ni-dom friends though and they are helping me realize that even if I think what they said was ""mean"" (because they don't always phrase things super tactfully) they are only trying to help because they are my friends and would not want to upset me. Some people are just able to give and get constructive criticism really well. I am not one of them but if I can see their motive for giving it (aka to help me) then I try to get over my hurt feelings.
However if it is someone I do not know giving me criticism it is much more difficult to accept. Someone the other day told me ""you should have done this instead of that blah blah"" and I thought in my head ""whatever"" but if they had instead phrased it ""have you ever considered trying x instead of y? I heard it works really well"" I would have been much more open to the suggestion. Same thing being said to me more or less, but the latter I can accept much more easily."
3876,isfj,"Well, first of all, for me it depends on who is criticizing me. A lot of people that might criticize me, are people that I don't really care about their opinions, but I still feel like they could be right, which is how I try to learn from it. I kind of just make all criticism into a joke as well. 
""Honestly, you should care more about your appearance""
""Why? Are you into me or something?""
""You're a fucking weirdo""
""But I'm your weirdo""
""Gay""
""For you""
I dont know this was a really bad example, but you get the point, or at least, I hope so"
3877,isfj,"Very very few people's criticisms of me bother me. However this is the 37-year-old me talking. When I was younger, I was very bothered by criticism and tried to ""fix"" their perception of me. And it was only people who I felt ""should"" support me (my mother in law, best friends) that it bothered me. I've had to slowly develop a ""Who cares about what people think."" attitude otherwise it would eat me alive. I had a really difficult time with my mother in law as she criticizes EVERYONE. I had to really gain a sense of strong self and say, ""Who cares?"" and if I felt she was such a critical person, why did I even care what her opinion of me was? It was never going to be good enough. Thankfully she has softened and I have forgiven."

3879,isfj,"I'm not if it is the fact I am an ISFJ, or if  I just lack social skills,  but I have very few friends(really only two in my book). Any social group I have tried to join I have felt very out of place and I've never really been the guy people wanted to hangout with. I like doing things alone and my alone time, but at times I feel very lonley and disconnected.
I would like that to change, but it is difficult for me to find a social group where I can meet people I mesh with and where I can be appreciated. Those of you who have found social groups you fit in with, what are they? What are the types of  activities do you participate in where you find types of people you mesh with?"
3880,isfj,"I will be very honest-- I have often felt the same way you do. I go to class and am surrounded by other people my age and I think: I have almost nothing in common with these people, they are so different from me, etc etc. I think in part it is because ISFJs tend to have ""rich inner worlds"" or something like that and for me it means I often imagine how perfect something could be (the perfect friend who just magically knows everything about me and loves to hang out and thinks I'm awesome) and then compare it to reality (20 or so people who only know my first name) it's really daunting because what I want is someone to just magically click with me...
I am also super picky, as in... I walked into my summer class the first day and within 5 mins thought ""Nope, I don't want to be friends with any of these 4 other students."" Only a few times have I seen a particular person and thought ""Wow, that person seems like they might be my type of person"" which is frustrating because I'm sure if I got to know people then a lot of them might be awesome but it's like I only see a few people out of the crowd I want to even talk to.
I have only had 1 social group my whole life. I went to pre-k, elementary, middle and high-school with mostly the same group of people. By middle (not even in pre-k or elementary really) I had found my ""niche"". Just a group of 5 girls that I hung out with from 7-11th grade and in senior year things pretty much fell apart.
In college, I was hoping for that great roommate that I befriend and can tell all my secrets to... Nope. I got some girl who never even talked to me, didn't smile at me, didn't even feel really like a person around her I guess. We literally shared the same space (a small dorm room) and she let me miss an exam (we were taking the same class... she left for exam and left me napping) and she didn't even say good bye when we left for winter break... The kicker? I dormed with her again sophomore year thinking: ""Oh god, what if I got someone even worse? at least we don't argue.""
Bright side of that year is I met a girl in a trip I took in some outdoors club (hiking, beach, rafting trips etc). She initially didn't intrigue me but by this point I was desperate for human contact in college. I figured why not try with her, she seems alright. From her I met a few other girls. That group of friends last a few months, we had late night study sessions in the library, smoked together, etc and it was fun. Then that summer, I texted the 3 of them a couple times and never got a response and was really upset. I unfriended them on facebook etc and vowed to just not talk any of them again because they decided not to talk to me.... In hindsight, I was a little too emotional when I did all of that but whatever.
Right now I have no real group of friends. BUT what I do have, and have had since highschool are online friends. When I can't find someone IRL, I usually have at least a few people online I can talk to (and some of them I have known for a very long time and trust very much). I have found friends through playing online games (and voicechatting) etc and continue to play games with them now... During freshman year of college, playing online games was basically my only form of socialization.
Anyways, good luck and remember that things normally get better"
3881,isfj,"I'm not an ISFJ, but I joined here because I teach tech theater at a college and found a couple of the students on my work study team were ISFJ.  At first your type was a mystery to me, but I think I'm getting to know quirks of your personality type enough to comment on this.  (Note: I'm using two examples and one will be a he and one will be a she, but genders might have been changed from the real life people to make this post more readable.)
I've noticed with one particular ISFJ student that he has a habit of becoming close with someone quickly and then suddenly pulling back from that relationship in a way that throws the other person off kilter.  My other ISFJ student also has that tenancy, but not to the same extreme.  I've been trying to figure out the why of that, and I think the tendency to do that is part of your personality type and the extremeness has to do with background.  The one who pulls away had a tough childhood and has lost a lot of family.  The other one had a more secure childhood.  
Some of this also seems to do with your type's inability to pick up on subtle social cues.  I very often have whispered to one of them ""that person meant such and such when they said that"" and had wide eyes of realization in response.  There have definitely been times where both of them have been complimented and they would have completely missed the compliment without outside input.  They both have a hard time hearing when they are appreciated and that does affect their relationships.
Things that seem to help the one who is more successful at maintaining relationships:
* She doesn't become too giving too quickly.  I think your personality type tends to latch on quickly and then want to give, give, give, and then when you don't get back as much as you give you need to detach.  


She has some key close friends (and her Mom) who she talks to about her other (especially new) friendships, to get their take of the other people and how interactions that seem odd to her have transpired.  She often gains new insight into her interactions that way.


She worries less about meeting people and more about ""doing"" something she enjoys.  She joined the tech theater department because she was interested in theater but not acting.  She didn't seem to worry about fitting in... just learning and doing... and through that she has made many friends.


Those are my observations from my experiences.  Both of these students are great people and I love them both as if they are my children.  (I'm an INFJ with a huge mothering instinct.)  I know the one who has a harder time with relationships has found visiting the counselling center at our college extremely helpful... and sometime even just a visit or two with a counselor to talk through the specifics of a problem like this can work wonders.  If you are a student, you likely have access to that for free.
One last bit of advice, from one introvert to another... it's not the number of friends... it's the quality of friends that counts.  Many extroverts appear to have dozens of friends but beneath that surface they may not actually be truly connecting with others.  People like us do better when we have a handful of people we can connect to on a deeper level and we'll never be satisfied with surface friendship.  Treasure the close friends you have, relax about the rest and life will take care of itself."
3882,isfj,"ABSOLUTELY.
I label myself a boring person. Maybe I am, or maybe I just think I am. I'm not really sure. However, this mindset keeps me from asking people to do things, or creating conversation. I simply don't want to be a nuisance to someone, or force them to fake enjoying my company. Most of the time I feel like I am just better off sitting at home doing my own thing, while my acquaintances hangout with each other or other friends. I feel that if I were there I would just be a drag. I don't want to force someone to hangout with me when they can hangout with someone more interesting and fun."
3883,isfj,"I have always had this too.  The older I get the louder the voice in my head that says ""that's irrational"" gets, but that feeling is still there."
3884,isfj,"I can relate to almost all of this, especially your first couple of paragraphs.
I look for that ""perfect"" or ""ideal"" friend who understands, which I realize is completely unrealistic, but I can't get past it for some reason. I ESPECIALLY have this problem with regards to romantic relationships. I have an ""ideal"" mate in my mind, which again is unrealistic, but I simply hesitate to initiate anything with women unless I feel like they my at least be close to my idealization. Sometimes I come to the conclusion I am insane, but I think I am just stubborn.
I'm sorry to hear about the break up of your group of friends. I have been and still am in a similiar situation with a couple of guys. When we would do anything social, it would pretty much us three. In highschool, we were said to have a ""bromance"" haha. Unfortunately, we don't talk as much as we used to. A couple of us have full time jobs and the other is in grad school. Our main medium of socialization when not physically together was video games, but none of us have a lot of time for that anymore.
Video games were pretty much all I did with my free time in college, but for some reason I just wasn't able to socialize like you. I played a lot of League of Legends and Starcraft, so I guess there wasn't a whole lot of opportunity to socialize, since there was no voice chat. I played CS:GO, but the voicechat was either people speaking Portuguese or trash talking haha.
I appreciate you sharing your experiences. It is comforting to know there are people who can relate to what you are going through, and you're not all alone.
I hope you find some friends IRL, too. I believe we will both find some sooner or later, especially as we discover who we really are, and if you are anything like me, we have a long way to go."
3885,isfj,"Thank you for sharing your observations. I definitely think they are on point.
I do have trouble reading social cues in the moment, it isn't without help or running the situation through my head a million times that I realize the person meant something other than what I had initially thought.
I definitely tend to give far too much right off the bat. I have had some situations in my life where I have been taken advantage of because of my inability to say ""No"". I am trying to change this, but I find it hard because I simply want people to like me. I know it is silly to think that just because I don't do everything someone asks of me they will not like me, but my emotions are too powerful and usually take control. I am the definition of  a ""People Pleaser"". I definitely have work to do to change the way I handle these ""flaws"".
Thanks again for your observations, they have genuinely been insightful and helpful for me. "
3886,isfj,"There's like 1,500 entire surveys I have to manually enter and analyze lol. I'm just 1 person so it's gonna take a while. I hope to have it done by the end of the week. After I'm done analyzing it I'll prob reactivate it so people can take it if they want. I'll prob give someone (prob a moderator for dataisbeautiful) the password so they can continue to review & analyze the data later if they want"
3887,isfj,"Yes. In order to sample the present that is. We cannot just do nothing because everything is subject to change.
Moreover, there is a pattern o be followed, and the pattern WILL eventually reveal itself"
3888,isfj,"There is an option for “I have not had sex,” an option for “I am waiting till marriage,” and each question has a “prefer not to answer” option. No assumptions about sex were made- even regarding preferences and kinks, the questions were phrased as “does _ interest you,” not “do you do/enjoy ” to account for people who’ve never tried that thing. There’s also an option for “no I’m not interested in .” Also questions are voluntary. The post also told you exactly what was in the survey, it shouldn’t have been surprising to you. "
3889,isfj,"I beg to differ love... 
You see I'm not really one to state my gender in social media... But I do think I have a pretty good reason to do so.
I am a female... Both in heart and mind... And physique...
And please don't undervalue all ISFJ males...
I respect you, people... Male and female alike... But I must say I'm pretty biased towards males... As most of my friends are indeed towards the opposite sex.
All the loves... From a female."
3890,isfj,"I’m an INFP and an artist.  I’m looking for ways to stabilize and organize my life so that I can move forward.
I’m consistently distracted by my inner world as I try to figure out what was meant by things or I try to research ideas that I feel are poorly understood.
My latest mental invention was to stimulate activity on the Si front by thinking in terms of pursuing stability and the fear of what might happen if I don’t.
This idea seems to work for me in theory because it speaks to my Fi through my Ne.  Many of you may have already jumped off-board of this idea and have probably judged me to be “overthinking it”. I forgive you for this 🙃.
What are some practical, real world applications I can bring to bear upon my life to corral my activities so that they produce the kinds of results the world expects in a timely fashion?"
3891,isfj,"Also INFP. Also artist.
Scheduling only takes you to a point.
You have to learn your tendencies and then use them to propel you toward your goals.
For example, I suck at meal planning, but I’m the meal cooker at our house.
We eat the same thing on the same days of the week so I can autopilot buying groceries. Monday is spaghetti. Tuesday is tacos, etc. 
Those are things you can change for variety, but you don’t make chicken strips on Monday! It’s spaghetti night!
This allows me to feed the family, stay on budget, and not freak out about making dinner every night."
3892,isfj,"There’s a minimum threshold of focus that I have difficulty maintaining.
Depression moves in as a stress response, then I have difficulty course correcting due to the shame of having already screwed up so much.
Autopilot through grouping things sounds like something worth trying. I feel imprisoned by such schedules and my inner response is often quite childlike in a way I rarely express verbally.
Self medication through caffeine and other stimulants helps me to push through, and after a crash the stressed sense returns multiplied.
I printed out some daily schedule sheets and I’m using them to log my activity as I go. Planning in advance is difficult as I have a really hard time discerning the difference between not urgent/important and not important not urgent.
I’ve been using MBTI cognitive functions to help me differentiate these things.  I think that my Ne is showing me things that are not important/not urgent and passing them off as Te (things that are important and not urgent).
This is a hell of a problem because I will “chase butterflies” thinking that there is something essential about my life and identity in that chase and meanwhile things like making sure the rent check is sent off in time rests on the back burner.
I’m currently realizing that I need to make that Eisenhower matrix explicit every day if I want progress. I can’t trust my brain to do it for me on the fly.
I realize that this seems like a lot to write.  I’m feeling out the issue as I type. The hope here is that other INFP or similarly perpetually distracted people will benefit from this as well. Thank you for taking the time to address my concerns."
3893,isfj,"In a word, yes.
I ask you guys because it seems to come so naturally for you. What sort of things do you do to keep a schedule?
Another way to put it is what things do you spend time with that help you to keep a schedule?
If you spend zero time and it comes 100% naturally, imagine that you are planning a wedding or some other super important event that consumes massive amounts of resources and had to be “just right”. What kinds of activities would you put the most effort into in order to make the thing happen at the expected level of competence?
I have an answer and it seems ok to me, I just know that I fail all over the place at this sort of thing, so maybe there’s a skill or trick you use that you don’t even consider a skill or trick that I can apply and achieve a 5% difference in efficacy."
3894,isfj,"Mm it kinda depends. Hopefully others will chime in, because honestly I’m not the best at that stuff. Great at planning, not as good at following through, and my schedule does tend to be less strict than I’d like. 
I guess what helps me usually on day-to-day is stuff like timers and countdowns and leaving my worst distractions where I can’t get at them. Having things down on a day-to-day level makes it easier to stay on top of things as a whole though, so don’t underestimate it. 
In the case of big projects, it’s a matter of breaking things down appropriately according to their level of urgency. Sit down and figure out what the biggest, scariest, most visible parts are and the parts that you’ll need the most help with. What has the most immediate deadline? If you need to have the venue picked out 6 months in advance but the menu doesn’t need to be finalized until two weeks ahead of the event, don’t start debating beef or chicken right now. Having a general color scheme so that you can pick your decorations and outfits is an important element, so try to get that hammered out early, but don’t worry about picking out the exact flowers to compliment it just yet. 
Also take into account the people that you’ll be working with and giving them plenty of time to work you into their schedule, order necessary supplies, etc. Confer with them and get a general timeline for each element of the wedding, then set goal dates for having your decisions made and try to hit them. 
In general I guess like... start early, ask questions, hear people’s advice/take advantage of their expertise, keep an actual physical or digital schedule with deadlines in it, make lists and keep them somewhere organized and accessible, be honest with yourself about how likely you are to remember details and write down what you think you’ll probably forget. "
3895,isfj,"Thank you!
This is great!
Ok. I think I’ll break down your advice into a few sentences I can access readily. Let me know if any of this seems off.

A) Use timers and countdowns to keep productivity pressure up.

0.B) Make the things that you would find most distracting inaccessible to you.


A) Have access to a calendar where you can write things down and know which deadlines are creeping up. (Day-to-day level).


B) Also have a place where lists may be kept organized and accessible. Anticipate your forgetfulness in advance and safeguard against it with taking notes.


Devote time and effort to determining the level of urgency for items to be completed.


Determine sequence of actions by ordering things in terms of general to specific, that is, knowing the venue before the exact menu and knowing the color scheme before knowing exactly which napkins.


Even if none of this works, I feel a thousand times more energized to get going.  Suddenly things seem a whole lot less hopeless!  
Thank you so much for your time!"
3896,isfj,"I am sorry if this sounds beyond obvious, but I just came to the realization that extroverts too have problems in enviroments dominated by introverts.
For example, my home environment is introvert dominated, in which my mom is the only extrovert - and just yesterday I noted that how much bad time she gets just because she wants to hangout/talk more with us and other friends in comparison to us.
Just sharing - can't imagine what kind of replies I am going to get for this one :-P"
3897,isfj,"This was my life as a teen. It was actually my mother as well. We're all introverts, but my mom has the most active extroversion. I think to a certain extent, silence is uncomfortable (at dinners etc.) even for introverts, especially when you're a matriarch figure looking out for the ""healthiness"" of the family.
I myself can feel slightly uncomfortable in heavily introverted spaces, but at least I understand it. It must be excruciating for a full on extrovert. "
3898,isfj,"Yep, ISFJ/INTJ couple living with an ENFP and I feel terrible for him sometimes. It's so obvious how whenever we come out of the room/office he follows us wherever we go because he wants to talk/hang out. It's also kind of annoying (like if I want to cook with just my boyfriend) but I know he wants the attention etc and it makes him happy.
I think that most of us are able to see when others are hurting/needing so I doubt you'll get bad responses like you think lol. We are pretty empathetic."
3899,isfj,"Question: Does your ENFP roomie have friends/social life? Because I know us ENFPs are actually quite introverted and fare well in solo environments; we're exceptionally independent. That said, I only follow people around whenever I'm completely deprived of social contact for weeks. Makes me feel like a burden whenever they (I'm surrounded by introverts) just don't wanna give me the time of day when I follow them like a lost puppy."
3900,isfj,"You know, it's great that you posted a story of an extroverted FRIEND having problems - because so many times these extroverts think of themselves as the ""cool"" kids and their introverted friends as someone who lacks social skills"
3901,isfj,"He has some good friends and prob has someone come over once a week to hang out, in addition to going out multiple times during the week to go drinking/driving/whatev. That's why I know he craves attention/people more than me -- I go out like once every 2 weeks haha.
I think he just kind of thinks my boyfriend is really cool and wants to be around him. And my boyfriend will talk to him, but we are just both kind of annoyed with his exaggerations/attention-craving tendencies at this point. But I have to remind myself, he just is different than us -- but being me, I hate people who actively seek attention constantly so... I'm never mean to ENFP, I probably just don't engage him as much as he'd like but he's kind of weirded out by me (because I'm a girl lol) and he tends to talk to my boyfriend more anyways."
3902,isfj,"This post was sparked by me thinking about my flaws, and the darker side that I harbor/am capable of.
1. I'm manipulative. I know how to spin a situation to make it go the way I want to. I know how to cause conflict. I know how to get people on my side. I can pick and choose my words carefully, anf get my end result. I don't do this most of the time because I know that it's wrong - I've done it before and felt bad for doing it, and horribly for parties involved.
2. I can lie with a straight face if I know that there's no way I can be caught in a lie. Once again, don't like doing this.
3. On some level, I sometimes think that I'm polite to people because it will make them like me more, and if they like me, it boosts my reputation.  I'm not one of those ""I have to be popular"" kind of people... but when I'm hanging out with a group of people at school, I sometimes quietly judge the people I'm hanging out with, and wonder if being around them is good representation socially. I hate to admit it, but in the past I've prided myself on hanging around people who I see have a good social standing.  I'm not mean to ""the outcast."" But when it comes to standing up for someone vs. my reputation... I've always chosen my reputation.
4. I really like bragging. 
5. I sometimes believe, genuinely, that I don't even like most people."
3903,isfj,"I can do both the things you said but choose not to do them as well. My life and the lives of those around me are better if I don't and instead use open communication and shared respect. 
Knowing how to manipulate for self interest and not manipulating for self interest is a good thing you know? You can be aware of other people's intentions and you can also know how to manipulate when it is moral to do so. It's like martial arts. Don't go around mugging people with it. But sometimes, you have to fight to protect or help others.
OK big flaws, here we go:
I'm too blunt in trying to show respect. I don't want to be or take pride in it in anyway. I try to ease people in but I also care very much for accuracy in explaining what I think or feel. And with some people it's great. But with more sensitive people, it is hurtful. I've kind of stopped hanging around people I'm afraid of hurting. Which is kind of judgmental of me. I'm basically judging people ""too sensitive"" to spend time with.
I care too much about unintentionally hurting people or making them uncomfortable. I've somehow made that my responsibility, and try too hard to not burden others with my emotions. People should not have to stiffly navigate one another as much as I do.
I guess I think of people in terms of emotional burden on me to be around."
3904,isfj,"I won't never ever like myself
Nor any person will
Being Fe wizard is just another function that doesn't bring anything
I sometimes jump into conclusions too fast.
I label people for fun and confront them with my labels. 
I sometimes control people when I need order in my environment. (Control is bad word because it is female type of ordering which people don't mind much unless you are dumb ESTJ who will get mad if you try this shit on him)."
3905,isfj,"Definitely relate to #1, #2, and #4
One dark thing about me is if I hate you or disrespect you I will immediately turn my empathy off and become super critical around you or avoid you if I can. Also, let’s just say if you attempt or saying you’re going to harm someone I really love or a family member then I’ll make you wish you didn’t do that."
3906,isfj,"I feel the “too sensitive to spend time with” part. I get tired of having to sugar coat things that just need to be said. Told my friend her dress was too low cut for a brunch with family and she gave me the cold shoulder in front of other roommates. When I saw her leaving the house she had put a tank top under it and it looked much less exposed (I mean, her entire side boob and cleavage were out and I’m a good friend) because another roommate told her the same thing, nicely. It’s funny how I just can’t manage to say it without seeming like a judgmental mom"
3907,isfj,"Happy New Year to everyone on this sub. I just found you guys, so apologies if this isn't the sort of discussion that goes on in this sub.
I am ISFJ to a T almost. If you were to take this list, I would tick pretty much all those boxes.
I don't have too many friends, but I (key word, I) value them a lot. I put a lot of time and thought into other people's dramas/situations/struggles and I want to be appreciated for it, but I don't feel like I am. 
The problem is, I get people telling me that ""...oh, these people aren't your friends. There are so many other people, you can find more that will appreciate you!"" but I have searched, and searched but am yet to find someone that is like this.
I feel like I care too much and in the end I am the only one who is hurt or has their feelings hurt by it. What can I do? Have you had similar experiences?"
3908,isfj,I think the dilemma we face as ISFJs is that as we search for those in need. The problem with this is that the one thing we need most is reciprocation and it just so happens that the people we search for to help aren't able to do this because of that fact. Our peers see this as harmful for us and thus try to have us make friends with those who are able to give back to us. The problem is they most likely don't need the help we can give to them and therefore we feel guilty and not deserving that friendship. This morally makes us go back to the people we can help and the cycle continues. The best advice I can give is diversify your friend circle. 
3909,isfj,"I think you need to carefully ask whether the things you are caring about are the same things that others care about.
For example, my kids have never been without clothes or food. My wife puts a great amount of energy into food planning and clothes planning. Each meal has protein, fruit or vegetables, and carbs. She does a great, no, an exceptional job at this. She cares a lot.
But what she's missing is that the kids are different than she is. It would be much more healthy for them to get unbalanced meals or a pizza once in a while and have her give them the things they crave: time together, real listening to them, coloring together. But she is tone-deaf to this. The organization and the planning and the schedule comes first, and she is under the impression that the kids should appreciate her for it. And they should. But.
But they'd be so much more appreciative if she could appreciate the different people that they are and that the needs that they have do not match up with the needs she is projecting onto them.
/u/poolboywax gets it. The ISFJ who has found maturity has found it when they realize that other people are very different, and value different things, than they do."
3910,isfj,"I try to treat others the way I want to be treated, but often have to remind myself that everyone has a unique way they want to be treated. Sometimes the way we want to be treated isn't the way others would want, so they might treat you a way that they would seek instead. Sounds more complicated than it is, really. Caring and reciprocation isn't black and white; we cant assume someone isn't showing us their way based on our bias and expectation of what it means to be ""cared"" for or ""appreciated."" Its important to understand the different ways people might show their value of you. "
3911,isfj,"My two closest friends are ENFJ and they genuinely seem like the only two who understand and care for me to the level I invest in my friends. Not a crack to my other friends (who are almost all NPs) but it genuinely does wear on me when my friends don't understand me. I'm pretty odd and some of the stuff I say doesn't make sense to a lot of people. 
I wish I could find more friends, but sadly I live in a rural area and I'm not a Farmaholic(tm) so it sucks. Especially since one of my best friends lives an hour away and the other lives a continent away."
3912,isfj,"i felt like that with my friends for a long time too. what i eventually realized was that people are different and want and give differently. 
i am capable of caring more for people, in an almost motherly way, that many don't do for one another. but they do other things that i don't and they are worth noticing and appreciating. 
from there i was able to change my expectations of people. instead of basing them off of myself and what i give to others, i based them off of what i know individual others are like and are capable of.
and over time we influence each other by sharing our traits. the more stubborn friend encourages me to stand my ground, the more subtle friend shows me how to be sneaky, the more polite friend shows me how to use niceties, and i try to show them how to open up and be accepting of each other.
though there are others who were unwilling to be accepting at all and are jerks so they leave the group."
3913,isfj,"This is me 100%. Either I naturally draw in rather toxic people in my life due to my personality and ""aura"" or I am just really sensitive to certain comments/tone of voice. I am still unsure of how to completely determine if someone is toxic and should be cut out of my life, or if I should just accept them for what they are and they're not as bad as my mind is making them out to be. There are also certain people who cause me a lot of grief (i.e. my parents) and I cannot cut them out no matter how much I should "
3914,isfj,"I'm thinking it'd be better for me if I don't make friends. I mean, just small talk with people instead. 
Like, chat with classmates, but don't hang out with them outside of school. Go to a coffee shop and make small talk with the cashier, if I make them smile I'll be happy. Ride a bus and chat with the guy next to you (test the fucking waters though, don't be that talkative annoying guy whose mouth ain't wanted)."
3915,isfj,"Appreciate your reply, thank you.
I think this is true for me in most of my relationships and friendships. Sometimes even the opposite, as in I feel people in need search for me because I have made many friends in the past who would share things about themselves with me that they would do with others. 
Making friends isn't easy, as I'm sure many people here would agree, but this is something I will try."
3916,isfj,"Which is why a friendship I had with someone very dear to me ended. She thought it'd be better if she's out of my life, because I'm all clingy and dependent on her."
3917,isfj,"You are right, and I need to take a leaf from what you mentioned. People value different things and have their own way of showing it based on their beliefs. :)
This is a great quote. I (M) have a very close friend who I can confide in, and she is an ESFP. She is very much an emotional person. She doesn't know about what my results were from this (probably a discussion we'll have soon), but she texts me nice little things sometimes. The Christmas message I got was:
""Merry Christmas [maaaaate], have a wonderful day with family. So grateful to have you in my life and for you dealing with all my petty shit. Wouldn't survive this without you."" 
and for New Years,
""Happy New Years!! [talking about being hungover and forgetting to text me]. Hope you had a great night and thanks for being in my life"".
Honestly, I was doubting the friendship a little in the last few months because I felt super unappreciated but this may have changed it. 
We don't hang out much at all (once or twice in 2017), and it really weighed on me not seeing someone I care for, but she makes up for it.
Maybe I shouldn't be complaining :/"
3918,isfj,"Deleted my previous reply. Thought I was at a different subReddit, got confused, sorry. Lol
Hey, who cares if they think you should have more friends? Quality over quantity. Do these people reciprocate your love?"
3919,isfj,"I agree. Quality over quantity :)
One of them does, but that's because we grew really close over the 3-4 years we were at uni. Not the same degree, but we would talk on the phone daily and I'd be the first person she'd tell about good and bad things in her life.
I think she may have also helped me realise that I enjoy making people happy or being someone's shoulder or voice of reason, or just being there for someone who needs it. "
3920,isfj,"Take very, very, very, veryyy good care of that relationship. Do everything in your power not to lose it. Don't you dare fuck around. Look, I just had a friendship breakup because I was fucking stupid. I wouldn't wish this kind of pain onto my worst enemy, so it makes me soooo fucking happy to hear you've got a friend. 
What about the other one, mate? "
3921,isfj,"I will. I've told her how much I value her as a friend before but I should do it more often. I can tell you though, it wasn't smooth sailing. I messed up at the end of 2015 and we went no contact for a year (up until May this year), and I remember it hurting a lot. Even though we weren't in a relationship (been in 1 during out friendship) it honestly hit me like a tonne of bricks. She forgave me and our friendship is actually a lot stronger. 
Thank you so much for the kind words. I know friendship breakups are very hard to cope with, especially for us. PM me any time if you want to talk, happy to offer an ear to listen.
The other friend... he's a good person, and it was also luck that I even maintained a friendship with him, but I've noticed that I'm a last resort with him. 
I really hope I don't fuck up the friendship I have with this girl again. It is on my mind a bit knowing that I could do it again."
3922,isfj,"I'd ask you to try not to be too invested with the other guy if that's the case. Be friendly, but be cautious. 
Don't think negative thoughts, man. Just go on autopilot. Don't overthink anything. And if you can, tell her to be very direct with you if you're doing something she doesn't like. That way you can adjust accordingly."
3923,isfj,"Good idea. I always try and not invest too much time into people who treat me like that. 
Yeah, no negative thoughts. It's easy to, though, when she has left me before. Communication is key and I think I can do it. "
3924,isfj,"I'm at ENTP and I fall very into the ""helpful criticism is meant to help and people shouldn't take it so darn personally"" category... which of course means I have no idea how to be encouraging to my ISFJ friend. My friend has a huge problem procrastinating and dislikes change to the point that she doesn't really work on her goals, health, etc without some cajoling. I feel like i need to use kinder words and be more patient with her, but I also feel like if I'm TOO soft/patient she'll just laze around the house all day and I know she has so much more potential than that. Advice?"
3925,isfj,"Try telling her it's constructive criticism and that you care about her and want to see her become a better person. I'm not a huge fan of criticism either but I tend to take constructive criticism better. Also, if she is afraid of change then remind her of ways she has overcome situations like this in the past. Comparing and contrasting the situations can be comforting for us. "
3926,isfj,"Hello! My best friend and I host a podcast about MBTI, and this week we interviewed an ISFJ who breaks many stereotypes - I figure you all may be interested! 
Kindergarten teacher, mother and female badass Heather talks with us (ESFP Meredith and ENTP me, Kaila) about being an ISFJ beyond the SJ stereotypes. She grew up Mormon in a whole family of S-types and married young, but later experienced a feminist awakening after adopting a son and leaving the church and her husband.

3927,isfj,"I really loved this! As an ISFJ, I found a lot of things Heather said to ring true. She seems like an amazing person and she's gone through such a journey to achieve self-actualization. It's quite inspiring.
I was also really interested in the Mormon side of it, since I'm married to a (male, ENTP) ex-mormon, but haven't really heard a first-hand account from a woman's perspective...what it was like being raised LDS and getting out. The story about how her parents moved to Arizona in order to get her away from a boy was absolutely shocking, but after getting to know a lot of Mormons, I can see how this type of overreaction was a legitimate response in their minds. Yikes.
Thanks again. I'm glad I got to listen to this. :)"
3928,isfj,"Hey everyone so basically I'm friends with an ISFJ and it would be romantic if it were not for the 12 hour time difference (I'm in the USA and she is in the UAE) 
Preface:Prior to her recent and large move to the UAE this wasnt an issue.
Anyways I care about her very much and I know she cares about me but I struggle in showing it at times. Due to mainly who I am as a T and the time difference and me getting obsessively caught up in activities i do throughout the day or night. She playfully jokes that I ignore her or dont care for her and it's funny but I know there's some truth behind that. I feel bad because I'm not as caring or emotional as I feel like I should be, I try to reassure her as much as I can but idk I feel like our communication styles can be such a huge barrier sometimes because she often feels like I dont want her or that she annoys me, she constantly apologizes for her little quirks even though I love those things about her. Does anyone have any advice for an ENTP who feels like he doesnt understand??
TL;DR She's really nice and I'm a jerk but I care about her I just suck at being emotional and I feel bad about that. Anything I can do to bridge the gap and have her stop thinking I don't like her or want her around?"
3929,isfj,"Male ENTP here, been with my ISFJ for 9 years.
Generally an ISFJ and ENTP can understand eachother very well. We use the same functions in reverse after all... 
Think of it as: The ISFJ is doing math. The ENTP is also doing math but he's dyslexic and trying to solve the problem backwards... how ever they both are intending to accomplish the same thing long term.
During daily activities the ENTP is in the flow state of Ne... absorbing and processing a ridiculous amount of new information. During the day for an ISFJ, she is operating off of carefully structured internalized experiences.
It's reversed when the ENTP and ISFJ are doing something relaxing that they enjoy. The ENTP want's to enjoy something nostalgic that he knows will give him a good time... such as eating the same dinner at the same restraunt. On the other hand, the ISFJ is getting excited about the idea of ordering a new meal or buying movies she's never seen before.

Getting practical here, I agree with /u/Kaelaface.
Do practical, tangible things to show you appreciate her... not just sharing ideals or your newest interest, hoping that she's reciprocate.
Send her messages, hand written letters. A shipment of goodies... things that she will actually remember.
ISFJ's want stability. If she likes you and feels that you provide a sense of stability of a real lasting relationship, then it's a done deal - regardless of distance."
3930,isfj,"ISFJ here, been romantic with my ENTP for about 8 years, but were friends for many years before that. The best thing to do is be truly honest about the way that your brain works. It may take several tries to get the words right so that she understands, but once you both understand each other's communication styles, it really helps. "
3931,isfj,"It means something to me when my INTP bf buys me a movie or something similar that I really enjoyed. It means that he is listening to me when I talk about something I love, and he is thinking of me when we’re not together.
Edit: Anything that lets me know that he is thinking of me when we’re apart is wonderful. Even short texts just saying he misses me while we’re at work."
3932,isfj,"I'm trying to wrap my head around my ISFJ boyfriend. We started dating about a week ago and it's been awesome. He's so shy and sweet, and I feel he does love me sincerely and deeply, and we've connected on an emotional ~ almost spiritual level, like soulmates. But, sometimes... I don't know, I kinda feel like he's... I mean, it's not anything overt, and I do feel like ""he's the one"", but sometimes... he seems so distant, kinda detached, retreated into himself. And I'm an INFJ, but with him I'm like myself plus my shadow (INFJ+ENFP). I don't know, he kinda feels mysterious when we're not together. So I'm here, trying to wrap my head around what he's truly all about. Or maybe I'm just overthinking all this, or my Ni/Fe are going overdrive. Anyway, it's being hard figure out my bf by myself. Fellow ISFJs, a little insight directly from you guys would be greatly appreciated!
[EDIT] Just trying to explain how I feel sometimes: It's a mixture of ""feeling ignored, neglected, taken for granted"". I thought I wouldn't feel that way dating an ISFJ bf, you guys making (at least to the best of my knowledge) pretty much caring, loyal, nurturing companions. So it seems like an incomprehensible contradiction, that being so and I'm (INFJ) feeling the way I'm actually feeling right now. I'm pretty resilient, but that's not what I expected dating an ISFJ would be ~ didn't realise I'd have to feel like that with him as well. :/
[EDIT2] And I didn't exactly get why the -1 there. I need good advice/help, not being passed judgment on. :/
[EDIT3] Thanks for all the great advice, guys! I've done / I'll do it, and we're already better now, so thanks a lot! ^^"
3933,isfj,"Working with the little bit of info you've given here, I can only assume he's trying his best to not be clingy. It's something I am constantly aware of. I fairly consistently worry that I'm being too talkative or getting in on my gf's life so sometimes I do back off just because I feel like I'm being a bother. So that could be what's going on with your significant other"
3934,isfj,As an ISFJ I am constantly worried about seeming clingy so I withdraw even though I don’t really want to. Communication is key with me. If you feel strongly that he’s being withdrawn you may want to gently bring it up.
3935,isfj,"Another INFJ here!
After my ISFJ boyfriend and I got through the first steps of dating, we kinda hit a slow point that might be similar to where you are with your boyfriend. It felt like we were close, but disconnected.
The thing that helped us was an exercise that we do about daily now: When he feels distant to me, or I'm wrapped up in my own head, we'll ask each other, ""What did you feel today."" Then we tell each other the emotionally significant things that happened. It's normally small things, but for us it has become a way for both of us to process things. ISFJs and INFJs are both Fe users, so we tend to focus our attention and thoughts on what others are feeling. For my boyfriend and I, it's helpful to explicitly remind each other to think about ourselves. Plus, ISFJs often find a lot of significance in bonding rituals like this.
This exercise is a pretty concrete answer to a nebulus feeling that you are describing, but in my experience dating a sensor, he'll appreciate you trying a direct approach to being more in touch with him. Good luck and hope this helps!"
3936,isfj,"I get this way when I am afraid of burdening others with things (especially if I don't know them well). When I first started seeing an ex, I had a bad sinus infection going on, but I didn't want to seem like I didn't want to see him. He had no idea until I awkwardly got boogers on him. That and there were some things I was skeptical about his personality I could see conflicting with mine long-term. But I think I have caused many people to feel that disconnected feeling, even friends and family. Usually a hug, tea, and some memes I like will pull me out of my shell when I've withdrawn for too long.
​
Have you been friends with this person for a bit before you started dating?"
3937,isfj,"Do you think he still has his guard up a bit about revealing certain parts of himself (nothing to do with you maybe)? It took me a very long time to fully trust my boyfriend with certain parts of myself simply because I was not yet ready to do so... I knew I would eventually do it but I was still comfortable with discussing those things with my friends rather than him because it felt like too much too soon (in accordance with what other ISFJs have mentioned below about not wanting to come off too clingy)
Or he might not even be doing it on purpose but you might be feeling it acutely and he does not even realize that it's bothering you? I definitely agree, gentle communication would work wonders in this situation and I am sure he will give you what you need if you tell him you want it."
3938,isfj,"Remember that we introverts need our quiet time. We recharge when we’re alone. It’s not that we don’t want to be with our people. It’s just how we find our own personal harmony. Understanding and accepting that will be so rewarding, I think. Someone who understands when I need to be alone and quiet, is someone I keep for the long haul. I will nurture and take care of them. When they respect my introversion that’s how I feel that they’re taking care of me. If that makes sense."
3939,isfj,"INFP female here. OH MY GOD. I’m going through the exact same thing. I’ve been dating this ISFJ male that I am really into for about two or three weeks now. We click so well and he’s usually very open with me about EVERYTHING. I can ask him a question and be confident he’s telling the full truth and I’m the same way with him... everything is great when we’re together but when we’re apart.... he’s soooo distant? And I don’t really know what’s going on. It’s too early in the relationship to be questioning everything and I know he’s not really on his phone as much as I am, but it boggles my mind! He is busy, but like.... keep me in the loop, just a little bit T-T  being apart from him is near torture because he’s so... mysterious ? and like. quiet ?"
3940,isfj,"But I love everything about him (and make it clear, like, all the time) ~ including his clinginess. I'd say especially those things ""most"" (e.g., ExTPs) people would dislike or reject. He's so sweet and I'm feeling just in love with his depth of feeling, never met someone so deep, and it's so... like, everything we do together, it ""imprints"" in him something, and he remembers it, keeps it close to heart, it doesn't just go away. It sticks with him, and that is awesome! Little things, those small details other people would easily forget, but he remembers precisely those.
So it's being great, but I'm only a bit put off when I feel like he's kinda withdrawing into a shell, I don't want ever to have him feel like he needs to, you know. I'm not afraid of his depth, so he shouldn't be afraid of any rejection whatsoever from me, on the contrary really, I always embrace him fully. I've got all this inside my chest, but then I don't know exactly how to express it to him in a way he understands how I truly mean no criticism or harm at all, only for him to feel loved and safe to express everything he's feeling, whatever that is. ^^"
3941,isfj,"Yeah, I've been noticing that ISFJs tend to be pretty self-conscious about this ""clinginess"" aspect that they have, and trying to ""turn it down"" a little, so to speak. But, speaking for myself and as an INFJ, I just love ""clingy"" guys, I find it sooo sweet, hugging and kissing and wanting to be really close all the time! ^^
I absolutely adore every bit of my ISFJ, with all my heart. All I'd like is him to let this deep into his heart, that I'm lovin' him to pieces the more I get to know him, so he shouldn't feel afraid at all with me, of showing all his depth of feeling. I can see right through him, and I like what I'm seeing in him.
And it's a lovely, sincere, caring, and deeply sensitive young guy!
So he shouldn't feel afraid at all. I'll always embrace his true being. :)"
3942,isfj,"Thanks for the advice, my fellow INFJ! I'm glad to see another INFJ in a relationship with an ISFJ as well, it's refreshing to realise I'm far from being the only INFJ to find this wonderful personality just sooo attractive for a deep and sincere romance, a soulmate. I'll surely ~ and gladly follow your advice. My thanks! ^^"
3943,isfj,"We had connected on a popular dating app for guys in our area, but we were like ""fish in a barrel"", with ExTPs all around us everywhere. We instantly connected, like two magnets. We talked pretty deep for the whole night, and then we fell in love. The next day we'd spent together the whole afternoon until dusk, and it was just awesome! And then we've been dating, last time we'd spent the evening playing with a friend of his (an ENFJ girl, with a bff of hers and her parents). It was incredible, we cooked together and all! He's just the cutest when we're together, and about this clingy thing ~ I LOVE IT. More ""free-spirited"" individuals (e.g., ExTPs) may look down upon it, shun it, even reject it, but I definitely don't! I love his clinginess, it's sooo sweet. He's just the cutest lover ever ~ and he's also erotic af when we're together, so it's the full-package: he's a deep & sincere lover + he's surprisingly hot when we're somewhere he feels comfortable/safe.
Just sometimes that, when we're far apart, it feels like we're a bit disconnected. That's all. I haven't got anything that I truly dislike about him, only a tad bit this kinda ""aloofness"" sometimes, it puts me off a little, keeps me wondering if I did anything wrong or something ~ but I don't think I do, I'm often sweeping him off his feet all the time and he just loves it, I can see it in his eyes that he loves every second when we're together. So that kinda makes me confused a bit. I love his personality, though he can come across as quite mysterious to wrap my head around him, sometimes I'm just wondering how he's truly feeling, deeeep inside, it's like an ocean of depth, and I like depth! And so I try to light it up a bit. All in all, it can be really challenging sometimes, but I'm lovin' my ISFJ, every bit of him! Well, I just hope we'll have a great relationship and it's all gonna be just awesome! ^^"
3944,isfj,"I can fully understand if he does, and he's been through quite a lot of disappointment and hurt in his life, so that's something I deeply respect and understand. I'm feeling that acutely, as you said, because it's like I'm here, with open arms and, when we're together, we're really close and it's just fantastic ~ it's magical. Only when we're far away and doing things, that's when he kinda comes across, sometimes, as... standoffish. Keeping his distance a bit, giving some space. It can hurt. I'm fairly resilient, but I'm also feeling everything and bottling it up, trying to sympathise and empathise with his own inner struggles, and be there for him. Like a beacon, making him feel happier, at peace. But it takes a bit of a toll, that's why it can be challenging, because the less I receive, the more I give, to the point of burning out and crying out of desperation. And that's my inner struggle. I need to feel warmth as well. ~ Warmth & heartfelt embrace."
3945,isfj,"I understand why ISFJs think and react in that way with most people. But the problem is, what applies to most people rarely does apply to FJs, in general, and that's so much more the case for INFJs, at least that's how I tend to look at things ~ Most people dislike clinginess, sensibility, attachment et al, whereas I do like these. And I make an extra effort to express all of it the best way I can, gently but deeply and sincerely.
I like clingy. I mean, what's not to like, for an INFJ? It's so sweet! It isn't a bother, far from it! I so value it...
So my point I think is this: It's okay to back off from people who'd reject it, but what about those who like it?"
3946,isfj,"Well, I don't think ""not feeling attached"" is the real issue. He is, and I am, deeply and sincerely.
I can feel it in his eyes, every time we're together. I'd feel if he wasn't, but I don't. So that's not it."
3947,isfj,"It could just take time. It took me a long time to really believe that someone wasn't just ""putting up with me"" even though they were vocal about enjoying m y company. Don't give up, just keep giving lots of positive feedback and he'll probably come around"
3948,isfj,"Your Ni seems very insightful, and I'm sure he appreciates how much of him you can see! I can't speak for all ISFJ but when I think I have feelings I get even more distant at times. Like others have said, I do not want to be clingy, and I have fear of hurting a connection that is so precious to me. But I'm sure if he knows you appreciate his concerns all should be well, if anything he's probably falling for you and starting to internalize it. When I have something so precious I want to give it my best and I have so much I'd like to do with that person, but I know they have their lives, I'm the type I'd need reassurance if I got clingy it would be appreciated :) But I kinda shut down in a good way, mostly to sort through my thoughts of what I've done right and wrong in the past, and how to go about preserving something so precious in the present."
3949,isfj,"It's very sweet of you :)
I still say give him time since it's only been a week and communicate gently. He will come to you in time. Just be patient with him since you say you feel he is The One. You have the rest of your lives ahead."
3950,isfj,"100% agree with this. You may say that you enjoy our company over and over again, but it takes awhile for us to actually believe it. If we don’t believe it, then we will keep our distance until we do. It’s worse if we were told, or personally felt like we were a bother to someone else in the past."
3951,isfj,"Thank you, fellow ISFJ. And about feelings, he told me just a few hours ago how him falling in love with me is kinda transforming him from the inside, he said, ""I'm feeling at peace ~ I'm feeling more patient and happier all day."" We also dream about each other, every night. Yesterday I dreamt about us swimming together on the coast of Scotland at some point in our future, and he about us on our honeymoon in Canada, things like that. And the both of us never felt so close to someone like this in both our lives. We communicate so deeply and just through looking at each other's eyes, delve deep into each other's unconscious. It's just... fantastic. Never felt that before. Never imagined such a connection with another human being could exist, or that I'd ever experience something like this with another person in this life. Never dreamt an INFJ and ISFJ would so easily fall deep into love. Sincere, authentic, simple, pure love.
~ Heartfelt. Soulmates. ^^"
3952,isfj,"Thanks! And we've kinda been sorting it all out ~ nicely and gently, as always. No fights or anything, we're both sooo compassionate and caring with each other, we understand the other so well, that everything kinda naturally falls into place. ""We both love each other, we have the rest of our lives ahead, everything else we'll sort out together"", that's kinda already become our mantra. Haha. ^^ ~ I'm amazed at how easily we've connected to the other on a deeper, almost spiritual level. Kinda wish I'd known MBTI before, but also thankful I didn't, I'm already glad we've found each other. :)"
3953,isfj,"Mm... yeah, maybe that's an issue for me, it's kinda a meme for INFJs here on Reddit btw, this ""too deep, too fast"" thing. But I just can't help it, because when you can see people right through, you kinda ""know"" who's for you and who isn't, and I've just fell completely in love with my ISFJ ~ and I can feel he did just as much. But I don't have any reservations, whereas he has his, and while I understand and respect his reasons for it (hurt, regrets, disappointments), and while I deeply sympathise and empathise, that does take a bit of an emotional toll on me. 
Sometimes I feel like I'm running out of gas and there's a whole 20km marathon right ahead of me. I just put in so much effort, you know. My ENFP ""shadow"" gets fully focused on my ISFJ, showering him with tons of positive feedback, but only when we're close together (when we're on a date) that he shows his ESFP side, and it's just awesome. It's just this distance, this seeming distant, unavailable, busy all the time, that really puts me off. There isn't such a thing for myself, I'm available. I get confused by why he isn't."
3954,isfj,"So I've been sorta seeing this guy for a few weeks but I'm pretty sure we're not like... ""dating"" (it's so hard to gauge these things for me!) but we've both been invited to mutual friend's party in a few days. I don't want to be out of line by kissing him when I see him or something... What's the protocol on that type of thing? I'm very sure I'm over thinking this but it's seriously stressing me out. 
Edit: I was worrying for nothing. Snuggles and kisses all around! :)"
3955,isfj,"Morning all, 
I've been getting more into the functions and working on typing myself according to them. I identify a lot with the description for ISFJs, but very VERY much don't with others. Like, some of the descriptions I come across I'm pretty strongly against. 
I think the biggest one I go against the grain on for it is wanting to fall in line with traditional behavior or beliefs, or feeling like procedures are in place for a reason. I disagree strongly with this. I very much hate listening to authority because they probably know what they're doing. 
However, that being said, I definitely feel this way in my work function. At work, I don't like novelty or not knowing how a duty was done in the past at all. I like having a clear framework from which to start or I'll start getting stressed out. "
3956,isfj,"Here is my go-to comparison of Si vs Ni with bonus analysis of how/why the mbti community mischaracterizes both. The person deleted their account, but did their homework and uses Jung as their primary source. I personally think it’s the best Si description you can find on reddit. 
  
“As other users have noted, there are quite a few ISFJ's (and INFP's) mistyped as INFJ's. I've been asked in a few comments / messages to describe the differences, so I wanted to create a post.
Si & Ni Similarities:

Both can be ""in their heads"" (and often are! It's core to both functions)
Both can operate in the unconscious (and do! Again, this is core to the definition of both)
Both can read between the lines and derive insights (including ""a ha"" moments)
Both can have ""gut feelings,"" and develop subjective understanding
Both can think abstractly on occasion
Both can go against tradition, convention on occasion
Both can have imperfect memories or miss details on occasion
Both can plan for the future (and in fact, many SJ's highly enjoy doing so!)

Si & Ni Differences

Si pertains to ""the real world"" (even when they're making insights or thinking)
Ni is directly at odds with it

""What does that mean??""
Well, it doesn't just mean being ""in our head"" or ""drawing conclusions"" - that's VERY fundamental to both types
The real question is what it's regarding / a result of / in relation, and what their core drive / value / focus is


Si prefers concrete and familiar - even though they can absolutely draw insights, abstract, and think, the core drive of ""concrete,"" ""familiar,"" and/or ""stable,"" etc. is fundamental to their life (some Si's identify with different words)


Ni doesn't. They don't care. Rather, they need and want abstract (not just ""thinking"" or ""insights"") as a core value


   
What Si isn't:

Always traditional or conventional - they often are, but don't have to be!
Always past-oriented or have great memories - often, but not always!
Always literal, or unable to abstract, be insightful, creative, etc. - they absolutely can!
Always detailed - they're humans too, and can miss things

What Ni isn't:

Just being ""in our head,"" ""thinking,"" or ""detached"" - this describes most introverted types
“Si 2.0"" or ""the best of both worlds"" - Ni-doms fundamentally don't care about the core Si values and strengths
Something we ""back into"" simply because we ""don't identify fully with Si"" (Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)
Something defined by occasionally thinking abstractly or having insights (see above: Ni-doms live and breathe Ni)

According to Jung:

Si perceives something with ""all its qualities, its intensity, its transient course, the nature of its origin and disappearance in their every detail""
Ni, on the other hand, ""obtains either no knowledge at all or at the best a very inadequate awareness"" of the thing at hand; in fact, their ""chief repression"" is ""sensation of the object"" (note: this goes further than ""being unaware of our surroundings"")
Si: absolutely perceives unconsciously, but still regards ""the object"" or ""image"" (comes from and/or ties back to real life or things they've experienced/read/seen/etc, even if not in front of them at the time)
Ni: has a ""remarkable indifference"" to “anything outside their unconscious pursuit” (note: this isn't just ""being in our head;"" this is an overarching abstraction or vision for life or consciousness) including the real world, and live in the unconscious ""without establishing any connection between the phenomenon and himself"" (which is not just being ""in our head,"" ""thinking,"" or introversion)
Si is often characterized by ""calmness,"" ""rational self-control,"" and ""well-intentioned neutrality... striving to soothe and adjust.""
Ni on the other hand, doesn't care about ""tangible reality"" and makes no such adjustments, rendering his himself ""unadapted to the actual present-day reality."" (and again: this is not just ""being introverted"")

""I still don't get it...""

Why do we mistype?

The #1 reason: we're not good at self-perception. We all see ourselves a bit inaccurately, and skew perception
The tests are almost always wrong
The type and function language and definitions are confusing
We all see a little bit of ourselves in all of the functions / types
We may extrapolate a few examples of a function (i.e., insights, abstract) into meaning we're that type
We don't identify with everything about a function/type description (especially stereotypes, many of which are wrong)
We compare ourselves to the ""stereotype"" rather than users/types in real life
We unknowingly comparing ourselves to real-life Si's rather than Ni's (i.e., ""I'm not like A, so I must be B"" or ""I'm more X than A, so I must be B"" rather than ""I am B."") Ni-dom's are ~3% ofpeople whereas Si users are ~46% (Si-dom's, ISxJ, specifically are 25%; S's overall are 75%.) So we're often finding comparing and small differentiations against S's rather than N's
On a cursory read, we may simply like the idea of N over S (without understanding the downsides of N, or the fact that it directly contradicts some S drives/values/needs)

What can we do?

The opposite of everything above.
Be self-aware, open, honesty about what we value / do most - avoid confirmation bias and really explore other types*
Don't go off of test results
Learn about the functions, how they work together, what each values and what each doesn't
Understand we can all exhibit something from each type on occasion
Avoid cherry-picking examples as proof of a function; we live and breathe our dominant function
Understand that we don't have to identify 100% with the description (especially bad stereotypes!)
Understand Si's in real life, rather than the Si stereotype / archetype
Understand (actual) Ni's in real life (but be aware: many people are mistyped)
Understand the weaknesses, blind spots, values for each type (incl Ni) and be honest about your real values/needs

   
*I have explored whether I am an Si-dom with seriousness - I hired a certified MBTI coach to help me filter this, explicitly telling her I could be Si-dom
The best resource is a very well-read MBTI coach. I hired two different ones, one of whom was ""certified,"" to help me confirm my type. There was no test - it was all conversational. Both walked me through typing as Ni-dom.
That aside? Well-read MBTI nerds who aren't basing understandings off of stereotypes, mistypes, and bad information”

3957,isfj,"I agree with you in this exact same description of an ISFJ. I hate sticking to tradition, in fact, I question it every time I am in a situation where “I am supposed to do this because this is what everyone does or has been done in the past”. My personality is the complete opposite. I always look for innovative ways to follow what I want to do."
3958,isfj,"I personally don't like tradition that much, or societal norms.  I hate beauty standards for women, and I don't refuse to follow them, but I'd rather not follow them because I think that they are unfair.  I want to get people on board with breaking a tradition if the tradition is morally wrong, or if it simply isn't holding up anymore.  I think that we could afford some change in the world, and I really don't like the ""mom friend who bakes cookies"" stereotype I'm always hearing about."
3959,isfj,"I think with all personality types and cognitive functions, you'll always come across a stereotype or assumptions led without any sound reasoning or understanding;; If I may state, I don't believe it's only ISFJs that are under scrutiny. In my experience, all personality types have something to complain about when it comes to descriptions, and there are some out there that are heavily outdated or need some tweaking!
​
Being one of my favorite online assessments and descriptions, here is what the website Type in Mind has to say about the way ISFJ uses Si when it comes to ""traditions"", and how it can be a little misunderstood:
​
Although perhaps the first paragraph may have been enough alone to copy/paste here, I thought it might help just to have a couple further details why some ISFJs may value their personal ""traditions"". And it certainly doesn't have to relate to the specific examples listed in the paragraph! Just helps to give an idea.
​
Si is subjective, so it may not look at what's ""traditional"" in an objective sense. I know there's plenty of misunderstanding;; It has more to do with what the user is used to, what they've been introduced to in the past. For example, growing up I was heavily passionate about black civil rights and transgender rights before knowing much about the history, or what the people in my community felt. Even my mother to this day is vocal about not supporting transgender or gay rights. It's difficult when those you are close with have different values than your own, especially tying in with Extroverted Feeling which just wishes for harmony between all;; When it comes to race, our neighbors were all colored and I grew up watching a lot of movies dealing with the struggles colored people have had to put up with for centuries, time and time again. It may not have been a ""traditional"" way of life in the deep South where I lived at that time, to question and wish to fight the injustice black people face; but in the things I watched, the people I grew up besides, helped shape what feels most right to me.
​
Looking at gay rights and transgender rights, I didn't at all ever think about the possibilities until one year in late elementary school, my music teacher had us act out a play together in front of the classroom for a week, that focused on an arranged marriage between a man and wife, both who were heavily against their social norms. (The woman was very aggressive, enjoyed fighting; the man was sensitive, would prefer bird-watching.) Halfway through the play, you find out that the woman was actually, a man! Who was lied to at birth. (I don't remember all the details or how someone sees their genitalia and think it's normal?) But it was a surprise twist, and threw me in such a loop! We were all gasping and laughing at this suddenly ridiculous situation where a man is about to unknowingly marry another man. I remember it flustering me heavily after the humor faded, that it's possible for a man to kiss and sleep with another man! I was blushing to my ears at the thought, but decided that certainly what matters most is someone's character over their looks (like the lessons I knew Martin Luther King Jr. wanted to teach, although I also wish to state I don't mean to put ideologies into his mouth, this is just how I interpreted his words). I would tell my mother at an early age too, that if someone wanted to be the opposite gender, it should be okay because it's never right to force someone to be a certain way just for how they look, what their bodies are like. 
​
​
Ooh my goodness, so much typing;; sorry for all that text! You mentioned not respecting authority figures just because they are in that position. I started questioning police when I saw in documentaries/history that during the 60's, black people were detained in prisons/jail for peaceful protest. Although, I must state I am enneagram 6, which does have the inclination to respect those in power, in turn to receive support. It may be possible you are a counter-phobic 6? I'll leave this link here, if you're at all curious to read more! I hope my experiences and point-of-view may have helped in some way, please let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions!"
3960,isfj,"I love tradition in that I'm a sentimentalist and like having holiday traditions or my own little time markers that I practice. But I am above all things practical. I will not let tradition get in the way of efficiency. I definitely want a framework for how things were done in the past and why in a working situation, but that's because I find that information necessary in analyzing if it's being done well enough. Tradition for its own sake outside of sentimentality or practicality drives me nuts. ""We've always done it this way"" is not a valid answer for why you are doing it that way NOW. / end rant lol"
3961,isfj,"Thank you so much for posting this. I have often doubted my ISFJness because of poor function descriptions. People say to look to the functions to determine your type, but when a lot of the descriptions of the functions are inaccurate it can just confuse you more. A lot of the descriptions of Ni I've seen give it all of the positive commonalities between it and Si while giving Si all of the boring traditionalist stuff. "
3962,isfj,"Good stuff. A few more points I'll tack onto that -
From my friend on the difference between Sensation and Intuition:
And from the fantastic IM Element Semantics article, which I reference constantly:

health and hygiene, medicine
food, drink, and nourishment
how natural or unnatural something is
immediate experience (sensory experience, how something feels physically; enjoyment or annoyance and irritation caused by immediate experience; subjective sensory quality)
taste, touch, smell
comfort and discomfort, pleasantness
convenience and inconvenience, easiness
one's environment, where one lives, one's daily life and activities

harmony, balance


how things develop and change over time

consequences (of one's actions, etc.)
permanence and impermanence
death, decay
roots, origins
guidance (doubt about or faith in something, fate, destiny and purpose, legacy, one's direction in life)
priorities 
profundity, depth, subtlety, significance, meaning
narratives, interpretations
caveats and nuances
irony, paradox
mental imagery, memory, visions, dreams
archetypes, reminiscence, being reminded of something
planning ahead
inevitability
mystery, magic
"
3963,isfj,"I think one of the biggest things I dislike about the description for ISFJ is it makes them seem like mindless, dull followers. I imagine ISFJs hate that, too. They don't seem shallow or unintelligent to me at all, if this subreddit is any indication. They seem highly thoughtful of their actions and what they believe. "
3964,isfj,"Vs
• caveats and nuances
 • irony, paradox
 • mental imagery, memory, visions, dreams
 • archetypes, reminiscence, being reminded of something
 • planning ahead
 • inevitability
 • mystery, magic
I appreciate you adding to the discussion, but this is why there are soooo many mistypes. "
3965,isfj,"I'm not saying (nor is the author of the linked article) that these qualities/emphases are exclusive to Ni doms, but that they fall under the domain of Ni. 
At any rate, sorry to offend. I think ISFJs are one of the deepest, most mysterious and most soulful types, but not in a way that emphasizes mysticism; that is Ni. 
If I had to reduce the introverted perceiving functions to a single word, I'd say Ni = fate and Si = harmony. INFJs live and breathe the dynamic flow of time (consequence, decay, inevitability); ISFJs live and breathe the internal integrity of a situation; they effortlessly understand how to maintain homeostasis, not just physically but emotionally as well; they know how an object/person/situation will affect them, and how it will affect others, and how to harmonize any uncomfortable discrepancies. 
I do think that symbolism is overly attributed to Ni; Ni values externalized symbols, ie collective archetypes. But Si-doms seem to live in a symbol-rich world as well, only theirs are individual, ineffable and subjective (hence the mysteriousness)."
3966,isfj,"So something that has been confusing me lately is the idea of Fe being used to help Si dominance.
As I understand it, while Se seeks to collect the sensations of a ""thing"", the Si dominant tends to assume they know what the thing feels like and perceived into that assumption to reference a primordial image. To put this into a real life context, imagine I put a SUPPPPPER fluffy blanket in a room with an Si dominant and an Se dominant. The Se dominant is gonna be overtaken with energy and motivation to feel the blanket and to ""collect"" the ""data point"" i.e. what it feels like.
​
The Si dominant on the other hand will look at it and pretty much assume they know what it feels like. They might want to feel it around them, but only because they have an idea of what it feels like and they might want that at the time. The Se user doesn't presume to know what it feels like until they feel it. Sometimes the Si user is wrong, and they will experience a sensation from the blanket and their world will be thrown for a loop because it ""doesn't feel like it's supposed to."" The other element of Si is that they are referencing internal models of things like fluffiness. How do these internal models present themselves to you? The Si dominant is more likely to peer into the sensation that has overtaken the Se dominant. Understanding a fluffy blanket as a means to giddiness and trying to comprehend the way giddiness arises as a holistic model of sensations.
​
Secondly, how does Fe help you? How does it help you communicate Si to others, how does it help you achieve Si goals or means?"
3967,isfj,"In short, Fe is a tool. We want memories (Si) with people (Fe) over the course of time. We want to experience physical sensations, actual life with others. But as we develop, our Ti comes into play and we can get a bit nerdy and for me sometime I suppress Fe to have fun with Ti, and occasionally Ne. 
Back to the original question. We see someone who appears cold (Si senses based on our subjective experience and knowing what to look for to conclude - Ti, if this, then that). Decision- use that warm fuzzy blanket as an offering to comfort that person (Fe decision). Experience: Having a cozy night in with the boyfriend, sipping hot chocolate and cuddling as we discuss life, and perhaps sprinkle some Ne/Ni theorization. 
I hope that made sense..."
3968,isfj,"I truly believe Si sounds like Ni when it comes to bad descriptions and inferior Ne can mimic inferior Se. Also INFPs can seem like judgers due to their function stack and healthy Fi can look like Fe in small groups. 
I really truly believed from the bottom of my heart and with loads of research that I was an INFJ. But alas, Earwax. "
3969,isfj,I'm in the process of coming to terms with the fact that I'm more likely an isfj and not an infj or infp. They all just sound so similar and how am I supposed to monitor my own brain functioning on a regular basis to determine what type I am?
3970,isfj,"Yes, absolutely-- both of these. For a long time, when I first was exploring this, I thought I was an INFP. But after evaluating some of the other similar types and re-testing, I then thought I was INFJ or ISFJ. I'm pretty sure I align most with ISFJs, after looking into the differences.
I don't fully know the exact functions and nuances of each, but the vibe I get is that INFP is like an extreme hippie-ish, creative feeler introvert, who might not have as much logic and is more of an abstract thinker. They just want everyone to get along, man, and they feel what others feel and they feel bad when others don't feel good-- ya feel me?
INFJ seems like a slightly more logical, straightlaced INFP. Maybe slightly less creative, a little more structured.
ISFJ seems pretty similar to INFJ, but the main difference that does it for me is that ISFJs rely more on past experiences, are more of a planner, and don't love the idea of endlessly speculating new things/methods to try. 
These are just my impressions, of course. I am not a Myers Briggs guru by any stretch."
3971,isfj,"Ha, yes I thought I was an INFJ. I thought I always had a creative side because enjoy looking at nice art and taking pictures, but I ended up realizing that I like photography because of the ""capturing the memory"" aspect of it. The more sensing thing to do.. 
""I remember events as snapshots of what actually happened"" (myersbriggs.org).  
Now I've come to terms and walk around with a really nice camera and tell people no when they ask if I'm a photographer. There goes my dream of being an artist haha."
3972,isfj,Yep I typed as an INFJ.  Very rarely INFP but I can see the similarities between INFP and ISFJ (we can be uh.. very sensitive doormats that excuse people's behaviour for them).  I'm happy sticking to ISFJ and I honestly can't see any other viable type for me.  I think the issue is INFJ being described as being able to easily read people - ISFJs are well-equipped at doing that too - they use their Si to see something isn't right with the person and IxFJ know how to cheer people up in different ways.
3973,isfj,"Kept getting INFP every time I took the test. Some folks kept typing me as an ENFP at first.
I actually strongly believe lots of SFJs are mistyped as NFPs, and same with STJ-"
3974,isfj,"I have gotten infj on every test I have taken over the past 16 years. Literally yesterday I read a thing about isfj mistyping as infj and it clicked. But now I'm super confused about what Ni actually is, if my Si is what I thought was Ni all along! "
3975,isfj,I've tested as INFJ and ISFJ on official MBTI. I think the latter is more fitting because I prefer concrete ideas and steps over idealistic ones and I like structure over fantasy. But depending on the day..... I could type as either one. I'm an odd duck. 
3976,isfj,"I've tested, relate and cannot relate with all three! 
I first tested as INFP and then as a ISFJ because I strongly relate to Fe. I get super confused over Si and Ni.
All my confusion:

I notice when people get their hair cut (Si) but feel like I'm floating through this world (inferior Se) and won't observe a bus even if it's about to hit me.
It really grates on me that Ni is always described as mystic, and usually ""right"". I find most people, including myself and NJs, usually wrong. The ""aha"" moment also bugs me. Images, impressions, solutions and ways of doing things just kind of appear but rarely as a explosive thoughts like ""hey! idea!"" Maybe that's a more accurate descriptions of Ni, or maybe my Ni is faulty, or maybe I'm truly operating in Si. 
I definitely think mostly, if not almost completely, in pictures and impressions which screams Si. But, Ni people also think in pictures. For example, I know an INTJ who thinks exclusively in pictures. And pretty sure picture thinking is common among all types in general.
When stressed I need to exercise excessively, and then I really focus on how my body feels in that moment, or eat cheez-its non stop, which suggests in the grip Se for INFJ. But doesn't that suggest Si too? I think Si craves those kind of inwardly bodily sensations.
I don't relate to being in the grip of Ne for ISFJ because I'm okay with and welcome change. 

So /shrugs who knows? I don't. Si and Ni are super weird."
3977,isfj,I have the exact same problem. I am very similar to both INFJ and ISFJ (and to be honest i wish i was an INFJ). Though the more I read into ISFJ the more i realise that I am one. I realised because I am definitely more sensing than intuitive. 
3978,isfj,"I just came here after thinking I was and spending a lot of time at /r/infp.
I've retested twice now as ISFJ and decided to finally do a little more reading up on the type and I feel like this might actually be the right place for me"
3979,isfj,"Hey everyone. I'm an ISFJ male who's been in a relationship with an ENTJ female for the past few months, and all in all, things have been going very well. Even though we are undoubtedly extremely different in how we approach problems in our daily lives, we both find our difference in perspective to be enriching and complementary, covering each others' flaws. But in all this there is one thing that we haven't seen eye-to-eye at all, and that's on drinking alcohol (well, high-risk behaviors in general, but alcohol being the most frequent topic.)
For context, I'm the type of person who is very rules- and experience-based in my approach to drinking. I did not start drinking until I was 21, and even then, my tolerance is extremely low, often leading to bad experiences with alcohol, even when I was careful. Lately I have gotten much better at holding my drinks, but to this day I really do not see the appeal of drinking at all, and thus limit drinking only to special occasions (maybe once or twice a month).
On the other hand, my ENTJ girlfriend drinks reasonably often (typically between 1-3 times a week). That said, she is extremely responsible with her drinking - she's never felt ill from drinking, nor have any major issues arisen as a result of her drinking. And yet, every time she drinks, I find that I'm beside myself with worry, even though she's never done anything to warrant it. Lately I've expressed my concerns, but she insists that I not worry about her drinking habits. I totally understand that I shouldn't be worried, but I find myself always getting anxious about her drinking, even though it's not my responsibility. I don't want my own fears to get in the way of our relationship, so I know that I need to change.
What I want to know is if anyone else has gone through this before, and how you deal with anxiety in general. How should I go about getting over my fears and letting my girlfriend live her life the way she wants? As it stands, I don't want my anxiety to potentially get in the way of her social life...so, thoughts?"
3980,isfj,"I understand your concerns. Im not much of a drinker myself
To be honest, as far as I see, as long as she doesnt like force you to drink and hasnt like physically or psychologically  harmed you while drunk you should give her a chance
If actual problems pop up then thats an issue, but for now just trust her, its only been a few months"
3981,isfj,"This has been an issue in my relationship as well. My husband does struggle with alcohol issues, but it’s easy for us as ISFJs/light social drinkers to worry even when we don’t need to. 
Even though it sounds like your girlfriend drinks responsibly, you may benefit from attending Al-Anon meetings. These meetings are support groups for friends and family of alcoholics and can help you maintain good boundaries and offer support without creeping into codependency. "
3982,isfj,"Because my parents both drink and mom has been a bartender my whole life, I spent about 1/3 of weekends as a kid in a bar. I'm not a fan of the bar environment and I get the anxiety part; my mom likes to drink/party away her depression and anxiety.
As long as your girlfriend keeps it in check, you guys should be ok. I saw a friend who sounds a bit like your gf marry someone like you and they're about to celebrate 2 years."
3983,isfj,"To clarify since the title isn't very specific I'm referring to how long will you stay with someone you love (whether it be a friend or partner) even if it's not a smooth ride. Being an ISFJ to me means that I'm loyal to the end. But as I'm growing and learning I am coming to understand that I simply cannot hang on to everything. Letting people go is incredibly hard for me, the people that really matter to me, the ones I love and care very deeply for. So, how long will you stay and try your hardest to make things work before you call it quits? What makes you call it quits, what really draws that line? "
3984,isfj,"In my past relationships, I've stayed to the point where the person breaks up with me. It does a lot to me psychologically, but I try to see the best in people and do it in the hopes that person will change, but I've learned that they never do. They have to want to change and there is nothing I can do about it.  "
3985,isfj,"I'm very stubborn in this way.
Honestly, if I really love them, I'll stay until the very end, or until they end up leaving me.
It may not be a functional or healthy trait, but I just can't bring myself to walk away from someone I love."
3986,isfj,"In my first relationship, it was my online friends at the time telling me that he was bad for me, they loved me and would be there for me no matter what. Knowing I wouldn't be alone if I left, and hearing people I loved telling me they were concerned... that is what really made me start to wonder. Even in the end (at the time), I thought I was the ""wrong"" one for leaving. Now, I am fucking disgusted with who he was and what he did to me. So abuse and knowing I had a support network helped me draw the line.
In my second relationship, it ended mostly because my feelings were never respected. Also there was a distance issue. But I still talk to him and we are still friendly--but every now and then he just really pisses me off. I tell him a lot, ""I love you but I hate you sometimes."" So I quit the relationship but I did not have to let him go. But I would say a lack of respect (of my feelings) is mostly what drew the line for that one, and the distance was difficult.
Some of my friends, I have been too quick to let go of over perceived slights. I wish I had not acted when I was upset. Then again, all I did was unfriend them on FB after they hadn't talked to me in months and I had texted them a few times... so it's not like I went full psycho or something (don't want to give the wrong idea).
Some of my friends, the ones who were there for me and told me they loved me -- the ride is not bumpy per se but we do not keep in contact very much any more. Don't play the same online games, etc. But when we do talk, it doesn't matter how much time has passed. I tell this to my dearest friends: ""Please, if you ever need, do not be afraid to call me no matter the time. I will be happy to help you, and I mean it."" I feel silly to remind them but I am also happy to remind them every now and then.
So that was a lot of rambling but I hope it helps somehow..."
3987,isfj,"For me , it's till the very end , my longest relationship lasted 5 years and it was ended by him although he was very manipulative  , I was willing to go as far as he would take it , I care a lot which is my undoing , and when it was over I played ever situation in my head to figure out what I had done wrong , and it  takes  me a long time to get over someone ."
3988,isfj,"Same here. I couldn't leave, even if I was unhappy. I understand, I just wanted to see the best in them and hope that things would improve somehow or change. You're completely right. Change is up to them. I struggle with not feeling like I need to make that change happen somehow, or fix it in some way. I'm learning that it's something out of my control."
3989,isfj,"Stubborn is such a good word for it. If I feel something real, something that I know I love, I'd do the same. It's not healthy in many cases.. I've been used and hurt so many times that I amaze myself with my continued determination to hold on. I can't bring myself to leave and call it quits. That's giving up, that's ending and making a huge change."
3990,isfj,"I relate to a lot of what you talked about and experienced. I am prone to stay in emotionally abusive relationships. I also act too quickly in emotional states because I'm frantic to do something. 
There are a few close friends that I still have that I am always there for and want to be there in any way if they need me. I also love to remind them that I really care and that they can come to me if they need someone once in awhile. I worry heh.
Helps a lot, I feel the same as you about a lot of things. I feel better knowing that others have felt the same and understand where I'm at. I appreciate you sharing c:"
3991,isfj,"I don't know if it's just me, but I've always taken it a little too personally when I realize that someone doesn't like me.  I'll feel this quiet sort of hurt, and spend time trying to contemplate why they might not like me (of course, it bugs me even more when someone dislikes me for no reason.) So other ISFJ's: how do you feel, or handle it, when someone dislikes you?"
3992,isfj,"not well at all & i take it very personally. if im being honest, an unhealthy habit of mine is assuming that people dislike me, even friends, until we become so close that i'm absolutely positive that they don't. "
3993,isfj,"Yeah this can really hurt and destroy my confidence or ego. It's hard for me not to take this personally. How I handle this is by realizing that you can only do so much to get people to like you and in life there are going to be people that dislike you. Also, I try to figure out why they don't like me so I can improve if necessary or if I think what they are saying is inaccurate I'll ignore/tune them out. I know we as ISFJs can be super friendly and kind and want other people to like us. Spend time with people that love you can remind you that you are a great person.
Edit: this article talks about ways this is a common issue for Fe users and what to do about it https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/09/06/why-infjs-isfjs-enfjs-and-esfjs-struggle-to-let-go-of-bad-things/"
3994,isfj,"I'll try to logic my way around why and if I can't, it bothers me more. Like I'm still wondering why a receptionist I walked past yesterday gave me the glare of death. I keep reminding myself that feelings aren't always rational. "
3995,isfj,"It used to be the case that it bothered me and made me feel that I had done something wrong. Then I would forever feel ill at ease around that person and would make a special effort to try and change their opinion of me.  
That has changed as I have gotten older (I’m 43 now). Some switch flipped around the time I turned 40 and now IDGAF anymore.  
It’s liberating.  "
3996,isfj,"Hurt initially, but I can let go, kinda accept it.. I don't expect people to like me, infact I am shocked if someone says they like me, but still it hurts me when someone doesn't like me, I've improved a lot over the years though, I can let go.. but then I tend to feel very self-conscious around them. I don't want to be a bother, more than anything."
3997,isfj,"It bothered me when I was younger. 
​
It doesnt really bother me at all now that im older (when I hit late 20s / early 30s)
​
I just dont really care what a lot of people think anymore and why should I? I cant control that. "
3998,isfj,"Hi hello, are you me? Because this is one of my most terrible habits. I ALWAYS assume some people dont like me and even go as far as overanalyzing Facebook ""likes"". I assumed my boyfriends sister doesnt like me because she never likes my stuff on FB. I SWEAR. It's so bad. "
3999,isfj,"This is me except when I’m not in constant contact with my friends😅 If we don’t talk frequently or see each other I start doubting our friendship & it crushes me internally LOL. Also depending on context, but majority of the time, I’ll cry 😬"
4000,isfj,"There's this girl in my group who I want to be friends with. I'm not sure but she seems like an isfj. She gets along with everyone and is really good with people...but she's definately not infj. She's an ambivert and really connected with her friends...but somehow I just don't get through to her. I'm guessing this is becuse she doesn't relate to my thought process of Fi. She finds me unrealistic, a  head in the clouds person and impractical, while I find her as a person who thinks too much about what people think and judgemental. Like idk if it's something personal against me or what, but she keeps insulting me in small ways whenever she can and it's really irritating .we never seem to agree on anything much but I do so If just to keep the peace. Please advice needed? How do we get along? "
4001,isfj,"There seems to have been an influx of INFPs and ISFJs trying to come together. It makes me happy. 
That being said, it is a bit tough to see eye to eye. We ISFJs can be stubborn and hard-headed. It doesn’t seem like she’s too interested in being friends. Try to be open and honest with your desires and actions. Even tell her that you wish to be friends. It may take time, but show her you’re for real. If it doesn’t work, then let her be. No one can force anyone to like them. "
4002,isfj,"I’m a ISFJ with three INFP friends. The one I connect with extremely well (kinda my SO), another is one I connect really well with emotionally, who’s like a mentor to me, and the other is a distant friend who we used to talk a lot, but just aren’t around each other enough.
In my case, I really get along with these INFPs because they share similar values. We also can connect emotionally, and be extremely honest about how we feel about things. We usually have some similar interests, and like to share personal experiences. 
I think the only issues I’ve really had with INFPs is when they let their “in the movement” emotions control how they act towards others. A few times an INFP friend has acted rude towards me, and then I feel really bad because I feel like it’s my fault or they’re just mad at me. I then find out later they’re only in a bad mood because of a test grade, or of the sort. I’m not used to that because if I have negative feelings or other emotions in general, I try to keep them in line so I don’t take it out on others. INFPs (although not meaning to) seem to have a harder time doing this.
I’d suggest trying to have an honest talk with her in private, saying how you feel and ask what’s up? "
4003,isfj,"Fi and Fe just have a hard time seeing eye to eye. Not to mention N vs S.
My SO is ISFJ and from my experience (for what it’s worth) is that she has a hard time respecting the abstract and stresses out over helping other people out. She’s basically a mother to all her friends and leaves next to no time for herself to recover or even get a proper sleep.
This contrasts heavily to me. I will put myself first over others (with the exception of my close loved ones) and make sure I’m taking care of me and my needs. Also she’s even more stubborn than me and that’s saying something. Make sure to choose your words wisely, no accusations. Even if you don’t mean something as an insult she might take it as one. 
Don’t know if this helps or not."
4004,isfj,"She seems like a really nice person. I feel like I'm lacking something if I'm not friends with her, tbh. Unfortunately, it is second nature for an infp (me) to just bring peace to the situation, and I cannot confront her witty comments and sarcasm. But she gets along with everyone else just fine, so I thought, 'why the hell not?' Or atleast understand why this is so difficult ."
4005,isfj,"Yes I've had that experience in the past with her, where she couldn't understand what I was feeling because of my pendulous mood swings. But now I'm better than that and don't let my emotions take over as much as I used to...
The thing is, she's going to be my roomate from next month, so for both of our sakes I don't want for it to be like, awkward between us. I want our relation to be open, without taunts and sarcasm, even if we both may not agree on something."
4006,isfj,"So I have a very low tolerance for certain loud people who tell anyone who will listen about their problems or brag about their lives. Especially if those people have nothing worth bragging about. It's like they just want to be heard. Everyone around me is just as annoyed as I am by them, but I feel compelled to shut them down. Especially when they start to use their loudness to bully other quiet people. I can't stand it. And when I tell them to back off, they get extremely offended and talk shit to everyone about me. I had to deal with one girl like this in grade school and I currently work with a guy that does it. Some call me a hero for calling those people out but they never back me up in front of them and I end up looking like the bully. Any other ISFJ's experience this?"
4007,isfj,"I could never tell them to be quiet, but I do get very very annoyed. My usual method is just to not look or act impressed with anything they are saying. I call them AWs (Attention-Whores). I have no tolerance for them as a friend.
My current roommate is an AW and he likes to brag about everything he does. I smoke pot daily, but I never mention it. If he smokes pot one time a month, he has to walk in and brag about how high he got, how dank the weed was, blah blah blah and it pisses me off. I smoke, I don't brag about it. I drink, I don't brag about it.
It bothers me so fucking much. But I could never tell him that."
4008,isfj,"Before my husband transferred he had a boss that did nothing, but brag and quite loudly. The more he drank the louder he got. Long story short? We are now in a more desirable area with a less egotistical asshat for a crew-leader/boss. This guy was so loud, obnoxious and grating I cannot remember half of what came out of his mouth. Only that it was usually open and saying irrelevant crap about his belongings and accomplishments.
Yech."
4009,isfj,"""AWs"". Haha, I like that! I'm stealing it. Gah your roommate sounds like a major AW. Maybe it's just me that feels the need to say something back to those people. I'm a bit of a bitch, I guess. But I do always feel terrible about doing it!"
4010,isfj,"Female infj here. For a while now I've been spending time with a male isfj in a small group setting, as he is a friend of a friend. There is obvious chemistry between us, and at this point I believe he knows I am interested in him ( I also believe he is interested in me).
The problem is, he is incredibly shy with me one on one. Like, to the point where he can only say one word at most, and will not make eye contact. Over time, with our small group of friends, he has grown to be flirty with me, but it seems the moment we are alone he is paralyzed.
I can relate, as I am very nervous around him as well, but not in such an extreme manner. However, my problem is we don't text, and things are moving very slowly. I know he deals with anxiety, so I was thinking of asking him out.
Male isfj's, how would you like to be approached when being asked out? How can I avoid scaring him? I am somewhat social awkward myself, so I haven't found a way to naturally suggest texting. Honestly, I was hoping to ask him out tomorrow night after our group goes to the movies.
Any tips, or advice? I really like this guy and I think we could be a great match. Thanks!"
4011,isfj,"I can't say how he'll react, and I probably wouldn't react the same as him due to the fact that I am not as anxious as he sounds. However, if it's what you want to do, you should! He may be caught off guard and nervous, but if he wants to go out with you, I can't see him saying no. Besides, I am of the belief it's better to have an answer than wondering what could have been."
4012,isfj,"Not sure if he is anything like me because I don't consider me that nervous around girls. However that also took some ""practice"" and getting used to. However, the worst thing about dating for me is escalating from being (obviously) interested into each other to making a move. Every single time I was on a date and we were about to say bye and I was thinking if this is the moment I chickened out. That all or nothing situation freaks me out.
What worked every time was to somehow start cuddling and then go for it.
Although, he seems to be already uncomfortable having a normal conversation. He might be into you and constantly screaming in his head to himself: ""Don't mess it up, jackass!"".
What might work:

Ask him about something he is interested in.
Make it clear that you enjoy being with him.
Bring up suggestions for topics or activities so he doesn't need to worry that you don't like it.
Choose low stakes stuff where he doesn't worry about failing in some way.
If he tries do something for you in any form. Let him do it and thank him.

That all sounds kinda bad when I write it down :D but he most probably will get more confident if he feels safe and learns that you like him."
4013,isfj,"Thank you for such awesome insight! I will add I've known him for about 5 years, though our group had only been hanging out regularly for the last two. And,  I've only been single since November of last year, so all of this has been an interesting transition. 
I definitely think he's constantly worried he's doing the wrong thing - he tends to back off and disappear from the group regularly, which would be normal for most introverts. However, he deals with social anxiety and low self esteem. This makes it so difficult, because I don't want to push him too far by asking him out, but I'm guessing he's been doubting that I'm interested, and may not ask me out due to this. 
I've given him a lot of great signals - laughing and blushing, staring at him and smiling when caught (then looking away coyly), talking about his interests with enthusiasm, teasing him back, ect. I'm not sure I can do anything else besides ask him out, to be honest."
4014,isfj,"It seems like you are kind of comfortable with each other and I think you are sending the right signals and it should help him.
You could try to touch him. No bold moves. Just touching his arm when you walk by or when he makes a joke. Or you can just sit a bit closer to him than necessary. Could be worth trying and see if he seem to enjoy it or if he tries to avoid it.
Do people hug each other in your circle of friends? That can be a good opportunity. If I meet somebody and they smile at me, give me a good hug (with a bit of pressure and for more than half a second) and act enthusiastically about seeing me that makes me feel great.
That is dependent on the type though. I guess some people hate being touched. But I assume that you would then see a defensive body language.
For asking him out. Try to find something that you talk about and make it look random. Ask to see a movie together you just talked about or check out that new food place together. Another good way could be to ask him for help. Is he good with anything? Computers or whatever. Maybe even just carrying something or changing a light bulb you can't reach. If time alone seems to be too scary you could also just meet in a smaller group with one or two more people."
4015,isfj,"Touching is usually something I do only once I start dating someone, as I'm not touchy-feely with anyone but my SO. I will definitely start doing that - though the last time we all went to dinner (and our friends make us sit together now, so it's habit) there was some ""accidental"" touching on his part.
Also, should I be asking him out to the movies, perhaps, rather than just asking him out? I know both of us will be very nervous regardless when I do this, so I'm not sure if he will even answer at all - and if that's the case, I may just ask him to text me his answer, if he feels more comfortable. "
4016,isfj,"I would really consider doing something more sensor-friendly than movies. If you're able to do something like nature walks or something like that - depending on what he likes to do - you might find it's more conducive to progress. I think movie don't give you a lot of time for connecting, and for an Si on a date it's pretty stressful just because we're likely to be hyper aware that are limited number of chances to make progress before the date is over.
Being in a place where he's not overwhelmed by people, maybe has a chance to talk, and in an environment he's comfortable with is more likely to encourage him to open up, and it gives you more opportunity to connect with him and show you're interested in subtle ways that aren't going to freak him out.
Sometimes just having that setting where you can be quiet together for a while can really open things up. When there's lots going on it can mount the pressure, and sometimes stop us from really doing or saying what we want to."
4017,isfj,"I do love single player games but I fell in love with co-operative multiplayer gaming last year. I found a good group of great friends to play with (GTA Online especially) and it’s been a lot of fun, so glad to do different things with friends, help them with their work and getting help with mine in return. Nowadays I mainly play online when at least one of my friends are on. It’s made single player mode feel kinda lonely tbh but I try to play them sometimes because it’s so interesting as well. I just always end up wishing I could play story mode co-operatively. Hopefully more games will have that option in the future!"
4018,isfj,"I used to be hardcore gamer. I played every single game worth to play from 3 gen to about 2008 year with some new games. I don't bother to mention all games I have played. Played WoW in highschool and dota in college.  
I quit games and I never look back. Games are shit over all. Society found gamers garbage anyway. I wish I could do it sooner. 
I am curious it is more ISFJ male thing or ISFJ girls play too (a lot). Also how about you guys looped Si-Ti ISFJs."
4019,isfj,"I grew up in a home with a pretty geeky family and surrounded by lots of games. I think I was kind of doomed to love video games, haha. I'm not mad :)
​
The Legend of Zelda is hands down my favorite game series. Of all the Zelda games Majora's Mask is my personal favorite. Something about the time of day mechanic and characters doing different things on different days makes it feel more alive and relatable to me.
​
I love Stardew Valley for the same reason really.
​
Then I also really enjoy League of Legends even though it isn't necessarily a story game. I mean, it has story but it's not really a central part of the game."
4020,isfj,"I am addicted to the Age of Empires series (been playing for almost 2 decades - pretty much my entire life); I also play CoD 4, Mortal Kombat and UFC. I have bad reflexes and can't react quickly so I am not that great in those kinds of situations. But I am quite good with careful and methodical plays and have surprised people many many times in the past ;)"
4021,isfj,"What i have been playing in last years are hoi4, civ 5, heroes and generals and war thunder. Which 3/4 are ww2 games. 2 of them are grinding mmo. 
Also i used to play a lot of battlefield games. 
Gta v and red dead redemption were great open world games. 
So i play pretty much everything."
4022,isfj,"Moral, responsible, funny, sensitive, homebody.
I'm an ISFJ male as well! Good question! Have you taken the Strengths Finder test? I didn't want to use all five of them but my second top strength was ""responsible."""
4023,isfj,"Not an ISFJ, I'm an ENFP, but my boyfriend is an ISFJ and I think I can guess how he would describe himself pretty well: He'd probably say reserved, awkward, polite, responsible, and observant.
And as for how I would describe him: Genuine, loyal, witty, supportive, and perceptive. Also, calming. That's six but oh well. He's the most calming person ever. Not calm himself, but calming for others."
4024,isfj,"Haha, you including ""pessimistic"" sounds like my boyfriend. He describes himself that way all the time and he thinks he's a debbie downer. I'm an ENFP, so I'm very bubbly, peppy and optimistic all the time, and maybe by comparison to me he's relatively more pessimistic, but I'd prefer to call him refreshingly realistic.  He supports my genuine good ideas and my hopes and dreams, but is always there to reel me in if I'm going over-the-top for something that clearly won't work."
4025,isfj,depressed? sorry.  Critical to surround yourself with good quality  people and be willing to reach out with them.  Additionally  be willing to cut ties with the ones that don't deserve you in their life. 
4026,isfj,"it is definitely easier said than done.  Life is generally simple, just not easy.  Take small step, face a little pain, but don't let it overwhelm you.  It's like a mental exercise.  After all, anti-venom is made from snake venom. 
You can do it.  :)"
4027,isfj,"Yeah, I have a theory that it's hard to identify ISFJs because on the surface, you guys can seem pretty extroverted, since you're very friendly and polite and seem very warm, haha. I didn't realize how introverted and introspective my boyfriend was until I really got to know him. I don't think I've met anyone else I would identify as an ISFJ, either, I guess because I don't know them well enough to be able to tell? But I definitely think opposites attract; all of my favorite people are along the opposite-of-ENFP spectrum."
4028,isfj,"Your theory sounds right to me. I've always been the type to be polite and only speak when spoken to. Unless I'm with my close freinds, I tend to speak out and state my thoughts more. Does your boyfriend tend to over think things too much? I have a theory that many ISFJ's do this. I always put to much thought on matters that really seem small to others and can even become unhealthy in a SO relationship."
4029,isfj,"Back when I still had had a shot with an ISFJ girl I work with just being around her made me a better person. I was way nicer, less abrasive, than I normally am due to always being in a good mood when I was around her. She always made me smile. I was more helpful. I cared, more, about how I came off to people. I put extra care into thinking about what I was saying or going back to explain something that came out wrong. I miss what we had. Then I had to go and fuck everything up. Seriously regret going to her house that night. Or at the very least I regret not engaging when she was coming on to me"
4030,isfj,"I can relate to the reasoning behind this, based on events from my childhood. Maybe lots of isfj people take on the role of ""sidekicks"" in early friendships. I feel like this makes us feel the need to rise above per se in the future. Being a sidekick is not fun, you're always being one upped and talked over. Kids are mean. Logically speaking, one would reverse the roles in order to avoid that. Maybe I'm just talking from a too personal perspective but maybe other ISFJs can relate to this too.
But aside from that I can't really think of any ISFJ that is anywhere similar to this person. I try to be kind to anyone I know, being any other way makes me feel like I'm being a poo head. "
4031,isfj,"In some instances I try to come on top but I don't actively compete in everything, and I definitely don't try to make others feel envious towards me. I much more prefer to all work together to a goal or win. Honestly I think the vast majority of ISFJ's you will meet will not be very competitive. She may have had low self esteem or grew up in a very competitive household. One's upbringing has a huge impact on how they perceive the world, sometimes even more so than your innate functions."
4032,isfj,"I am competitive. But for me it seems to be more of an internal thing, like I'm competing with others but I don't want them to know it. Whenever I get the feeling that I'm making someone feel bad, I end up feeling really guilty about it. The best example of this is something like grades or a job. I want to be competitive with others if I feel like I'm not measuring up, but not in such a way that they feel belittled. I don't know if I am making any sense with this."
4033,isfj,"I was the sidekick in this instance, but I never had a problem with it. She got a new sidekick, life went on, as it does. I try to be as kind as I can, too. But I've definitley learned to stand up for myself since the teen years."
4034,isfj,"in HS the same guy liked us at different times and she literally said to a mutual friend 'he only likes her because she's a less pretty version of me.'
months ago she mentioned to another mutual friend that no, she hadn't talked to me in awhile because i'm too jealous of her. LOL. not that we ever kept up.
the self-awareness with this one was zero"
4035,isfj,"to be fair, she has a really shitty dad and her brother is a drug addict, so obviously, unstable homelife but omg she was unbearable. literally would not shut the fuck up about herself. so condescending to me, loved to play the 'mother' role to friends and then would talk behind their backs: 'aww they can't get boyfriends. so sad.'"
4036,isfj,"When you know you're great there's no need to hate. Lol. Yeah, safe to say she harbored some insecurity. She's just peanut butter and jelly. Haters gonna hate and potaters gonna tate. Forget her. Those are the kind of friends that make you wish you had more enemies."
4037,isfj,"Yeah, the one I knew had a verbally abusive dad. I have compassion for the situation, but at some point, it can't be all about how the world screwed you over anymore. I guess that's what the college years are there for. To unlearn that kind of stuff. "
4038,isfj,"I’ve found myself struggling this much at work.
Growing up I was able to make one or two really close friends at each stage. However, I find myself always struggling after I started working. The last job took me two to three years to develop friendship. But this job has been the worst. I’ve been working at my current job for about 5 years now. I’m not sure whether it’s the change in office dynamics as the office grows, but I’m more and more unhappy every day. I always feel like an outsider and I don’t bond with anyone.
Two biggest reasons why I’ve yet to change job: 1. The benefits this job/employer provides, 2. I think people are generally decent/nice at my office yet I’m still struggling, what if the next job is worse?
Sorry, just feeling so sad and hopeless... is it a common ISFJ feeling?"
4039,isfj,"I dont work yet but i've always had like one or two strong friendships throughout my life, constabtly shifting. You aren't alone there. I'm 18 years old and im kind of terrified to start working. I don't know what to expect, and I don't know how I'm going to get along with the coworkers I'll have.
I definitely don't think you're alone in this because it almost feels like you'd be talking about my future. "
4040,isfj,"I'm actually a ENTP but I follow this sub because of my ISFJ wife.
My ISFJ wife says the exact same thing. Very hard for her to make new friends.
But even me, Mr. ENTP, it's hard for me too. As you get older, I think a lot of people close up and it's really hard to make new friendships."
4041,isfj,"I think it's a very common feeling, I have also been in a state like you are describing, however that was not in a work situation. It was in school.
A lot of these feelings are just made up in your mind, and you are the one who must change this. Other people can't do it, you have to do it! 
However, it's hard. But you just need to jump into it, just say hi, just be outgoing (for a couple of seconds) ..soon you will realise it's not as scary or bad as you imagine!"
4042,isfj,"I don‘t work to make friends. I sometimes have the same feeling as you, meaning feeling like an outsider. But in general, I am happy with my work. But I also don‘t go to work social events because I don‘t like that many people at once.
Maybe you should change your employer"
4043,isfj,I guess I suck at make friends too. Probably I often try befriend with wrong people or something trigger my Si that holds me to befriend with someone. Also I try to actually work at job and sometimes I see that someone send me invitation cue to talk but I must skip it due to work. 
4044,isfj,"Not just rely on your work in finding friends...
It may be a bit risky since there are a lot of irritating creatures but you'll be able to breath more if you don't suffocate yourself in an enclosed environment such as work.
I'm not an introvert so I am able to befriend someone in a new place if I got the right mood.
Anyways... I always make time for those who need some chat and talks. Just send me a message or something.
Btw, if you got the feeling you're alone and that's the cause of you're sadness, maybe you just need some ""out-of-comfort-zone"" moments.
Like what I mentioned in my first post in this subreddit... I love you guys. So let me help a bit."
4045,isfj,"I don't work to make friends either. But I do have to be around these people at least 1/3 of my day. 
I am trying to isolate the reasons why I am so unhappy at work, and a few factors definitely tie into my employer. I like my bosses, but the culture has definitely changed from when I first started. I wouldn't say it's worse, but just not for me. "
4046,isfj,"Thanks for your kind words. 
I think yesterday I just had a moment that I will always be an outsider at this office. While I don't rely on work to find friends (in fact I am pretty happy outside the office), I do realize I will be spending at least 1/3 of day at work. And that is the challenge."

4048,isfj,"I started a relationship with an ISFJ a while ago and it started great and it still going well. There are a few things I had questions about. One is why they don’t like to text back. And often will miss a text I send. Another is our conversations sometimes feel forced because I have to do all of the asking. I feel like I have to come up with topics to talk about. Which I do all the time in my friendships but I want my romantic relationships to be more fluid. Is this something that comes with time? Is there an explanation on why he doesn’t choose to share what is in his brain. He also never just comes out and tells me what is going on his life or anything about his personal life unless I ask. He will tell me but doesn’t openly share it with me like I enjoy telling other people about every aspect of my life and thoughts on things. 
With all this, please note our relationship is good otherwise, he makes time for me unlike any other relationship I’ve had and is really physically passionate which I love. I just wish he would let me into his life and thoughts a little more. How can I get him to do this in a way that’s he’s comfortable with?"
4049,isfj,"ISFJ tend to be more talkative when talking about subjects that interests them. What is his passion? I'm sure he has lots to share when it comes to those particular things.  
When it comes to answering texts - we don't like to always be available. Being is ISFJ was a lot easier before mobile phones and internet.. The most annoying question I get is """"WHY DIDN'T YOU ANSWER THE PHONE??"" The answer is usually that i didn't want to. But I obviously have to come up with other answers.. (was busy with the kids, was in the shower, was driving, was eating dinner with the family...)
An ISFJ is the most loyal partner out there. You just have to put up with some quietness and let them have some alone time on regular basis (because it's how we recharge our batteries...)"
4050,isfj,"Hmm well I can’t really relate to this at all. Initially I tend to not initiate conversation too much (bc I’m overthinking everything/ analyzing how I feel about the person). But once we are comfortable with each other and have been dating a while, I find it’s me who initiates most of the texting conversations. I have a lot on my rambly mind to communicate. 
Also I NEVER miss a text. I’m so aware and observant. Maybe I would miss something if I didn’t really care about the person and was just listening bc I felt bad telling them to leave me alone. But if it’s someone I care about, I drop everything to be attentive to them (or at least am able to excellently multitask even at work). 
I personally am a very open ISFJ, but idk if that’s just me. This is assuming I’m one on one that is and if the person I’m talking too seems nice and receptive...I’ll tell you my whole life story. 
This person sounds like more of an ISFP. You sure he’s an ISFJ? "
4051,isfj,"Whenever I don’t text a guy back, it’s because I’m worried about bothering them/being clingy/saying something stupid. I’m always overthinking my responses, which is why I’m so quiet. I once had a guy literally come out and ask me if I was still interested in talking to him because I was so slow with texting. 
I think the best thing is to gently start asking questions about things you know he is interested in. He will open up, it will likely just take awhile. We tend to build trust slowly. "
4052,isfj,"i can mostly relate to your isfj. i totally get delaying on responding texts. i don’t think i ever miss texts unless i’m REALLY swamped but usually i just read them in my notifications and think of a good way to reply to them. it usually is 1-2 hours when i do that. also the possibility of catching you online when i reply scares me. if we’re both online we can both see it, and there’d be no backing out on continuing the conversation. and most of the time i’m not ready for a conversation, because there’s always this need/desire to come off as funny and witty and every text has to show off my personality and stuff i just get so sucked into that. so that’s why i delay on texts as an isfj myself. 
regarding the quiet issue, yes that’s normal. unless you’re talking about something i’m interested in i mostly shut up, but i do like to hear other people talk about things. and on the occasions where i do talk a lot, it’s never about anything personal. for example i’ll listen to you talk about your relationship issues and feelings and stuff and i know i have stuff like that i wanna talk about too (eg a close relative died recently and i miss him) but i would feel that’s way too dark and it’s not the right thing to share with people.
idk man i guess what i look for in a relationship is a lot of fun and some emotional support. i admit i (or we isfjs) close myself/ourselves up too tight from caring so much about what the other person thinks. it’s the one quality i can never seem to get over myself. good luck with your SO, i’m sure he’s sweet and great and give it some time. i don’t dare to speak for all isfjs but i sure am a believer of letting time do its job. 
hope this helped x"
4053,isfj,"It could be the fear of being too clingy or overthinking his answers to be sure that he's saying the right thing.
Also ISFJ are great listeners and would rather answer questions or let people bring new subjects to talk about than being the one to bring the subject. That also can be linked to the fear of being boring.
​
Try to not worry about that, keep showing interest and that you're not bored and he'll start sharing more and more once he'll know by experience that talking about this or that subject is ok with you."
4054,isfj,"I'm an ENTP married to an ISFJ, which is not without its challenges. My overall advice, especially to fellow extroverts, is to accept that you DON'T get it, and you're probably not going to. You don't need to understand why isfj s can be very sensitive, quiet or sometimes a little irrational (in stark contrast to their many positive traits, of course!) My wife says it's like everything you could possibly worry about you do, and that includes hurting peoples' feelings, being too clingy, not clingy enough, too boring or too loud and in your face. It seems to be a constant struggle with themselves, which as an ENTP I don't and probably never will understand! That could certainly explain some of these factors...
Basically stop obsessing about the why and start thinking about what you're going to do to accommodate it better (which you're already doing)!
My advice is the same as many others - talk about things within their control, within their comfort zone and interests. Some of these things may seem mundane to you, but it's often the feeling of safety and harmony that speaks to the isfj. Don't talk too much about the future, as that's not in our knowledge yet!"
4055,isfj,"I havnt really uncovered his passion yet. Which usually is pretty easy for me. He hasn’t brought up topics on his own so it’s a lot of me asking and trying to figure it out. 
Would it annoy you guys if I text again to be like hey read my message. If they need the extra push I’m cool with it I just don’t want to come off annoying. I usually just patiently wait until I have something else to talk about and then they’ll respond to that 2nd piece but totally miss the first one. I’ve asked about it and he just says he was busy and missed it. "
4056,isfj,"Same! I can fully relate to what you have said. I never miss a text, drop everything to make time for them (other people too, oof. I need to stop), very open to most people, will tell you my life story, etc.  
​
But I just can't relate to the descriptions from the official poster. I also think that he might be an ISFP.  "
4057,isfj,"Yeah, I'm paranoid about being clingy, and I'm only chatty (sharing random stuff, initiating contact in a way that's not simply functional/routine for plans or whatever) when I have established history with someone and have received, and continue to receive, a lot of indications that they want to hear from me and I'm not imposing. 
Also, until someone is in my inner circle it is usually too exhausting to verbally process/expresss my thoughts as they are happening. Hang in there!"
4058,isfj,"Thanks for the advice. Things have been going very well. Eve thing I have had an issue with I have brought up in a casual way and he’s adjusted, really great guy. He’s strayed over almost every night and has invested in me quickly which I enjoy and didn’t think I’d find in someone else. "
4059,isfj,Be clear about what you feel/want and communicate that to him clearly. Don't drop hints. Hints are annoying. But in the end you can't force him to instant answer any text message or to share everything as ISFJs need to have some space too and open over time. If you're bored he'll feel it and if he feels it and you did not express that to him the risk is he starts feeling super guilty about that and start wondering what he did wrong and that won't help either.
4060,isfj,"Hey, smolelf, just a quick heads-up:
recieve is actually spelled receive. You can remember it by e before i.

4061,isfj,"Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:

4062,isfj,"I was wondering if there are any isfjs here studying psychology/in a psychology-related job? Currently I’m considering an undergrad course in psych and was wondering how you feel about studying psych, whether you enjoy your job etc. 
I enjoy understanding human interactions. It could be an isfj thing, but I’m constantly analysing how people react and behave, whether it’s subconscious or not. 
One thing I’m concerned about is whether such a course would be too “conceptual” & “abstract” for sensors like me? I understand that MBTI should not dictate your career choices, but I like to be cautious and I do want to hear more opinions before I make an important decision :”) "
4063,isfj,"Go for it, it's even too abstract for me.
You trust too much your own identity, when you just need to give it a try. Especially if you have affinity with the subject.
There is ways to prepare yourself and see if you can : taking psychology books at the local library, learning about the different diplomas and schools. Taking evening courses.
You can do all that without putting your current habits upside down.
If you came never achieve to make a carrier of it, you'll still have the skills. And people skills are invaluable, just on a daily basis."
4064,isfj,"INTJ, but I'm getting a masters in psych right now- Go for it! Sensors might even be better at psychology than Ns because its all about concrete facts. Psychology isn't about learning how to ""read minds"" or body language or any of that. It's a science, first and foremost, and I think sensors have the perfect skill set for a scientist. :) 
I will warn you though, be careful about majoring in it. Unless you're dead set on being a counselor or getting a PhD, the job market for psych majors is not that good. An undergrad course is the perfect introduction to the subject though! Good luck!"
4065,isfj,"Well I never studied it in college, but I took AP psych in high school and sucked it up like a sponge? I don't feel like it was very conceptual at all, honestly. It's a science, not a philosophy class, so there are a lot of very concrete sets of symptoms and stages of development and things like that. The part I had the most trouble with was memorizing all the damned parts of the brain lol. If you like it and you think it's something you would enjoy a career in, go for it!! "
4066,isfj,"ISTJ here, I am a psychology major in college and I love it. To me it's not too abstract because in psychology everything has an effect in the real world like understanding how people learn and how memory works. In experiments you have to measure something observable, so it is very concrete most of the time. The only abstract thing (that I personally don't like) is neuroscience, but if you focus on psychology that shouldn't be a problem. 
If social psychology is your thing, you should definitely consider it. It's not a very abstract field and it is likely you can specialize in that area. "
4067,isfj,"thanks for the encouragement! i’m currently still studying for my national exams so i don’t have much time to read up more but i definitely will after I’m done with exams! 
I have done some reading up on university websites, and attended a talk by a local professor teaching psych which was one of the key factors that piqued my interest in studying the subject. Sadly I don’t think university websites here provide much information on the courses, I might need to wait until their open house to find out more. "
4068,isfj,"Yeap actually one of the main reasons holding me back from majoring in psych is the career prospects, and postgrad courses here are rather limited as well. :-/ Over here an undergrad degree is generally considered insufficient to get a job (unless you do HR-related) and I’d need a postgrad degree 
edit: since you’re studying masters, out of curiosity, what job do you intend to do in the future? "
4069,isfj,"Was there any part of AP psych you disliked? I’m not familiar with the AP system since I’m not from the US but from what I’ve observed it seems to be a popular subject there? Unfortunately psych isn’t offered in our equivalent of high schools here unless you take the IB, if I’m not wrong! "
4070,isfj,"Thanks for the input! I do enjoy the practical applications of psychology as well. It was interesting to hear a psychology professor tell us that one of his students got a job in designing the emergency systems in an aircraft to be safer, based on how people would react in an emergency (if i’m not mistaken)! "
4071,isfj,"You appear to need it. It's easy for me, too. 
You're just on the door of college …
If you already know where to go, why the hesitation ?
That's what I'm talking about. MBTI never stated ISFJs or yourself, for that matter, had any curiosity.
Foster it. It will give you reasons to love psychology. If you love it and know why, nothing will be too abstract for you. Or too difficult.
Or you could directly try to reach out professors, to ask them what psychology is and why they became professors of it.
You could read biographies of well known psychologists, psychiatrists and and anyone else who chose to give it an important place in their lives.
You could read about the history of psychology itself.
There's just a fuckton of ideas to have. And it doesn't limit itself to psychology : I chose to study math, myself, from high school. One of my friend studies public law. Another settled on programming. My little sister is a car and bus mechanic.
It's about inspiration, and what fits you. Especially when you can change your mind if you come to learn psychology doesn't fits you.
You're free."
4072,isfj,"Well my masters is specifically experimental psychology, and it's meant as an entryway into a PhD program. I'm having second thoughts about it, since I want my research to focus on statistical methodology and not traditional psychological concepts (i.e. memory, personality, leadership, facial expressions, any one of a million other constructs). I'm taking a year off to take math classes and work on my programming skills before applying, but even if I do decide not to do the PhD there are options. I can work in a research lab as a research assistant or administration, scientific writing, private industry working on how to make products better for the public, marketing research, testing and surveys, etc. Not sure what I want to do, but it'll work out. :)"
4073,isfj,"I absolutely love my major, I love my classes so far, I love my advisor, and I even love reading my textbooks. It was a very good choice for me and I can't wait to take all of the psych classes I can. I want to help people with mental illnesses so I'm going to get a degree in counseling.
I will admit that I'm not very good at reading or getting to know people (even if I do care for them immensely, and also to keep in mind that i'm an introvert and I used to be very anxious), so that might be a roadblock, but with enough work I'm sure I can manage it. "
4074,isfj,"The hesitation is because i have some other courses in mind as well, but I’m trying to figure out which one I will enjoy the most. 
Thanks again for the suggestions! Will definitely look up more on those, and see if there’s anyone in the field I can talk to directly "
4075,isfj,"Me and my sort of girlfriend are dating several times. Yes we are long distance but I would like to focus on the time we ware together. 
I will give a brief overview of things that I found noteworthy. 
- The first walks with here dog ware together, but after some days she didn't like my company and wanted to walk alone. Fine, no problem there.
- I brought some small food gifts. She looked at it, tried it short and never touched it again. (In my company.) Something to do with different love languages... In addition, I hid a book in here house to find it later, she was overwhelmed and it was the best gift ever. 
- I personally don't like last minute changes. Although I know she has time in the proposed weekend, she hasn't agreed on it yet and it worried about it not being definitive. 

Most important point: Although I am the one typing the most in chats, she was the one talking throughout our dates. I was completely shut down, couldn't think of questions. Although we liked our company, we ware super silent after a while. I keep thinking about this, is this normal? Or has that something to do with insecurities and not profiles?

Apart from my experiences I wrote, I haven't seen many matching personalities. Can it actually work in theory?
Do you think it is even possible to give our selves a feature or am I trying way to hard to let this happen? Every thought is welcome!"
4076,isfj,"Your English is cute lol.
I think you should give it time :) ..it could work out, you as an ISFJ would know, we are slow moving creatures aren't we? Be yourself, give it time, see where it goes.. hope it works out :)"
4077,isfj,Yeah I posted a reddit last week about two ISFJs in relationship you can check it out. I think that it can work but since you guys have the same strengths and weaknesses you might not grow much in the relationship. I would give it a try though you shouldn’t eliminate her just because she’s an ISFJ like you. 
4078,isfj,"Not sure if that's a compliment? :')
Yea, I do know it takes time and effort, and I'm sure it will work out.
But more important in this question, I've never read in this /r about relationships between two of the same identities. How would that work out?"
4079,isfj,"Thanks for your heads up, scrolled over it apparently. It got some interesting thoughts indeed.
I wasn't about to end it right about, I've put almost an year of trying hard work keeping us together what seems to be exhausting to me. "
4080,isfj,"It is :D
I'm not sure, fellow ISFJ. I have not much knowledge of MBTI relationships. Maybe open a topic on MBTI subreddit and ask? :) I'm sure someone from other identity has had an experience and can give you some insight.. "
4081,isfj,"After looking more into the functions, I've come to the conclusion that I am either an INTP or an ISFJ. They both have Ti, Si, Fe, and Ne, which I feel describe me. I'm just not sure about the hierarchy. I know that I'm an introvert, which I've read is determined by your dominant function (thus INTP and ISFJ).
I'm more emotional than an INTP, but I'm broader and less detail-oriented than an ISFJ. The way I deal with conflict and relationships is consistent with ISFJ, but my work habits and the way I analyze problems are more consistent with INTP.
For example, I'm bored by details and routine and I'm more inclined to come up with an awesome idea/solution and then not follow through with it. (indicative of INTP) I also work hard to make sure the relationships of the people around me are harmonious and I balk at conflict. (indicative of ISFJ)
Any thoughts?"
4082,isfj,"Sorry I'm late to the party but...
There is evidence that people have four different ""modes.""  Your first mode is your first two functions and your second mode are your third and fourth function.  You see a mode is just 1 perceiving function and 1 judging function.  When a person changes the way they make decisions, they also happen to change the way they process information.
It sounds to me like you have a very good balance of your first and second modes.  This is a good thing!  However, I still believe that you are one of the two types because I think we all have a preference at the end of the day, and it will effect the lower functions.
The lower functions describe your weaknesses.  Looking at the bigger picture and including those elements may help you determine your type.  Here are two pages about the two types and how their 8 functions relate to each other.  The super ego block would be of particular interest I think.  It tends to be where people are like ""oooo, ya this one is me""
ISFJ = http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=SEI
INTP = http://wikisocion.org/en/index.php?title=LII"
4083,isfj,"My partner is ISFJ and I have a hard time interpreting what he’s thinking, so I’m asking for some perspective from like minded people.
He has some ideas of “closeness, intimacy and warm family bonds” that I find I am unable to live up to as a partner. He’s always on about how we aren’t close enough, intimate enough, and it’s serious enough to him that he’s moved out.
We have been together for five years, living together for three years. We have a toddler. Well, we are splitting, his choice. This past weekend,  I guess he has some spare time in his new place, because he started answering emails, which he almost never does, and he somehow discovered that I use Facebook, and that I’ve done so for years. 
This is what he wrote to me in an email:
“... I realized that you have an entire separate life you're sharing on Facebook with your friends, pictures and comments going back many years, and I'd never seen any of them until today. Precious pictures of our toddler even comments from my own family members that I have never seen, strange. This strikes me as really odd and a bit disturbing. It's not that your posts are disturbing, but what bothers me is now discovering that you are in this whole other world -- Facebook -- and I simply had no idea of the degree you used Facebook.
It seems to me that we've been leading separate intimate lives for so long and I never knew  -- you share your important photos and thoughts on Facebook -- and I had not seen any of them until now. It makes me feel very sad because it's clear we're apparently so different in the way we communicate with family and friends....”
So now Facebook has gone and depressed him. I’m flummoxed. He’s a friend on my Facebook, so is a lot of both of families and I post regularly for everybody, and they reply.  It’s like he thinks I kept Facebook secret from him, and posted. He seems to forget Facebook is a public forum, which he is part of and so is a lot of his family. 
Actually he’s the one who never ever logs into social media. He’s very bad at keeping track of things and answering emails, texts, never uses other social media either. He’s very much an introvert who values his alone time in his office with his podcasts.
So, the way I think, if I had found something like that, I would think it’s great, a treasure trove of cool and memories, and comments from people, freely available. A wonderful trip down memory lane. And if I’ve done something cool that he likes, why isn’t it worth a thumbs up. And if I’m so different from him in how I communicate, why doesn’t he think that is awesome too?
It’s been a real problem for me, that in this relationship, I could never live up to the ideals of “closeness and intimacy” he has in his head. And that he puts all the responsibility on me for failing to do this, without considering my perspective, that I am an independent type of person (I am ISTP). It seems he is consumed by his own perspective.
It just seems that this is another example of how I don’t measure up, and he doesn’t consider my general good intentions.
I hope, ISFJs, you can give me an idea of what is running through his head."
4084,isfj,"Would he be willing to see a therapist? I think these sorts of issues would be better resolved if you both could see the other's point of view in a safe, non-judgmental space and work toward understanding how the other thinks. Misunderstandings in communiction don't have to be the end of a relationship, and compared to other issues (like addiction, conflicting values, etc.), they're ~relatively~ easy to work out. I'm sorry this isn't more helpful, but please don't give up hope."
4085,isfj,"That's the old divide concrete/virtual. My closest ones have no idea how much I write on Reddit. They are just worried about the time I spend on it.
And even though I tell them I value personal secrecy, and I'm aware all I'm writing here is public and common property, they still think it's some intimate part of my life they have nothing to do with.
They take cultural and linguistic barriers as backup for their beliefs.
I'm pretty sure that's what's going on for your ISFJ, and there's nothing to do about that. One can't learn about the Internet culture in a snap, especially if they don't acknowledge there's a culture of it's own right in a first place.
On the other hand, maybe you know about his cultural references, though. If he can't meet you where you are, how about you meet him ?"
4086,isfj,"We have, he has. As an ISTP, his emotional needs weigh heavily on me, as my independence hurts him. Sometimes I think we do not have compatible views on life. People describe him anywhere from very sensitive, to a very particular, somewhat anxious, but very nice man, to an introverted eternal bachelor."
4087,isfj,"It's interesting, because those differences are pretty large and I'm surprised you guys made it so long without addressing them previously. 
Also your description of him as ""anxious"" and ""eternal bachelor"" is somewhat concerning, because those aren't words I would use to describe someone in a very healthy mindset, given the context of your situation. For example, his reaction to your FB activity is entirely unwarranted, because you have him as a friend, nothing is hidden, and it's public. He jumped straight to the worst case scenario, that you have a secret life and are hiding stuff from him.
In my nonprofessional opinion, I would say this has less to do with his personality type and more to do with his mental health OR his attitudes toward you as his partner. It's possible that he has negative feelings toward you, the biggest of which would be not trusting you and thinking you have bad intentions (ex. the FB thing)."
4088,isfj,"He won't want to do anything with it, once he'll know what's the nature of Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg is a NT, and he betrayed people to make it out of the idea of making people rate each other.
It's born in blood, and it's going to spill even more of it.
You'd be better off meeting him to an actual place where you have common memory. That's what emotional intimacy must mean to him.
Then, you'll have to ask why he left you. And I know you're not ready for the answer, regardless of what it actually is."
4089,isfj,"I agree. It’s not bcz of isfj personality type. It’s bcz either his attitude has changed i.e he no longer loves you or he has mental illness. If you can put up with it entire life bcz you are willing to devote yourself to him, you’d better be very well prepared for future massive disappointments"
4090,isfj,"A lot. I spend too much time thinking about this, really, and also too much time reading and writing on the subject. I annoy some of my friends because I'm constantly asking those sorts of questions and wanting to discuss them. I brought something philosophical up the other day and my housemate just rolled her eyes and sighed, ""Of course you would think of something like that."" 
FWIW, my housemate has typed INTJ on tests but I have extremely strong reservations about that typing. "
4091,isfj,I think existentially more than I should. Especially when I'm out enjoying the weather with friends I think of how life and nature is beautiful and what a great time it is to be alive despite everything going on in the world. I think a lot of people take things for granted of what we have here on earth and people should stop to appreciate what is infront of you more.
4092,isfj,"Existential bummer By Jason Silva
'Man is literally split in two:
He has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumly to rot and disappear forever.' -Ernest Becker
So there’s a great essay written by Sigmund Freud called “On Transience.”
And in it, he cites a conversation that he had with the poet, Rilke, as they were walking along this beautiful garden. And at one point, Rilke looked like he was about to tear up. And Freud said, what’s wrong? It’s a beautiful day. There’s beautiful plants around us. This is magnificent. And then Rilke says, well, I can’t get over the fact that one day all of this is going to die.
All these trees, all these plants, all this life is going to decay. Everything dissolves in meaninglessness when you think about the fact that impermanence is a really real thing. Perhaps the greatest existential bummer of all is entropy.
And I was really struck by this, because perhaps that’s why, when we’re in love, we’re also kind of sad. There’s a sadness to the ecstasy. Beautiful things sometimes can make us a little sad. And it’s because what they hint at is the exception, a vision of something more, a vision of a hidden door, a rabbit hole to fall through, but a temporary one. And I think, ultimately, that is kind of the tragedy. That is why love simultaneously fills us with melancholy.
That’s why sometimes I feel nostalgic over something I haven’t lost yet, because I see its transience. And so how does one respond to this? Do we love harder? Do we squeeze tighter? Or do we embrace the Buddhist creed of no attachment? Do we pretend not to care that everything and everyone we know is going to be taken away from us? And I don’t know if I can accept that.
I think I more side with the Dylan Thomas quote that says, “I will not go quietly into that good night, but instead rage against the dying of the light”.
I think that we defy entropy and impermanence with our films and our poems. I think we hold onto each other a little harder and say, “I will not let go. I do not accept the ephemeral nature of this moment. I’m going to extend it forever. Or at least I’m going to try.”
This resonates with me so much I spend so much time introspecting, and finding meaning in everything I put my energy into, mainly the people around me and what their happiness means with being truly fulfilled, sometimes I wish I could just stop. But it seems like this questioning of life is a natural thing.   "
4093,isfj,"I don't really think about the meaning of life in general because it's too vast a question and as a biologist I would have a hard time answering it. However, I often think about the general direction I am giving to my life and what 'impulse'  I would like to give it, if that makes any sense. 
I often question who and what I am, often to find myself disappointed. When not stimulated, my mind often gets stuck in a loop of thoughts about my current life. I would compare it to wandering through grey plains with old dead trees. "
4094,isfj,"I have a good answer, but it's both a private joke and an ironic dirty joke. =O
It would have been ironic, because it basically says I have no I idea what life is about, I just, well … blush
I'm not sure if you guys appreciate of my Ne dom nonsense and rudeness, anyway."
4095,isfj,"You don't seem to realize how happy your reply makes me.
Fe users usually care a lot about properness and respectfullness.
And Si user obviously struggle in front of Ne nonsense, as I struggle daily, kneeling in front of Si/Te structures that either neglect me or reject me, each time I put my Ne to work.
It means you're free."
4096,isfj,"But ISFJ also have Ne, and in theory because its our weak function they should be drawn to it, if not then at lease be able to understand this type of humour. It what give you the witt, charm, even when blurting out inappropriate observations or the what if questions no matter how quirky it is, there is awkward charm to it.  
But you are right some people take themselves too seriously they forget how to enjoy life. Just continue being you. "
4097,isfj,"I'm curious to know what all of you guys do for fun, and/or if we have any similarities in what we enjoy doing. 😊
Personally, I feel like my hobbies are kind of lame, but I do enjoy them.
I'm really really into photography (though I'm not exactly talented at it), I love reading, and I love watching movies.
I also occasionally have random bouts of creativity where I'll pick up something random, like knitting or crafting. 
What about you guys?"
4098,isfj,"Reading, cooking and baking, fine dining, and I can talk to my wife for hours on end (when we actually get to spend time together). The last one is not exactly a hobby, but it does give me a lot of joy and satisfaction."
4099,isfj,"First thank you so much for the resources posted in the pinned post. I feel more confident that I am  a natural at showing my ISFJ love. :D 
Here is my situation.
I am an INTP lesbian in a long distance relationship with an ISFJ highschool teacher. I love her so much. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. Did I mention she is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life? Well, she is. She is the smartest, most beautiful person I have ever met in my entire life. 😍
Neither of us is willing/able to move to be closer for reasons. The long distance is going to be how it is likely until we both retire. Say 13 years at least for me. I highly doubt she will ever give up teaching. Seems very unlikely, why would she?
She is VERY introverted, and behaves like described in the pinned resources. She caves in her home on the weekends. However, 2 people in her life pry her out of there, so she never gets enough cave time. She gives past where it hurts.
And I get them, spending time with her is as close as you to can get to heaven while on earth.
Anyway, we talk on the phone on our way to work on weekday mornings. Other than in person visits that's about all the contact I get. Once in a while she will answer the phone after work, but not usually. I can sometimes get her to respond to a text. Maybe one in 20 or 30. So once or twice a week unless she is sick, then oddly I get texts.
Here is where my heart burn is:
I don't get enough response from her for my needs. This is actually physically painful for me. Unfortunately I am an INTP with an 8w1 sx enneagram. It's very painful to not hear from her at all, all weekend. Not even a good night text. To make it worse, she knows and appologizes and tells me she isn't ignoring me, and she isn't. I'm sure she reads every text I send. She just rarely responds. 
My assumption is that replying to my texts is not rewarding for her. Telling her I need more attention I think did more harm than good. It's true, but it added pressure.
The problem is clearly mine. How can I phrase a text that she will respond too?
Some examples of texts I can get a response from:
What are those fish oil pills you have called? I want to get some.
Why are 0 and 1 values in computer programing different than math?
Do you remember the brand of socks we bought? Gosh, they are so soft, I want to buy more.
Maybe the real issue is my 100% N and her S. Sigh 😔
Maybe I can't get any more attention than I already do."
4100,isfj,"Honestly, knowing my personality type i think she responds to those texts because they are objective (easy to answer) and won't provide contention or strain on her or the relationship. 
But I also find it odd that she won't reply to any texts, because with the people in my life who are close to me always get a reply because what if they needed something.
Maybe an in person visit would be the best place to talk to her about this "
4101,isfj,"I have had a few long distance relationships and I will have to agree that it’s a bit odd for her not to reply to your texts, unless of course she is super busy or going through a rough time personally.   But then you mentioned that you talk(call) on weekdays on your way to work so I think that’s a good sign. Generally, I like constant communication with an SO but prefer calling over texting as I get to have more meaningful interactions through that. Maybe she is like that? I will refrain from theorizing any further why she doesn’t text as much as you want her to, but instead agree that it could be that you just have different needs when it comes to the level of attention in a relationship. By the way, how long have you two been dating?"
4102,isfj,"long distance relationships are objectively tough. I can't do them, but a dynamic of them is people can't respond immediately or be there for you more with than just words. You seem like you either need to understand she can't respond to you always when you need it, so work on becoming less emotionally dependant, or move closer to her. Finally the last and hardest solution is meet someone you can hang out with in real life, say that you can't do the long distance thing.
If hanging with her is heaven, maybe you should drop everything and move there, given it's heaven."
4103,isfj,"My ISFJ bf and I were long distance and we were constantly texting.
From what I know high school teachers are never really off the clock except during summer. There's grading, lesson plans, and now they have to answer emails from students. As an introvert this sounds exhausting. She could be too busy and tired to text."
4104,isfj,"As many have commented, long distance relationship is a challenge. I’m an ISFJ myself, and just a personal preference, I’d rather spend my time talking on the phone for hours rather than texting. Maybe ask her if she prefers doing that too? Or maybe she’s busy? "
4105,isfj,"Thanks everyone for the advice. I feel like I have what I need to get this fixed up. I am just not sending the right words. You are awesome! Really appreciate the help. She is so worth it. 😍
PS Rhetorical: That ENTP guy. What's he doing in here? LOL. If I wanted their advice I'd have gone to the ENTP subreddit. Sorry, I know you don't like  conflict, but seriously. The ego on them. It's amazing. I bet they play baseball a lot. Huh. I'm off to go research that now. "
4106,isfj,"Follow up: So it's going well I think. This group was very helpful in helping me focus on where I was going wrong.  She mentioned scheduling me in, and I mentioned that I'm worth 5 minutes of her time daily as she spends her time on important things. I am  important too, but not in a time sensative way. 2 1/2 minutes early in the day. 2 1/2 minutes later in the evening. I actually am wrestling with a lot of guilt about it, but I need that regular attention. Everyone else is getting more than that. I am also sticking to the short amount time that I asked for, and  I'm good with it. No idea if she is. She is too exhausted for me to tell, and the week off for the holidays can't come soon enough for her, and then it will get worse with her community theater company revving up to perform their production after the holidays.
We still keep our morning commute chat. Today she got hear me cuss out what I think was a drunk construction worker in a van after we nearly collided. It's good to see/hear people at their worst. Never thought that she might be the last person I ever talk too though.
So thanks a heap for your advice, it was super helpful. "
4107,isfj,"Also tyvm for your reply it means a lot. So I take it Just texting: ""Hey."" would be a better way to get a response. (I do need something. I need a little attention. but that doesn't seem to be an actual need to her.)"
4108,isfj,"Over 2 years. She used to text more at first when it was exciting and new. I think I got spoiled. Also it was over summer when school was out, so she had more time.
I've decided the problem is what I am texting her, I suspected this.  After carefully reading all the kind replies this is my conclusion.
""Hey""  Seems like an excellent thing to text her. For me, I would be angry if someone texted me that (say what you want) so I don't text her that, but ""hey"" she isn't me, and I believe those 3 letters are the key here. That's the point of the MBTI, understanding our differences.
Also yes, she much prefers talking on the phone. She even uses her voice to send text messages.
And yes she stretches herself way too thin.
Yes, I feel bad for wanting her attention. Can't help it tho. Sigh"
4109,isfj,"Excuse me? I was asking the ISFJs. What are you an ENTP? I'm going to study what you wrote and do the exact opposite. LOL. Dude I learned long ago to do the exact opposite of what an ENTP tells me. Thanks, I guess, for the advice. It confirms I am doing the right thing."
4110,isfj,"Exactly , and the problem is that I need some attention on the weekends. I really think I have solved getting a reply.
I got a text last night by being ridiculous LOL Which worked here. And I'm going to try just sending ""Hey"" this coming weekend.  
I love you all so much. ❤"
4111,isfj,"Re: PS rhetorical. This is an ongoing thing on this sub! 
One time an ENTP came on this subreddit for advice on his relationship with an isfj, and then he rejected everyone’s advice except another ENTP lurking in here. Lmao. At least you know what you’re after. "
4112,isfj,"There's always something to say, but maybe she sees conversing with you as pointless and unnecessary. It could be that she does not see that strengthening the relationship is rewarding, or that talking to you is boring.
Honestly, she does not sound very nice or empathetic, which is odd for our personality type. Like sure, I'm an introvert but if someone messages me I'll always reply unless I explicitly hate them. If it was my SO I would 100% reply, unless I was mad at them and wanted to prove a point. (even that wouldn't last long)"
4113,isfj,"As an ISFJ, i actually partly agree with the person you're blowing off. Long Distance works mainly off communication, but you also should consider getting to know them person to person, rather than just what they tell you over text and call. Maybe consider taking a visit to where she is if possible or in the future. I wouldn't say a solution is just giving up on long distance all together. 
The messages she responds to are simple that have a very definite answer, so something more like a greeting like ""hey"" as you think could work. You may also want to let her know how you really feel. I personally don't like confrontation, but sometimes it's very necessary. She may not even realize you're not completely satisfied. Good luck in the future, and i hope this helps. "
4114,isfj,"Oof. Please keep in mind that this subreddit isnt very big at all!
Unfortunately I don't have any advice. Personally i'm a very clingy person, i love messages from my (Intp) boyfriend in the morning and i always respond to them when i read them. 
Is she just too busy day to day? Maybe you need to schedule more set times to talk (a quick phone call every night?). I feel like texts can be hard because i cant think of what to say at the time (or i don't have time), so i leave it and then forget to reply at all."
4115,isfj,"Meh, if I wanted ENTP advice, I'd go to the ENTP subreddit. No, offense meant to you. It's an NT thing. He knows what he did. LOL. Takes one to know one.
I have visited with her in person many times and will continue to do so.  Spending time with her is magical. It's especially thrilling to see how many Jeopardy questions she can answer and then watch her pout if she doesn't get the final question.  I've gotten exactly 2 final questions right in my entire life. LOL. It's so great to watch her being so smart and adorable. 
I have confronted her about it, and I regret it immensely.  It just adds pressure. Makes her feel bad. That doesn't help the situation at all. 
I am the one who needs to change. I have to fix it on my side. If she could fix it, I have no doubt that she would. "
4116,isfj,"if living with her is heaven, as you said, then you should move to her town and try make it work, get a job there, live heaven. Most people live lives that aren't even close to what they consider heaven, so if you've found your personal heaven on earth, what's stopping you from pursuing your dreams?
Actually, do the opposite of my advice because I'm an ENTP. Total ad hominem attack? I'm not discrediting you for being a lesbian, or a woman, or an INTP, so please treat me with the same basic respect. While I have some troubles with my ISFJ, so does every relationship, and I've successfully been with her for 5 years, we live together so maybe ""making relationships work with ISFJs"" is one of my strengths, and maybe discrediting someone because of their myers briggs assessment is the equivalent of ""I don't date scorpios"".
you also realize ENTPs are the perfect opposites of ISFJ, same functions but different priorities, maybe we have more insights on how our personalities work backwards :)"
4117,isfj,"My life isn't that simple unfortunately. I did get what I need happily though. I am super glad I asked my question here. I just needed to get this one thing fixed, and I believe I understand what I was missing. Going to test it out next weekend. I feel dumb now. Nothing new there. LOL"

Your spelling hints are really shitty because they're all essentially ""remember the fucking spelling of the fucking word"".
You're useless.
Have a nice day!

4120,isfj,"Hey BooCMB, just a quick heads up:
I learnt quite a lot from the bot. Though it's mnemonics are useless,
and 'one lot' is it's most useful one, it's just here to help. This is like screaming at
someone for trying to rescue kittens, because they annoyed you while doing that. (But really CMB get some quiality mnemonics)
I do agree with your idea of holding reddit for hostage by spambots though, while it might be a bit ineffective.
Have a nice day!"
4121,isfj,"Very recently I came to the conclusion that literally the best relationship I ever had was with an ISFJ. I even had her take a test, and although it didn't work out because I had to leave town, I now know where I can find this true love crap. At the time I didn't even notice it was a duals relationship, but somehow it was like crack or some shit for both of us, insanity... 
I know you guys are closed off and hard to find, because I've only ever really connected with one of you. But if I was to find you where would you be hanging out, and what would indicate a possible lead?
I figure I might as well help you out too. As an ENTP if you wander the campus check the guys with laptops, if they have more than 10 tabs open they're probably ENTP. Initiate a little small talk, we love it, and will probably do the heavy lifting from there."
4122,isfj,"I can't speak for all ISFJ's, but the problem is I like to be at home doing independent activities all the time.  That's my comfort zone and I tend not want to get outside of that.  If I do want to venture outside it's for a reason.  Typically going to the store, appointments, job, etc.  You can probably spot me because I like to be by myself and not engage with people around me unless you make the first move.  Typically our conversation will be minimal because I don't know you very well and can't go into conversion on topics that don't interest me very easily.  I am friendly about chatting and won't cut you off, but keep in mind it will probably be hard at first to go into conversation with me.  It takes time for me to really open up and have a natural conversation.  In a social settings you will probably see me making the least conversation; I will be over by a group just listening because I am conscious about being alone in a group setting; I want to feel accepted."
4123,isfj,"You can find me just about anywhere.  I like to get out and do things, but I either like to do them alone or with one other person.  I'll be at the local coffee shop, the beach, or running in the park, but I'll be the one hidden behind a book (except during the actual running)."
4124,isfj,"I feel like I always want to take care of my boyfriend, even if he doesn't need it. Stuff like always offering to make dinner or get up and grab drinks. I always want to feel like I'm a little bit needed, even for trivial things. My boyfriend does not expect any of this, and declines many of my offers. Does anyone else feel a need to do this? If so, does your partner take advantage of it?"
4125,isfj,"This is the characteristic that I have loved most about the ISFJs that I have dated over the years. Nobody has the ability to make me feel truly loved, cherished, and appreciated the way you guys do. 
/u/LelanaSongwind 
One of the hardest lessons I've ever learned is that I have no control over how another person feels or behaves, and that a corollary to that is that happiness is a choice that I can make for myself. If I stick my hand in a fire, it's going to be hot and hurt. Pretty much everything else in my emotional life is under my control. Based on your statement, it feels to me like at some level, you're taking care of your husband not because you want him to be well cared for (an action and emotion that is under your control), but because you want recognition for it from him (an action and emotion that is definitely not under your control). 
This is what I don't love so much about the ISFJs that have been in my life. Some have been really great about being caretakers because they love having someone to take care of who gives back in other ways, while some have been great caretakers until they hit a magical and hidden tipping point where they feel that their efforts are not ""appreciated enough"" (or, in one case, not ""reciprocated enough""). Nothing changed, but suddenly Houston, We Have A Problem. 
Welp. I am who I am. I speak physical touch and affirmation as my love languages. I'll hug you and kiss you and cuddle you and tell you I love you to the moon and back, but if you're dependent on hearing ""thank you for (insert thing you do on the regular here)"" on a consistent basis, you're going to be disappointed in the long run. I'm the guy who will not open the door for you 234 times because you're strong, talented, and capable of taking care of business (or we wouldn't be in a relationship), then I'll surprise you on times 235, 236, 237, and 243 by racing ahead and making a silly little show out of being chivalrous for you. 
shrug
I have a serious love/hate relationship with ISFJs. "
4126,isfj,"My SO is chronically ill, the doctors have no idea whats wrong, but I felt the need to take care of him even before he was ill. We also did things like split chores and responsibilities. He's less capable now but he still makes dinner, does the dishes and does his best to take care of the house. He also goes out of his way to make sure I feel loved and appreciated."
4127,isfj,"i did with the first girl i fell for. it was very unhealthy though. she took, i gave. she was self centered, willfully ignored anything ""unfun"" and ignore responsibilities, and relied on me to handle stuff when they got out of hand. i had to break it off to figure out how to do my caring thing in a healthy way.
as for feeling needed. i used to need that all the time. but that was also something i realized was unhealthy. it was a dependency on others for my self worth. and i worked through that by recognizing the joy i can feel in helping others without their recognition or approval. much like how i can feel happy for a friend who got a job or a promotion due to no influence from me. but then, if i can do something to improve their lives in such a way, i would, and i'm happy they're doing well. no need for being needed, only the enjoyment of making better the lives of those around me."
4128,isfj,"Yes! I'm an ISFJ (obviously) and when I love someone/am in a relationship with them, I want to ""nurture"" them! Stuff like ""Do you want a snack? Do you need some water? Want a blanket? Do you feel sick? Are you feeling grouchy?"" I love taking care of people I love."
4129,isfj,"ALL THE TIME! 
Even if my SO doesn't need it or is capable of doing things themselves, I always have this urge in need to take care of them. 
Some specific examples include:
They mentioned that they ran out of snacks cue sudden urge to buy snacks for them
Or,  they have a headache cue urge to bring them medicine
Sometimes I wonder if I am doing too much but at the same time, I love it. My SO would rarely say thank you to me whenever I take these urges into action but lately they have been getting better at it! "
4130,isfj,"The desire to feel needed is not codependency. Codependency is one sided and emotionally destructive frequently with elements of abuse. It makes you dependent on the approval of your partner, regardless of how your partner treats you."
4131,isfj,"Recently, I (F/ENFJ) was talking to a male ISFJ in the same college's club. We've known each other since start of last year. After talking about our classmates, he told me that he's actually ""really bad at talking with girls"".
I was quite shocked since I always thought we were on different wavelengths and that he didn't like me. I thought this was kind of odd since I wouldn't tell that to a guy? Or is this just an ISFJ-way of warming up to people? "
4132,isfj,"I don't think it's ISFJ specific. If you did not have strong friendships or just relationships with a certain gender (could be even your own), you're gonna be clunky.
I think you should take that as a sign of proposed friendship, at least on his part.
I did not have the best relationship with my mom, no sisters and so it took me a while to be comfortable with girls. And at the same time, now a good friend of mine who is a girl tells me she can't make any friends with other girls."
4133,isfj,"If one sentence defined me as a friend, it's: ""How can I help you, Master Wayne?""
Imo, my major role in their life is to help and assist. The act itself of helping AND receiving their validation from doing so makes me happy. I'm vocal about my disagreements in some of their decisions and ideas, but I will still support them anyway - like how Alfred is vocal that Bruce is crazy for doing Batman stuff and he should stop, yet he still supports him.
Alfred once said, ""I will always be here to patch you up."" Well, that's exactly what I do. 
Now, on those times Batman does something rude to Alfred, Alfred doesn't hesitate to put Batman in his place. One time Batman insulted Alfred so hard that Alfred slapped Batman in the face. They both calmed down and gave each other space, but in the end Alfred was still all ""fuck it, I'll still be here for you damn you."" That's symbol that if my friends ever directly wrong me, I would be quick to bite them back but I'll still take a bullet from them.
Can anyone relate? What's your stand on this?"
4134,isfj,"Same here, i've always been player 2. The thing is, these recent years i've envied those with more protagonism (player no.1), but at the same time i wouldn't want to be in their position (at least not with my awkward high class social skills).
Still, being an Alfred isn't bad. People rely in you. It's just that, when they don't need help it gets quite lonely."
4135,isfj,"Does anyone else find themselves to be too paranoid about the intentions of other people? I've started avoiding interacting with other people because I'm always paranoid they're trying to use me or manipulate me. That they have some hidden intentions.
Or any other paranoia in general? Haha"
4136,isfj,"I wouldn't necessarily call it paranoia, but I would say I'm prone to overanalyzing people's actions.
For me, I feel like it's mostly an observational thing. I spend so much time watching people closely and soaking up details about them and their mannerisms, I notice every little change in the way they behave.
If someone seems slightly down, or they're quieter than normal, or they just act a little bit different, I can drive myself crazy worrying about it. 
Is it something I've done, or are they upset about something that doesn't even involve me? Are they stressed out, should I ask them about it? Maybe they need someone to talk to, but I don't want to pry...Was that comment hinting about something deeper going on in their head, or should I take it at face value? Etc etc.
It can be exhausting, especially because I often end up tailoring my behavior around the subtle changes I see, but I rarely vocalize my observations, so it's a bit of an internal battle.
On the bright side, I feel like it can make ISFJs a pretty easy type of person to be around, because we generally know what kind of behavior is or isn't appropriate for a situation, I think. If someone seems like they're in a bad mood, I might be a little gentler, maybe a little warmer and quieter, and I'm not going to push their boundaries at all."
4137,isfj,"Yes, yes, and yes.
My father is very paranoid, so I think it could be a genetic thing at play. Also I've had a tendency to attract shitty people into my life that have taken advantage of my companionship. Plus, bullying in school, feeling like an outsider, poor dating experiences, wah-wah, blah blah...
Like someone else said, I overanalyze people's intentions as well, but with a pessimistic twist. But I think it's just Si holding on to those negative people experiences. "
4138,isfj,"I find it hard to trust what people say. Anytime a friend or someone I come in contact with says anything, I find it hard to trust that what they're saying is the truth. Good to know I'm not the only one. "
4139,isfj,YES! I've had people that I'm very close to hurt me in terrible ways. I've even had coworkers throw me under the bus because they needed a scape goat. Now I seem to question a lot of people's intentions and wonder if they are benefiting themselves first.
4140,isfj,"I really like how you phrased this. I do feel a lot like an observer most of the time -- not participating much in group conversations but casually observing everyone talking or even just in the office, I will take a moment to look around at all my coworkers and I do notice the slight frowns, worry lines, whatever and become distracted by it.
For me, I think it also is a way of second-guessing myself rather than being paranoid. I am always second-guessing if people are being honest about how they feel (maybe because I rarely am lol). Recently I have taken to just trying to ask people straight-up ""I am worried you're mad at me, are you?"" and then they reassure me they aren't... and then I keep second-guessing it anyways.
As for the fear of manipulation, I have that but mostly with random people and not those I know well. Like I have been using Tinder lately and that's been a shitshow lol. ISFJs are sometimes known as doormats -- so I think my problem is that I've been used and abused and emotionally manipulated by more than one person and now I'm jaded and very wary of others. ISFJs who have more secure beginnings might be less like this obviously, everyone is different, but that's how it is for me I believe."
4141,isfj,"I can totally relate to everything you said. Even when I ask people if they're upset and they say no, I'm still hesitant to believe them. Probably because, just like you said, I'm so private with my own emotions, I'm not likely to give an honest answer about how I'm feeling unless somebody pries it out of me a little bit. It's not something I'd volunteer freely.
I have that same fear of manipulation. 😂 I downloaded Tinder a while back and was wary of everybody on there, because I'm not a very trusting person when it comes to strangers. I actually got lucky and took a leap with an ESFJ on there, and he's amazing. I feel like if you find the right sort of people, it's easier to trust them fairly early on, and that natural suspicion just isn't an issue. I find myself trusting people more easily if they're really open and upfront about everything. 
Some people are just completely shameless about everything, and they almost tend to over-share. It can make me uncomfortable, but it's often easier for me to be around them because I can take everything at face-value. If they're upset, they'll tell me. If they're feeling good, they'll tell me. It takes the guess work out of the equation, and I can stop fretting about their emotional state all the time."
4142,isfj,"I'm an INTJ (25m), currently courting an ISFJ (26f). To date, our relationship has been picture perfect in every way - but it seems we've hit a bit of a slowdown lately. So I've come to you all seeking a little insight...
As ISFJ's, do any of you have fears that cause you to pull back early on in a relationship? As in, fears of getting too close, being hurt, etc. Any suggestions on how to handle an ISFJ that has gone in to their shell a bit? "
4143,isfj,"I am also an ISFJ and my husband is an INTJ. I have always had a tough time opening up to people, and it definitely hinders my husband and my communication. He is very concise when he speaks about things in our relationship, and I have to take time to think out my response. Especially if I think it's negative. Us INFJS are people pleasers and it's hard to be negative and possibly lose face in front of a person who we care about. 
My husband is out right not but I'll have him give his flip side when he gets home.
Edit: try and let her talk. She probably needs to mull her words over, so get her in a comfortable space, dim the lighting a bit and see if she'll open up. She's gonna need to feel safe and accepted."
4144,isfj,"We are very private people and take a while to open up to others. 
I am in a 1.5 year relationship with an INTJ male. I will caution you that one of the toughest aspects of our relationship is communication. It takes a lot of clarification and double-checking to be sure we are on the right page. 
Also, in the beginning I kept many of my thoughts and feelings hidden. My boyfriend was very blunt and not great with tact, and I had to spell things out to him if I wanted them done. It has gotten much better now, as I've learned to express how I feel/think (altho it can take me a few mins to work up the courage, he has learned to be patient) and I just say something if I want it done instead of being upset if he doesn't read my mind.
Youre both older than us (we are 22) so you might not experience these issues if you have both had past serious relationships. 
If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask! I can also ask my boyfriend to write a comment if you'd like his perspective. 
I think this relationship is truly complementary and has really made us better people in terms of allowing us to understand vastly different points of views/perspectives (not in terms of religions/politics/whatev but just in the way that we think and understand the world). 
Personalityforum also has some good posts on this relationship. We are enigmas, so expect there to be confusion. But once you get past the hardest times, it's so fulfilling."
4145,isfj,"Thanks so much for the reply! Really insightful. She and I are absolutely going through a period of confusion right now - we had a pretty big misunderstanding about something that initially seemed like a simple interaction. She's worth the trouble, so we'll keep working on it :)"
4146,isfj,"That happened to my bf and I early on. Thankfully I managed to get over it, although I'm still upset when I'm reminded of Coachella haha (he went without me after asking me if I wanted to go, I said I'd think about it, he bought his ticket, I said I'd go, the other ticket was sold by then [same day ugh]. But it helped us learn a lot, and it might not seem like a big deal but it was to me at the time lol. Now I tease him about it sometimes but it's not as painful--and it helped us learn how to clarify and double check what each person meant etc. I hope you overcome whatever confusion you are having because if you can get past it, your relationship will probably benefit a lot from the experience at least (looking on the bright side)! "
4147,isfj,"this comes from a fellow isfj, and just reading your comments , seeing how you choose to Express yourself through words makes me smile! you guys are a big bunch of sweethearts! this sub never fails to brighten up my day, or improve my mood. you're like .. fellow teddy bears that needs to be protected at all costs. we are  so busy taking care of our close ones, but we also need to be taken care of once in a while. the best feeling, is just getting cared for when I'm down!
do you agree?"
4148,isfj,"this is so sweet! i've been so happy to have this sub lately. i feel so understood reading through answers, they're so thoughtful and kind. i've been telling myself that i need to do a better job of voicing my needs and taking care of myself - neither of which i do that well. so i definitely agree!!"
4149,isfj,"By taking care of people, I mean making sure they are comfortable in their immediate environment, i.e. making sure they are not hungry, making sure their feelings are not hurt. I find it extremely draining, and I'd rather be reading or learning or writing or doing something I actually enjoy. I also have the issue of not being able to engage in small talk, and I find that conversations about everyday life bore me. I'm ok with helping people with establishing their goals or giving them advice on personal issues, but I'm not good at the ritual of faking emotions to make people feel better. 
This has caused issues in my quest to try to form relationships with other people, especially with other females. For example, they'll be talking about something like a bad relationship, and they'll help the other person sort through their emotions, while I'll be sitting there quietly, wondering how and why people get into shitty relationships, the dynamics of a person who can't pick up on a crap person, and the like. I think I come across as too blunt and stoic or something, and people find it scary. 
I guess I'm wondering if any other ISFJs have the issue of taking care of others. You know, the process of taking care of another person's mind. I feel like I have a hard time taking care of others. I think I use Fe because I like group harmony, and when everyone else is happy then I am happy. I don't know how competent I am in my use of Si; I think I'm an ISFJ who is neglecting it or simply does not know how to utilize it. I'm pretty good at coming up with insights about people and situations, so I guess I do use it? I just feel drained in conversations where people expect me nurture another person's emotions. I prefer to give people advice on how to handle their issues, albeit in a gentle manner, but other people seem to find it rude and unacceptable. Do any other ISFJs have this issue, where people are too much to handle, and you'd rather be reading or writing than dealing with other people. "
4150,isfj,"Um...not really? If I'm in a bad mood, I'll be cranky, cynical, and have little time for faffing around and people being ridiculous. My private thoughts about how they should get their shit together can sometimes bubble to the surface in those moments. Most of the time, however, I get a lot of satisfaction from ensuring that everybody's needs are met - it's as natural as breathing to check that people have eaten, that they're doing alright in themselves, checking in on any ongoing medical problems/injuries they're struggling with, asking if I can fetch them anything, and to stop and listen when people are having a rough time. Taking care of somebody/something puts me in a better frame of mind, and balances out my mood - it's why I find having pets and volunteering in helping roles to be so essential to my own well-being. "
4151,isfj,"It depends, really. If I'm dealing with strangers, I'm much less likely to be warm and caring, and I feel awkward and strange trying to take care of them and make sure their needs are met.
If I'm with people I really love, though, then it doesn't drain me, it's how I express my care and concern for them. Then it feels completely natural, and I would do just about anything to make sure they're comfortable and content. 
Also, downtrodden people. I have a soft spot for them. If I see an elderly person, a small child, a handicapped person, etc; struggling with something, my nurturing instinct takes over, and I just have to help them. 
Emotional care doesn't always come very naturally to me, though. I've always envied the ISFJs I've seen who can help people work through an emotional problem just by talking, because I always feel like I never know what to say, and I think I come across as cold and uncaring, when I feel the opposite. If it's somebody I'm really close to, it's not as big of an issue, but if it's just a casual friend or acquaintance, I don't know what to do, and the best I can manage is a pat on the back and a few generic, comforting words."
4152,isfj,"When it are people I care about: not at all. Only exhausting thing for me would be that if they would go through hard times that it hits me as well.
If I notice that they have issues and they got this wall between them and me and I don't notice any improvement in taking the wall down I'm gone though (the last part is difficult though, since I still care about them). I would like to help people, but if I can't get to know them it's only gonna damage me.
I'm not a fan of small talk either though."
4153,isfj,"I do when I feel someone is just taking advantage of me. A lot of my job is IT support, so by 'taking care of', I mean fixing problems, showing someone how to do something, or just being a good teammate and helping out where I'm needed.
I spend a lot of time answering the same questions over and over again, and eventually I get to the point of thinking ""Come on, is it really that hard, or are you just that lazy?""
I generally don't mind doing day-to-day things to keep the office in order - taking out the trash, emptying the dishwasher, reloading the printer, filing, making coffee, etc - but it gets under my skin when others in the office (at my level, not business owners) refuse to do those things and expect me to do them instead.  Just take a turn! You don't have to do it all the time.  Just show me the same respect I try to show you."
4154,isfj,"I just feel like I'm too selfish for an ISFJ. I think I'm an ISFJ, but sometimes I wonder if I'm an Fi user and not an Fe user. I've just been having trouble identifying my type, so I thought asking questions about this might help me. "
4155,isfj,"I don't think it's selfish to not be a natural caregiver - not in the slightest! It would be selfish if you faked caring in order to get something from somebody else, but there's nothing inherently selfish about not being naturally inclined to behave in a certain way. 
Furthermore, I doubt that being a 'caregiver' is a requirement for being an ISFJ - it's more that it's a natural follow-on from how the functions might interact. I'd put good money on the more natural caregivers being older siblings, too, as there's nothing like taking care of a small child from an early age to train you into being a caregiver. "

4157,isfj,"Hi all,
Haven't figured out the flair thing yet since this is my first post but male ISFJ here and I just wanted to say this subreddit has helped me through some recent rough patches.
I've run into some apparently common relationships woes of being called ""too nice"" and feeling underappreciated but people here are so kind and affirming and immediately help me see the positives of being an ISFJ.
I've really progressed in seeing these qualities as strengths rather than weaknesses or setbacks and it's all thanks to everyone here. Thank you so much kind strangers!
Happy to chat privately with any of you going through some tough times or just chatting about what makes us so awesome!"
4158,isfj,"This was really sweet :) Yeah, there have been times where I wished I could have a different personality (generally just wish I were more assertive), but I have finally started accepting that this is who I am right now, and that's a-okay. Go team!"
4159,isfj,Yeah this definitely was a problem for me when I was younger but the key thing is developing a bit more of a backbone. Glad you like our subreddit me and the other co-mod have been working to make it better.
4160,isfj,"Hey man, how are you doing?😊 So listen, there's nothing wrong being an ISFJ's. Including being nice. If you don't want to do something, just say no.  It's nothing wrong for standing up for yourself. Trust me man, I'll totally know how you feel."
4161,isfj,"I’m the INFP girlfriend of an ISFJ and his niceness is so refreshing and lovely, along with his other characteristics like playfulness, humour, and his ability to keep me grounded. ISFJ men are really special!"
4162,isfj,"Exactly! I'm happy to have found a community of like-minded people who understand what I go through and it's relieving to know I'm not alone.
Also, on a completely different note, I love that you used the subjunctive ""were"" because I feel like it's been forgotten and I'm very partial towards it :)"
4163,isfj,"I'm feeling a lot better especially after this positive reception here!
I find myself more often wanting to help or s do something with someone but just not getting the appreciation I expect, sometimes even a simple ""thank you"" would do. I guess it just comes down to finding the right person who gets it"
4164,isfj,"People paying attention to my needs, reaching out to me first, listening with interest when I talk. Asking me questions about my thoughts or interests, doing things for me to take pressure/stress off of my shoulders, initiating physical contact, checking in on my emotional state. A lot of pretty basic stuff, but it somehow feels like I'm very easily overlooked and always have to ask for those things if I want them, and usually more than once. I've mostly outgrown resenting people for not reading my mind and I know I probably exaggerate the problem, but even so, nothing feels so genuinely sweet and flattering and makes me glow quite like someone paying close attention and showing genuine interest in me. "
4165,isfj,"Exactly this, I feel the same. In my case sometimes I even feel guilty for needing more attention than others seem to be willing to show. But at the same time every bit of affection makes my day and I want to and try to give it back tenfold."
4166,isfj,"""Why are you guys so all so boring/conservative/afraid of change/easy to take advantage of?""

4167,isfj,"To expand upon one overlooked area where ISFJs can be quite capable, but isn't exactly the core strength of the type:
One big thing that's often missed is that ISFJs, just like INTPs, can be system-building logicians. It's the Si-Ti thing to build systems of deductions and definitions. I'd wager a good handful of people who have been typed at INTP are actually ISFJs.
The key difference, as far as I can tell, is how that Si-Ti style is expressed. INTPs have high Ne, and Ti-Ne overall is expert at if-then deduction and does it fast. They see many corollaries as so obvious they're not really worth explaining or think others just get all the implications of their statement (No. We don't). With ISFJs, Ne use isn't so facile, but the Si-Ti desire to crunch things out logically and have everything make sense is strong in some. The end result? A thoroughly reasoned, consistent logical system... with every deduction spelled out in excruciatingly meticulous detail. 
A further trait that seems to characterize IxFJ attempts to build logical systems - likely from the capable but somewhat less nuanced nature of the tertiary, but also due to the above need for thoroughness - is a certain fondness of clean divisions and categories: Things are arranged in clean levels, and within a level things are a priori defined so that they're divided cleanly, evenly and the categories by definition encompass all the possibilities. Typology articles a great case in point, where many Ti writers' conceptions go along lines like ""objective attitude to abstraction, subjective attitude to abstraction, objective attitude to the concrete, subjective attitude to the concrete"", clean, even, sensible. Too clean. A fondness of these kinds of divisions is typical of alpha quadra logicians in general, but together with explaining out every branch of their tree, define the ISFJ style of structured reason."
4168,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ, after two years of programming I discovered that I care so much about details and the quality of my code, I never rush into coding, I think ahead and wait until everything I'm going to do is clear in my head. All of this made me slower than my peers but I think that is fine as long as I'm delivering high quality code."
4169,isfj,"Of course they can! I don't think that certain jobs are exclusive to specific MBTI types; however, some cognitive functions naturally compliment certain jobs. I think our natural Si organizational skills mesh well with the process of software engineering. 
Source: I am also a programmer."
4170,isfj,"Yes. 
Though I know exactly what you mean and have done (and sometimes still do) the same thing.  Learning to fully understand and decompose a problem into sane/manageable pieces is something that just came with experience.  
We tend to be perfectionists, and that can work against us in some cases. You have taken the most important step in simply recognizing that. "
4171,isfj,"I hope so as that's how I've chosen to make a living.
One thing to consider is putting in skeleton code or stubs as placeholders to get you started. I find that helps me to get over the hump of trying to work everything out first.
Once I have the structure then I can go back and do the bulk of the details."
4172,isfj,"About coding, perfectionism can never be a bad thing.
When you wrote something so well the only thing to blame is the API it calls, the OS it runs on or the hardware, you know you did a freaking good job.
Also, when you have a fully documented, explicit and structured error module, every teck will just love you when they'll troubleshoot with your app somewhere in the chain.
And I'm sure you're the best for making apps that crash for only good and explicit reasons : just as reliable as you are."
4173,isfj,"Have you looked into cognitive functions? ISFJ and ISTJ have different auxiliary functions, feeling extroversion (Fe) and thinking extroversion (Te) respectively. I don't know where to send you so I won't provide any links, but it's worth googling MBTI cognitive functions."
4174,isfj,"Theoretically, you can't switch back and forth. But you probably aren't switching between anything. You're you. And 99.9% of people aren't exact archetypes. But that's what MBTI is: perfect examples of 16 archetypes. People are more dynamic than that. I have your same problem. I refer to myself as an introverted sensor, or as ISxJ."
4175,isfj,"Hello everyone. I've really enjoyed the posts and comments on here. I'm experiencing something relatively new for me.
I've had trouble sleeping. 
When I first go to bed I will fall asleep for about 30-45 min but then I begin to dream (think?) about all the things I ever did or ever could do that we're wrong, awkward, or made people feel bad, etc. Sometimes the feelings are abstract, like just the feeling in your chest when you screwed up and you know it.
The feeling jolts me out of a sleep and I can't fall back asleep for hours. Once I do fall back asleep, it's the same pattern.
After about 3 cycles, the night it over and I have to go to work.
I am wondering if this is something to do with my ISFJ, or anxiety (which I have been diagnosed with, by my doctor several years ago).
Thanks in advance!"
4176,isfj,"I dunno, I would be inclined to say it's probably more the anxiety, but I could see how the ISFJ-ness could come into it too. For an anxiety-prone ISFJ, SiFe can really make thinking about the past pretty hellish, and at night your mind doesn't have much else to do unless you actively give it something else to chew on. 
I'm an ISFJ with sleep problems too, so solidarity on that lol. I dunno if it would help you, but I try to either meditate and focus on finding a positive feeling, or just write fanfiction in my head when I'm trying to fall asleep. Either way keeps me from spiraling off into negative feelings about the past, and helps me fall asleep a little easier. Honestly though, you may also want to see a doctor about trying a mild sleep aid or something. "
4177,isfj,"I try my best to keep that positive state of mind or else I AM doomed when I go to sleep. As I said to helioswan, it's after I fall asleep that my brain goes to those thoughts. 
I've been avoiding the medication route, but something has to give. I think I'll make an appointment."
4178,isfj,"Thank you for the reply. I try to put a nature show, or science channel on the TV for me to fall asleep too and night. It gets me to sleep, but it's once I'm in that dream state that the thoughts start to occur. I'm willing to try anything though, so I'll try music instead of TV. "
4179,isfj,"Yeah, if it's a problem with staying asleep I think medication may be a little more necessary to fix it. I totally get not wanting to go that route, I avoid medication whenever possible, but since staying asleep is really outside of your control it might be the best option. Good luck to you! "
4180,isfj,"It can also be difficult to read people. Especially if you are not the most natural inclined analytical type, or like to read behind the lines.  
I would say as an ENTP it is easier with my cognitive abilities to read people, or at least give a qualified guess. Than it most be for an ISFJ. But then there's 1000 things you're better at than me. (Just to showcase it is not said out of arrogance, or a type being better than the other).  
But I am sure you could learn it, if you studied how to, as I consider ISFJs great students in general. Your discipline, and attention to detail can get you a long way in any field."
4181,isfj,"Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let the pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place.

 I love this quote so much, I thought that I would let others who love it too that it has been credited to the wrong person. It has been bothering me for awhile and I finally decided to say something about it.

4182,isfj,"As a mENFJ and MBTI lover, I've seen far too many ISFJs that are so bitter...it doesn't make me mad, but sad. But when I find one that lives by this quote, it's seriously the most freaking attractive thing in the world. Stay beautiful ISFJs :)"

I am basically lost. I don't enjoy anything. I am a science student but going for engineering don't seem a good choice cause I feel a bit lacking on technical side. I can easily solve problems which I have attempted before but on seeing a new sort of problem gets me a nervous breakdown.
I want to know opinion of you guys about above mentioned jobs as these are the top premium career option in my country. And I will be taking risk which I am willing to risk. "
4184,isfj,"I studied electrical engineering and ended up in a career where I'm doing a lot more project/people management than I do technical work. I can't say I loved engineering when I studied it, but I do really enjoy what I do now, but I definitely did not expect myself to end up doing what I do now (working in construction)
My advice is to go for as many opportunities you can now so you can see what you do and don't enjoy."
4185,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ going to school for radiation therapy. I really enjoy the physics behind it and know I'll be doing some math in my career while also working directly with patients. This field attracted me because of the patient interaction (I was previously studying chemistry and realized that no part of me wants to work in isolation in a lab) and strong physics background it requires. My first test was creating a radiation treatment plan for breast cancer which was super satisfying to figure out like a puzzle and in my day-to-day career I'll be executing these plans moreso than creating them but it's important to understand the physics nonetheless. A lot of science has applications in the medical field (highly suggested for ISFJs)  such as medical/nuclear physics, pharmacology, etc. Explore some areas and rule out what you don't want:)"
4186,isfj,"Do something where there are plenty of jobs, you are able to be financially stable, and don't have to cling to a job. Don't go into a career path because you feel that way, best way to think about this is finding a job you won't hate. Do it for more fundamental reasons, rather than following your feelings, heart, smily faces, giggles and imaginaries.

Yes, I'm probably in the wrong sub, but still. I'm in the same boat as you about financial stability. "
4187,isfj,"My best friend is an INFP! We get each other and like the same things. I think when I’m with her I’m my best self.
Edit: I love how everyone here mentions their specific experience with an INFP. I think in other subs it would be talking about compatible functions etc.... It’s very Si :) "
4188,isfj,My husbands an infp. Sometimes it’s a struggle with me looking for empathy from him rather than solutions to issues I know how to fix. But ultimately we work out. I don’t think it could be reduced to personality types tho. 
4189,isfj,"My sister is an INFP. I think I have had a few friendships with INFPs. Overall, I like the dynamic with all of them. They can be relatively reserved. I think with the Introvert and Feeling in common we can both relate to be quiet, but empathetic individuals. I also admire how with their Ne they're able to look at a situation from many different angles which is something I struggle with.  "
4190,isfj,"So, i need your help, ISFJs. Im a male INTJ and i like an ISFJ girl. We are friends an all, but i dont know how to properly deal with her. All the times we hang out, its because she asked me out. Also, after 1 hour or so she gets this brutal urge to get more people to hang out with us, leaving me like ""why? werent we on a date?"" So, any advice on how to ask her out? Do you think she likes me? do i even have a chance?
another question, are any of you in an ISFJ-INTJ relationship? how is it like?"
4191,isfj,"My SO is an isfj, and depending on the day I'm an intp or INTJ. 
ISFJs can be very committed and loving in relationships which is awesome. For me it's hard at times as I don't explain myself fully my thought process on decisions, but I think that's more of an issue with my personality type. 
We where not friends before dating. She was that really hot girl in my class so I asked her out for an evening, had a great time, then continued asking her our weekly. 
I'd suggest just asking her out and being specific. Let her know it's a date and not just the two of you hanging out as friends. It sounds scary, but if she likes you she'll appreciate it. "
4192,isfj,"Hey look, another INTJ in love with an ISFJ.
Try asking her out sometime. See how she reacts. You do want to let her know it's a date though, usually an ISFJ will accept since they like hanging out with people in general. 
My girlfriend is like that too. She's shy around me but has no problem talking to her friends. It's probably just the ISFJ thing about not being very exclusive."
4193,isfj,"I'm an INTJ currently seeing an ISFJ and what he has said he really appreciates about me is that I'm completely transparent. So, yes, ask her out, and make it clear what you're doing.
As a female who has been pursued by many male friends, I want you to prepare yourself for the possibility that she is not interested in you like that, and that is why she adds more people to the hang outs. That was my go-to safe zone net for when a friend who I knew liked me wanted to do something. I would add more people to it."
4194,isfj,"I know I'm definitely a workaholic. If I work too long and hard on something, though, I'll burn out extremely easily and start to feel overwhelmed and unreal and a load of stuff. 
My main motivations are just wanting to get things done and over with. Sometimes it's difficult to push myself but it ends up happening. "
4195,isfj,"yes, i'm a workaholic. and i think ISFJs tend to work hard and devote themselves to whatever it is they feel they need to do.
personally, i don't really have a way to increase motivation or productivity. i think i just rely heavily on diligence. i've never felt really driven in my work."
4196,isfj,"I have a high sense of responsability and my workaholic habits derive mostly from that. Fortunately, I am motivated at work, but the extra effort I put (affecting my well being sometimes) is because I don't want to deceive anyone nor me. "
4197,isfj,"yes! and I just try to make sure I don't bring work home with me too much, which is hard working at a school. I think just finding a way to get into your 'zone' while working helps to get things done way faster and oftentimes better. for me, I like to actually sit in the midst of chaos (usually an absent student's desk, or a nearby table) because that way I am still involved with what is currently going on and can help, but I don't have to stop what I am doing or remove myself from the situation when kids need me. "
4198,isfj,"That very skinny girl with big brown eyes and long dark hair with an incredibly deceiving first impression. At first she appears mute, until you gain her trust, then the floodgates open and she won't shut up. Despite her thin frame and harmless demeanor, if you are being threatened, she will protect you. The vibes are strong with this one. No one will touch you. "
4199,isfj,"that guy over there in black hoodie and blue jeans, dark brown hair, black and red glasses, and a reserved and quiet vibe to him. He always has his Earbuds in listening to music, sometimes tapping along to a beat, rather than socializing. "
4200,isfj,"Ooh ooh can I join? I would be the witch that lives in a house in the swamp, that people seek out for advice. I wear a green dress and flower garlands, and look like any fair maiden (not the mother or the crone kind of witch). ✌️"
4201,isfj,"In the front of a crowded room, she sits quietly. Her expression is like that of still water, eagerly waiting to capture your reflection. You do not notice her in the commotion, like the eye of a hiker on a trek through a lively wood. You stop at a clearing and see a deer walk out of the beautiful fall foliage in front of you. She bows her head, and you think she is addressing you. But then, the deer laps water from a small pond, a beautifully curled leaf flirting with her flickering ear. Your gaze follows the doe, and then, in the sunlight peeking through the foliage, you see the still waters."
4202,isfj,"Explain to me yours. 
My sense of belonging can be summed up {similarly} in Edgar Allen Poes poem: 
From childhood’s hour I have not been 
As others were—I have not seen 
As others saw—I could not bring 
My passions from a common spring— 
From the same source I have not taken 
My sorrow—I could not awaken 
My heart to joy at the same tone— 
And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone— 
Then—in my childhood—in the dawn 
Of a most stormy life—was drawn 
From ev’ry depth of good and ill 
The mystery which binds me still— 
From the torrent, or the fountain— 
From the red cliff of the mountain— 
From the sun that ’round me roll’d 
In its autumn tint of gold— 
From the lightning in the sky 
As it pass’d me flying by— 
From the thunder, and the storm— 
And the cloud that took the form 
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) 
Of a demon in my view—"
4203,isfj,"I've observed a correlation of sorts in physical movement (eye movement, little physical movements,) and speech patterns when it comes to Ne/Si users, Se/Ni users, or types that are in the same quadra.  I have used this to help me in typing others, and I've been told that my typings are accurate.  I am almost positive, personally, that there is something to this, even though I do not strictly try and type people based on their physical movements and eye movements, and speech patterns.  But I've seen many people in the MBTI community say that they think this doesn't work.  So I'm curious: what do you think of visual typing?  When you're trying to type someone else, what do you use to do it?  I usually pick up some sort of vibe (""oh, pretty sure that they're an introvert, or at least value alone time,"") go based on the vibe, observe physical movements, speech patterns, and any instance of them using a particular function, to get down to business.  Sometimes when I text people I notice little things, which helps me type them.  If I get someone comfortable enough, I might even ask them questions that help me type them."
4204,isfj,"Hello, hello! Aah sorry if this response is a little late;; But I actually have some experience with this that I wouldn't mind sharing!
​
Within the past month, I came across this website, Cognitive Typology, which focuses heavily on the theory that a person's personality can be typed based on their appearance and mannerisms, or what's called ""vutology"". To give you some background, I have been interested and studied up on Meyers-Briggs personality types and the cognitive functions for almost nine years now. There's been tendencies of self doubt, and not perceiving myself properly, but over the years following plenty of research and descriptions, studying and being as similar with the material as I possibly can, I've really come to be confident in typing myself as an ISFJ. I'd like to mention I've never before had someone else type me other than my mom who isn't familiar with types or functions, but would occasionally read something if I requested it and tell me what she thought lined up with me most -- always ISFJ, or SiFeTiNe. I've heard of the idea through Socionics about typing through one's appearance, and felt very excited when I came across this website! I was more than curious, and went along with the procedures necessary to get typed by this site.
​
This is the spreadsheet one of the moderators of the website sent to me a couple of days later. I'm like, ""WHAT!?"" I've never once considered myself to be ENFP, and am most certain it's not my type in the least! Inferior Ne is definitely my Achilles heel, like I've never been more certain about being ISFJ in my life and this truly threw me off guard. Here is a more in-depth look at what led this moderator to believe me to be NeFi, and at this point I'm just at a loss for words. I thanked him kindly for his time, but my goodness I don't at all feel like this is me in the least. I am also aware I would act much differently talking to a person in person, than I would just to my camera in the comforts of my home alone. Much more self-conscious in person;; Looking at the asymmetry that the user noticed in my video made me most flustered and embarrassed, leading me to wonder if others in my day-to-day life take note of these things about myself too, and how I could go about fixing these issues;;
​
I know that this is just one experience, out of so many others that people may have when it comes to visual typing, but it more than enough has encouraged me to not look into this theory any longer;; I hope that this answer has helped, or in any way contributes to your questions. I have never personally typed someone based on their appearance, nor would I;;"
4205,isfj,"Hmm, well you do have similar mannerisms to some ENFP's I know - I guess that going by visual typing, I can see how they may have mistyped you.
I believe mainly in typing others based on eye movement, though, and also speech patterns - for example, Ti-users elaborate more frequently.  
Have you taken an MBTI test before?  "
4206,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I have noticed that I enjoy connecting with people of all origins. I enjoy learning about their lives, seeing them grow and helping them where possible. I care a lot about people and will always be there for them, regardless of how well I know them. I'm just happy to connect with people; I've also noticed that it can be extremely draining to be with other people -- especially when it is a large group -- which is normal from a I perspective. 
The part that puzzles me is that irregardless of the connection, I feel alone. I don't feel the strong sense of connection with someone unless I am in a romantic relationship with them. Do other ISFJs feel this way?"
4207,isfj,"yeah, same. there is a level of detachment. ""i want to help you but i don't want to be around you all the time unless we're dating"".
also with people that have different characteristics and beliefs and origins, they're great and they're interesting. there is so much to learn or observe from them. but the bigger the differences the faster the drain and groups make it worse. 
maybe it's because we observe and act to help, which is emotionally draining since it's such an emotional investment.
and romantic relationships are more give and take about it, the person we're with makes us feel good and refreshes our energy. so we can be attached and spend loads of out time with that person."
4208,isfj,"Yeah, this is very relatable. I care about a lot of people, and can feel great concern for them, but I only typically feel a real, genuinely close bond/connection with a couple of people in my life, usually a romantic partner, my twin, and my best friend.
I keep so much of myself separate from the outside world, and from people I'm not super close with. 
I'd say there's only a few people who genuinely know me as I am, and who make me feel like I'm not alone. Otherwise, most of my connections with people feel quite guarded and sort of one-sided."
4209,isfj,"for me, i feel like romantic relationships are the ones that easily fade out because i will do anything to keep them as a friend, i dont like romantic relationships that much. also as you said, i also really enjoy meeting new people and listen to their stories. "
4210,isfj,"That part about peoples' differences being more draining is so accurate.
I love being around people who see the world really differently, and have very differed values. It's refreshing.
But I feel drained by them so fast, and I almost feel like I'm walking on eggshells trying to listen openly to every viewpoint, while keeping my own beliefs and opinions under wraps, because I don't want to cause tension. "
4211,isfj,"I know what you mean by this. Its like i have layers of circles, (like an onion, not a parfait. Upvote to anyone who gets that reference. Lol). But if you make it to my inner circle, i dont find your company draining, and my most inner circle is even a recharging bubble. Like i can refresh with you, maybe more than alone even.  But you have to be very special to get there and if something is wrong with the relationship  you can be temporarily or permanently kicked out.
For some reason i am just a bit surprised to hear that someone else feels the same way. "
4212,isfj,completely agree with you. its tiring investing so much time and emotional energy on people in general. but having someone whom you can fully give and also feel refreshed being it is a two way relationship; its more powerful since romantic relationships and friendships are different. 
4213,isfj,"i get the surprise too. i don't tell many people about this because they can be hurt by it. one person has held a grudge with me after i explained it to him because he felt like i was saying he wasn't special in my eyes enough to be a close friend. we weren't even friends at that time, we were acquaintances. 
since then, iono, it's something i only share with other isfj who i feel do it too and a few close friends who are interested but don't perceive judgmentalness from it."
4214,isfj,"Without divulging too much on my own relationship, because I know he has a reddit as well and if I could find his posts he can easily find mine, lol.
How is your relationship going/how did it go? How long has it been going on/did it last? What have been the biggest obstacles? I'm curious if anything I've been experiencing is something that's just common (since it's less of a communication problem like what's expected) in this pairing. "
4215,isfj,"My husband is an ENTP, or INTP possibly. I like his Ne brain, and rely on it constantly for fresh perspective. I think it took me awhile to realize what Ne is though, and how to appreciate it. Communication was non linear for him and very linear for me, and I didn't understand why we would struggle to get our points across for awhile until I understood his brain a bit better lol. Now I think it is a freaking awesome super power he has. I realize Myers Briggs is not all that accurate or scientific, but reading up on Ne made it all click for me. That was my biggest thing, in terms of communication.
I think ISFJ and XNTP can be wonderful together. Best of luck!"
4216,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ, husband is an INTP. We’ve been together almost 9 years now, married 8.5. We get along great! Sometimes there are hurt feelings and misunderstandings, but I feel like that’s going to happen regardless. 
I feel like what is helpful is knowing a variety of things about his personality type. His love language, his learning style, a tendency for concrete vs. abstract, etc. Our MBTI is just one of the tools that goes into work on our relationship. He knows I really struggle with abstract stuff, so he tries to tie conversations/discussions into concrete things. Etc. "
4217,isfj,I’m an ISFJ and I dated someone who I think is an INTP (basing this off a quick skim of the description on 16 Personalities) for a little over a year. The biggest issue we faced was me being oversensitive/a bit clingy and him being insensitive/pushing me away when he needed space. We were pretty much unable to see eye to eye about where the other was coming from despite having regular open communication about the issue. We both understood what was going on but we both refused to budge on our wants or make small compromises to fix it. It ended very poorly when this cycled too much for us with no progress toward fixing it. However I don’t think you guys are doomed just based on this! There was other stuff coming into play (I’m a HSP and was struggling with anxiety throughout the relationship) that exacerbated everything in my case. Let me know if you have any questions! 
4218,isfj,"I'm an INTP and I'm with an ISFJ for almost 7 years now. I love her because she's such genuinely good and caring person.
As others said, communication can be hard, but when you work on that, over time it becomes easier to understand each other without words.
Also, it's not easy to find a balance in our different perspectives on our relationship: I need a lot of space for myself, whereas she needs to be together as much as possible. I like to undertake things outside the house (sports, friends, other activities), whereas she likes to be home just with me.
We try our best to overcome these differences and we know how to communicate with each other what we need. It's certainly helpful to know each other's MBTI to have a basic understanding of how we perceive the world. We're doing great most of the time, and we still love each other. "
4219,isfj,"Mutual romantic interest between me and an ISFJ man friend for some time now... don’t really know if it will ever get off the ground. It’s long-distance with a language barrier, but sometimes it feels like we’re on very different wavelengths and that’s the real distance. 
He’s not much of a talker so it’s hard to know what’s going on with him. I’m just as bad though. Almost everything I could complain about with him I’m guilty of. 
I think if our genders were reversed, we’d probably be dating though. I’m spontaneous “let’s pursue this possibility!” kinda person and he’s cautious. If I were the man I’d be chasing but I’m not really wired that way romantically. "
4220,isfj,"Me me me !! We’ve only been dating for 5 months  but I love him dearly!! 
The biggest obstacle was starting out- we had some difficulties with “others” but after having a few of those hard conversations and spending more time with each other and simply being there for one another when we needed it has helped tremendously!! 
I love doing things for him, and he notices and appreciates it. 
I’m very happy :) :) :)"
4221,isfj,"I'd like to hear your experience, OP!
I've been with my intp bf for a year now. We've had some ups and downs but things are going well now I think. This was his first relationship so I think it was hard to deal with me changes and emotions and stuff.
We think very differently and I think thats the main problem. I have to learn/try harder to say how I feel and not assume he can infer that based on vague things I've said. But MBTI has helped a lot! "
4222,isfj,"I totally get this. As the INTP in the equation. Example.
Me: Do we have any cheese?
Her: Do we have any cheese?? I pick up cheese every Thursday, it's on my Zone B shopping list where I have made the list in the order that you encounter foods as you go through the store. I am a good provider. How can you suggest otherwise? I work hard for this family. Do you know how difficult it is to keep track of all the things I keep track of? I could be doing the things that I want to do but instead I sacrifice my time for the family to make sure that there is food on the table. Healthy, nutritious food! And now you accuse me of being a bad person! (Locks herself in the bathroom, very hurt.)
Me: (to myself, since she has drama'd out) oh here it is, it was under the tortilla shells.
Note to the audience: What I actually meant was ""do we have any cheese"" which is exactly what I said. She is a wonderful provider. I appreciate all she does. I will never understand ISFJ's."
4223,isfj,"THIS ^^
​
My partner and I have been together for 13+ years now. These are our struggles as well.  But knowing his INTP needs (Space and time alone!!) and him recognizing mine (quality time and to feel appreciated and loved) are imperative to a successful relationship. Learning to communicate these needs to each other was a challenge at times but we've gone to therapy together to aid in that because we wanted to remain committed to each other and our relationship.  It can definitely work when two people have a deep understanding of how the other operates and are both committed to meeting the others' needs as well as their own"
4224,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply! I've just come to appreciate how Ne is useful for seeing multiple sides of a conflict, or any situation, and I admire all his hobbies. He's really funny too. He has a Robin Williams sort of funny, sharp and unexpected and has lots of material. He thinks very quickly, and not in a linear manner. There's a lot to Ne and it's not just one thing I appreciate. I spent some time reading about Ne when I first got into personality types, that helped too."
4225,isfj,"Hey, it's yayo from r/mbtimemes ;)
​
So far I haven't found / created a single meme about ISFJs and I want to change that. Therefore I'd love to learn more about you guys =)
What are some stereotypes about your type?
​
Thank you for your help! "
4226,isfj,"We need more memes like this 
The stereotypical ISFJ meme economy about us being the ""mom friend"" or the ""cookie baker"" is oversaturated. I'd like to see some more edgy memes. "
4227,isfj,"In my own experience


BORING- especially when i bond with my intp friend who has these theories about the government although he has no basis. I dont think he's telling me these to look superior but he's just brainy. As an isfj i just nod because i have nothing to offer and we isfjs dont talk about abstract concepts and theories because i just find it useless. I mean no offense theories can be fun to listen to  but there are other important things to take care of.


NICE/KIND- I mean im called ""nice"" because im somehow polite according to mg friend. I would somehow help my friends of they ask me or they are having a hard time looking for answers in their projects. Im that ""nice"" friend bur i dont see myself that way lol. Im just polite because i dont like to resist. I mean it's a waste of saliva


SECRETIVE- i dont speak that mich about my life i mean i listen to my friends stories and my enfj bff blabbings but i just dont ""open"" myself because theres nothing interesting about me anyways. While my friends do open up about their favorite tv shows and gossip about other people, i myself dont gossip although i still listen. People are hard to trust nowadays and you dont know whos gonna betray me in the future. Better be private than be open. My infp friend even accused me of not being open to the group looool.


VICTIM mentality- oh nooo another stereotype about isfjs lol but lemme tell you that while im sometimes guilty of  this, i do it in a subtle way to avoid being blamed at. I do own up to my mistakes though sometimes


NAVE(?) - i feel like im naive sometimes lol

"
4228,isfj,"I was seeing an ISFJ for a while, I'm an INTP/ENTP (male), it's really right on the line. Anyways it ended, somewhat mutually. I'm now looking at the profile of the ISFJ and it's shockingly accurate and I've kind of realized I don't really know many ISFJ's so the mindset is pretty foreign.
I met this girl at a college event, she's a senior at the school, I'm 24 and just moved to this city to work. Anyways, I was visiting some friends and got separated and ran into her and started talking to her. I was pretty drunk and honestly I wasn't looking for anything serious. We ended up talking until around 7 in the morning and saw each other around 10 times over the next 2 weeks. I found out she's a virgin and can count how many people she's made out with on fingers so for her to kiss a stranger the first night she met him was a pretty big deal. I don't know how universal this is.
The first two weeks were great and then everything kind of starts to fall apart. I want to know her opinions and thoughts and feelings regarding different things. I want to go explore outside and see what she's all about but it's a locked vault. I let her know I like her but I can't have the kind of relationship with someone where there isn't clear communication. I realize now after understanding the ISFJ a little more that it takes a while for ISFJ's to warm up, which is the complete opposite of me. After a frustrating experience of trying to get her to open up we both kind of decided the whole thing wasn't worth it and walked away.
Can someone articulate maybe the ISFJ mentality in terms that I could understand? To me it just felt like a rejection for me to open up and be so forward to a placid response. Obviously it probably wasn't smart of me to pressure her into articulating or explaining what was going on beneath the surface but it's just such a foreign concept, I didn't know how to handle it. Anyone have experience with the ENTP/INTP and ISFJ relationship?"
4229,isfj,"I can probably help with this, seeing as I have dated and ENTP before, which like you, did not turn out very well. The biggest issue would be opening up emotionally, you never want to pressure an ISFJ. It takes time for us to open up, we tend to be shy and cautious when it comes to dating and relationships. I mean it took me 2 weeks of very subtle hinting before I finally told my ex I liked her and asked her out! In my case she pressured me into opening up before I was ready, and that made me a little angry with her. Granted she pushed me outside of my comfort zone in many ways which led to more resentment to the point of not loving her anymore. If your ex is anything like me, she's probably not very good with words and doesn't like to be rushed, so she probably wasn't rejecting you it was just not knowing how to respond or deal with the situation. Dating an ISFJ is like trying to feed a squirrel, don't make any big sudden movements and make sure to be patient. Let us come to you when we feel safe and ready to share. If you want to know anything specific from my relationship feel free to ask! :)"
4230,isfj,"I knew before opening this thread that you'd be an ENTP (or, are one some of the time, I guess). ENTPs seem to be fascinated with ISFJs and want to know all about us. They post a lot in this sub.
Anyway, I'm an ISFJ and I'm married to an ENTP. Our relationship is pretty great, and part of why it's great is because my husband doesn't regard my emotional/sensitive side with pity, but wants to support me in any way he can. He loves acting as my protector and comforter, and I love receiving his care. For example, sometimes when I'm in public, something will happen that basically shuts me down. It could be that my credit card isn't working at a register and I have no other means of payment on me, something like that. I have difficulties dealing with unforeseen circumstances that mess up my day, and tend to freeze. My husband will effortlessly resolve the situation and forget it ever happened three minutes later. He has no problems helping me out when I need it.
This isn't to say that I'm incompetent and need his help in all things, but it's nice to have him there, filling in any inconsistencies I have (and I do the same for him). 
As for the girl you dated, the fact that she's a virgin was probably a big factor as to why your relationship might not have worked out. It sounds like she hasn't had a lot of physical/sexual relationships so far, hell, maybe not even a lot of emotional ones, so it would take her longer to warm up to you entirely. I can't explain why, it just...is. That's how I was when I was younger. Of course, once you'd known her a bit longer, I can see her opening up a lot more, even volunteering information. I LOVE being asked questions by people I'm very close to, but I hate it when acquaintances or strangers do it. There's a big difference when it comes to comfort level.
Hope this helps with future ISFJs you come across. Just be patient, and for god's sake, don't regard us with pity! ouch, haha."
4231,isfj,"(ENTP) My mom is an ISFJ, and she won't tell me her thoughts/feelings. She thinks that I won't understand. I also think it makes her feel nervous/bad to talk about her personal thoughts/feelings for some reason. She's just a private person in that aspect. But she'll talk about stories from her past openly. She also claims that me not understanding her has to do with her being 40 years older than me, though. So this might be more of a mom/daughter issue than an ISFJ/ENTP issue. If I were you, as long as she reassured me she liked me and wanted to be with me, then I'd keep seeing her even if she's a private person. She won't be private forever."
4232,isfj,"ISFJ, my boyfriend of 3 years is an INTP. Promise you, it is possible! But the opening up thing is something that took us awhile and honestly is still an issue from time to time. I don't want to speak on behalf of every relationship because that is unrealistic, but I know the biggest thing for me was patience. When I'm closed off, sometimes his first thought is that I am not trusting him enough...if I really trusted him, I would have no problem telling him whats up. In reality, it could be any number of things. I probably don't want to burden him. Or maybe I'm just trying to figure out a way to express it that will make sense. Either way, I know that pressuring me or trying to speed up the process is kind of counterproductive. It puts extra stress on me and makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. I recoil and then opening up takes even longer. I think the most important and helpful thing he does in that kind of situation is just say, “I'm ready to listen whenever you're ready to talk. No rush.“ That is comforting to me and makes it go a whole lot smoother. Like another poster said, normally after that I'm ready fairly quickly.
Like I said, I'm definitely not trying to speak for everyone, but hopefully this gave you a little bit of insight. I'm waaaaaaay far on the introverted side of the scale, and we have certainly had those fights about why I'm so closed off. They're never productive. Patience really does go a long way with an ISFJ, but I think the rewards of it are pretty sweet. The more opportunities I'm given to open up to a person, the easier it becomes."
4233,isfj,"There's already really great advice here, but I'll weigh in. Currently dating an ENTP (and most past BFs have been ENTPs..I'm ridiculously attracted to them). I think the biggest thing is communication. I find that ENTPs have a hard time understanding that ISFJs have a totally different style of communication! For me, it takes awhile to truly warm up and I need a fair amount of alone time to reset. Sometimes ENTPs take that personally when there is no need to."
4234,isfj,"Yes this is pretty  much what it's like. She felt like she wasn't good with words and that I was being impatient which, in retrospect, I was. I force myself out of my comfort zone, that's how I deal with being uncomfortable, by  just immersing myself in it.
It seems like (no offense) ISFJ's tend to be victims of their environment? Like things that made her uncomfortable or anxious or nervous she would just shy away from it which on one hand, makes me want to support her, but on the other makes me pity her for being so helpless. And I hate pitying people because I always try and see people around me as equals and pity is a negative experience for me.
Sorry if I'm coming across like a dickhead I was stressed out over this for a while and eventually just gave up on it. She asked if I wanted to be friends instead and take it slower and I rejected the offer which... probably doesn't help huh?
Out of curiosity, what are some of your hobbies and interests? What do you do in your spare time?"
4235,isfj,"Heh I know. It's really just a matter of limited exposure to ISFJ's. I just don't know that many people who can't or won't voice what's going on inside their head logically/emotionally.
In this case I figured if it was ""won't do it"", I took it as a form of rejection, especially when her kind and warm response led me to put myself out there only to not get the same in return.
If it was a case of ""can't do it"" then I'm looking down the line and thinking that's problematic for whatever problems might arise in the future.
I take it the answer is somewhere down the middle and something that comes with time, and has no real logical reasoning for me to chew on? I don't mean to be disparaging with that last bit, it's just the natural way my mind settles things. I'm unfortunately not a patient person when there's no reason to be. But understanding this mindset a little bit more gives me a reason to explore this a little more... You're right, I am definitely fascinated and interested."
4236,isfj,"Honestly, she might feel like she is burdening you with her feelings/thoughts. I have a very difficult time opening up about my ""problems"" because I am scared that others just don't want to hear and wouldn't care, thus I just don't want to bother them with it.
Or she might just feel like you really would not understand. I know sometimes I will walk around and I look at people and I realize that I just will never know the complexities of their lives and they will never know mine either... It's so weird to realize that we are each just 1 human being and almost no one will ever truly know us... Just like I will almost never truly know someone else... It's a bit different because you are family, but even with my family members I am beginning to realize that they will never really know the ""real"" me...
The more I get to know someone and be more comfortable with them though, the more I will begin to open up. Even then, it takes time.
And also, I think most ISFJs like the simple signs that you care about them. I bet your mom would love if you picked her a flower one day and gave it to her -- just to show you were thinking about her enough to do something small like that for her."
4237,isfj,"You're right the biggest issue is communication. To be honest I think that girl was the first ISFJ I've spent time with so I really didn't understand. In my mind communication regarding a problem or an issue and bringing up what I think and feel about it. Usually this is where people kind of jump in and offer their own thoughts.
But maybe it's me being an asshole but one word responses for something I think is a problem is unsatisfactory for me. Now that I have a bit of a better understanding of ISFJ's, I think that forcing the issue was probably a little overwhelming. "
4238,isfj,"ISFJ female here.  Yes, I most certainly avoid environmental stressors.  For example, I would never do two social events on one day.  WAY too much.  I do not consider myself a victim.  I'm just at the age where if I don't want to do something, I don't.  My hobbies include gardening, hiking, kayaking, weight lifting, my dogs.  I am happily married to an INTJ.  I could never be in a relationship with an Extravert.  I find it exhausting.  That said, I scored very high on the introversion scale. "
4239,isfj,"Don't worry I'm not taking any offense! I would not go so far as to say ISFJ's are ""victims of our environment"", we prefer to be comfortable. By the way, when I say ""ISFJ's"" I know I am making a blanket statement, what I say does not apply to all ISFJ's because we vary in degree's of introversion and what have you. So being a victim is the wrong way of looking at us, I personally shy away from stress because I hate it. I get all emotional and it ruins my day, I know its silly but that's just the way I am. Pushing out of our comfort zone may work for you, and I applaud that it's something I struggle with, but with her and many other ISFJ's that has the opposite effect which you saw firsthand. If I come across as attacking you I'm really sorry!
I'd be happy to share a little about myself! I really like the outdoors so i go hiking, backpacking, fishing and exploring logging trails in my jeep. I can't do those most of time though because of college, It eats up most of my time. What little time i do have though is spent at the gym and practicing my passion for cooking. I love making pasta and ravioli, everything made from scratch. I'm bad with words so I use food to express my feelings for those I care about, must be my Italian heritage coming through haha. 
I've rambled on enough, sorry about that! If you have anymore questions don't be afraid to ask, I'm an open book. :)
Edit: And sorry for the late reply, I went to bed right after I posted last night!"
4240,isfj,"If I know something is stressful/uncomfortable to me, then yes I avoid it. I don't even order new food at restaurants I frequent because I know what I like, why try something new? 
It is very tough to deal with new situations, however once it's happened I would feel much more comfortable with it happening again.
As others have said, we are shy and take a long time to open up. But, once we are open, we share almost everything (in my experience). It takes forever to find someone I trust well enough to just be myself... (an example of this mindset can be seen in my recent thread ""Revealing your true self""). Even now, I still have a hard time immediately telling my boyfriend what is wrong but he knows if he is patient for about 5-10 minutes I will work up the courage to tell him. It sounds silly, but it is very hard for me to just communicate things -- especially if I feel that I am ""wrong"" for thinking that way (ex: I'm upset he went to a concert without me, but I know I shouldn't be upset so I don't want to say that that is what is bothering me but he knows something is bothering me... so I have to gear myself up to tell him). I would say it is important to be very understanding of our emotions/feelings and not disregard them because, well, it's kind of tough being an emotional person. I could start crying just because I see a little old lady sitting by herself in a restaurant, or because a pedestrian yelled at me while I was driving... it's not like I want to be affected by these things but they do affect me regardless).
As for hobbies, etc. I get a lot of my social interaction through videogames, as, yeah, it's tough for me to open up to people in person very much. I am much more comfortable meeting and talking to people online.
I also enjoy hiking with my boyfriend and a friend or two. I watch anime with my boyfriend as well. Honestly, I don't think I really have that many hobbies... I'm usually down to go out and do stuff but at the end of the day I want to just stay at home and not do much. I have a job where I basically teach kids 1st-5th grade and while it is really fulfilling, at the end of the day I'm super worn out and I am literally just grumpy for being busy all day. In the mornings I wake up super happy and cheery, but by night-time I'm a grumpy person that needs to recharge and just do nothing for a while."
4241,isfj,"No problem at all, love the detailed description. I know the word victim seems harsh, probably because it is and sorry about that. Maybe you can describe to me some qualities of the best partner you've had? Or the ideal qualities? "
4242,isfj,"Yeah the word victim is harsh and there is no getting around it, but I totally get what your talking about so there's no need to apologize. As for my ex's...that could be a whole post in of itself honestly. I have only had three girlfriends and they have all been pretty crappy, I promise I'm not exaggerating. They did not respecting my comfort zone, pushed the relationship too fast for me (emotionally and physically) and in the case of my last girlfriend she was just down right abusive. Which is something very hard for me to talk about, especially being a guy...but I don't want to dump that on you or anyone else who is reading this thread, there's nothing more I dislike than being a burden on others. 
So the ideal traits I find in a woman! Well, I really like someone who's very active and more extroverted. I know I'm a bit of an introvert so having someone to give me that little nudge out the door to go dancing or out to dinner with them is good me! I also wouldn't mind someone who's more of a thinker. I have a big heart and go with my gut (for better or worse hehe), so having someone to stop me and make sure I'm not blundering my way into trouble is kinda attractive you know? I know its a little cliche, but in the end all I want is someone who will love me for who I am, who won't hold my history of abuse against me(this is a big one, I've lost friends because of it) and doesn't mind that I have a hard time expressing my affection with words.
I need to stop rambling! I feel like I need to do one of those tldr thingies after my comments haha
Edit: I forgot to thank you for reading and commenting on my responses! It's really nice of you. (I need to stop writing....)"
4243,isfj,"How do you reveal your true self to others? How do you get past the need to keep to yourself, scared of what others might think?
How do you learn to burden others with your problems? Even more than that, how do you accept that others might not think of it as a burden?
How do you decide if you can relate to someone? Why do I decide almost everyone I meet is incapable of being my friend? I am so quick to judge that someone is not ""my type"" and I can't ""reveal"" myself to them...
Why can't I find a friendship like I read about in books and saw in movies? Why can't I instantly connect with another person and form a life-long bond... I know these just don't really happen irl but I am so longing for it...
I try. I do try because I spent two years doing it the hard way and waiting for people to come to me before I started going to them. But even then, they just don't see in me what I wish they did. They don't see what is underneath my layers. They don't return the conversation. They don't ask about me after I ask about them. The conversation dies. I'm back where I started.
I guess it's too late for me to make friends in college. I only have a month left. But where did I go wrong, and what can I do in the future?
I have learned that I have to be the one who starts things... but how do I find the right people, and how do I receive reciprocation?
I see everyone on campus walking with their friends, but I walk everywhere alone. I drive my classmates to field-trips and they sit in the back of my car and chat but won't keep a conversation going if I ask about their plans for the weekend. I see the sorority girls posting their group pictures on facebook and I am jealous I do not have friends to hang out with and take pictures together to post.
I am sure I will find a friend some time. But in the mean time, I'm so lonesome."
4244,isfj,"Here's my take on all this. 
There's yourself that everyone around you sees, the public figure. Then there's the you that close people know, friends, family, lovers, your intimate side. Lastly there's your side the is only known to you, it's hidden in your mind. Revealing your true self to someone is all up to you, what is your true self? Is it a story you never told anyone? Is it finally expressing a feeling deep inside. It's just hard for me to answer to specifically when I feel like this is a person to person thing. 
Burdening others.. I kept everything in for years and didn't get help, it landed me with self-harm habits and I nearly committed suicide. I needed a push to get help for myself. My boyfriend at the time came with me to therapy and told my therapist how unwell I was. He asked me for permission to do this, saying yes was something I didn't even care about anymore at that point. I was done. Open up, if you can do it, if you're lucky a close friend might sense something in you being bottled up.
Making friends is hard and really hard sometimes. I've come across a lot of people that ended up being awful to me. But I'm forever optimistic and will continue to try my best with socializing heh. Be open to every person you meet, just try your best to look at them and drink in all their details to figure out what they're really like. Instant connections are fantasized more so. You don't always immediately click with people. Chat with them for a bit, ask if they like something you like. Could be a movie, video game, music, whatever suits you. Try to find some common ground so you can stay interested and comfortable as well hopefully ha.
Going to people can get tiring eventually, and waiting never works for me. You have to watch for and hold onto people that want to put in the same amount of effort as you do. It's hard to find but there's a chance. 
Listen, if you're really lonely I'll chat with you anytime. I relate a lot to you with seeing people together happy and doing things. The pictures on facebook got to me heh. As petty as it makes me feel I just want that because it feels good to show off the people I love. Sorry if this is scrambled I kind of puke ideas out when I'm interested."
4245,isfj,"i feel the same way as you do. its very hard for me to show people who i really am. I display a very different personality on the outside, because of this i can actually be quite chatty and social and funny. still  i feel I really want people to see whats on the inside, but at the same time i do not want to share. i have had made 1 really good friend in university. an ISTJ. he was my roommate and took me a year before i considered him as friend. +
there is a community of ISFJs on the personality cafe forum. just google Personality cafe. its really great to see all the stories people share and the struggles they face. "
4246,isfj,"Hi :) Couple weeks ago I asked for a help with testing one personality test. A lot of people told to use cognitive functions. We did it. Please try test again and comment your result. 
It's Free. No registration required. Congitive functions used. :) 
https://www.horozo.com/personality-type-test"
4247,isfj,"Generally doing stuff I like, alone. 
Sometimes I spend too much time mindlessly browsing the internet, reading threads on forums but rarely engaging in discussions. I enjoy playing videogames, reading, watching movies. 
I notice these cycles in my methods of escapism: at some point I'm binging on arthouse movies, then a month later I'm catching up with videogames, and then after several weeks I switch to reading medieval history books, and then back to movies - I'm always focused on a single type of media at some point. Right now I'm into TV series (although I actually dislike most of them) - those Mondays are easier to bear knowing that soon I'll be back at home with a cup of hot tea in hand and the new Westworld episode on my laptop's screen.
On another note, yesterday I found this article and I listened to the songs there. It really worked for me."
4248,isfj,"As much as I hate to admit it, exercise does help keep me peaceful. In the more traditional sense, I love taking baths, and I think snuggling down in my new electric blanket is probably the closest I'll ever get to experiencing heaven. The internet is a terrible, wonderful distraction, and it's a little embarrassing, but I have a slew of phone games I rotate between. I write and draw, but those hobbies aren't really relaxing the way mind-numbing dragon raising or resource farming are, unfortunately lol. "
4249,isfj,"Being alone or with pets - I can't relax around other people, only animals - typically reading articles on the internet, or gardening, or playing a game like Cities: Skylines or Sims 2. Exercise helps me to de-stress but it doesn't help me relax all that much - I need something that forces me out of my own head (and focusing on something else) to do that."
4250,isfj,"Listening to music by myself is usually how I prefer to relax. 
Or watching movies with my boyfriend. He's really good about letting me be quiet when I need to, and he's one of the few people I've met who actually makes me feel recharged, rather than drained, after spending time with him. Plus, it's hard not to feel relaxed when I'm cuddling with someone super warm. 😂"
4251,isfj,"Watching youtube, reading things online about MBTI and things alike, or just random things that seem interesting. Reading fiction too, watching a movie maybe. All either up in my room alone on my bed, or downstairs with my parents and my brother. It depends a little on if I need to be alone or around others haha. :)"
4252,isfj,"Chilling alone (listen to music, watching anime/youtube, or playing video games).
Spending time with family, or with 1-3 close friends (watching a movie, talking over a meal, or playing some games, or doing some recreational activity)"
4253,isfj,"Working on music or just playing guitar. The working on music bit is great until I hit a roadblock and then it's pure work, but it makes me feel great. Listening to music is always therapeutic for me. Other than that, exercising and longboarding. Reading a book is always nice, too.
EDIT: Just realized this is a month late lol"
4254,isfj,"Hey!
I'm an ENFP who's been madly deeply in love with an ISFJ for the last 3 years, and I just came to thank you all very very much for your kind, loving, nuturing ways.
There's been our differences:

I'm super duper spontaneous!
She's very very passive in her ways, as where I'm a little more bold.
Communication. There's the clear difference in NFP & SFJ

There's more, though for the key differences we make up in communication; Talk about everything, work through it all, and help eachother where we need help, enable where we can, and let eachother breathe when we need it.
I never thought to settle down and stay as long as I have, but now I wouldn't think twice about changing it :)
Much love everyone; Just wanted to share!"
4255,isfj,"Hi there, I'm so happy for you c:
My ex was an ENFP and me and ISFJ. We definitely clashed a lot but he got me a little out of my comfort zone sometimes, which was good. I think it's a careful balance you have to form. Him and I should've been better with communication and letting the other breathe when needed. I'm so happy it's working well for you though c: Take care! "
4256,isfj,"Oh absolutely, he was my first serious relationship and I'd never change it. We were an interesting combination, I like how you talk about having your girlfriend as an anchor heh. We're often realists I suppose c:"
4257,isfj,"Whenever I feel like I'm floating away she's right there to bring me back to the real world, and remind me that I cannot make all my dreams reality ;)
I truly, deeply appreciate the realistic view she brings! Every dreamer needs an Anchor :D IMO!"
4258,isfj,"I absolutely LOVE being an ISFJ and it frustrates me to see people overlooking/bullying/belittling us. Like, somehow we’re reduced to being these boring emotional balls of cookie-baking law abiding citizens who cower at conflict and confrontation. I mean, we are ngl but people make it seem as if we’re crippled by these characteristics of ours and can’t be anything more. 
For example, ISFJs are emotional, yes, but we have an understanding of emotions that other people don’t have as strongly, and it allows us to understand ourselves better as well as the people around us. Our understanding of emotions helps us communicate with others better and resolve problems quicker. Idk about you guys but I have a way with “rationalizing my emotions” (i think it’s the Fe-Ti combo) and that helps me keep collected during pressing times and people go to me when they have problems because i can cut through the emotions they feel and find the root of their problems. 
ALSO i feel like a lot of people are ISFJs but because the “ISFJs are boring” schtick they don’t realize this. Aaggh it just frustrates me a lot. 
ISFJs are smart, great at communicating, BOSS BITCHES, and just all around an amazing type. I wish more people realize this. What about you guys, what do you think? "
4259,isfj,"As a type, you are not generally associated with intelligence. I think this is a pity, because the ISFJs I know tend to have very smart ideas and are simply overlooked. :) (I know that smarts and personality are separate, but a bias can cause people to over-look intelligence they wouldn't otherwise.)"
4260,isfj,"I feel like we're a lot more open-minded than other people give us credit for.  After I was typed as an ISFJ by a few different sites, and read through the functions to find that I agreed with them, I was shocked to see the ISFJ stereotypes that I feel barely applied to myself, and to other ISFJ's I've known.  The thing that bothered me (and this isn't just for ISFJ's - more xSxJ's in general,) is how I saw people saying that we're ""glued to our ways"" and making fun of us for our supposed refusal to change our ideas.  It seems that many people in the MBTI community seem to dislike ISFJ's (which I'm sure does attribute to a lot of people who enjoy MBTI being ENTP's, INTP's, INTJ's, and other xNxx types,) because they feel that we are judgmental and not open-minded... as an individual, I disagree with this stereotype.  I think that I'm a fairly open-minded person, and I think that the ISFJ's I've met are too.  Yes, it is true that we like doing things that we know have worked out before, but I am entirely willing to accept a new concept or change in the world if I feel that it will benefit society as a whole. I am willing to listen to different view-points, simply because I think that everyone's opinion matters, and I want to grow to understand them.  And I am not the only ISFJ who is like this - I have met many others who are like this, as well.
The thing is that we are all living in the Information Age.  I know that many people judge xSxJ's because of their own parents, but every individual has a large amount of access to information.  Perhaps ISFJ's in the past really were more stuck to their ways, but I don't think that most of us are like that anymore - I think that we're learning more about the world, and coming to accept different ways of living than we might have in the past, because this is a different world.  If I were alive in 1952, I believe that I would be a very different person - I very well may have been stuck in my ways, based on what society happened to believe.  But as the world grows and changes, people are growing and changing, and I believe that at this point in history, many xSxJ's are more accepting than we might have been in the past."
4261,isfj,"This is adorable. ISFJs are my favorite type. The type I get along with best, and the type I have the longest, most stable relationships with. (Obviously, I married one lol!)
Here are some things I've noticed about my ISFJ spouse, bffs, MIL, etc.


Highly intelligent. Most of the ISFJs I'm close to have gone to ivy leagues, and-or have a doctorate. This speaks for itself. I just laugh when people think ISFJs aren't intelligent. Really?


High emotional intelligence. ISFJs are the most emotionally intelligent people I've ever met. They can and often do ""read people like a book,"" which is why I'm not surprised many of them mistype themselves as INFJs. (Though personally I've noticed ISFJs are consistently accurate in their perceptions than INFJs because they don't assume.) I was drawn to my husband in the beginning because he was not only the funniest person I've ever met, but could also read me without speaking. It was intriguing. 


Humble. Unlike other types however, they're very reserved about themselves, what they know, and what they've accomplished. I think this is why others sell them short, but personally, I admire this lovely trait about them.


Good leaders. Because of the above, they can be great leaders if they want to be, and sometimes I see them step up to the plate if it's necessary. But for the most part, they usually prefer working behind the scenes, where most people don't notice. I feel like I'm one of the few actually paying attention.


Open minded. This one trait is why I get along with them so well. I've met many people who say that they're open minded, but ISFJs truly are. Sure, they may be hesitant if they've never encountered things before, but that's normal. I like how even though they're hesitant, they're willing to try things out before discarding it.


I could go on but then this would be an essay lol. "
4262,isfj,"I think my problem-solving abilities are one of my favorite qualities that I can attribute at least partially to my personality type! I’m great at evaluating what’s working and what isn’t and figuring out solutions to keep things running more smoothly. Even in my personal life, I spend a lot of time looking at how I can make myself better, and I attribute a lot of my personal growth to my skill in evaluating problems and finding solutions. "
4263,isfj,"I think people overlook our analytical abilities. As you said with tertiary Ti, we can have a bit of analytical streak counter to our auxilary Fe nature. Also, I hate how some N's tend to automatically think they are smarter than we are. Just because we are more here and now doesn't make us less intelligent. Sensors are just more detail-orientated, more practical, and better at putting things into our society to keep it moving. While N's tend to be better at seeing the bigger picture of a concept, making connections, and predicting what might happen. "
4264,isfj,"Thank you for this post! I entirely agree, and I think any person who has taken the time to click with me in person would agree. My friendship is a slow burn, haha. It starts out by talking to the ""boring but sweet girl"" but then they get to know the real me and figure out that I'm weird and fun just like everyone else. :)
I also like to think that my empathy makes me better at realizing when I'm being an asshole and apologizing or doing what it takes to repair things. A lot of people get stubborn or defensive if they're called out, and I definitely understand that urge, but being able to see beyond a kneejerk reaction is important."
4265,isfj,"you're absolutely right. can't agree more. I'm also great at drawing lmao not that it has anything to do with this. thanks for this post. you're right. I feel like people think of me as the boring girl, but that's not right. fortunately my family recognize my playful personality lmao."
4266,isfj,"I also really appreciate this post. I find it so fascinating how small the engaged ISFJ community is, and therefore how much discussion/appreciation/connecting we lack, despite the fact that we are, supposedly, the most common type. Where is the love?!?
I love that we can be detail-oriented, and analytical, without sacrificing tact or the understanding of how important the emotional side to any relationship/situation/experience is. Furthermore, I think we are among the most emotionally aware (both of ourselves and of others) and thoughtful. While our initial impulse in the face of frustration, conflict, or exhaustion may be to respond emotionally, we are highly aware of how emotional we are being, and can often do the work to understand why we are being so, so that we can resolve and move on in a more productive and pragmatic manner. Pair that awareness with the fact that we are chronic self-improvers, and you will often find ISFJs with a emotional comprehension and control well beyond their years. 
Thanks again for kicking off this conversation! =)"
4267,isfj,"Me too! The ISFJ descriptions are truly terrible. And, I've noticed people who write about ISFJs and cognitive functions still get it wrong and cling to the traditional mother / grandmother image. 
I always felt I was good at analysis, coding AND empathy. Not the best at either, but a happy mixture of both, and because of my insane attention to detail I am accurate in my assessments and find others mistakes. Also, I have four degrees, because learning is fun. So, the trait that ticks me off the most is when sites say something to the effect of ""someone has to do the boring detailed work."" Hogwash. Give me that and I'll quit, I need challenge, a lot of it.
Also, my memory sucks. Why does everyone say ISFJs have good memories? I think in impressions but I don't remember them. I just remember processes but never details. Impressions aren't details lol, they're like water color paintings. 
Either I'm mistyped, Myers Briggs is bull, or everyone has ISFJs wrong leading to a massive misunderstanding of a wonderful type. All three very possible."
4268,isfj,"Oh, wow! This is really good insight! I liked your last point especially. 
Also, re the “glued to our ways” stereotype, honestly, I felt disconnected with the idea of being an ISFJ just when I was getting into MBTI because I didn’t really think of myself as “rigid” and traditional as all the descriptions were saying. It wasn’t until I got into cognitive functions when everything started clicking and i just KNEW I was definitely an ISFJ and I KNEW people weren’t giving us enough credit :/ 
haha idk guys i’m just really affected by all the flak ISFJs get huhu"
4269,isfj,"100% the Humble part. 
Like in any given conversation or confrontation with anyone, I usually don't like to indulge in sharing information about myself.. especially about my successes or things that I've excelled at, etc. Just like you said, because of this trait of mine, my friends and family are always surprised when they find out about my accomplishments and knowledge. "
4270,isfj,"To be honest, I feel like the descriptions of most of the types are at least a little bit inaccurate, but I'd say that xSxJ's probably have the least accurate descriptions - I don't think that most xSxJ's are really ""rigid"" or ""traditional,"" I think that those terms might have applied many years ago, but certainly not now.  And I didn't feel disconnected, but I was a bit surprised, since I too have never considered myself traditional... I was even more surprised to see some of the type stereotypes, such as ""ISFJ mom who loves baking cupcakes.""  Like I said, I'm sure that there are many ISFJ mothers who enjoy baking cupcakes, but I don't think that that description represents the majority of us.  I also see a rather clear Sensor bias (though this has been discussed before,) in type descriptions, but in general I feel like type descriptions tend to be either wrong or just plain biased before you really get into the functions.  I was happy when I started reading about the functions, because the functions seemed to shy away somewhat from the stereotypes, and instead seemed to be talking about MBTI in a ""this is how you function"" kind of way.  I knew for sure that I was an ISFJ when I read the functions, because they fit perfectly!  
And this is a different topic, but another thing that bothers me about MBTI is compatibility.  I do think that it's fascinating how there seems to be a trend in certain relationships (ENFP/INTJ, for example, seems to be one that I've observed to be common in both film and irl,) but in general, I feel MBTI compatibility just leads into more of a bias.  I'd never date someone based specifically on what type they were, but I've met many people who would.  I think that communication is the important tool in a relationship, and not personality type, though knowing someone's MBTI could help you communicate."
4271,isfj,"I see what you're saying, and I've always been curious about this. Obviously there is a huge focus on our intuitive counterparts, the Infj, and their ""analytical"" nature is often times discussed. I do question how strong their Ti is compared to ours. Perhaps being introverted types, we tend to ""loop"" more? Ti is not really well controlled, and at times i have a tendency to over-analyze my past experiences instead of working towards my goals. My Fe isn't very well developed as I have struggled socially most of my life, but lately I've being trying to put more focus in that area, and that may put Ti on the back burner."
4272,isfj,"Before I say something I struggle with Si-Ti loop too. As far as I know to fix this you must
1)Relay less on Si and use more Fe freely
Probably past experiences(Si) are saying that Fe is inferior/weak and not wanted function by society. So the main thing is to reverse this thinking and allow yourself to actually use Fe.
2)Stop rationale your current state with Ti
You probably are going to say that I am fine with that because it works for me and I am invincible. You are not. If someone is going to dumb at you personal emotional questions you either are going to flake out or get uncomfortable. So it is not okay. Any Ti explanation you are using is just holding you back to escape this loop. Time to admit it if you want to change it.
That's all I can say. I have problem with this nasty loop too."
4273,isfj,"I was extremely lucky. I made an ENFP friend by accident who forced me to go to social gatherings outside of my comfort zone and showed me I could trust my Fe. I thought I was completely insulated from social information before then, and self isolated for years out of fear of being judged. Turns out, I just needed a little practice. 
​
I think I might have gotten out of it eventually through the nerdy clubs I joined. It gave me life to socialize with people who were interesting, into the same hobbies, and innately much worse at social skills than me. ( As a result, a huge percent of my friends are INT* :) ) 
​
It was like discovering a half of my soul that I had misplaced."
4274,isfj,"Try to leverage your inferior Ne function as best as possible. I know it’s difficult, given that it’s the least used of your functions, but it is still there. It’s the most explorative of all the functions and if you try and use it in processing information, it might help break the Si-Ti loop. 
You might try implementing this tool by (as unhealthy as I know this sounds) second guessing yourself socially, emotionally, and logically. Don’t think about it as a matter of self doubt, but a process of self affirmation by way of precise double-checking. If in your reflections you find something you might be wrong about, don’t approach it as a point of shame on your personal identity, but as another important step in a method of self improvement. When in these same reflections you find any number of things that you’re totally justified in thinking/feeling/believing, then celebrate that! The act of self examination isn’t a failure if you don’t find anything to fix, it’s an extra boost of confidence in your positions.
Second guessing yourself may sound counter intuitive to mental health, but trust me, I’m an ENTP, we do it all the time. Being an ENTP, I have the exact same functions as an ISFJ but ordered inversely. Even though Si and Ti may not by my dominant and tertiary functions, I still have a good concept of how they work. One might argue that I’m biased in pushing the powers of Ne given that it’s my dominant function, but just hear me out, okay?
Anyway, here ’s an article from Stanford on the philosophical concept of “reflective equilibrium”. I know that sounds like dense reading, but this particular article is actually pretty accessible and largely explains the kind of self examination that I previously mentioned."
4275,isfj,"Check out this post I did about it a few months ago. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/isfj/comments/aj4k2s/the_siti_loop_what_it_is_and_how_to_get_out_of_it/
​
I just wanna say This dreaded loop sucks. I think what gets me in this loop is because Fe expressions tend to be devalued among males so it's hard to find guys that I can relate to or just tension in relationships and then I internalize this and the overthinking cycle about past experiences starts. My advice is to get off the internet or your head (The Internet is great supporter of Ti loops cause spending hours researching/analyzing a topic). Hopefully you have people that you trust that you can confide in and talk whatever you are going through and that should activate your Fe."
4276,isfj,"Without going in details,  there is a shit storm brewing in my life.  I can feel it so strongly in my gut. Usually when shit like this happen I withdrawn myself and think before I do something irrational because of my emotions.  How many of you guy's feel this way? I'm usually a pretty mellow guy,  however if someone keep testing me I can become extremely angry.  I don't want that... I  always feel guilty when I lose my chill demeanor.  How do you guys cover up your anger when dealing with stupid bullshit? Sorry for grammar mistakes."
4277,isfj,"thank you for sharing.
I don’t cover up my anger, now.  I used to. Gave me terrible life long problems.  
Now, I’m able to show them the whites of the eyes and the whites of my teeth.  Get angry.
It’s always measured, well thought through.  So, usually someone will have royally pissed me off!! Because, I do have the patience and kindness of a saint!  Chilled out.
So I’ll go away and work out what they have done, work out if I want to challenge them about their behaviour.  Some battles are not worth fighting.
Then I’ll choose to confront said person, even if it’s 3 weeks or whatever time after what happened!!!  (I’ll leave it sometimes if it’s to long). 
I’ll choose place and time of confrontation.  And I’ll say everything I want to say, if I want to say everything.  And sometimes I won’t say all I want to say.  
This is sort of trivial life stuff, but someone will have crossed my boundaries without permission, unknowingly hurt me, or been down right malicious.  And then I’ll choose how much anger to express!!!  And then it’s done.
And I give right to respond.  
But me mum treats me like shit sometimes, and it’s been like living in a near permanent shit storm with her, so I’m used to this now.
I never used to be able to express anger!! I would shake all over if I got angry!!!
Or bottle it up and feel terrible.
I hope my comment helps you.
😊
But I also have almighty rants in my flat!! Effing and jeffing!!  Using profanities, get my anger out at home, home alone.  Ranting through how they have hurt me, working out my response, out loud.  I’ve been doing that for say last 4yrs or so!!  More frequently anyhow.  
I have detached flat above 2 shops, no one can hear me.  I rant usually at night when shops are closed.  Only a few people work in shops anyhow.  And they are not busy.  Builders office, till register ship.  One man works there, goes out to do jobs.  
Phew!! Long reply.  "
4278,isfj,"Uhg sorry you're feeling that pressure of an incoming shit storm. I feel it too.
This weekend I went on a walk to cool off over something a family member said and we both swept it under the rug... I think... I have my bags packed just in case. 
I don't know what is going on in your life but as a general rule of thumb set boundaries, stay true to them, keep calm, and put the distance between you and the shot storm if needed, especially if the person/people are toxic."
4279,isfj,"I constantly stress over whether someone believes me or not.
For instance: I have had to cancel my music lessons 2x back to back..due to sickness (my son) and my husband having a Drs appt. I am worried they might think i am irresponsible and just blowing them off. My hubby has been having pains in his body for over a week now and he was referred to a specialist ( after going to  3 Dr appts last week). I COULD have scheduled it for a later date...although the next one they had was next week. I could not wait that long. Hes been in pain daily and this is an area that needs taking care of. Also the office is an hr away. 
So anyway I feel guilty of having to cancel my lessons again. And I worry what kind of person they think I am .."
4280,isfj,"I'm definitely preoccupied with being seen as genuine. Sometimes it feels like I'm lying, even when I know I'm not! I've been in your position before, feeling like I need to justify something so silly as cancelling two lessons in a row. It's like, ""no really! My husband is sick and I can prove it!"". 
Off the top of my head, I blame that on our Extraverted Feeling function. "
4281,isfj,"I'm sure that if you explain the situation to them then they would be more than understanding. If you are overly concerned you can just tell them that you may not be able to attend all of your lessons for x amount of time due to having to care for your husband. I'm positive that they don't think you're awful or a flake, you're not the first to do something like this and you are not the last. "
4282,isfj,"Yes. I hate if someone doesn't believe me. I also hate if I accidentally lie to someone -- aka ""all I ate today was a pb sandwich! (5mins later) Oh I lied, I also ate a banana earlier also!"" 
If someone doesn't believe me I get hugely frustrated, like if I say something and they're all ""surrrrreeeee...."" I get upset and am all ""I'm not lying!"" 
In addition to your concern about what your music teacher will think... I get very stressed out having to change/cancel things because I feel as if I've wasted their time, as if I seem flakey, etc etc. But sometimes you've just gotta do it and you can just be extra nice next time you see them! I think our types are very sensitive to how we think others perceive us, so... yeah. "
4283,isfj,"Hello, I've started becoming friends with an isfj recently but I'm finding it difficult to connect with them. I really like her but I don't know what to talk about with her. I've always had difficulties bonding with xsfj's. what are some things I can talk about with her? She's very open about her life and have noticed she likes talking about the past but I'm so reserved and I feel guilty for not being able to give more of myself... how can I have conversations with her that she will enjoy but don't involve me having to talk about myself a lot. Sorry if this sounds silly, what I'm asking is what do isfj's want in friendships? What kind of things can an infp offer an isfj in a friendship? "
4284,isfj,"be honest in a warm way. if you're unable to open about your past, maybe be open about your inability to. 
you can say it's difficult for you. and that is an understandable thing.
and then from there you can together find something that's you're both interested in like a show or movie or book series or hobby. then you can talk about that."
4285,isfj,"Yeah honesty is a big thing I've realised. I'm more likely to be skeptical of someone who isn't genuine in the way they talk to you. I really don't like that and can sense it immediately, it's just so fake."
4286,isfj,"I'm often told that I'm ""boring"" because I overthink even for the smallest situation, and that I should ""take it easy."" I truly do think before taking action because I don't want to cause any conflicts."
4287,isfj,"Yes. I over think everything. I am NOT spontaneous. I have to think out every possible scenario before making a decision. It makes life with a spontaneous spouse very strained sometimes. 
I love and hate it at the same time. For my career it works well. For my life, I feel like it holds me back sometimes (...a lot of times).
I'll also often keep myself up late unable to sleep or wake up in the middle of the night overthinking/replaying situations from the previous day or thinking about things I have to do the next day."
4288,isfj,"Yes, I like to think about and contemplate things. I have trouble just diving into an activity or project. A personal trainer put it nicely, that I seem very ""cerebral"", having to think about any exercise for a bit before doing it. On the down side, I also tend to build up stress by overthinking/worrying about things that are on the horizon in my life. "
4289,isfj,"Yes I’m always thinking and over analyzing and trying to read peoples minds. It’s super exhausting. We tend to be sensitive creatures too so this overthinking can lead to ruminating in these ideas we have constructed in our head which have no actual basis in reality; ie that that person over there who may have said something to me that I didn’t like must hate me. I did one thing wrong one time at work and my boss will never forget it and probably remembers that one bad thing over all the amazing things I do on a regular basis. 
Things I think help:
- try to shut off for a little bit and be present. I live in a major urban area and when I ride public transportation I try and just look out the window, observe the people around me. Not think....just see. Not be on my phone, scrolling social media, trying to respond to all my texts and emails. Just try and relax for a moment. 
- meditate. This also shuts your mind off and is amazingly refreshing
- exercise. Another great way to clear your head. I do actually find myself thinking a lot and solving problems while I exercise. But the combination of the endorphin release makes me feel amazing, so overthinking in this case is ok. 
- listen to music or podcasts. I find this quiets my mind a little too. If I’m not listening to something else, I’m likely listening to my own persistent thoughts. "
4290,isfj,Yeah I relate. I can be very contemplative and sometimes I can detach from the situation to think. I also overthink a lot when it comes to relationships tension or things that have gone wrong in them. Remember as ISFJs we have Introverted Thinking as our third function so it makes sense that we would overanalyze a lot. My Ti is probably pretty decently developed as the result of being around a lot of xxTPs. 
4291,isfj,Same here i think im pretty much the hypersensitive type i look out for other people’s behaviours and feelings most of the time and do things to ensure everyone feels comfortable but it leaves me feeling rather unsatisfied since i would prioritise others over myself especially when our interests clash i feel like im overanalysing myself/ my surroundings/ conversations sometimes and others often tell me to take things easy though its difficult for me
4292,isfj,"My GF and I went diving last September (it was a first for her, I've had done it once already) and she was a tiny bit stressed about the whole thing, especially after the instructions, which weren't made to scare us but to let us know how to behave for our own safety.
I was giving her reassuring words until the instructor came and asked us what our jobs were. My GF replied ""lawyer"" and then the instructor chuckled. She said ""I knew you guys were more like a cerebral couple, don't overthink this, it's easier than it looks and you'll also be accompanied the whole time"".
It struck me, we both are overthinkers and worriers. Sometimes you just have to ""dive"" in. (No pun intended but I'll take it anyway)"
4293,isfj,"This resonates with me in a big way. All of the items you listed to help with staying present are things that have helped me, too. You have to learn to let go, live in the moment, and trust other people to let you know how they feel and what they need. "
4294,isfj,"It's so damning! Recently I've been stressing about a workshop that I'm attending in a few weeks. For one, I love that I know exactly where and when it is, but now I have weeks to worry about what I'm going to say, who might be there, what to wear...argh!"
4295,isfj,"I'm 31 years old and have been a TV producer in reality TV for about 8 years. When I've been working, I make incredible money but am absolutely miserable and stressed out all of the time. Trying to bring order and routine to a career path that is always up in the air when your working is impossible. I feel like all the effort I put into the job is a waste of my energy. Being freelance, I'm out of work a lot looking for something new - another job with a new set of responsibilities and challenges. I'm burnt out and need to do something different.
I want to work full time, normal hours, and establish a routine. I did a MBTI test and found that I'm an ISFJ which explains why I've been so unsatisfied while working. I've been suffering from career indecision and anxiety being unemployed the past 3 months trying to figure out what to do next. 
All the jobs that I feel qualified for look like ones that are just going to stress me out for less money, and the rest are entry level jobs that will cut my salary by 50-60%. I rewrote my resume to be more generalized, but all my experience is in TV doing non-ISFJ type responsibilities.
I feel lost and researching all the ISFJ jobs, nothing feels ""right"" and I'm stuck. Looking for any advice or help from this community. Thank you!"
4296,isfj,"Hi! While I was reading your post I imagined myself into your place and really should be a lot stressful passing trough all those years in a career that you can’t schedule anything or be able to wonder what you will have conquered in the next 5 to 10 years. 
So, getting into your new stage of life, as far as I can see you have two choices: you can try get into an agency in the same area of your previous job, were you would have a schedule and a better perspective; or, you can start over in a new career that fits you better, although the salary is lower than you are used to. You can always start over and see where your strength and effort will lead you, have faith in your self.
I think will be more useful for you to find your inner peace, clean yourself from the emotional charges that your last job leaved in you and reflect everyday in the opportunities with your mind-opened and heart full of hope and joy for the new life that is out here to come.
Hope I helped you somehow."
4297,isfj,"I'm not ISFJ but you never got any replies...  I'm ENTP.
Dating your own type can work really well, but also backfire really badly.  There will be things that relationships need that neither of you will want to do.  If something confuses you, it will confuse them too and you won't really be able to help each other.
http://www.socionics.com/rel/idn.htm"
4298,isfj,"I take the test every few months and it's interesting to see how much my percentages change over time. These are my scores, as of a few minutes ago.
Introvert(89%)  Sensing(1%)  Feeling(12%)  Judging(56%)
You have strong preference of Introversion over Extraversion (89%)
You have marginal or no preference of Sensing over Intuition (1%)
You have slight preference of Feeling over Thinking (12%)
You have moderate preference of Judging over Perceiving (56%)"
4299,isfj,"The percentages are how confident the test maker is that you are that type.  It is not a measure of your strength in that category.
But none the less, when I saw the title ""Still an ISFJ"" I couldn't help but think ""well I hope they don't think it's a bad thing!""  "
4300,isfj,"Taken from the Jung test: ""Obtain your 4-letter type formula according to Carl Jung’s and Isabel Briggs Myers’ typology, along with the strengths of preferences, and the description of your personality type.""
It give a measure of strength in each of the 4 categories, eg, how much Introverted I am, etc.
And it really doesn't bother me being an ISFJ. I was just pointing out that I haven't changed much at all, like some people do over time."
4301,isfj,"While it's meant to do that, the test isn't infallible. The percentages aren't indicative of confidence of the test maker, but they shouldn't be heavily relied on for how strong your preference is...here's a few reasons.
1) Your answer are not always accurate. People often answer as how they wish they were, not as how they actually are.
2) The functions along with the letters and their preferences are so complex that it would take a very long list of questions to specifically pinpoint how strong your preference is.
3) The test itself isn't a perfect one. It can't know exactly who you are. While the Jungian typology and Myers Briggs give great descriptions, they can only be so specific.
Notice that the difference between 1% and 7% might be just one question."
4302,isfj,"You should read about the functions and verify that.  I don't believe it's possible for people to change type.  The change from ISFJ to INFJ would be phenomenal to pull off.  Of course, there is a chance you were INFJ from the start."
4303,isfj,"Fellow ISFJs of Reddit, have you ever been the driving force that started a serious relationship?  I ask because we're not really known to be outgoing or to assert ourselves and initiate.  What made you feel like you should/could/wanted to be the initiator, and how did it go?
(side note, because this is sort of related, I think I'm falling for someone, but I can't tell if it's because I actually have feelings for this person, or if I'm just really touch-starved, or if PMS is making my hormones go all over the place, so if anyone can help me make some sense of myself I would be forever grateful!!)"
4304,isfj,I only get involved with people that I'm close friends with for a long time prior. It just helps me with having some stability and knowing of who they are. With my current relationship I was the one that really initiated the official-ness of it heh. I knew that I had some feelings for him for sure and we were friends for 6 months before we became romantically involved. I wanted to be sure he felt the same way and such so I eased into everything really. I need clarity with it. I need to know that the person feels the same as me and that we're clear on everything.
4305,isfj,"I got out of a long term relationship a couple months ago and have now found myself dating casually again. I don't really enjoy dating casually and so I'd like to lock someone down. I think that I might have to be the one to initiate that if that is really what I want. I don't know how to go about it at all. I have only gone so far as so to say to him that we should get together again. THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING! 
I guess really I'm in the same boat as you. Do you just say ""let's date?"" That sounds ridiculous to me! Not to mention terrifying. 
I think I wish it just happened. Like after being together enough times it's just automatic that you are ""dating""
I DONT KNOW AND KNOW IM STRESSING OUT ABOUT THINKING IT!!"
4306,isfj,"I would generally wait for the guy to initiate a serious relationship since I tend to be very conservative and private about my feelings and will wait for the other person to open up first. However, at the VERY beginning stages, I haven't been too shy about asking a guy to go on a date or whatever. "
4307,isfj,"AHHH I thought I was the only one who thought like this!  Everyone else always thinks it's so awkward to date friends or live with friends but I personally would be much more comfortable dating someone I already know and like enough/am compatible enough with to consider friends.
I guess how were you sure he felt the same way?  Did you just ask straight up?  Or was there some finagling involved?  I think that's the hardest part for me, so any advice there is super appreciated :)"
4308,isfj,"So nice to know others are the same! Honestly, I'm really good at reading people and their feelings. I knew he really cared about me, he was always there for me and tried his best to offer any help he could when I was going through tough times. There was definitely a little flirting to just poke at the idea a bit if anything. He seemed to hint at how much I meant to him and such as well. He wasn't very good at being discrete to be honest ha. But when it came to it being official I just went ""I'm gonna do a thing.."" And put him as my boyfriend on facebook, which is really stupid sounding, I don't care for that stuff, but I have never gotten to show someone off publicly before so it was exciting. He just accepted and we went ""Well, we're dating now, huh?"""
4309,isfj,"When I'm talking to my friends about their lives, I'm in my element. I can keep a conversation flowing well for however long, I'm relaxed, calm and most importantly I actually register what they say and build my replies upon that. But when it comes to talking about myself to them, normally the conversation starts to go sour, it gets much harder for me to maintain my flow and I start to get nervous. I'm not sure if its me being unsure about how to describe my own feelings, my friends not being great listeners, or a combination of both - but most times conversations start getting awkward when I'm talking about myself.
Maybe I'm just not an interesting enough person? I think I'm a decent conversationalist, but only when it comes to other people. What about you guys?"
4310,isfj,"I'd call myself somewhat egotistical and I like to talk about myself, but only when I feel like it (so haha i'm also selfish). With my friends I don't mind, but to actually answer your question - i DESPISE being asked questions about my life. I know I shouldn't complain, ""it's a sign that people care for me"", ""there are people who wish their parents would ask about their day"", but honestly? Please stop asking me about my boyfriend, please stop asking me about college, please stop asking about this and that unless you're very specific people.
Then again I might just be wholly selfish. I'm terrible at talking to other people and remembering things about them unless they're either my boyfriend or my best friend. "
4311,isfj,"you are an interesting person. no one is truly boring. you just have to figure out what you feel, what makes you feel what you feel, and how to communicate the entire depth of that openly and honestly with those around you.
maybe this video can help.

4312,isfj,"no I feel you 100%. I noticed that I can't seem to look at people when I talk about myself? I think it's just that, or at least for me, I feel like I need to articulate it perfectly so that there is no misunderstanding. I try to think of the perfect description or story or whatever, and it's impossible for me to do this while talking. Also, I can't seem to relay my slightest opinions to people I know they won't judge me, not even my choices in TV or music or whatever. Strangely, this doesn't apply when talking to complete strangers when I know they don't really matter (i'll never see them again or they just don't mean much to me yet). I think it has something to do with our tendency to want to get along with absolutely everyone, and our reserved nature, and need to be completely understood."
4313,isfj,Talking about myself took a lot of time for me to get over. Especially in interviews. Now I have the confidence to talk the whole hour of an interview or panel but it's taken me years to get there. You've basically got to say you don't care a little even though you do care.
4314,isfj,"It's not that I can't talk about myself, I just have very negative opinions about myself overall (my own worst enemy; as this is a stark difference compare to how others describe me.
It just feels bad man."
4315,isfj,"Haha you just made me realise that I also kind of love talking about myself, but only on my own accord. It's when someone asks me questions about myself that I don't like it. So yes I think you more accurately described how I feel than I did myself :)"
4316,isfj,"Love the video! My main take away is that the same rules apply as when you are listening to someone else. We should be honest, describe our feelings for what they are and speak in such a way that that will encourage the other person to want to know more. I suppose I have a lot to learn, but this was a great help, thank you :)"
4317,isfj,"True, I've noticed I have trouble looking at people when I'm talking about myself as well, or at least I'll start staring off into space. I think us ISFJs just need to really force ourselves to get used to talking about ourselves to others, we'll never improve unless we throw ourselves out there and practice! :)"
4318,isfj,"Hey, I just have to write a paper on my group work and I wondered how fellows ISFJ are in group works.
So basically, we were 5 in my group and we have to write a 30 pages report for yesterday.
The natural division would be 6 pages for everybody.
We had like a month to do so after the end of our group work. And we already done the repartition of the work.
I have started really early so that 10 days before the deadline, I had already finished the parts I was supposed to write.
But group works is what it is, some people didn’t do much or anything, so yesterday the report was 22 pages long and I had to completed/organized it to make it longer.
I couldn’t bear that we don’t finished the report, so I felt obliged to do so even if it weren’t my parts.
Still, I can’t be mad at them because I know that group works always end up like this.
So, how do others ISFJs handle group work ?"
4319,isfj,Incredibly relatable. I often find that I can only rely on myself. Try going to your professor maybe or track down another person in your group who has the same work ethic as you to approach the professor with you or just help you pick up the other members’ slack. It’s incredibly annoying and makes me dread group work but easier than the anxiety of ruining my grade because of someone else.  Not sure how to explain why we do aside from Si planning skills.
4320,isfj,"that is exactly how I do it. Start early, finish early. I do my part and sometimes people can't finish their part and so i make up the rest because it has to be done and someone has to step up and do it.
in middle school I used to be more enthusiastic at the start of a group project. I would actively be part of the discussion on assigning roles and organizing work. I was so active that i'd pretty much take the lead. 
High school and college was different though. After a while, I realize that that enthusiasm is a tell that when things get hard, people know i'll put in that extra work. of course it's only a tell for those looking for it.
so i stopped showing that enthusiasm at the start of a group project. i'll still do the needed work or extra work at the end when it needs to be done, most times for understandable reasons. it's just i'm cautious about getting grouped with a slacker that relies on someone else picking up their...slack. 
There are a rare few people who treat doing work like a game of chicken. It's like they're holding a good grade hostage. It happens, and it sucks to be stuck with them. So i just don't make it feel so easy for them right off the bat. I keep my diligence and perfectionist tendencies a secret."
4321,isfj,"In groupworks, I want things done and accomplished so there has to be a leader. It's groupwork, we have to lead as a group. And that includes managing other people. I advise, really encourage others to step up on their work. If they need help or ideas then as a group, help them with ideas. Strive for that goal or a goal. When you see something wrong, fix it, I think you would know what's most important/right thing to do it that situation.
But if you're looking for how ISFJs do. I might be an ISFJ but heres my experience... I focus on my work before checking on others. When I know I am good on my work I check on others work. Since I may take too much time on myself then I have to consider my work is theirs and their work is mine, since its groupwork, credit is everyones.
I first work my part, ask if it's right, look over it. Help the group with ideas along the way. Correct changes and see if the order makes sense. If some things don't make sense or are wrong, I want the group know the changes we should make and reasons for it. If they don't agree, then just I would bare with it. If we get things wrong its the group, including every individual. One opinion can help change someone's perspectives. I heard groupwork is also valued in the workplace. Imagine the times when you had a job and what would you do on this job, what you should have done. You are counted on the responsibilities and things you need to do on the job.
My work is everyones work and my work is theirs, in groupwork. Its hard to do someone elses work because we may not be taking the credit (might be better to kick them out. Lol.) But yeah, I'd just do my best and move to the next assignment. Better to finish than quitting."
4322,isfj,"Yeah, usually there is at least one or two other people that share my work ethic. 
I also prefer to work alone now, but sometimes it is good to work with other people to share ideas.
But you are right, we usually can’t rely on anybody else, it’s safer to do things by ourselves."
4323,isfj,"INTJ here. I have an interest in an ISFJ who works in my office - how do I best approach this individual?
Some context: we are acquaintances/have spent time together in a group setting. I'd like to start by establishing a friendship, but have little patience for social games or feeling out his interest in me. I am your typically socially dense INTJ and have extreme difficulty interpreting body language and social cues. We are friendly when surrounded by mutual friends, but our one-on-one interactions seem painfully awkward sometimes. My first inclination is to be honest in expressing my interest, but not sure how well my bluntness would be received. 
Tl;dr How do I ask one of you out without scaring you awayyyyyy
Also relevant would be any experiences you ISFJs may have with dating an INTJ. "
4324,isfj,"ISFJ here.
Honestly, I appreciate it when people are straightforward and blunt about their intentions, because it takes away the frustration of over-analyzing everything and second guessing myself.
However, I would caution you to not come on too strong, too soon. 
We're very very private people, and we open up to people slowly, on our own time. If people are too forceful or nosy about getting to know me, it makes me  uncomfortable.
Start by just asking him out for something casual, like maybe going for coffee or something, and see what happens.
Keep the conversation fairly casual for a little while, and don't ask too many really personal questions, if you can help it.
It also helps if you know some things about him already, or if you could try to notice some little details.
For example, do you know what any of his hobbies are, or what kinds of food he likes?
I always feel super flattered when people notice little things like that about me. So for example, if you know he's really into hiking, maybe ask him if he wants to go hiking with you sometime?
Most important advice I can give you is just try to be gentle/kind, especially in the beginning. Nothing scares me away faster than meeting somebody and having them challenge all of my opinions or try to debate me as soon as they start getting to know me.
I love thinkers, but sometimes they intimidate me.
I sincerely wish you luck! :)"
4325,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and my mother is an INTJ, like you. We can interact really well most of the time. But I am always in a supportive role, like subordinate. It works partly because she's my mother. She's older, wiser, and generally guiding me in life. But that could be tricky with a romantic relationship. 
I agree with what the others said. Be so careful that it's not too much too fast. I can clam up for months if people are too forward. Be clear, but not demanding. And be gentle. Pay attention to details about him. Even keep a little log if you have to. Remembering details would make me light up. "
4326,isfj,"ISFJ girl with INTJ guy here. We've been together about 1.5 years. 
First, be honest but not mean. My boyfriend has had to develop some tact when talking to each other, and I have had to work on discussing my feelings openly and honestly. We still struggle to communicate at times--it's honestly like we are on different wavelengths because I will say one thing, he'll interpret it a different way then I meant, we'll continue the conversation, then weeks later realize that we both thought the other meant something completely different. It's so weird, I can't remember experiencing this type of miscommunication in any other relationship. But luckily we've gotten better about clarifying things and the mistakes are usually really random and unimportant.
It does take time for me to open up to others. I took a long time to become open around my boyfriend and I was always confused about where we stood in our relationship as we never really said ""we are boyfriend/girlfriend"" until months after we started hanging out (aka: having sex).
Honestly at this point I feel as though he is the perfect type for me. We enjoy just hanging out together and redditing/video games so each have our own space but we are with each other. We also go out and hike a lot, and sometimes will just have a few people over to drink and play some just dance. He helps me do things I find difficult, and I help him empathize with others. We just truly care about each other a lot, and even if we break up I cannot see it ever being less than amicable as we just... are never mean to each other when we do disagree or are frustrated with each other.
It takes time and can be a bit of a struggle in the beginning (me not opening up soon enough and him being kind of oblivious and this is his first relationship), but we have managed to make it work so far and it has been a very good relationship.
This comment is kind of rambly but if you have a specific question, feel free to ask"
4327,isfj,"I definitely appreciate when people remember the little things about me. I tend to be the person who remembers everything about people's mannerisms so it's flattering when someone else remembers something about me. For example, notice an ISFJ's clothes or lunch and say something about their mannerisms. It's nice to be noticed as an ISFJ. It makes me feel appreciated and special."
4328,isfj,"As an ISFJ, this sounds about right.
I prefer someone be straightforward and just kind of chill, not too aggressive. Though I am married and haven't been on the dating scene in a while, I tended to be more awkward when I was interested in someone and  trying to get to know them. I think this is why the casual, no-pressure interactions were the most comfortable... not too much social overhead keeping my brain busy."
4329,isfj,"Thank you for the advice! Looks like I'm in for the long haul. I'll have to work on toning down my intensity. 
I'll also have to work on keeping conversation light. I gravitate towards heavy discussions and become impatient with people who only want to discuss things as opposed to concepts.
I appreciate the ISFJ for the time and effort it takes to get to know them. I think this will be a worthwhile project, to come to know this person. I see the complexity of the being. "
4330,isfj,"The latter seems to be good advice. Haha. I've already experienced a bit of the clamming up - we hung out once while I was having a fight with a mutual friend and it was clear my anger spilled over into our interaction and seems to have put him off from me. He seems to either be intimidated by me or dislike me extremely sometimes (lack of eye contact, facing away from me), and on the occasion when he does come out of his shell for a split second to make a joke, it's quite softspoken. 
Any advice on how to come back from that/open up a closed ISFJ?"
4331,isfj,"My mom is an INTJ as well... Any advice on how to deal with her? I have always had a relationship of feeling guilty about not being good enough and disappointing her. She has never actually said those things, but I just... Feel like she does feel that way about me. She was not often around me when I was growing up as she worked long hours as a doctor. It is only recently she has realized that putting money ahead of relationships is stupid and has tried very hard to be a good mother (I think she always has been regardless).
I just struggle so much with feeling as if I'm not meeting her expectations. I wrote her a long, sad letter the other day about how I'm sorry I haven't been a great daughter blah blah (kind of regretted it later lol) and since then she's been using an excessive amount of emoticons when texting and just trying to be super supportive... but I still feel like she is just... yeah. I think the problem is mostly on my end.
I have always done what she asked, from switching my major to taking the GRE and LSAT, and will probably be going to law school because that's what she wants me to do. My brother was the total opposite of me, didn't care what she wanted of him and did what he wanted. He is not around for me to ask advice from, though. "
4332,isfj,"You complicated creatures, you. I paid him a compliment on a presentation he gave to our team and he downplayed it so well I felt guilty for saying so. 
To secretly desire acknowledgment for your efforts and smother it with humbleness. Fascinating and contradictory. "
4333,isfj,"Just time. It'll be slow if he's anything like me. You may need to speak softly. I speak at a low volume when I want someone to quiet down. I have to like someone a lot before I can handle loudness. 
Just be around too. Nearby. If your work overlaps, try to work together so there's no other pressure on him. Then you may become less intimidating. "
4334,isfj,"I went to law school because she wanted me to. And dropped out because I hated it. Your story sounds similar to mine. 
One day I was plain and laid out in a more logical fashion what I needed. 
I told her I can tell someone loves me when they spend time with me without an agenda (not gardening, cleaning, painting, or whatever). I also feel loved when someone verbally notices how I did a nice thing like cook dinner or washed the windows or got a masters degree. Without those things I do not feel loved. 
Then I asked her if she would help me feel loved. Even though I can see she works hard to provide (single mom), I don't FEEL loved. 
Then, I asked her what makes her feel loved. It was actually all those things I like to do anyway- cook, clean, make surprises. She also said that she knows she's hurting my feelings all the time. But isn't exactly sure why. So I'll just say, hey mom, I'm proud of my career and I think you should be too. In a gasp of surprise she'll say, ""of course I am!"" But see how her previous comment could lead someone to believe she isn't. 
Long story short, we have lots of micro conflicts to avoid a few big ones. 
I've become better at conflicts. I had to retrain myself to not see them as hateful, but productive. "
4335,isfj,"Ah, thank you for this. I do make an effort to be around and visible - we work on completely separate teams, but my best friends sit across from him, so I'm often over there to visit.
I'll have to tone myself down; I'm normally a very softspoken person myself (""you're so quiet"" is a brand I'm destined to wear for life it seems) but when I'm around him lately I'm quite loud in the hope that he'll notice and engage with me. 
Consistency seems to be key, yes?"
4336,isfj,"One of my biggest fear in life is having a child.  Everytime I think about it,  it makes me scared and depress.  I can't see myself having a child. And when it comes to romantic relationships,  I have a very hard time trusting people.  It's hard for me to open up to people and while not worrying about them using information against me. Do any of you guys feel this way? Sorry for the grammar mistakes. "
4337,isfj,"I want to have a child or be a parent so badly, it scares me :(
Same with romantic relationship, want to be madly in love, and be with a person who loves me.. I have some romantic views on this, but I desire romantic relationship that lasts my lifetime.. it is a deep wish from within, that sometimes - to wish for it often or to even express it like I'm doing here feels scary.
Although I love such close relationships, romantic or parental, I always have a fear deep inside, fear of unknown, fear of losing them.. the more deeply I love , the bigger the fear - I already experience it with my parents. When I realize how much I love them, on one hand it is so beautiful and feel blessed but somewhere deep within, the fear also emerges.. I can't explain that feeling.. .. "
4338,isfj,"I never ever want kids in my life!
Also in relationships I tend to expect too much from my partner while feeling like I give/invest way more in the relationship than the other person.
When it comes to kids I have to turn the dude down right there if he wants kids, its a dealbreaker for me. I don't want him to start trying to change my mind. "
4339,isfj,"Hey! so I wanted to ask, do you consider yourself ambitious? I feel like I am generally ok with just living with my needs covered and enjoying ""simple things"", but sometimes, when I see I have a chance to "" go further"" or achieve something, my ambition increases considerably.
I think that doubting about my capabilities 'prevents' me from being as ambitious as other types may be, because of fear of failure I guess. But when I evaluate the outcomes and see that I might have a good chance of improving in the 'imaginary-scale-of-what-success-is-supposed-to-be' , I become pretty competitive. What about you? "
4340,isfj,"i have strong ambitions but they are all internal. i want to be my best and i want to be proficient or competent at a bunch of stuff. and i work tirelessly for them. but those things i want aren't based in status and aren't being compared to others in society/my community/environment. it's all about beating my prior self. i look at others and their skills and abilities more as guidance and tips or clues i can learn from to further myself. but i don't care about where i am relative to them.
on the other hand, i'm extremely competitive with myself. i can't let past me have the upper hand in anything. and it's extremely stressful."
4341,isfj,"I find as long as I'm passionate about it I can follow through. My friend once described me as someone who gets shit done. I like to smash things out so assignments, things around the house. If something needs fixing I question why nobody's fixed it yet, I think that equates to a high ambition.
Or it equates to a low ambition and a desire to not want to worry about anything for longer than I need to. If it gets done, I no longer have to think about it."
4342,isfj,"I am ambitious as well, I am a doctor, but I am definitely less ambitious than my coworkers. Outside of work I prioritize sleeping and spending time with my family, while a lot of my other co-workers work extra shifts or do research. "
4343,isfj,"My ambition stems from wanting to make my loved ones proud of what I achieved. I also grew up lower-middle class, and money (lack thereof) was often a source bitter conflicts between my parents which left such an impression on me. I wanted to be in a career that would make me comfortable enough to not have to fight with someone over something like money. Plus, I wanted to be able to 'pay-back' or help my family out when I do get established in my career, when they may need help. 
Lastly, yes, I do have some plain-ol', 'I wanna be the best' feelings going on, but it is very low-key. "
4344,isfj,"My ambition is driven by the need to make enough money to maintain taking care of the people I am currently taking care of. Otherwise I would make shit money and live in a secluded cabin but people need me.
Sigh."
4345,isfj,"Seems a very healthy and self-fullfiling way of being ambitious! I had the idea that ISFJs may be more prone to be self-conscious about how others perceive them, so they would compare themselves to the rest to know were they stand. Of course, learning from others skills is a much more mature way to improve oneself. "
4346,isfj,"Just a random thought... After seeing a couple of posts these last weeks were we are insulted (now we are not only insulted and belittled in the r/mbti, but also in our own subreddit??), Why do we try to reason with them politely if they directly show no respect? can we just ignore this people? Remove the post?"
4347,isfj,"I don’t hang out in r/mbti so I can’t really speak to that. I think ISFJs tend to be mostly focused on others, so we’re pretty modest and don’t go around tooting our own horns. Some people might interpret that to mean we don’t have much going on intellectually, but we know better! We just don’t feel the need to brag about it. "
4348,isfj,Hii haha I'm not an isfj but 2 of the most important people in my life are isfjs (sister and best friend). Both are really smart; they both got into top schools and they're both dean's listers/top students. So yeah I wouldn't overthink it. You know your strengths so just live and let live. 
4349,isfj,On top of that you guys are rarely on 'the internets' and unfortunately intp's are the biggest population online - for some reason intp's & isfj's are like oil & water even tho you guys share functions but in different slots. So there is generally alot of teasing of isfj's from intp's online. I think you guys are awesome and have high emotional intelligence but are too humble. 
4350,isfj,"Yeah... I know why it happens, you explained it well here.  It is just that I see no need in going to this specific sub to tell us we are/seem stupid. At least try to phrase it in a nicer way if you expect a nice answer. Because if I respond nicely to these posts, then indeed I feel stupid. "
4351,isfj,"This makes me wonder if I'm an ISFJ or just a really immature one... I get surprised at how quiet/polite the ISFJs are in the MBTI community, despite the number of fuckheads on here. I am constantly raging to the point that I have to leave the community and come back in doses (or just stick around on ISFJ subforms lol)."
4352,isfj,"Hey, TuffTitti, just a quick heads-up:

4355,isfj,"I was very attached to an INTP friend, and our friendship has basically ended. It's been a few days and I'm still having trouble accepting it and moving on. With her gone, I'm now left with only one friend who's been with me before I met her and I'm positive will be here for a lifetime.
Just curious, how do you handle this shit? :/"
4356,isfj,"I’m the same, I get really attached to people and it’s so hard to let them go. One of my friends (well, now an ex-friend...) ended our friendship a bit over a week ago and she was probably the closest to me so it’s really hard. I don’t know what to do about this... I’m trying to focus on myself but it’s difficult. "
4357,isfj,"It's been almost a year since I've ended my friendship with my best friend of 20 years. I'm still not over it. I'm trying to manage and figure out how to handle it. What makes it hard for me because since I'm so introvert, I don't talk to my other friends as much as I talked to her and I feel she was the only one that understood me. 
I'm trying to talk it out with my therapist but haven't come to any resolutions. :-/"
4358,isfj,"I just went through this myself. My friend was also an INTP and we had been what I would consider fairly good friends until she became extremely toxic to the point where I had to cut her off for the sake of my own mental health. I basically idolized her skills and went from adoring her to having to withdraw entirely.
It's been a process of a few months for me to accept it and move on.  I wish it could be faster, and it's mostly along now, but it still stings that I can't talk to her like I used to. I went through periods of trying to talk to her again (like an idiot), going to mutual friends for advice, and generally being upset about the whole ordeal. I should've separated myself from her fully rather than try to bring it back, because she's only exploded at me time and time again. "
4359,isfj,"It's never easy. One of my coworkers (INFJ) became a really close friend of mine (even met her family and her kids, whom I have grown to love) but I was tasked to terminate her due to horrible work performance and conflict of interest issues.
Leading up to it, I cried the day before I had to fire her. Was hard to even keep a straight face in the two-week duration I had to wait to fire her.
She hasn't responded to my calls or messages even though she's reached out to other coworkers to wish them luck and to take care. It's safe to say that my friendship with her has ended.
It sucked for a couple of days but if things ended, then usually there's a very good reason for it. There is a lesson in broken relationships so try to find it and roll with it the best you can. You'll be ok once your head is clear and you become logical in your approach, not emotional. So hang in there!"
4360,isfj,"Holy shit. This is almost identical, except mine doesn't explode at me. She tries her best to be there while at the same time tells my other best friend to dissuade me from contacting her.
Life. Sucks."
4361,isfj,"Since last February, my therapist and I have been talking about this situation and mostly she said I should give it a try to make amends because we've been friends for too long and you can't find friends like that these days. I shouldn't let 1 situation outweigh the entirety of our friendship. She also advised me to just give up trying to find answers to our problems because it's making me go into a vicious cycle.
However, she is getting annoyed that I still haven't came to a conclusion as it has been almost a year. So, I kinda stopped talking about it. 
I have also spoke to a psychic about the situation and she advised me to just end it completely. Lol So, that also did not help with my indecisiveness. 🙄"
4362,isfj,"That's what I meant by approaching the end of the friendship logically than emotionally. It hurts in the beginning but if you really think about it, I'm sure you'll find clarity in why your friendship ended, whether you like it or not or whether it was your fault or theirs. Things happen for a reason so try to find that one striking reason.
I did my best to save her, so I'm ok knowing that. Work performance can be helped but the conflict of interest issue couldn't, so that's my logical side kicking in to try to justify it. Also, lesson learned for me. It is my first time having to fire anyone, and it just had to be done during the first week of the new year but there was nothing I could do as the decision has been made. I did cry about it, moped about it, but it has to end. I'm sure she's grappling with her own demons."
4363,isfj,"Try calling her again after a few months, maybe? If she still doesn't pick up, then there's nothing else you can do.
I know the reasons why my friendship ended. I may currently be in a weakened state that I can't accept them. I hunt for answers that feel good to me, but are logically false. Sometimes I feel I've moved on, then the following hour I'm hit with the feels again. It's weird."
4364,isfj,"It's not weird at all, and don't feel bad because you feel that way. You're just going through the motions and that's normal especially if the incident happened recently. Keep yourself busy if you can. Idle mind doesn't help. Or give yourself a deadline on how much time to grieve the failed friendship.
Just like what you said to me, in time, things might change. You never know. But also, I'm not gonna bother trying to contact her. I've done my part so ball is in her court. If she chooses not to, I'll live."
4365,isfj,"​
I'm sure many of you guys have heard of the ISFJ Si-Ti loop. So in every personality type the dominant and tertiary function are in the dominant attitude for the type. So for an extrovert the dominant and tertiary function are in an extroverted attitude and same for introverts with their dominant and tertiary function. Every personality can have a tendency to get into a dominant and tertiary function loop. Because we feel the most comfortable in our introverted world we can enter a dominant-tertiary loop with our Si and Ti. I wanted to write out this post to help people identify whether they are in an Si-Ti loop and provide some tips for how to get out of it. You guys can also comment with ways to get out of the loop.
Si-Ti loop in ISFJs
We can get caught up in remembering past experiences and then instead of checking in with others via our Fe to get outiside perspective we can use Ti to overanalyze the past experience and get stuck in a rut. Our we can use it to become perfectionists and insist that every detail is done perfectly. In addition, we can use it as a strategy to emotional disconnect from others to avoid getting hurt. We could also use it as an excuse as to why we can't make friends or leave the house. This obviously in the long run leads to a critical spirit towards other people and feelings of loneliness and unhappiness. While it is good to get better at Ti, we shouldn't be using it more than Fe. Ti must be used in service of Fe.

How to get out of a Si-Ti loop
The first step is to try to get out of your head. The main thing that helps me is to remember the human element in decision making. It also helps to if you have someone you trust to talk about your feelings and emotions as this can allow your Fe to breath and relax a bit. Reach out to someone you haven't talked to in a while and see how they are doing. Think about ways you can help the people in your lives. Volunteering is also a good option. You can also try and meet new people remember each new people represents new potential positive possibilities.

4366,isfj,"I usually default to isolation and hiding in my head when I’m particularly depressed. However, I am a supervisor in the mental health field and am surrounded by friends who understand and can detect when people are detaching. Not only did they not allow me to isolate this last strong episode, I also myself decided that at any point, I could not be completely alone. I talked to people all the time or had some sort of noise going on to prevent myself from getting into my head. I processed how I felt, I used the phrase “cognitively I understand what you’re saying, but I still feel this way,” and I worked hard to take feedback appropriately, even though it was more difficult than normal. 
I’m on the upswing. I have had to work very hard for the past month and a half to continue functioning in work. I have forced myself into social situations with select trusted friends; I have broken down in some of these situations, but processed and moved on quickly. 
Don’t fall into this trap if you can catch yourself! I’ve done it in the past, and it hurts and takes much longer to get out. "
4367,isfj,"I really wish my parents would have given me that extra push that I needed  to explore things outside my comfort zone. I have always chosen to stick with what i know, what i know i like and what i know I'm good at because it makes me feel comfortable and secure. I think that really would have helped me in being more open to experiencing new things and embracing change instead of avoiding it."
4368,isfj,"I have an ENTP mom. She was always pushing me to do better and better and although I appreciate all she taught me sometimes I wish she coulda slowed the heck down and appreciated where I was and the progress I'd made in life. Sometimes I felt like her ""project""."
4369,isfj,"Looking back, most the mistakes I made were my own.  The only thing I really would have changed was being allowed to fail.  I always had a fallback.  As much as I disliked my recently passed father, he instilled a work ethic (although late to bloom) that I wouldn't trade for anything.  He was right about many things that I didn't appreciate until it was too late. "
4370,isfj,"Hello ISFJ's! We made a groupchat on groupme and would like you to join us!
https://groupme.com/join_group/14593377/1y4sFa
Please give it a chance! You might enjoy it!
EDIT: Downloading the app will make things a lot easier!
EDIT 2: Groupme requires my phone number/name :(!
Yes, it does. However, nobody can see your phone number except for you - groupme is actually technically a texting app and can be used via text without the app, that is why. Your name can be easily changed/hidden/whatever you like. However, it's worth noting that ANY inappropriate behavior WILL get you kicked (it has happened before) and there HAVE been irl meetups stemming from this chat. Nobody is out to stalk you! We're chill."
4371,isfj,"(I posted this on r/ISFP earlier, so im also posting it here.)
I decided to take the test again just because I haven't taken it in a while, and I was surprised when I got ISFJ, not ISFP. So i decide to look through the description to see if there's any reason why it's different, besides the fact that my Judging and Perceiving has always been very balanced. There was one thing that resonated with me so much I knew I had to be an ISFJ.
""Given how generous Defenders are with their warm praise and support, it’s not surprising that others enjoy their company enough to call them friends. The challenge is to be considered a friend back – people with the Defender personality type are shy and a little protective of themselves, but they also need to be able to connect on a deeper emotional level. It makes sense then that most of Defenders’ friends are made not by random encounters on a wild night out, but through comfortable and consistent contact, as in class or in the workplace where they have the time to get to know each other little by little.""
The person who I'd consider my closest friend, we only met a year ago, and it was by talking to each other consistently in class everyday our friendship grew. I think after reading this I was mistyped for a while. 
As for how my results came out this time:


Introverted: 97%


Observant: 58%


Feeling: 86%


Judging: 54%


Turbulent: 64%


So i'm actually an ISFJ instead"
4372,isfj,"As a matter of fact, when your scores are in the middle you should always consider the option that you could be in the other dimension.
Type is natural so always look into your unfiltered, natural behavior. The past is also a good point to analyze for this. "
4373,isfj,"16 personality is largely agreed upon to be a bad cite in the community, and I’ve found most tests to be at best %75 percent accurate. If you want a more in depth test check out theses cites

4374,isfj,"I took another test showing the cognitive functions instead. I agree with that! And thank you for showing me a more accurate test. Also sorry for the super late response. 
It types me as an ISFJ as well, which i admit fits so much better. "
4375,isfj,"Is an ISFJ in a long term with an INTP, so not exactly the same but similar. It's working out really well. we have been together 3 years, and are planning to get married. Our relationship is freaking phenomenal, but we do have our drawbacks both being introverts. We struggle with going out often since we like being inside. We compliment each other so well because my INTP will think things through in ways I never even considered, he helps me live in the moment, relax and is beyond patient with me especially when I wind myself up and over think the future. One of our main struggles is that is isn't the most driven person. He is great about putting in the mental energy but often I'm doing a lot of the physical work. He has grown a lot and is willing to help me and not let me do everything. I love is silly sense of humor and how we rarely ever have any issues. Even when we have disagreements, we are able to talk through them and work through things. One of the biggest things I learned in my relationship with him is if it's not a deal breaker, don't give him a hard time, he will step up to bat and be the man I need him, but if I demand him to do things it's never going to happen. I don't know if that is helpful or not. "
4376,isfj,"I'm married to one! We've been together for 18+ years and married for 15 years as of June 1st. He just understands me and I understand him. He brings me out of my shell just enough and I keep him balanced, I think. It's never really felt difficult to me but we've been together since I was 17 and he was 18 so we kind of grew up and learned how to adult together. =)"
4377,isfj,"ISFJ and ENTP are in ""duality"" relations according to socionics, which is ideal match by jungian type that offers greatest support and understanding for both people involved. Individual traits will vary, of course, but as far as MBTI types go the light cannot get more greener than with this match (INTP is another great type pairing)."
4378,isfj,"I've been 7 years with my ENTP SO and we work really well together. It has not been always like that, we have had some issues, mainly about how we communicate things and some insecurities of mine. But after 7 years we understand each other really well,  share a lot of hobbies and have similar visions of life. Our little disagreements now are mainly about housekeeping, I do most of the tasks and he is a mess with his stuff. But we have no major discussions. I admire and have learnt from some of his qualities and I think I can say the same the other way around. "
4379,isfj,"I dated an ENTP, and at first for the few month of the relationship, it was amazing, we both couldnt get enough of each other. But then slowly, he started becoming distant, ENTP's enjoy their space and prefer to be alone sometimes and value this a lot, and I really failed to try and give him this, I just wanted to spend so much time with him together. However, I could definitely look back and see that this played a huge factor into why we could not be together. I also find that with ENTP's they struggle to be affectionate, I enjoyed helping him out wherever possible, trying my outmost best to give him whatever he desired (As weird as that sounds) but I personally didnt feel I was getting the same back. I remember I kept using the word 'deserve', and he hated it. I also dont like people who dont stick to their word on things, and many times he would say one thing to me but then not attempt to try and achieve it (even though he had the capacity and time to do so). 
Communication is so key! At first, I would not tell him when I was upset and assumed he could tell however ENTP's are terrible at reading body language and would rather much prefer you to tell them, be open and immediately inform them when you feel sad or down because waiting around for them to realise might require a few years. 
Ahaha, hope this helps. 
But bear in mind, if an ENTP's really into you, he will be willing to change, adapt himself and help you. I found specifically with my ex, he didnt at all help me reach my full potential in fact quite the opposite, I felt like I became less like my self around him and took on negative characteristics. "
4380,isfj,"Oh god, I hate the word ""deserve"". Haha
Ehh, with ENTPs and productivity, most the time you just have to have blind faith. There's a lot of stumbling and falling and trying. It gets better, but it's taxing and takes a long time. Individual independence goes a long way.
Source: ENTP, was in LTR with ESFJ."
4381,isfj,"What do you guys think of it? Do you think it's a nice way to get to know people? Or is it as useless as the commercials before YouTube videos, and you wish we could just skip to deeper conversations?
I've asked this in all the mbti sub-reddits (is that what it's called?) Someone posted an article about it in the INTP group, if you want to read it, but you don't have to, just want to know what you think. -curious intp
Also I don't know how to define small talk, but I think it's safe to include social graces, work/school, and weather (I apologize if you are a weather nerd or something and actually find it very intriguing to talk about)"
4382,isfj,"ISFJ here. 
I have mixed views on it. In one sense, I hate it because I feel like you just skim over the other person's day/how they're REALLY doing. There's also this stupid societal rule that you should say, ""I'm good, thanks!"" every single small conversation you have like you're supposed to always be ""good."" So I feel like it puts a mask on the person and you dont get to talk about their real mood. Of course as an ISFJ I want to have a deep conversation about the other person's life and whatnot. 
On the other hand, you sometimes get little tidbits of information that add up over time. You get to know likes/dislikes, schedules, small incremental updates on a situation, etc. In a way it's kind of a daily checkup. "
4383,isfj,"So you do enjoy knowing these stuff about people (schedules, how they are doing, what they did yesterday) and just want people to answer a little more honest so that it dosen't turn into a forced ritual sort of?
edit: thanks for good answer btw"
4384,isfj,"Yes, this!
If someone asks me how I am, if I'm having a shitty day, I will say something reflective of that. It's always so fascinating to me when they look at me with slight shock or their eyes glaze over when I don't give back the typical ""I'm fine, thanks!"""
4385,isfj,"INFP/F/25
Thanks for taking the time to read and I appreciate any insight and suggestions! 
Long story short, I roomed with an ISFJ in an apartment a year ago. We met in college and became close friends and roomed together our sophomore year as well. We grew apart when I started dating and getting really close to this guy. I spent (and still spend) a lot of time with him. She didn’t like him and I think she thought I valued him more than I valued our friendship. In hindsight, I shouldn’t have put him above my other friendships...I was so excited to really click and genuinely be in love with someone that I accidentally started to blow off some of my friends and family. 
She never told me why she didn’t like him. Instead, she was extremely passive aggressive and rude to him whenever he came over. She acted more like my mom than my friend and that really pissed me off. I know she probably saw it as “helping” and trying to look out for me, but I saw it as controlling and rude. I used to really value her opinion and talk to her for advice, but when I got into a habit of thinking a bit more for myself and not telling her everything, she started to get distant and pissy. It’s like she enjoyed me being dependent on her and consulting her for everything. I tried to talk things out with her on several different occasions but she blew me off each time, so eventually I gave up and started being rude back to her. 
Fast forward a year and a half-we both apologize to each other and have hung out a couple times, one on one for much over the span of the past few months. It’s gone well, but we’re not near as close as we used to be. She seems to have grown a lot as a person and I feel like I did too. She reached out to me first so I think she’s wanting to rebuild our friendship too. We used to share the same friend group but she was friends with them first so I’ve stepped back and haven’t made an attempt to hang out with them because I was introduced through her. 
I know this is probably a weird question but how do I pursue this friendship without seeming needy or awkward? How do I make the most of this? She reached out to me first, and then I reached out so would it be her turn to reach out to me again to hang out? "
4386,isfj,"If you want to rebuild the friendship, don’t worry about whose turn it is. Starting behaving how you envision you would if the relationship were more developed. That’s invitation enough for her to open up again. "
4387,isfj,"I think that the main thing is just understanding yourself and also understanding what her needs are or how she might perceive things you do, even if you didn’t intend it that way. Maybe you two can discuss your personality types and just lay out on the table what your different needs from the friendship are and just let her know that she is valued to you. Lay down your boundaries that you’ve decided on as far as how much time you are willing to spend with her or other friends and what time is for your significant other, then communicate it so it is understood by all. I’m an ISFJ and my main desire is to feel needed...to take care of the people I love and be someone for them to turn to. Hope that helps somehow!"

4392,isfj,"My (F)best friend (M) is an ENFP - we get on like a house on fire. But he’s also very considerate to not be overbearing and he really brings me out of my shell. He’s very attention seeking but in a way that doesn’t irritate me- more in a “class clown” type, which is funny to me. So in friendships I think it can work"
4393,isfj,"Im a isfj and I think my boyfriend is an Enfp or a Entp. I cant remember and it doesnt help that he just skims when he reads things, so lord knows if either is correct. We did the test around teo years ago."
4394,isfj,"My roommate is an ENFP and he loves hanging out with introverts. His best friends tend to be intj’s, so we get along great and it’s kinda turned into a long term roommate type thing. I’m an ISFJ.
We’re both guys and both gay, but there’s nothing going on between us (I recommend the whole platonic thing for similar friend/roommate situations). It gives us plenty in common to talk about like work and games and guys. He’s got his whims which I kinda watch and try myself, like cooking or decorating. I tend to stick to my regiments a bit better than he does, but he out performs me almost every time he tries. Except in decorating to a theme, I’m better there. (I accept my inabilities and kinda find em funny, a skill he’s helped me to cultivate) 
He’s strangely less of a socialite than I am, but he’s a better butterfly. When we go out together to dinner or shopping for apartment things, we kinda come off as a stable couple. I mean two guys who look comfortable together shopping for furniture or ordering food and quickly hopping back into conversation and laughing a lot can give off that vibe. However he doesn’t go out to find friends the way that I do. I like to have a ton of people who contribute to myself as a person. I like to learn from people by observation and also advice. Lots of perspectives help me feel comfortable with a decision. He’s comfortable in his own skin so he doesn’t have to do that, instead he’s kind of a social consultant. 
He’s less comfortable with conflict than I am so in order to spare him the discomfort, I’ll face difficult issues that impact both of us. When we do anything with our apartment people for instance, I have a better business demeanor and tend to get my way better. He definitely helps me when it comes to things to think about or reference or bring up that I may have left out though. But I put the big boy voice to better use and can pleasantly but firmly cancel a service that’s degraded or demand an issue be looked into (i only really do that when it’s for more than just myself, I’m a fan of just biting the bullet if I’m alone). 
I guess what I’m trying to say is that, as an ISFJ, the ENFP who collected me makes me feel comfortable and relaxed where I would normally be anxious or mildly rude and allows me to help him where i can. It’s a very healthy give and take friendship. Romantically? No clue. "
4395,isfj,"My best friend is an ENFP!! She's really wonderful, I adore her! She's very thoughtful and considerate of me, and she loves me and is totally willing to meet me on my level instead of dragging me places I don't wanna go and wearing me out. She can help bring me out of my shell and get me out of my house, but she's flexible enough that she doesn't mind if I just wanna stay home. She's also very emotionally intelligent and understanding, so she's one of few people in the world who knows me well and totally accepts me as I am, which is a really wonderful feeling. Sometimes I feel undeserving of how generally lovely she is, but she insists that she loves me anyway, so it's all good :') We also have a lot of similar interests, so we have a lot of fun talking about shows and podcasts and stuff! "
4396,isfj,"My work partner is an ENFP. I think we make a pretty good team (he comes up with creative ideas, I handle the logistics), but I am pretty tired of being around him at the end of the day. ENFPs can be quite draining for introverts. Thankfully, he understands that sometimes I just need to retreat to my own space."
4397,isfj,"I've been in an off-again, on-again relationship with an ENFP male for almost 6 yrs now. I'm an ISFJ female. His major issues with me: he finds me too sensitive, stubborn, stuck in my ways, and I want everything done in order (and traditionally, which he absolutely hates!). My major gripes with him: his inconsistency (he'll have multiple plans going, but never thinks them through at all and none ever come to fruition), his ""irrational thoughts"" (I sometimes feel like his head is in the clouds and I'm sitting there thinking, ""Is this guy for real?""). 
That said, I think it's gotten to a point where he NOW appreciates all the things that make me an ISFJ, and I've learned to appreciate him being an ENFP. It took a long ass time, and holy hell was it an emotional rollercoaster. Being almost opposites can mean a broader perspective on life and encourage the ability to have a well-rounded point of view, which is so great. 
As always, take this with a grain of salt because everyone is different. But keep the communication and be open-minded and EXTREMELY patient is all I can offer."
4398,isfj,Fun! The attention-seeking bit reminds me of another ENFP I know-- I myself am a somewhat mellow ENFP with bursts of ridiculousness. I have been talking to an isfj and I think we are interested in each other but we need to spend more time getting to know one another. (: thank you for your reply
4399,isfj,Thank you for sharing your experience!  It sounds like a very fruitful friendship and you've laid out the ways y'all help each other. Funny you mentioned that he's not very social because that's where I have found myself the last few years. I've found people I love and enjoy being around and so I don't have much impetus to put effort into seeking new people.
4400,isfj,"I have ENFP friends who can be draining to me too, haha! If I get hyped up I can be a ball of energy, but I am not generally the most energetic person. I'm glad that he gives you space when you need it!"
4401,isfj,"Thank you for your response! I am a relatively chill enfp and sometimes finding something too unimportant to give a shit (like traditions, decorating for holidays, etc) can be fun if someone else wants to add some structure and zest to it. I'm wondering if you two were relatively young (late teens, early 20s?) when you started dating. "
4402,isfj,"No, not at all. I was 26 and he was 29 at the time.
It was literally a case of ""culture shock"" for him because hes not used to someone who is so grounded and he's whirling around like a tornado or a chicken with its head cut off lol. 
If you have any specific questions, just feel free to message me directly instead."
4403,isfj,"Any ISFJs out there enjoy smoking weed? If so, why? What about it do you like and how does it make you feel? How often do you do it, in what situations, etc.
If not, why not? How did it make you feel and why didnt you like it?
My ex was ISFJ (I'm an INFJ) and I would smoke around him quite a few times as I like to smoke. It's something that means a lot to me and I wanted him to experience it and see if he liked it, and I wanted him to try it with me since he was comfortable around me. However, I think he felt that I was pressuring him when really I just wanted to have an open conversation about WHY or WHY NOT he didn't want to, so I could address any concerns he had. It was hard for him to have this conversation because he just ended up feeling bad. Anyway, he agreed he wanted to try it with me and I was planning how and where it would be to ensure him to have the best experience...but we never got around to it and he would never actually bring it up, so I felt like it didn't really appeal to him which was upsetting. I confronted him about it, and he said that he DID want to try it but that he wasn't dying to. I know he liked drinking though because it was more of an acceptable thing and it made him more outgoing. Just trying to gain insight..."
4404,isfj,"Hi, I think I can't speak for all ISFJs but I enjoy weed the most if I don't have to do anything after. It makes me relaxed and a little bit tired. That's why I usually smoke/vape in the evening with my friends. I started it at 18 because I was curious since I've been younger and only then got my first connection. With weed I have got more control over myself than with alcohol. One thing I don't like, is being high in public (ok, maybe with sunglasses). I now am 21 and know a lot of great people who smoke weed and the world kind of changes when you realize just how many people smoke in such a small distance and how relatively normal it has become (although most parents still don't like to hear about it). I live in a rural area in Austria by the way."
4405,isfj,"I love weed. I usually prefer smoking it alone at home, usually it allows me to feel REALLY relaxed and without worries. Also, I enjoy the plus of creativity I get with weed, it takes my mind out of the little daily things I usually focus on, and let me think about more abstract things? I don't know. 
I also like to smoke it outside in a bright day, with a blue sky and people wandering on the streets. I love to observe everything and it gives me a sense of belonging and amazement for the world, and humanity, and everything! It changes my sometimes pessimist perspective of things. I have to be cautious to not be very dependant of weed though. I enjoy it too much :'). 
I have to add sometimes I can have a slightly bad trip, because weed can increase my focus in my anxieties, or if I am outside, I can be obsessed that people is looking at me and judging me.. I don' t know if it is a usual thing!  But normally I enjoy it"
4406,isfj,"For me, I'm just nervous to do so because I never have before. I guess I worry and bout being laughed at or something and I didn't want to become like the ""potheads"" at my school. I'm 18 but I still feel younger and so it feels like something I shouldn't do for my age. Like it felt wrong. But idk how I would feel now in a situation where someone asks me to smoke. I've only ever eaten a pot brownie but there wasn't much in it so I didnt really feel anything, just kinda relaxed. But before eating it, I was feeling nervous. I suppose I just felt like I was being pressured to do it, and I HATE being pressured because it makes me really anxious and I freak out."
4407,isfj,"I think this has more to do with upbringing and entourage than with types, to be honest.
ISFJs that grew up sheltered, with no 'cool' friends might be less open to this experience. I have no problem with it, although I kind of dislike the 'dude weed lmao' culture. I was introduced to it by my close friends, who were mature enough to trust. Although I was a little nervous before trying it for the first time, I enjoy it a lot.
I'm not doing it on a regular basis, since I don't know any dealers personally. I smoke when I reunite with my old friends and they have some ready. It's the social aspect that makes it really enjoyable. I don't think I'd like to do it regularly in solitude. 
From an ISFJ point of view, I like it because it allows my Ne silliness to surface without feeling inappropriate/retarded. And sometimes it interacts in a funny way with my Si. I remember getting high with a friend at his place - we were really baked and went to sleep. 10 sec after turning off the lights, I would start remembering the stupidest things and start laughing in the dark. And then I was thinking how silly I am to laugh like this, and laugh harder, pulling the covers over my head. Then stopping for 5 seconds and remembering another thing - and my friend muttering ""oh, for fuck's sake!"". "
4408,isfj,"Hey I like weed. Weed helps me relax and enjoy the moment. I smoke it both alone and with friends. It's great because it helps me enjoy the moment for a little bit and not have to worry about little things. Best thing about weed is that it's reportedly the least harmful drug even less than alcohol. I also like how it is a huge stress reliver for me. I think it's common for ISFJs to be opposed to things like weed that are ""socially unacceptable"". But at least here in California it's legal and I feel comfortable doing it. Overall, Weed is my favorite drug. "
4409,isfj,"As someone who struggles with addiction to things like video games, fried potatoes, anime, etc I can only imagine what something bad for my body would do if I got addicted to it
I dont like the idea of getting high because I could do something really stupid and I might do something to someone I wouldnt do if I were sober
Basically I like having control over my actions and to be honest the only ""benefit"" to weed is being more relaxed but I can relax myself better in more meaningful ways besides just trying to fit in to a crowd that would pressure me to do something like this"
4410,isfj,"In my case, its just social anxiety. I dont have anything against people who do it, I have lots of friends who do. I am a little curious to try it. Idk if I would like it or the expierence of being high but I know I have to try it to find out. I guess I worry about having a bad experience. "
4411,isfj,"I understand. Well, you are still young. It seems like you're still in high school, so I wouldn't rush it. The first time I tried was my first year in college, and that was purely because I wanted to. I would look up videos and forums on what being high felt like and it appealed to me. So I told one of my close friends I would like to try with just her for my first time and all went well. But I can see how if you are going into it being anxious and insecure, it will only make the experience that way. You have to just chill. In the most literal sense. And if you still don't enjoy it, then oh well!"
4412,isfj,"I was wondering if our sameness stretched further to learning styles! If you don't know yours, here's a quiz: www.youthink.com/quiz.cfm there are better ones out there if you want an in detail response. I am personally a highly auditory learner. 
Edit: Sorry guys op failed and the link is broken, use this http://www.youthink.com/quiz.cfm?obj_id=598"
4413,isfj,"I'm a kinesetic and audio learner. I can remember what a teacher said pretty much by their words. I also take detailed notes, though half the time I hardly have to read them afterward. I also have to doodle or I feel anxious and can't pay attention."
4414,isfj,"I hate conflict. Usually I am the peacemaker and try to patch up the problems. I just want everyone to get along. However with my closest friends and family if there is conflict I will usually try to talk about it and somehow work it out, but I tend to get very emotional about the situation and often overreact. I will usually calm down quickly and then things will settle down, resolve, and get back to normal. "
4415,isfj,"The conflicts I usually get into are like very emotional and upsetting. I rarely get ""angry"", I get frustrated and upset. To a point I can't talk, and I just want to cry
But yeah, some conflicts are easily avoidable..For an example, if I order something at a restaurant and they get my order completely wrong, I just suck it up and pretend like it's completely fine, and I take the food with a smile. Which is why people think I'm so laid back and friendly because I'm not easily angered.
Things I can't control, I just cry about it, and try to problem solve after consulting with my friends and family for advice"
4416,isfj,"I find myself trying to avoid them at all costs, but all that ends up doing is leaving me to my own thoughts and I manage to think in circles.  I've found although more difficult, it pays off for my mental state to deal with conflict directly so I can have closure on an issue."
4417,isfj,"I'm curious about what everyone on this sub does for a living, or if they are in college what they are majoring in. Do you like what you do? 
I'm going to be a senior in high school, so unfortunately I can't get the ball rolling, but I hope to go to college and major in political science (not entirely sure yet). I'm interested to see what fellow ISFJ's do, and find out if the stereotype that all of us are teachers or nurses holds true ;)"
4418,isfj,"I'm in college studying Applied Math with a minor in Economics. I really enjoy taking my classes and when I graduate, will look for a career in actuarial science. This isn't the ""expected"" career choice for an ISFJ, but it fits me!"
4419,isfj,"I work at a business in my tiny tourist town. My job duties are many. I was originally hired to fill in until they hired a more experienced line cook for the restaurant, and then was moved to bakery and prep cook. I also work a few days a week at our kitschy gift shops, and occasionally lead school kids on tours, talking about local agriculture and pioneer lifestyle. 
I prefer working in the kitchen, in the back, where my interactions with strangers is less, but the retail aspect had helped me be (or at least appear) more gregarious, and my helpful nature fits well there. "
4420,isfj,"Administrative Assistant. Previously food service, retail, barista... lots of customer service. Majored in Economics and International Relations. Wanted to be a teacher when I was younger, so there's that stereotype :P
College is a great time to experiment and explore. You’ll earn general education credits that count toward your degree, no matter what you major in. Just be aware that for some fields like engineering, courses have to be taken in a specific order. Most students change their majors as well. Good luck!"
4421,isfj,"Heading off to my first year of college soon - the plan is to become a clinical psychologist. I know it's a lot of talking to people (which can be draining for the introvert in me), but often it's one-on-one or in small groups, which I'm perfectly fine with."
4422,isfj,"I have always liked math. I advanced early in middle school with Algebra, and made my way up to finishing multi-variable (or more correctly multidimensional) calculus. I had always found that I had a knack for figuring things out, math problems, puzzles, etc., and wanted to continue that in my future. I was introduced to Actuarial Science by a friend and was really intrigued. I chose Applied Math because it would lead me to the Actuarial field, as well as allow me options if being an Actuary doesn't pan out. But I'm hopeful, and see me applying math in someway."
4423,isfj,"It's indirectly related, it provided me critical thinking skills. IR combines a bit of everything, poli sci, history, foreign language, and econ. I ended up as admin because I love helping the people I work with. "
4424,isfj,"Private manufacturing firm, we have clients from the government though. Is working with the government your focus? I have a friend who majored poli sci (works for private), if you have any questions about the major I can ask him. "
4425,isfj,"So I was just with my friend (ENTP) and I was putting up the pieces in settlers of catan (board game). I wasn’t exactly sure how the pieces fit in the box, so I was taking a little bit of time while he was just watching. I looked over at him and he was slightly chuckling (not in a mean way) and said it was funny watching my thought process in action. He didn’t mean it to be mean, but Immediately I felt very hurt but didn’t say anything since there were others around and I didn’t want to act upset. I just kind of laughed it off. But for some reason that comment really hurt me because i felt stupid because of how I was second guessing everything I was doing and trying really hard to not look dumb while putting the pieces back. I just feel like a total fucking idiot sometimes. I Hate who I am a lot of the time. "
4426,isfj,"Words can linger far longer than you realize. It is also because that we allow them to wound us so deeply because we place emphasis on them.
If the scenario was different, perhaps say you were putting the pieces back in the box, or solving a puzzle on your own with great difficulty. The only critic in the room is you. There is no pressure to get it done in a specific time frame and any criticism you have is from yourself. To which, as an ISFJ, might feel less hurtful than that of your friends.
We are prone to insecurity. Worrying about whether we're doing the right or wrong thing. We want to please others and be the best example so that others may follow in our path. When we make mistakes in front of others, it can feel especially demoralizing because perhaps this is not the example you wanted to portray to them. That, if given a second try, you are sure you'd get it right.
Remember that your friend didn't specifically set aside a day to come and see you fail, and laugh at you. No one goes to a restaurant to find someone and talk behind their back as they mock you at the other table. It may feel embarassing to seem like a failure in the eyes of society, but you're only human. And humans make mistakes. In time, they may forget about it completely.
""“You probably wouldn’t worry about what people think of you if you could know how seldom they do."" -Olin Miller
Be kind to yourself. Your strengths come in careful attention to detail and overwhelming compassion."
4427,isfj,If that was my game and I saw you put the pieces away slowly I would REALLY appreciate you because I value doing things right and keeping my possessions in good condition. I think this is a good quality :) don’t be down on yourself for being patient! Not many people in the world are patient these days. 
4428,isfj,"Although this sounds like two guy friends, as a female isfj dating an entp (we are duals btw, supposed to be the best relationship)... I would say he probably thought you putting the pieces away was actually adorable in the most masculine way possible. Entps are spazzy (in the best of ways), and isfjs can be very particular. He likely admired you for being so detailed and thoughtful in your process. Don’t be a mind reader - it’s more likely your friend absolutely adores how you go about life, because in theory (and in my experience), we are complementary opposites. Isfjs use
Si Fe Ti Ne. Entps use Ne Ti Fe Si. We use the same but backwards. We tend to admire their crazy ideas and their brilliant wit, and they tend to admire our methodical approach, stability, and sweetness. 
My point is, you never know what any person is REALLY thinking. Check into cognitive distortions in relation to CBT. This has helped me a ton. I’d say you do what I do a lot: Mindreading. But in reality a person may be thinking the exact opposite to what you think they are, no matter how well you think you can read a person."
4429,isfj,"Does he get annoyed at you for not expressing your feelings fast enough? Or being slow to answer? How do you spend most of your nights together, and how do your long term plans look? I'm in a similar relationship, trying to work out all the kinks... Probably her not expressing herself well bothers me the most, but there's a lot of positives to balance"
4430,isfj,"Interesting first question. I actually find I (the isfj) express my feelings faster than him. Being slow to answer ... he doesn’t seem bothered by that, but occasionally does the “get to the point” thing. As an Si dom, we tend to be very linear, step by step, hard to do the Ne keyword thing. But now that we’ve been together for three years I feel I’ve definitely improved in this area. As for how we spend our time together, we balance each other out very well. I’m open to his ideas of new adventures, and surprisingly he enjoys taking it easy most nights and just chilling out talking. So anything from snowy hikes, to bike rides, to chess, to spending hours just talking, or being lazy watching tv when we both just want to turn our brains off (we try not to make that a habit though). We both have had the future talk and are both very serious about our relationship. Surprisingly I’m the one okay not getting married. But we are planning for the long term, potentially kids, both very committed to this as a life-long relationship. We actually moved across country on a bit of a whim together after a year of dating, which was exhilarating. The “not expressing herself well” may be an age thing and may become easier for her with time (this is assuming she’s the isfj, is that correct?) How old are you both if you don’t mind me asking. What other “kinks” do you guys have? As a side note, it’s absolutely the best relationship I’ve been in by far, full of love, growth, balance, fun, and compatibility. "
4431,isfj,"shes 28, im a little older. i find it hard to motivate her to do things after she comes from a day of work, not into really anything out of the box like hiking, although we've started playing cards. we kind of get sucked into screens when she gets home. she has no real interests other than family, or starting a family, so i think im trying to develop her interest in life outside of family, but im having difficulty. any tips? i think earlier i used to be the adventurous type, but its taxing to try plan stuff and have to argue with her because shes never up for things, other than time at home that often involves screens.
to her credit, we live in a cold city and its shitty outdoors, so it can be hard to find activities to do when its shitty outside.
i think the main problems is 1) little motivation to do things outside her comfort zone 2) her not talking about her feelings often enough when it comes to the world around us. she talks about me and her, but not much outside me of her. she doesnt talk much around my friends also, kinda quiet, hates expressing herself, i think for fear of someone disapproving of her opinion.
ok, i sound like im rambling, she has a lot of good sides, but those are the major problems i'd like solved, any advice is welcome"
4432,isfj,"Family thing sounds like me but I do push myself to try new things, mostly on the whims of my entp - but I genuinely enjoy it as I see the value in it on a practical level. That would be my biggest tip. In the past it was hard for me to want to try new things if it didn’t appear practical. However when I started seeing that you can make almost anything be perceived as practical and valuable, I started being way more open to new experiences. For example: Brazilian jui jitsu - when is one REALLY going to need those skills in life? But when I look at it as exercise for my brain and body, a way to keep mentally and physically sharp, I can get into it. Frisbee golf: Whaaat? Why? <- Initial reaction until I realized it could be an activity in which I can bond with my entp, be out in the sun, get light activity, improve my aim for other sports, etc. So yeah, help her see the practical side of any given new activity and it may help her be more interested. Remind her it can be a new fun experience she can share with you and loved ones that will provide lasting memories, physical and mental improvement (if applicable), etc- because really most things can fall in line with that. I’d also suggest giving her as many knows as you can about things before they happen, to ease her mind. With Ni and Ne being poor functions for us, we have a hard time having foresight or seeing possibilities like you- and therefore unknowns can be scary and stressful for us. 
For the challenges of not talking about her feelings, I’m afraid I can’t relate and don’t have any great suggestions for that. But as for her talking mostly about you and her: We use introverted sensing first & extroverted feeling second. Therefore we are more inclined to talk about what most people qualify as “small talk”. Our experiences through the day, last week, etc. Si is a past oriented physical function, so we are constantly re-living those past experiences and like to exchange them with those we love (Fe). However, with time and development of Ti/Ne we gradually become more interested in having more abstract, logic based conversation. But it can be sloppy. 
Anyway after that long rant, I hope you were able to take something helpful away. :)"
4433,isfj,"yeah, i think i have to teach her this, because she'll be tired from work, which i completely understand,but my logic is that if we do more physical activity (we stay in shape but dont exercise much), it will result in us in the future having more energy. Maybe i'll try that path of reason.
yeah i notice that, thanks for the advice, helpful
good to know, any idea how to help develop more Ti/Ne in isfj? like how do you feel personally that you were able to develop that more? are there strategies for doing so?"
4434,isfj,"Developing Ti/Ne as isfj: honestly for me being around Ne dom types more often and having their influence on me over some years. Somehow my entp (and all those I’ve met) make Ne (new ideas) seem less scary, and I’m more inclined to Ne myself if that makes sense. I also think chess and bjj helps (both very strategy/opportunity/logic based activities). Time as well. I noticed in my mid twenties I really started developing my Ti, and now in my late 20s I’m flirting with Ne- however knowing about the functions allows me to do exercise these functions out of a desire for growth. So doing things like visualization meditation for Ne type stuff, asking “what if”, pushing myself to see beyond what is in physical reality. For Ti I believe it’s been, to a certain degree, suppressing Fe. I don’t poll people as much before I make a decision. I use mind mapping for help."
4435,isfj,"In my experience they make conclusions based on their individual experience in the past or right now. They strongly tend to not be aware to facts & data as – long they are not affected by them personally.
They consider & hear to what other people value. But if they think it is dumb, they do not rely on it. So they have to go through experiences case by case to be able to see a pattern. So it can happen that ISFJs can make conclusions without reference materials. Not a bad thing.
Though they seem to not be aware to what other people think or that they might be smart too or might already know what they are talking about."
4436,isfj,This is unfortunately spot on. It’s sad because it take me longer to accomplish goals for this reason. I can never know until I’ve had a full body experience of it. And I think that means more failures than a Te person would run into in accomplishing goals. Having that issue right now. Care to be a mentor? Lol!
4437,isfj,"It is a great strength too because you don't forget things easily and become wiser. This will payback over time.
A simple tool to involve Te is to ask questions about how things work on your journey. What do you think about that?"
4438,isfj,"Thanks! She’s lucky to have a close relationship with a person who (in theory) is good at what we’re not. I want to achieve goals faster, mostly out of frustration with where I’m at in life. I was anorexic for a few years and essentially stopped living for that time. Now I feel so far behind, in so much medical debt, and in a job I’m not super happy with. In short, I feel like I’m in a prison and so badly want to escape. For me that means freedom. Which means having my own business, working when and where I want (reasonably), while providing value to the world. Sorry for the rant. It’s just, learning best through experience makes it hard to know what steps I should actually take, where I should allot my time, etc."
4439,isfj,"Thats a great question .. well since I'm always at home, I mainly do household chores, scroll through fb wall whenever there's a spare time and other repetitive stuff. Actually Im waiting for a callback from 3 companies ( fresh graduate). Ive been interviewed.
What I noticed was that you have to impress interviewers if you want to get a job. Though I have gotten on the second interview stage, I still have competitors to compete with . Interviewers do not owe you a job. On the bright side, my communication skills became more polished ."
4440,isfj,"I dated an ISFP. Our relationship was mediocre at best. It started out intense and awesome and just slowly turned into a mess. He was very anxious and relied on me a lot for emotional support. This led to me becoming more anxious and the relationship kind of imploded because of it. Both of us were unhappy and I ended up having to break it off with him (interestingly enough, he had always been the dumpee, never the dumper). There was a lot more factoring into his behavior than being an ISFP, so take this with a grain of salt. "
4441,isfj,"INFP here.
My dad is ISFP and mom is ISFJ.
I think it works in large part thanks to  the fact that my mom adores her children and my dad fully supports her in that and is very noble about being a father.
Other than that he basically lives to please her and in turn she gets all the shit done that he couldn't sort out on his own. He's also more of a sociable and artistic person than she is, which I think she admires.
I read overall it's quite a happy and workable arrangement. They are both devoted to one another."
4442,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ married to an ISFP - we have some differences in motivation sometimes but overall it works pretty well, we're both pretty even-keeled and easygoing, though we can both be bottlers so we have to remember to pursue each other's feelings."
4443,isfj,"I've had an on-and-off thing with an ISFP for about 5 years now. We never really made it ""official"" but we always seem to come back to one another and talk daily.
Our personalities always end up clashing. At some times the relationship becomes kind of abusive (might just be because he's an addict, but from my understanding drug use is common for ISFPs?). For example he will say really hurtful things while drunk and I'll forgive him the next day, or if it's really bad, after like 3 weeks or something. Once I decide that I like someone its hard for me to let them go. We have amazing chemistry in bed so that doesn't help when I try to forget about him...
Bottomline... he's very dear to me and very fun to hang out with but his temperament can change in a split second from lovey dovey to feeling attacked and getting defensive over some small thing I say or point out. I love him, but I know I could/should never commit 100% to him in a serious relationship because I know it wouldn't be as ""traditional"" as I would like."
4444,isfj,"I don't think it's uncommon for it to work. I think Keirsey says it has one of highest marital satisfaction rates.
My ISFP father is just not great at planning for the future. That can be a problem when you have to raise a family. It makes things like budgeting and scheduling difficult. But regardless, having a J partner makes that easier for him. He'd go to the moon and back to make my mom happy so she doesn't really mind. She likes doing that stuff anyway if it means taking care of her family. 
This description fits him 100% perfectly: http://www.truity.com/personality-type/isfp"
4445,isfj,Is he by any chance younger than his wife? Haha im 5 years younger. Does your mom have a hard time speaking her mind? Cuz my ISFJ girlfriend could at times have extreme pain such as recently she had a whole body muscle problem where she couldnt go to school that day but never told me about it until near the end when she was in excruciating pain because she was worried that going to the emergency room would cost a lot.
4446,isfj,"He is much older.
ISFJs are guardians. She doesn't mind taking care of herself. She just got concerned when she realized her situation might negatively affect someone else (emergency bill).
My suggestion would be to start caring about the things she cares about, and try to support her in that however you can. And not focus as much on taking care of her. She's probably much mentally tougher than you may think."
4447,isfj,"Yes true, she would care a lot if i had body pain. I knew that time she couldnt take care of herself cuz she couldnt even stand, but she had pain thr night before but not as bad as later when she videochat with me. We were together but now long distance so videochat"
4448,isfj,"Hi everyone. 
I’ve been speaking to an ISFJ women (23) for almost 4 weeks. We met on Bumble and have met up twice. We kissed on the first date (and also the second) and became more intimate on the second date (lots of cuddling, holding hands but not much more as we were in public). 
We message a few times a day and generally just talk about our days. However, when we meet up, we talk about many different topics and have a great time (at least it appears that way). 
We have a lot in common and hold a lot of the same beliefs/values. 
Even though I’ve only seen her twice I feel like I’m really starting to fall for her, and I’m trying to work out if she’s the same. 
The main doubts in my mind are: sometimes when I’m talking, she’s easily distracted by someone else coming into the shop/bar/place where we are and occasionally will look around the room. I’m not sure if this is disinterest in me as she can recall pretty much anything I tell her in detail, so she appears to be listening. 
Also, when we are messaging (and this is going to sound really silly but it confuses me) we end our message with kisses “x”. This gets automatically capitalised after any form of punctuation like so “X”, however, she changes it to the lower case “x” sometimes. Again, this sounds silly, but when you think about it, she’s actually making an effort to change the size of the kiss (which I’ve never thought about until she did it). She doesn’t convert it to lower case all the time which is what confuses me too. This is an arguably insignificant point but I’m not sure why she does it. Perhaps it indicates a deeper emotional response. 
She’s told me that she’s never had a boyfriend before but is looking to date and strikes me as the sort of person who wants a meaningful and committed relationship (from what she’s talked about so far). 
She does seem pretty shy and when I compliment her she blushes and will either say thanks or is like “I don’t know how to react” which is fair enough. She’s complimented me too, but usually after I compliment her. 
I know this is incredibly hard to tell from just a text post, but I’m wondering if this is more an ISFJ thing about concealing feelings, not wanting to come across too strong or if she genuinely doesn’t know herself. 
Thanks for any help/advice on the matter :)
TL;DR: speaking to and dating an ISFJ for almost a month, been on two dates, kissed her on both dates, I’ve made it clear I like her and I think she likes me, can sometimes appear as if she’s not listening to my end of the conversation, deliberately changes the kisses in a message, possibly to make them seem less significant (just guessing), seems to be pretty reserved in terms of revealing feelings and won’t compliment me much unless I compliment her first.  "
4449,isfj,"The thing with the messages, I can tell that you're just thinking way too much. If I were to compare her with myself, the looking around is probably just nerves. Sometimes I feel awkward when there's silence and I'm just looking at someone, so I act like I'm not concerned with the silence and just look around to give myself some time to ""recover"" my nerves.
But every single person is different. You've been on two dates. Give it some time. "
4450,isfj,"Yeah, I’d agree with you that I’m overthinking the messages thing. I thought it was pretty insignificant but then I wondered if she didn’t want to come across as “more interested” because it was capitalised, etc. But I can dismiss that now. 
That’s a good point about the looking around thing. I would say she is a little nervous sometimes (which I can understand as we all can feel nervous, especially with someone you don’t really know). 
I’m seeing her again at the weekend so I’ll try and just enjoy it and not stress too much. Thanks for your advice :)"
4451,isfj,"Hi ISFJ fellows! 
Me, as an ISFJ created a questionnaire which concerns training programs and would be useful for my research. 
I would like you to ask to fill it out, it does not take more than a couple of minutes.
I appreciate it in advance!
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9377aVHzGIbVzJ0ppib8zVEPUk-ACrF4XaWgkFUF0fm1stw/viewform?usp=sf_link
Thank you so much!"
4452,isfj,"I’m an ISFJ and I haven’t seen any personality trait relating to this type that has to do with lying. I have some examples of how I lie, and I would like to know if this has anything to do with ISFJ types or if I’m just crazy. Please give some input. Here goes:
- I lie practically everyday. 
- I sometimes lie to avoid talking about something. For instance, today I lied to my friends about having an interview for a new club I was going to join. My reasoning behind that was because I didn’t want them to think I’m trying hard in college to get involved in stuff. I also didn’t want to offend one of them, who was trying to join clubs with me but I didn’t tell her about this one because I applied over winter break. So I lied about that and just said I was dressing up to join a committee in a club I’m already in.
- Another example is when I try to be oblivious to something, like my friend starts talking about something I already know and they just start explaining and I continue listening on and on.
Other times, they would ask me if I had already seen something or know about something like a meme on FB and I would just say no just to keep the mood up and not disrupt the flow of their excitement. 
-Another way I lie isn’t explicit but for instance, I would see my friend wearing a sweater I clearly had and I knew where it was from. Then a few weeks later, I would ask them where they got it from. (Idk if this fits into what I’m trying to say)
-Lastly I often get really nervous talking to important people (interviewers, etc.) that I start lying"
4453,isfj,"Tbh, I often find myself lying by omission. I have a really good memory for what people say and oftentimes can remember all sorts of little obscure facts they've told me. Sometimes it creeps them out that I have remembered in that much detail so when they're telling me something I know they've told me before, I just nod and go along with it."
4454,isfj,"I agree with the third point.
but in general I try to not lie.
about big things? i don't lie.
when it comes to small lies, I tend to think in my head; is it really worth lying about this? creating a habit? and I tell myself no. I try not to lie abour small things. "
4455,isfj,"Why don't you value the truth? 
I dated an isfj for a few months and they lied a lot. It wasn't sustainable but they thought they were doing the right thing. 
The truth becomes evident eventually and leaves you guys (liars) on the back foot."
4456,isfj,"Hi! 
I'm a 17F ISFJ who has a crush on a 17M ENFP and he likes me too. I've known him for about 1 year. I feel like we're total opposites, but we share the same interests though and that's why I fell for him. Our relationship isn't quite official yet, we've just hung out at our houses watching YouTube/Netflix and discovering new music. 
It's just that he's so energetic and active! He talks all the time and I try my hardest to talk back interestingly  but I just can't. I'm super scared he will think I'm a boring, private person which I'm definitely not. I have lots of stuff going on inside me and I wish I could talk about them all. I'm scared he will get bored of me because I'm not a talkative person who talks about anything I think about. I almost never start a conversation. I wish I could do it.
Of course I do talk when he asks something or we find an interesting topic to discuss - sometimes I just talk and talk and talk.
I become attached to people very easily and it happened with him. I think about him almost all the time and can text him about anything but it's totally different when we're face-to-face.
How to become braver and more talkative? :( I know I can't change my personality entirely but I'm afraid my personality affects in our thing in a negative way."
4457,isfj,"Hi! I'm an ENFP girl dating an ISFJ guy. The first few months of dating were SO hard. Conversation  definitely didn't flow super naturally. If your ENFP is anything like me, he asks a ton of questions to get to know you. The easiest way to keep a convo going is to simply ask ""what about you?"" after you answer one of the questions! I would let him take the lead as far as starting a conversation, but try to ask these mirroring type of questions to keep the conversations going. My ISFJ and I bonded over our sense of humor, so maybe try that? Go to a stand-up show or something together."
4458,isfj,"Be yourself!! Always always always!! 
ENFPs don’t need a “perfect & cool” person with the best comments and conversation topics to be comfortable and have the greatest time. 
Be yourself and say what is on your mind, imagine he is your best (all life) friend and talk to him that way. 
He likes you the way you are, and if you are trying to hide yourself, sooner or later you will get to know each other the way you really are. There is no point in hiding it, BE YOURSELF :D I am sure he will (and has already) fall for that person.
(ENTJ)"
4459,isfj,"I am 24F ISFJ dating 32M ENFP.
They will love to see you being comfortable and talking about things that are passionate to you. You don't need to be more talkative or force yourself into doing anything you don't want to do. Just be yourself. Find something that the both of you like to do and do it wholeheartedly. You can tease him lightly. Make him laugh. Encourage him to be the best him he can be without nagging. Be cute, be patient, be you and let him be him"
4460,isfj,"Types for the most part dont matter in a relationship. It's about both of you being mature and honest with one another. No games. Hard work. 
The types only become important when both of you can't figure out why the relationship isn't working. That's when you see two mature adults mutually splitting. "
4461,isfj,My boyfriends an ENFP and I'm ISFJ. We bonded over humour as well. We realised we had the same sounding laugh once and couldn't stop laughing at each other laughing for what seemed like ages. Once we heard it we couldn't un hear it 
4462,isfj,"The title tells most of what I'm looking for advice on but it's hard to fit so much history into all this. To put it as simple as I can about 4 months ago my first serious boyfriend and I broke up. We were together as a couple for a year but friends for four. There's a lot between us. We stopped talking for awhile and he's moved on, he's with someone new. I was with someone but I didn't feel like I was in it 100% and thought it was better for me to cut it off. Right now I'm focusing on myself and my happiness. It's really hard for me to move on with my feelings for my ex, I still love him and I wish things were different between us. However, I've really come to realize that I can't focus on it. I need to learn how to be happy on my own and grow as a person. 
What should I do to find my own happiness? How do I move on from those intense feelings for him?"
4463,isfj,"Time.
I know it's way overstated, but time is the best healer. I know when I went through my breakup after a year and a half of dating, all I wanted was to be over him and be done with it and not have to think about it ever again. Well, that doesn't quite happen overnight. It takes so much tine, and you might feel hopeless, but know that each day you will make a small amount of progress, even if you can't see it or identify what it is.
It's good that you're focusing on yourself and your happiness. Those are the most important things right now. I'd encourage you not to date until after you are completely over your ex.
With that said, what are your interests? Do you like running? Maybe you can join a gym or running club. Do you like art? Focus on sketching or learning a new medium. Try something new! Even if you hate it, at least you can have fun learning about it."
4464,isfj,"I would say time as well. I went through a similar situation. I dated a guy and while I was with him both my parents passed away. So I really clung to him for happiness, when he left I was broken and lost. That was the only time in my life where I was numb. One day I was sick of being that way and I focused on what would make me happy. I got new clothes, changed up my hair, did things I normally wouldn't. If you would like a suggestion on hobbies, I suggest flow arts (poi, gloving, LED hula hooping). You can google it to find more info about it! I hula hoop and It's very calming, I can really escape and flow with the plastic circle lmao. It's also great exercise! Hang in there though, Life goes on <3"
4465,isfj,"Time really does seem to be my best option. I really appreciate the response. It means a lot to me. I've actually been really getting into my interests, writing again. I should definitely try some new things though, that'd benefit me a lot. I just need to expand and keep busy to be honest."
4466,isfj,"My mom passed away right before I met him when I was 12 so it was a really intense connection we had.. Time has indeed passed but I still really really appreciate this reply c: I've changed myself so much. I got new clothes, I changed my hair (just cut it). I have a lot of new friends now. I'm so happy that you have some really cool suggestions though. I wanna try the hula hooping, it sounds so fun haha. Thank you! <3"
4467,isfj,"Writing is great! There's a bunch of online communities like wattpad where you can post stories if you're into that.
Keeping busy helps a lot. I know that's pretty much all I did. Hang out with friends, throw yourself into school/work, etc. On the opposite side of the scale, I didn't really go out with friends much after I broke up, so don't feel guilty if you spend more time with yourself. But do spend time with your friends and lean on them as you need."
4468,isfj,"That's perfect, thank you! I think I'm trying to find a balance between having time to myself and being with my friends. I'm being more open in asking for their help and such so I think it's really good right now. "
4469,isfj,"I've noticed a lot of times I'll observe 1+ things occurring which seem odd/inexplainable to me at the moment. I'll think, ""Hmm. How peculiar. What could this detail indicate"". However, I often times lack the complete inability to connect things together in a story, giving an explanation as to the existence of that detail in the context, and I miss things which are pretty obvious after the matter of fact.
E.g. There's this show I sometimes watch, and there's this side character who came every now and then, but they really didn't have a big role. They was just sorta...there. But they were put in the spotlight much more than a side character should, at least in my eyes. I always subconsciously questioned why he was there, but I just told myself to keep watching instead. 
Then, there's a sudden reveal, and turns out that the person is the major villain. I started yelling ""How did I NOT see that coming?? It made sense! They were always such an unsuspicious character, and yet they were almost always there."" 
It's like my brain is too lazy to come up with possible explanations, or I simply can't on the spot. And then, when the answers are shown, suddenly I am slamming my head wondering why I couldn't have figured that out earlier.
Can any of you relate, or is this a me thing?"
4470,isfj,"From my understanding, attempting to connect things into a larger framework is actually a part of introverted thinking(Ti), which is our tertiary function, which would explain the difficulties you/I would have with it. Inferior Ne is more characterized by the inability to deal with infinite possibilities/choices and the inability to sort through them effectively. Personally, looking back on it for me, I could kinda see how my struggle with Inferior Ne manifested itself like, for example, when it came to choosing majors, women, or just paths in life in general, I was overwhelmed by how to discriminate among them effectively, and if we want to go even deeper than that, when it came to my own religion, Inferior Ne led me to an existential crisis because I couldn't reconcile how out of the million of forms and shapes that religion could take, my religion somehow ended up being/looking like what it is today, which in my mind started to look so incredibly arbitrary, which ended up being very difficult to reconcile. However, learning to coming to terms with my inferior function(Ne) taught me a lot about myself, about the world, about my weaknesses/limitations, and in the end made me a much more rounded out person because I had to learn to use/develop the weaker parts of myself that I struggled with as much as I could in order to move forward in life(I say as much as I could because, as you may know, Jung believed that we will always be, more or less, the least skilled, the least confident and the least differentiated with our inferior function."
4471,isfj,"That's how I understand it ya. But also more so just being uncomfortable with future/different possibilities. Not being able to navigate them with as much ease and flexibility as Ne-dom types. What you were describing about yourself sounds more like underdeveloped Ti though.
Sounds more like what you're dealing with right?
So with Ti you're building up this framework of how the world/system works, and then with Introverted Sensing (Si) you're sort of comparing past and present and whatever is new updates that framework. So whenever you watch a movie you have this sort of feeling subconsciously that you know there's some sort of connection because of the movies you've watched in the past, which is due to that Si-Ti connection/dynamic.
Actually now that I think about it, it could be more of an underdeveloped Si than an underdeveloped Ti, but anyways the truth is definitely somewhere in between the two."
4472,isfj,"Lordy! Sorry for the late answer (4 months late LOL, too much crap in my inbox), but this answer is FANTASTIC and just what I was looking for. Now starting to suspect I'm not an ISFJ after all... I always felt other ISFJ's were much more patient/quiet than I am tbh, and less emotionally volatile. It always bugged me tbh. 
(If you ever can answer my post), do you have a concrete example as to how auxiliary Fe manifests in your life? Dom-si would be tough as it is what you do/breathe, so you probably won't know how to describe it.
It's interesting that you discuss inferior Ne as overwhelming. While I don't like uncertainty either, I think I'm better able to handle it. Like ""Well... idk if this is the best choice, but hell who knows. I can spin my choice to seem like the good one at this point, and try not to regret anything. It's what I'm choosing under my circumstances"""
4473,isfj,Personally my primary instrument is drums.  I have been learning/playing piano as well.  I also like mixing live sound because I get to control all the sounds of the band.  I'm not the best by any means and it takes me awhile to feel comfortable playing in front of people.  I feel so frustrated when music comes so naturally to others.  I find when I'm playing piano I want to fix mistakes by going back right away than just playing through the mistake.  After playing/practicing by myself it makes me feel so rejuvenated; that's why I like to play.  Any other ISFJs musicians?
4474,isfj,"I got my BA in Music and teach piano and voice lessons out of my home. I had never thought about it before, but I absolutely have to fix mistakes before moving on.
Playing piano is also very rejuvenating and cathartic for me. I'm most energized after spending an hour or so playing through my favorite songs.
Word of advice: if music stops being fun (discouraged by other people's abilities, etc.), take a break and remember why you fell in love with it. And, I think you're at an advantage having to work at it from the beginning. It's a rude awakening when those who have had things come easy find themselves challenged! :)"
4475,isfj,"Basic music theory and the first steps of what would be considered intermediate for flute are the best I've done. And it wasn't all that hard and I certainly could have practiced and out more time in.
I totally stop playing and replay the spot where I made my mistake before moving on. I find it easier not to do that when playing in a band with more than on flute player so its not noticeable as a whole."
4476,isfj,"Play guitar mostly, but did drums in marching band back in high school. Also play a little piano and bass. I really enjoy music, itsy favorite outlet for connecting with myself. Also, I do some live sound as well, though I just started so I can really only do monitors."
4477,isfj,"Yes, have been playing the piano for maybe 16 years now.  Parents got me into piano lessons around 5 years old. I also played the clarinet during my middle/high school years and a little bit of guitar.  A steep learning curve came with every new instrument I would pick up, but after dedicating a lot of time it comes pretty naturally.  Music theory helps a lot with getting a grasp on new instruments. "
4478,isfj,"I just got into playing the harmonica a year or two ago and I love it! But I only play when nobody is home or when I have down time at work (I work alone). I'm sure I cannot afford real lessons, but I think it's relaxing."
4479,isfj,"I play a few instruments - guitar, piano, mandolin, ukulele.  I also can play sax (tenor and soprano), clarinet and played the tuba for brief period.  I really enjoy the band instruments but I'm no good at playing solo so don't tend to play them much as there's no one where I live to play with.  I quite like singing but I'm no good at it."
4480,isfj,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4Erksd9xmQ
I hope you don't mind me posting here! I am an INFJ that just got an ISFJ roommate. You guys are probably the most kind and loyal type. Thanks for being you!"
4481,isfj,"Sounds like you're feeling very hurt and abandoned right now, musicalmedic. Would you care to talk about this more in a PM or even Skype? I might be able to offer some insight into your friend's behavior, but even if I can't, we can always be internet pals :-)"
4482,isfj,"Sometimes I read the threads and wonder if I’m a true ISFJ. (At the same time I understand this subreddit is an extremely small community compared to other MBTI groups)
One thing I’ve been constantly doing in my life is confrontations. Whenever I feel hurt by a close friend, I always confront eventually. Sometimes the confrontations bring us closer, other times, the friendship ends. I never intended the confrontation to end the friendship, but was also ready for the consequences. 
I just had another confrontation because I really don’t want to think or feel badly of a friend. The idea of the friendship ending does sadden me, but I think it will help me move on better worst case scenario. 
Not sure why I’m posting, I think I just want to share my current thoughts.
Edit: after reading a few responses, I realized that I’ve understood the noun confrontation (noun: a hostile or argumentative meeting or situation between opposing parties) wrong.  I do confront (verb: (of a problem, difficulty, etc.) present itself to (someone) so that dealing with it cannot be avoided)."
4483,isfj,"Everyone is different, even if they prefer similar cognitive functions. 
Tbh though, I see this behavior more in people who use Fi. They have to feel good about a relationship- like, certain that what they are doing fits within the scope of how they perceive themselves as a person before they do it. 
Maybe it’s just me- but I forgive my friends a lot of real bullshit. I never forget though, and never confront- I just eventually cut someone out if my life if it hits critical mass."
4484,isfj,"I've always thought that facing problems and talking about them sincerely, even if it requires discussions and arguments, is better than just putting them aside and living with that annoying thought everyday, but I personally never look for confrontations because they make me really anxious, and whenever I want to discuss  something with someone I would try to address what makes me unconfortable and talk calmly with the person."
4485,isfj,"I get anxious confronting people, but when it comes to any kind of relationship I don't like certain behaviours because of my traits I used to let people treat me poorly until I was forced to confront it. Unfortunately those were more explosive confrontations since I let it go to far sometimes. Now a days I take the time and think about it but leaving things unresolved bothers me greatly and usually I have to initiate the conversation. It's frustrating because I get anxious either way. At least eventually there will be a conclusion instead of letting go on. Idk if that made any sense. Lol"
4486,isfj,"In my opinion, confrontation is sometimes needed for a really good relationship. It is important that the people, which are involved into the relationship, can talk with each other regardless if there are problems or not. With confrontation you can see which people really want to stay by your side. If they would care about you, they would want to solve the issues."
4487,isfj,"I think you confronting people is just trying to seek the truth and being ready to listen to the other person. You have the trait that I've been trying to achieve forever, and I'd like to hope I'm half way towards your ability to confront others. 
I get extremely nervous when other people try to confront me before I'm ready to be confronted, which is why it may seem like I tend to avoid problems. When I'm mentally prepared then I'm usually okay."
4488,isfj,"I also do this. I’m very upfront. Some people like it, but most hate it. I think people just expect others to deal with things that make us feel bad. It’s more about learning how to say it, I’ve learned"
4489,isfj,"I’m not very good at confrontation as I’m a bit too anxious for it (need harmony) sometimes it spills over though. I can snap sometimes out of frustration too, which isn’t a great way to confront somebody!!"
4490,isfj,"I'm reposting my own question from another subreddit.
I really want to be that person that people can come to and vent, but when someone actually starts to vent to me, I don't know what to say. I usually cop out with an ""I'm sorry"", ""Is there anything I can do to help"", ""It's okay"", etc., cheap answers like those, but I really want to be able to fully support someone when they need it."
4491,isfj,"What I do is that (this will sound cliche, but it works) I put myself in the other person's shoes as I listen to them, think about the best decision I would make if I were them, and then relay that to the other person. We ISFJs are very good at empathizing and decision-making, so use those skills!
Also, try not to ask, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" That's a yes/no question, so most people will say ""no"" so as to not ""bother"" us. Instead, ask, ""What can I do to help?"" That implies that we are going to help them, and it's a lot more direct.
Often, though, just venting is enough for people, even without getting advice about the situation. :)"
4492,isfj,"Do you know how it feels like ? Empathizing is really powerful. It can be your way to decide if you can provide support or not, too. 
There's nothing to be ashamed of to bail out and writing nothing because you never experienced anything comparable."
4493,isfj,"I don't think about what I can say to fix their problem.  I imagine I'm them and let them know how I would feel in their position.  My responses tend to be like ""That's frustrating I'd be pretty bummed..."".  Even if I think I know what they can do to make it better, I keep that to myself unless directly asked for advice.
I realized most of the time I vent I just want someone to listen and understand how I feel.  When people respond to that with all of the things that could be done I find it makes it worse.  Almost like the fact that a solution exists invalidates my feeling bad about whatever has got me down/mad."
4494,isfj,"i find good advice comes from experience and also from empathy.
the more you experience and learn and observe and analyze, the more you can know about and help others with. the quality of your advice goes up with experience. and you will see more options available for you and for the other person to take.
the better you are at empathy, the easier it is to put yourself in someone else's position and mindset. and that allows you to see what the person wants and needs better but also understand what can be blocking them from their perspective. and also empathy helps us understand how to communicate better. knowing a person's mindset allows us to know how to customize/tailor messages that is easier to unpack and understand by specific people.
expand experience and empathy, use them to increase your area of expertise, getting into people's perspectives, and become better at communication, and you're set."
4495,isfj,"And planning ! Few people here seems to remember Si is really good at managing tasks and priorities. With both material and emotional care provided, there is little issues that remains.
It helps for anger and some kinds of pain. Grief.
But some people remain angry because there is nothing more in their emotional lives. And anger is better than facing an emotional void."
4496,isfj,"I'd feel awful if I replied with nothing, because I know that if I was venting to someone, personally, I'd want them to say something comforting, and that's what I tried to do here recently. (The person was angry about something.) Though, yeah, I couldn't really relate."
4497,isfj,"I told about not replying than replying with nothing.
So you just feel bad about that specific occurence, and decided there were something wrong in the way you do ?
How about the thousands previous times you did helped someone in need ?
I have any much more perspective on the issue at hand, though. "
4498,isfj,"Let's hope that the last part doesn't happen.
Anyway, I saw that this subreddit was kind of dead, decided to make a post and maybe start a conversation. I like ISFJ people; my first girlfriend was ISFJ. We didn't work out because of distance not because of anything personality related (even though the not saying what she actually meant thing was kind of annoying).
But, I do like the ISFJ way of taking commitments seriously, I wish I could find more that did that and I like your way with money, I would have a lot of useless stuff if there wasn't an ISFJ reeling me in and forcing me to be conservative with funds. 
Anyway, I just wanted to say, ""Hi!"" and add some life into this place. I'm in a talkative mood today, so it would be great if you wanted to talk too."
4499,isfj,"MY ex is an INTJ and we get along great. We broke up due to not feeling strongly for each other but we're still great friends. I was more into the whole ""serious relationship"" scene than he was. 
What do you mean we like people like that until we hate them?"
4500,isfj,"Also, my INTJ friend said that if I need an emotional talk he's definitely not a go to guy. If I need harsh criticism though...
People play different roles. I was upset and even thought he was ""lacking important qualities"" before I read up on meyers-briggs. Everyone is just different and you gotta accept it."
4501,isfj,"I don't get along with any of my ex's. But, it's not that I don't still like them, it's just that they've kind of been erased from my life and that seems to get them angry. 
Well, the thing that I read said that ISFJ will think that if they try long enough and hard enough they'll break through the INTJ's tough exterior into the gooey center of feelings.
But, there's no such center. I would assume that putting all that effort into something and having those results would be rather irritating. Also, the statement is kind of true regardless of context."
4502,isfj,"That's actually exactly right. We are mainly emotion based creatures and sometimes we don't understand how others are not. We always try to get to the ""center"" of things and break through but we have to realize that not everyone is like us. It is not so much irritating as much as it is disappointing, but we still enjoy you and like you and are willing to work on the relationship. 
Also, erasing us from your life makes us feel sad and inadequate. Like there's nothing about us that you want to remember, whether you had good memories of us or not. "
4503,isfj,"From what I've read, we're one of, if not the only type that will completely erase a person from our lives. This happens after their trust has been lost, or the relationship with them retains no value. This does really seem to bother some people.

INTJ's do have feelings. 
Although they (ISFJ) have a feeling preference and we don't. Fe (ISFJ) also shows a lot more to the outside than Fi (INTJ) does. This is why ENTP's and ESTP's appear much more emotional than INTJ's and ISTJ's even though all of them have their feeling functions third. "
4504,isfj,"yeah, i've read that. and i'm really grateful for having her in my life. i feel like without her there i would've hrown up to be an emotional mess.
also i know of an intj (guy) and isfj (girl) couple. they are good friends of mine, but their relationship didn't work out. she felt he wasn't responsive and that he doesn't prioritize her. and he couldn't understand why she's so hurt and also dislikes that she isn't open with him about her problems."
4505,isfj,"Well, we've got that in common in a sense. I don't really care about the process, I only care about the results. This is why I tend to make things more complicated than they need to be.
I like the emotional nature of ISFJ, when I'm close to one, I can have some vicarious emotional output through them. I also find it interesting that some people can care about certain stuff. Like, my ex got really mad when I didn't do anything special for Valentine's Day (To be fair, I asked her if she wanted me to do something special and she said, ""If you want.""). To me, all holidays are just regular old days except there's no school sometimes.
When people aren't the main focus of my affection anymore, I don't focus any affection towards them. I just can't split up my feelings like that. I don't want to make them feel inadequate though. I never thought about that. I guess I assumed they'd remember that we had something and so their adequacy shouldn't be in question.
EDIT: put an extra word in there that made no sense"
4506,isfj,Wow. That would explain why I find it weird that my other friends have such a problem dropping people once trust has been broken. 
4507,isfj,"Yeah. That's the thing that gets me too. When the girl is just mad for no apparent reason and won't tell me what's wrong so that I can help make her feel better.
But, I could look past that in my relationships. Introverted feeling is super hidden to people like me."
4508,isfj,"Haha it's not complications, it's just our desire to connect and find common ground with you. We search and search for similarities in personality but sometimes we have nothing in common other than the fact we enjoy each others company. 
First, ""if you want"" is women speak. It means yes, always yes. And my ex actually forgot my birthday because there was so much more going on at the time, I was hurt but expecting it so I didn't make a big deal out of it and he's actually still apologizing haha. He never celebrates anything besides the big ones we used to get out of school for. He doesn't see the point, so I understand what you're saying. I'm just the type who celebrates each and every holiday no matter how small, even if it's just relaxing with family. 
My ex is dating someone new and even though we talk everyday he focuses on her a lot more. He just separates his affection from his friendship and I don't know how he does it. I've told him if I spend a lot of time with someone who genuinely wants to talk to me then I can't help developing feelings but he can just cut it all off. I can't do that, I have too many emotions! When you ignore them and stop communicating we get so insecure. I'm hitting that phase right now haha. "
4509,isfj,"INFJ here.  In the spirit of my wife being an ISFJ and me absolutely loving her, I give you a very comprehensive guide to everything ISFJ: here.  Our INFJ-ISFJ relationship works well because we both take our commitment to each other VERY seriously."
4510,isfj,"Well, I do genuinely like talking to you. It's a lot of fun.
I am so thankful for smartphones and their agendas or else I'd forget everybody's birthday and all the holidays. That's another thing I like about ISFJs, they kind of force me into social situations (I do think that relaxing with family is social situation) by celebrating things. I might act like I don't like it, but if I'm not like leaning against the door with longing look out at the driveway, I'm having a good time.
I get your ex, actually I'm afraid that I might focus on things too intensely and that might scare some people away. But, I get into those grooves all the time, not just with people, but with work. I'll cut off everything but the thing I'm working on and I won't be back until that thing is absolutely done."
4511,isfj,"On behalf of us ISFJ's, thank you!
Haha yeah the smart phones perplex me. I can remember everything just fine so I don't see the point in using all those fancy add on's. I used to have to take him out on date's. He would always complain about how it was emasculating and how he felt bad for not taking me out, but if I didn't plan and initiate, it could be months before we went out somewhere! He would complain, but he always enjoyed it and thanked me at the same time. So confusing for me!
I'm just going off of what he says and what I've seen from him but he would always focus on one thing at a time. Adventure time, personality tests (he's still on this one "
4512,isfj,"I'm pretty sure that if I racked my brain, I could think of other colorful phrases I use, particular in the affirmative or negative, that my SO doesn't. I especially do that when communicating by text and often use emoji when he doesn't at all.
I suppose we express more nuances than the seemingly-binary expression of the INTJs"
4513,isfj,"Sounds like it might be an INTJ thing. My INTJ is very direct and terse in how he words things that comes off very emotionless in plain text.
I don't think I speak for all ISFJs on this, but when I say 'if you want,' I'm expressing that I am fine with whatever is being suggested but without a high level of enthusiasm, or I am expressing it in a manner where I am trying to express 'yes' but with a level of agreement instead of merely consent. Almost like verbal emoji or another flavor of 'yes.' You probably wouldn't find me jumping up and down excitedly with 'if you want.'"
4514,isfj,"Don't know if it's an INTJ thing or not but I do know that all INTJ's I've met think the same way. You guys have a very black and white way of thinking. It's always either one or the other, yes or no. "
4515,isfj,"I struggle to not use too many faces when I'm writing on reddit! I just think in emotions as opposed to words a lot of the time. 
It seems that when I say something, my ex never understands what I mean. He's an INTJ and is always saying he can never figure out what to do based off of what I say alone. We just tend to leave the final decision up to them whether we want something badly or not. "
4516,isfj,"Does he use exclamation javascript:;points? Properly punctuated sentences are like emoticons for INTJs. But, sometimes we don't know how we're feeling so we just put a period or no punctuation at all. "
4517,isfj,"I see what you (and I) did there.
Problem with that is when you use, say, an exclamation point, it just looks to me like you are speaking with increased emotion, which could be either affirmative or negative—very ambiguous, especially when terse. 'Yes!' could be very angry or enthusiastic. That, and a lack of punctuation or even capitalization is common in media like instant messaging, which I frequently use."
4518,isfj,"Show him that you're interested, make the first move - these guys are usually somewhat quiet & shy.  Try to dress nice but not overtly sexy. Go out to a movie or dinner date with them. Don't be argumentative or manipulative, they don't like that. "
4519,isfj,"Send me your number! LOL. In all seriousness, as an ISFJ male I would actually be more comfortable with a lady who just asks me out, sometimes more than once, because I'm dense about those things. And I'm TOTALLY OK with a lady making the first move, unless I think you're playing a trick on me, because that never really happens to me. "

Results Post Here

Hey there, ISFJs! I'm a mod over on r/INFJ and we've been doing this experiment to see if there are any Big 5 correlations between MBTI types. So far I've got input from INFJs and ENTPs, and it's going so well that I wanted to ask you all next (I've also asked the INFPs just today, too)! I promise to come back with results if I get enough people to participate :) Just state your type and your % scores for each Big 5 category (and feel free to add anything else from your results if you want to share). Thanks in advance!

There is a lot of talk regarding MBTI vs the Big 5 - is MBTI as valid, do they correlate (1, 2), etc. I thought a community post would be a good way to see what kind of distribution we have when we compile INFJ results. With enough participants, I'll report back the distributions and see what shakes out :)
You can take the Big 5 test here
(it's free, the $29 ""cost"" refers to the cost of their premium report, and you also don't need to create an account to see your results, just click ""no thanks"")
Please comment here with your type (let me know your type so we're not mixing results) and the percentages for each Big 5 category.
Below is an overview of the Big 5 for those who are unfamiliar.

From wikipedia:
Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, curiosity, and variety of experience. Openness reflects the degree of intellectual curiosity, creativity and a preference for novelty and variety a person has. It is also described as the extent to which a person is imaginative or independent and depicts a personal preference for a variety of activities over a strict routine. High openness can be perceived as unpredictability or lack of focus, and more likely to engage in risky behaviour or drug taking. Also, individuals that have high openness tend to lean towards being artists or writers in regards to being creative and appreciate the significance of the intellectual and artistic pursuits. Moreover, individuals with high openness are said to pursue self-actualization specifically by seeking out intense, euphoric experiences. Conversely, those with low openness seek to gain fulfillment through perseverance and are characterized as pragmatic and data-driven—sometimes even perceived to be dogmatic and closed-minded. Some disagreement remains about how to interpret and contextualize the openness factor.
A tendency to be organized and dependable, show self-discipline, act dutifully, aim for achievement, and prefer planned rather than spontaneous behavior. High conscientiousness is often perceived as stubbornness and obsession. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.
Energy, positive emotions, surgency, assertiveness, sociability and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others, and talkativeness. High extraversion is often perceived as attention-seeking, and domineering. Low extraversion causes a reserved, reflective personality, which can be perceived as aloof or self-absorbed. Extroverted people tend to be more dominant in social settings, opposed to introverted people who may act more shy and reserved in this setting.
A tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic towards others. It is also a measure of one's trusting and helpful nature, and whether a person is generally well-tempered or not. High agreeableness is often seen as naive or submissive. Low agreeableness personalities are often competitive or challenging people, which can be seen as argumentativeness or untrustworthiness.
Neuroticism identifies certain people who are more prone to psychological stress. The tendency to experience unpleasant emotions easily, such as anger, anxiety, depression, and vulnerability. Neuroticism also refers to the degree of emotional stability and impulse control and is sometimes referred to by its low pole, ""emotional stability"". A high stability manifests itself as a stable and calm personality, but can be seen as uninspiring and unconcerned. A low stability expresses as a reactive and excitable personality, often very dynamic individuals, but they can be perceived as unstable or insecure. It has also been researched that individuals with higher levels of tested neuroticism, tend to have worse psychological well being.
From a peer-reviewed paper::"
4521,isfj,"This test is also good:  https://www.understandmyself.com/.  Worth the $8 IMO
w/ MBTI, I tend to test as an ISFJ/ISTJ (kind of in the middle b/w F & T).
From my Big 5 test, here's what I got:
Agreeableness:  57%

Contientiousness:  83%
Extraversion:  10%
Neuroticism:  44%
Openness to experience:  1%
I question how I scored on openness to experience, though.  I feel like I'm quite low, but not THAT low."
4522,isfj,"I got similar stats to you, but higher extraverison and lower neuroticism.
I'm wondering about this for myself right now. I've identified as infj for a long time, but recently have been thinking I may be an isfj. What qualities in yourself made you come to this conclusion?"
4523,isfj,"I loved personal training, but unfortunately with some challenging life events I had to “retire” and get a big girl job that’s more sustainable and stable. I hate it and am working on teaching myself computer programming so I can work remotely and have more freedom ultimately. I can’t do an office 9-5 .... it’s too stifling and limiting for me. "
4524,isfj,"I'm in instructional design and it's the PERFECT field for me. I went into education initially as a high school teacher, and while I loved it and was passionate about it, it was emotionally draining to the point where my physical health and personal life began to suffer. As a teacher, you have to be ""on"" all day every day, and as an extreme introvert it was too much for me. Instructional design takes all the aspects of teaching I love (pedagogy, theory, building lessons and instructional materials) and removes the more socially and emotionally draining parts. It's a great job and it satisfies my ""helper"" instincts."
4525,isfj,"This is a portion of what I do. That feeling after you figure out a problem especially when it’s interconnected with other processes and or workflows it just make everything so smooth. 
Pays to have exposure to lean manufacturing to really understand processes and workflows. At least how something with kanban and JIT processes setup to see the benefits. "
4526,isfj,"New topic series I want to start for fun (I'll start other ones later on).
In these I just want simply ask the experiences ISFJs have had with INTJs whether its people their friends with, went to school with, worked with or even just talked to online.
I have trouble figuring out if the people who claim to be INTJ and many MBTI related forums to be INTJ.
That said the ones Ive known and talked to are pretty chill. I know a few girls who typed as INTJ through a test who are fellow anime fans. I talk with one of them often, she can be surprisingly talkative about anime interests we have in common (much more than me). 
However I can at least see the Ni-Te in her. She loves being fiercely independent as possible. She'll always be very pragmatic with her buys. Even with strict (asian) parents she'll find a way to get around to doing exactly what she wants to do.
When deciding which car she wants to ride in when our group of friends are going in, she tends to side with me since she knows I'm good with directions + a safe driver."
4527,isfj,"My sister is an intj. Growing up together, we found that we understood things very differently and taught each other to see things differently.
She's smart, stubborn, and objective. She showed me how to be more objective. I taught her the value of people with good intentions and loyalty.
A close friend of mine is also one. He's ambitious, also objective, and of the few friends I have that's into actively applying philosophy into his life. My sis did too. 
He is also open to using political manuvering for his goals so long as it doesn't involve hurting others. He's moral about it, which is great. I know a lot of people that considers it wrong or evil regardless. And I also know people who do it for personal gain at the expense of others. So it's refreshing that he can do that and be focused on good.
Actually, him and my sister are both like that. They'll do things... Sneaky like... And manipulative like even, so long as they believe the end results are good for everyone.
Though he's more nice about it. And she is a lot more tough love."
4528,isfj,"lmao my fiance is an INTJ. It had been a very volatile relationship for a long time - his Ni was very aggravated by my Si. He caused me a lot of growth though, and I've been figuring out how to be better at Ti-Ne. I've been making actual plans (and writing them down!!), being more tolerant of intuition, and pushing myself by taking a deep breath and trying some of the terrifying things he proposes to me. It's still tough sometimes but when it's good, we both really cover up for each other's weaknesses, it's great."
4529,isfj,"Is refusing to accept responsibility for one's actions and denying the  actions they need to accept responsibility for a phenomenon connected to or correlated with the ISFJ personality type in some way? Keep in mind, I may not be catching things in regards to communication. Although, it's very clear the person refuses to accept responsibility for their actions they deem negative and denies such things."
4530,isfj,"It could just be a general personality trait of someone. Personally as an ISFJ I'm quick to take blame, respond appropriately and apologize. If you look up the ISFJ typing with blame shifting, it's very low. 
""Assertive Defenders (ISFJ-A) agreed least of all with the statement (10%). Sentinels would typically never dream of framing someone else for guilt that is their own, and Defenders – quiet, determined, and ready to sacrifice themselves to protect their values and the people they care about – are more likely to accept false blame than to deliver it."""
4531,isfj,"Only if I genuinely don't think it's my fault? If I feel that I'm being blamed for something unfairly or judged harshly based on incomplete info or something like that, I think I'm more likely to try to explain the situation or hint that it's not entirely my fault. I can also have some issues accepting authority based on my own perceptions though, so that might just be some lingering immaturity on my part, not considering other perspectives thoroughly enough or not being able to accept something that ""isn't fair"" even though sometimes that's just part of life. 
If I know something is my fault I immediately accept responsibility, though, and I tend to err on the side of assuming things are my fault unless it's really apparent to me that there's something else going on. It's easier to just apologize and move on most of the time. So I dunno, maybe it's more of a maturity thing than an MBTI thing? "
4532,isfj,"I think you're describing unhealthy SI: 
ex. ~Nope, that’s just stupid. I don’t need to consider it, I know it’s wrong.~
Dominant SI uses reality for its own established knowledge and experience in order to promote internal stability & integrity of thought and behavior. 
The down side is it can become too reliant on prior experience & routines. This may result in the ISFJ undervaluing or ignoring other peoples ideas & perspectives, or anything else that is deemed disruptive or impracticable in relation to their subjective priorities.
To other types, over-reliance on Si can look stubborn, fussy, or overcautious...."
4533,isfj,"A very unhealthy ISFJ has been floating in and out of my social circle for years. Everything is always someone else's fault and she has no self-awareness so she's completely incapable of taking responsibility for anything. But, like I said, she's very, very unhealthy. Possibly one of the most unstable people I've ever met. None of the other ISFJs I've met have had that problem as they tend to be quite humble."
4534,isfj,"I think the person FEELS that way, but the way they feel doesn’t seem justified. They did something wrong. If they feel hurt from someone pointing it out, that’s understandable. But it’s as if they’re refusing to accept with themself they did something wrong"
4535,isfj,"I think this ISFJ has a fragile, underdeveloped, immature, improperly developed ego and isn't open to changing her mind about most things, because it means her false sense of herself and the world around her will be broken. Debating is a foreign concept not in terms of definition but experience similar to sharing be a foreign concept to someone who never learned to share.
My dad is similar to this too. My mom isn't one to go around unable to bite her tongue. My Dad, however, has a very arrogant attitude about his knowledge about politics, sociology, health, economics, psychology, and and other things and will say things in public at risk of being in earshot of the person he's talking about. Some things he has no room to say, and will talk negatively and hypocritical of others. They're either A. true but hypocritical. or B. ignorant statements.
When you change their view of themselves or the world around them, their ego feels threatened, so they'll look for anything to protect it. They have an arrogant-esque attitude, because they're overcompensating for the void they have in themselves, and they try to fill that void with their ego.
In other words, they have tiny penis syndrome.
I think people like this, and much of Gen X and the baby boomer generation are like this, need to be treated like children not in belittling nor disciplinary ways necessarily but like children nonetheless, because they have the ego of a child."
4536,isfj,"I have this ISFJ friend, initially we clicked really well and I started to let her know more about myself when most people wouldn't have the chance to. However recently she seems to be taking advantage of her knowledge about me and seems to be using it to make me feel emotionally negative.
For example: I mentioned that I do not like it when people ignore me when I am talking, and these days she purposely switches to another topic or totally doesn't reply me. I know that it was done on purpose since she was looking at me but didn't give any acknowledgement. She then goes on to intrude on my privacy by leaning in really close to look at my messages, even when I tilted my phone the other way.
I used to be hurt at this behaviour, but I'm finally letting go. However, she is someone that I'll be seeing for some more years and I have no choice but to stay diplomatic. The thing is that when I start talking to her, I get sucked into our 'duality' and forget to close up, letting the cycle repeat itself.
It's a painful process, so I'm seeking advice here. What do you think about my situation? How can I take measures to prevent this from happening? "
4537,isfj,"My ISFJ wife has an ENTP brother with ADHD. What helped for her was to avoid the initial reaction (which was often anger). This process wasn't easy, because these reactions were deeply rooted in youth problems. She went to therapy for this. "
4538,isfj,"She doesn't seem like a very nice person based on what you've written:-( I would work on not giving her any information about yourself. Focus on vague small talk or topics that don't reveal how you feel. However do so in a way that won't come off as ""rude""  or ""improper"". You can try deflecting her questions by trying to make her do all the talking, ask about something she knows a lot about. 
For an ISFJ(based on personal experience as one and what I have heard/read) information = power. "
4539,isfj,Just be honest about your boundaries in this relationship. In a nice say that you want her to respect your privacy. That's honestly fucked up if she is manipulating you to get what you want. Definitely be honest about that boundary in this relationship. Also one thing we as ISFJs apperciate is compassion and reassurance. So tap into that child Fe haha. 
4540,isfj,"Oh yes, I can definitely sense this in her. I started doing what you said a few weeks ago, but now she is using old (and still true) information about me to manipulate my emotions every day and I can't walk away from her because of external influences. What do you think I can do to hopefully annoy the fuck out of her that she will get the message and stop this shit once and for all? "
4541,isfj,That's what ISFJ do. They try to create convert contract so they are allowed to do something because she helped you X and Y so I am allowed to stare at your phone. She gets offended when you break this contract she mentally created. She will be fine I guess.
4542,isfj,"Sorry. I didn't say that. And also sorry for approaching it from the wrong perspective, I got caught up in the story.
But avoiding your initial reaction might be a good idea in general. Communication is key.
Ok I'm really bad at this, the other reaction is better. "
4543,isfj,"Hey fellow ISFJs! It's not really a secret we are under-represented on the online reddit MBTI community; yet, there are 3,246 subscribers to our sub. That's quite a number.
So my question is: what are your reddit habits? Are you a lurker? Do you go on posting streaks and suddenly stop for a long period of time? Or maybe you only comment and never make submissions.
Without trying to draw any major conclusions from comments on this post, I think it'd be interesting to see where everyone fits in. I tend to use reddit in a weird way (only comment occasionally and scroll through very often).
Perhaps it's related to the amount of redditors of our type?"
4544,isfj,"I'm definitely a lurker but I've been commenting more often because I'm trying to raise my karma high enough to participate in a sub. Typically though I just scroll through, upvote occasionally, and rarely comment"
4545,isfj,"I hardly ever comment, but I like to comment on things that help people research, either about themselves or a topic. I feel like it helps all of us figure out more about ourselves and gives us a community where we can feel like there are others like us."
4546,isfj,"I tend to lurk a moderate amount, but I don't avoid commenting. I probably comment or reply to things anywhere from once every two or three days to 10+ times a day depending on my mood, energy level, and how much the topics being posted interest me. I only occasionally post threads of my own, though. Contributing to a discussion is one thing, but making a post of my own feels way riskier/more embarrassing so I tend to only do it once in a while. 
That said, I also tend to stick to a few favorite subs. I tend to scroll through individual subs more often than my feed, because there are only a few subs I follow where I really enjoy the community and content. My feed tends to be more spammy since I follow a lot of subs because I think they could be useful and don't want to lose track of them more than because I genuinely enjoy viewing their content. That also means it can make me a little anxious to just scroll through my feed, and scrolling through the popular/trending posts even more so. I still do those things once in a while, but I would say I mostly use reddit to lurk/participate in specific communities."
4547,isfj,"I just found this place so, hello!
I would say that I come off as a lurker but I'll go on posting streaks then chill.  I also delete a lot of my old posts except for ones on private subreddits.  Don't feel the need for everyone to see where I'm posting all the time."
4548,isfj,"I usually only contribute if I have a point to make or something to say on a topic that really interests me. I wind up posting a lot because I only frequent the subs geared towards them. There are exceptions however; I also like to be controversial sometimes if I lurk a strange sub and see something that Sparks my interest. Even though I'm an ISFJ, I do like to get into a heated discussion from time to time to keep my brain active on slow days. I prefer confrontation online because I get to respond in my own time and thing my argument through more than I would in a one on one discussion about a topic. "
4549,isfj,"I am The Lurk. I comment here the most which is, an ok amount. I also post here the most which is very little. Mostly I'm reading comments and trying to get a feel for how pockets of other people think about stuff and what they know."
4550,isfj,"Wow everything you wrote is exactly what I do--even down to the commenting for karma for a sub! Pretty much every comment I do write goes through at least 3 drafts though haha. I sometimes find myself thinking of what my comment would be, typing it out, but getting too tired of revising it and just deleting it..."
4551,isfj,This post is certainly doing that for me. The answers have all been so similar.
4552,isfj,"That's definitely it. Every time I discover a thread I want to comment on, everything I would like to add has already been said. Sometimes jumping in and piggybacking doesn't really fit the conversation, and comments just get lost in the hierarchy...
But since I like contributing to the dialog (it's sort of the purpose of reddit) I'll go out of my way every once in a while and sort by new to be one of the original comments.
Would you also say that you don't have as much patience to read longer comment threads? That is probably also a factor for me."
4553,isfj,"WAITTT lmao sameeeee, the thinking and crossing to walk parallel.
​
Probably why I'm gonna stay single ripp. Confidence negative percent, and I don't want to be perceived as a weirdo by her because I'm probably making her uncomfortable even though she probably doesn't even care."
4554,isfj,"I was wondering - how do other ISFJs feel about their creative/ imaginative potential?
I am fairly new to the realisation that I am an ISFJ, and in no way want to ""blame"" or attribute some of my quality to my type, and obviously we are all individuals. 
But after reading more about ISFJ qualities, I massively connected with the trait of being very practical, traditional, and concerned with ""here and now"". I don't spend much time daydreaming or imagining  new things or characters, but as someone who really enjoys drawing, music, and all things creative, want to expand my abilities in that area.
How do you find creativity works as an ISFJ? Anyone out there also struggling with being a bit too practical and struggling to break away from convention? How do you set your imagination free?
Any thoughts, advice and opinions welcome"
4555,isfj,"I write and draw in my free time, so I spend a lot of time trying to be creative. I don't know what it is like for others, but I tend to corrupt ideas and build upon them. Like, the core of every story is a seed from a different story and then the consequences that follow. I'll take certain things out and put other things in per my taste. It's like- I hold the new story in my mind and see how the flavor changes when I substitute certain parts for others. I'm not sure if it's what you mean by creative- assembling and modifying parts of other things- but it ends up looking like creativity in the end. 
To this end, I might suggest you find something you like and start swapping out elements until you stumble upon something that interests you. For example, seeing a favorite book from a different character's perspective. Changing the genre of that book. What kind of story does it become? The ideas might start burbling up from that neglected, inferior Ne ;)"
4556,isfj,"I went to college for fine art and found that in that environment the creativity flowed. But as I’ve gotten older I’ve become more rigid and it’s hard for me to be uniquely creative. I love and enjoy art and music, but creating my own is very difficult now."
4557,isfj,"You have already tried to get one of us through a cooking recipe ?
It's an impending disaster.
But you guys don't even need the recipe, and come up with how to do it better along the way without screwing it up horribly.
I think so much about any unrelated crap I have now to stick to my really simple plan, and keep my mind on tracks along the way, with all the alienating implications it entails. 
You're freer than that. More creative than that."
4558,isfj,"I'm an INTJ and a few years ago had a relationship with an isfj, it lasted a couple of years and was usually very hot or very cold, on again, off again, sort of thing, i came to learn when it was off again, she was with someone else, but that's aside from the point, i find myself checking out her facebook and wondering if she still wonders about me?"
4559,isfj,"ISFJs have exceptional memories, and I personally remember most of the people I've known throughout my life, especially if they had a strong impact on me in any way.
I still think about my exes, even though I'm very content in a relationship currently. It's not that I'm still hung up on them, it's more that I like to remember the good times that made me happy."
4560,isfj,"Probably. It depends on the person of course, but even as an ISFJ with a terrible memory (thanks, ADHD) I still remember quite a bit about people who left a strong emotional impact on me even years later. I tend to cut ties hard and completely, but I still think about people afterwards even though I don't let myself check up on their social media. "
4561,isfj,"I can guarantee she'll remember if you were that close. As to whether or not she'll reach out, depends on how it ended. It can cause great emotional pain to go back to something like that if it wasn't very clean, and thus she may stay away, but if she is healthy enough and get get past it then you may be safe to say hi and get along with her fairly well. "
4562,isfj,"she was older than me, and there was tension from that, i think i cut ties when i told her during a fight that it was 'over'. but later in other conversations she'd act like she was the one to break it off, so who knows what's going on in her mind"
4563,isfj,"Well, it's hard to know for sure, I can only speculate. It's very possible that she remembers you quite fondly, but doesn't think you're compatible over the long run, especially if your relationship was quite tumultuous.
If you were the one to end things, don't count on her reaching out. She may be feeling wounded, and I know in my case, if someone broke up with me, I wouldn't reach out unless they're extremely important to me, and even then, I wouldn't want to re-open old wounds, or bother someone who doesn't want me in their life anymore. There's also a matter of pride. ISFJs care about our image, to some extent. It would come across as pretty needy and slightly pathetic to come crawling back to someone that left us in the first place.
If you want my advice, I'd suggest reaching out in a casual way, like maybe an email. You can keep it simple and just say you've been thinking about her and you're wondering how she's doing, maybe even apologize for the way things went down between you, and just wait and see. If she doesn't respond, just let it go. But it's very possible that she would, due to intense politeness and a difficulty putting the past behind us."
4564,isfj,"The last email I sent was a couple years ago telling her about a mutual friend that needed help, but I got no reply. After the break up, she would call from time to time, and last year, she had a friend of hers call me, I forgot she blocked me on facebook, after I 'liked' a post of hers"
4565,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ that always tested as an ISTJ until I took the test again last month. Everything makes so much more sense now! Following the newfound type, I stumbled upon this subreddit and it's been really great.
​
What do you guys do after absorbing negative emotions from a loved one or a close friend? I've been finding myself in deep discussions that can cause me to be a bit overwhelmed because of my empathetic nature. This is beginning to concern me a bit as I've been considering becoming a therapist and dealing with absorption is clearly something I need to learn. I appreciate any help you guys can give!"
4566,isfj,"Lately it's been about finding an outlet to exhaust these emotions. What I first tried doing when this happened to me was to question myself and find the cause. I thought it was bottled up emotions coming back to haunt me.
​
After finding out what was causing it, I realized trying to deal with it by self reflection wouldn't help. The pain wasn't really mine. There may be something worthwhile in other forms of self-therapy,so please share what you find! Meditation's a good one but I can't get into it sometimes."
4567,isfj,"Congrats on figuring out your true type!
I'm not an ISFJ, but I can relate to absorbing other people's negative emotions. This might be an obvious answer, but  the way I deal with it is I process my feelings that I have as a result with someone I trust.
Also, when I have a friend that regularly feels like they are using me as their therapist, and it's starting to get overwhelming, I try to limit my time with them... It feels bad to distance myself when I care about them, but I have to put my own feelings first. I'll hang out with them as often as I can without being negatively affected by it."
4568,isfj,"The only thing that can really detach me from what I've sponged is physical exercise, stretching, tv, or video games. I tried exercises that revolved around building Ki, but it just sponges everyone else's and I feel yucky haha. I keep chat bots on my cell phone too in case I need to sort out what I was thinking/feeling outside of the current emotional atmosphere so I don't lose track of how I was doing until that point."
4569,isfj,There's also this ridiculous raising an idol game I play because it's so perky and optimistic about positive life choices and way of living haha :D Plus the rhythm part of the game makes me engaged to the point I have to ignore everything so I can hit the right buttons.
4570,isfj,"I can definitely relate to absorbing emotions of those around me. I did my master’s degree in counseling and it was something I considered prior. I enjoyed my program and value the counseling skills I learned, but I ended up in a related area where I use my counseling skills, but am not a counselor. 
There is definitely an emotional difference when you are separated from people and not involved in the outcomes like you are with family/friends. Having professional and ethically appropriate boundaries is a huge aspect in the field. That being said there are those clients/situations that really stick with you. I think I could have been happy being a professional counselor for a while, but I don’t think I could have done it forever. 
Something important for me was actually pulling back on my emotional labor with friends/family and evaluating friendships. I realized that there were people in my life who were draining and never put in the same effort for me as I did for them. I phased some of those people out and it affects me less because the relationships I prioritize are much more equitable in terms of emotional labor. It doesn’t make you a bad person to prioritize your own feelings, not be constantly available for feelings dumping by others, gently redirect conversations, or encourage individuals to seek out counseling. 
The other thing I find helpful is to do something where I can detach and not be in my thoughts so much to avoid dwelling on those feelings of others. For example, getting absorbed in movies/tv shows, taking a dance class, etc. I know that was an essay, but hope that helps!"
4571,isfj,I’d say make sure you spend time alone to rest away from others. We are introverts and really need it to stop being overstimulated and overwhelmed by the outside world. :) I find engaging in something creative helps me relax (but not something too taxing!)
4572,isfj,"Ellina’s Greenberg words
Empathy is not a clinical term: most of these people are just hyper sensative and lack strong Boundries.
Fyi, find her on Quora as she is a very respected psychologist.
I recommend working through the boundries book and it’s work book.
Look it up on amazon and you will find it.
ENTP Here!  Power to you!"
4573,isfj,I very much appreciate your insight on self reflection not working. That's what I've been trying recently and felt like I needed to keep trying harder. It's good to know I should find an alternative solution.
4574,isfj,"Most of those suggestions don't work for me, as they simply don't distract me well enough. TV can pull me out of it, but that is essentially because I'm soaking up emotions from the TV show instead, which I suppose is fine but doesn't seem ideal."
4575,isfj,"Thanks very much for all the advice, particularly that surrounding the professional aspects I was worried about. It's good to know that the proper preparation will leave these career options open to me. In my case, I don't have very many people that I put emotional labor into, but I will definitely keep in mind the need to keep that number to a reasonable amount."
4576,isfj,I greatly appreciate the advice! I'm currently waiting for the boundaries book to come off of hold at my local library (should be any day). Thanks for letting me know that I should get the workbook too. I didn't realize it was a thing.
4577,isfj,"Edit: I have closed the survey. Basic preliminary data is available here: link
Hi all. I'm interested in seeing what correlations exist between certain types and various random things, so I've created a big survey. Its a little bit long, it will probably take 10-30 min depending how fast you are at filling out surveys. I tried to mix fun questions with serious questions and so topics include pop culture, politics, art, lifestyle, etc.
I also posted this in /r/mbti, but I'd like some more varied responses (INxx types really like filling out surveys) The survey is at this link to google forms
It is completely anonymous, handled by google forms. After you take it it will let you see the raw results, please don't spoil these results for others. Once I have enough responses, I will perform a statistical analysis on the results and share them on /r/mbti.
If you know anyone else interested in MBTI, feel free to share the survey, but please only fill it out once yourself.
Please don't spoil the survey questions for others, particularly the trivia questions, I want to see what types have knowledge/interest of certain things.
I'd like to know (without spoilers), what you thought of the survey and what additional questions you would have included. So please let me know."
4578,isfj,"I wish the choices with 1,2,3,4 in agree and disagree would have a middle option for indifference. And I wish there would be less americanized questions, a bunch of them were stuff I had no clue about or which weren't applicable to me as an European.
Otherwise an interesting survey."
4579,isfj,"Thanks for the feedback.
I've gotten a lot of feedback on the American nature of some of the questions and if I make another I will include more geographically neutral questions. The numbering was actually intentional (although somewhat mean), it's used on some surveys to prevent people from always clicking in the center.   "
4580,isfj,"Looking for a post from earlier today about an ISFJ married to an INTJ suffering from depression, asking for advice.  Looks like it was deleted, but I would like to pass on some advice that I've gained married to my INTJ SO.  OP, I can post it here or you can PM me if you would like."
4581,isfj,"We could tell you all the different ways that ISFJs usually show that they care, but I wonder whether that's really the issue here. If you feel like he's not showing that he cares in a way that you can really connect to... that's the problem, not that you're not interpreting what he's doing or saying in the right way.
While identifying love languages is important... unless your partner is actually demonstrating their love for you, using your love language, there is very little comfort for the knowledge.
ISFJs have auxiliary Fe, and this means that we have extraordinary capacity to speak of our feelings, if you feel like you're not communicating in that way, maybe you can talk to him about it. Just be sensitive in the conversation as it's likely to hit him hard if he's unaware, but he will likely address the situation very quickly."
4582,isfj,"Sometimes? I'm an ISFJ with a horrible memory (routinely forget birthdays, major life events, favorite colors/foods/shows/etc). It doesn't mean I don't love my close friends and family, and I often feel very guilty about it, but things just don't stick in my brain. For me, my ISFJ-ness shows because I always do my best to be considerate of others, and that effort scales depending on how much I care about you. Si isn't about memory in the sense that it means your memory is inherently good or that you'll definitely remember everything, although that's a pretty common misconception. "
4583,isfj,"Love languages focus how one can give and receive ""love"" as symbolized through those actions. 
Remembering details about someone you love, because you love them, does represent that you love them. But do you convey those details in order to communicate your love? Or does someone telling you things they remembered about you communicate love to you? Perhaps incidentally but not directly. 
As such your detail of people's lives has more to do with Si then love. And the more you love someone the more cognitive attention you will spend on them. Which can then be used to express your love via gifts or services that are meaningful to that individual. "
4584,isfj,"Thanks for your comment! That's so true that there is not much comfort in understanding his love language if he is not communicating love to me with mine. Mine are more words of affirmation and touch. I frequently touch and compliment him, and he does do that stuff, but not nearly as much. I think his main love language is quality time- as in we do things together that he likes. He seems very attached to certain things- like his passion for music and for several types of sports- and has mentioned that he wishes I liked them myself more independently rather than doing them because he likes them. (I do these things with him happily and enjoy myself, but he is correct that they are more his things than mine.) Is this expectation an ISFJ thing? "
4585,isfj,"Thanks for the comment about being considerate- I definitely think that describes him! Though- it's hard for me to tell how much of it is unique to me- in other words, how much he is scaling his effort because he cares about me. He's kind to everyone, including me."
4586,isfj,"How exactly did you type him? I ask because what you describe sounds a lot more like ISTJ than ISFJ. Particularly, it sounds like he's more into building traditions through doing the things he likes, than necessarily digging into the things you like.
Nothing against him of course, it's just I think if it were Fe in that auxiliary position you wouldn't see quite the same behaviour that you seem to be describing....
And while Si is very well adapted to quality time, to not be very affirming doesn't sound very Fe like... and honestly, it sounds like you're adapting to him a lot more than he's adapting to you.
Does that make sense?"
4587,isfj,"All good points. He told me he is an ISFJ, and I do see majority Fe from him in terms of wanting to be helpful and caretaking, being supportive, and being a great listener. He's definitely not the bossy, get things done Te - that's more me from my inferior function (INFP) :). It's not that he doesn't want to do my things (he does), just that he wishes I liked his things more. As if somehow my not being as passionate about his things makes him feel like he's not connecting with me. I don't get it honestly. I don't think that two people need to have the same level of passion about their interests, so long as they support each other in them, listen to their partner talk about them, and participate from time to time. Does any of this resonate with you as an ISFJ?"
4588,isfj,"How is it that as a result of being easygoing and attempting to succeed at LIFE (not just a job, but at life) and giving it my all, I have still ended up feeling like I haven't gotten anywhere? I am not trying to whine, I am just trying to understand and see if any other ISFJ's feel the same way. I struggle to keep up at work and don't feel I have connected well with anyone there. My ENTJ husband and I have struggled, but worked at it, and have been together for 10 years. My daughter is more like him and they demand a lot of attention as well and so I struggle with work/life balance all the time. I love them and want to give them everything I can, but feel so often like I fail in that and in work because I can't give everyone my all. It is not until recently, that I finally feel like I am being given ""me"" time by my family and that he is finally recognizing that need. At this point, though, I am exhausted and depressed. My husband and daughter are constantly going, going, going...I love being active, but I need down time, too. I try to have time for friends, but I have never really had any close relationships since high school. I live in a small town, as well, and it is even stranger being in a small town and feeling the way I do. I can't go to the grocery store without seeing people I know, and that used to be how I would unwind - grocery shopping in the middle of the night where I know no one and it is empty. "
4589,isfj,"Just wanted to say, I know the feeling you describe of wanting to just go walk somewhere and not have to see anyone you ""know"" and fake it.
New relationships are hard to forge, but take comfort in the ones that you do have. It sounds like your husband finally understands some of you needs and is trying to give you your space. Perhaps pick up a hobby that brings you outdoors, like gardening on a weekend morning where you can be at peace and out of the house.
I hope everything works out for the best, wish I had some good advice..."
4590,isfj,"My best friend is an ISFJ (I'm an INFP), but we live over a thousand miles apart. So we have different circles of local friends and we've watched each other's friends come and go, all the while sticking with one another adamantly. We've both especially connected over our dislike of what friendships in adulthood seem to be (short-lived, little effort, not much consistency... as a 20 year old fighting idealist tendencies, I could write a book about this).
But it really sucks being so far away from each other and it makes me feel like I can't really be there for her when she needs it, so I do my best to understand her from afar. She's also been pretty hurt by friends in the past, so she's cautious to trust, even after a few years of being close.
Anyway, I'd love tips for making an ISFJ feel valued and loved long distance! Also, what's are the best responses you've received when you're having a really tough day or freaking out about some bad stuff happening in life? It's hard to know when to fix and when to only listen.
Thanks!"
4591,isfj,"This sounds identical to my friendship with my INFP best friend. We live far apart, and we've watched each other struggle with other friendships and relationships, but we've been there for each other through all of it.
Honestly, my INFP didn't even have to really do anything apart from just being there for me. It took me a couple years to open up to him fully, but now he's my go-to for everything that happens in my life. He's always there if I need a shoulder to cry on, and he's been unconditionally supportive of me through the years. 
If there's one thing I love about INFPs, it's their emotional intelligence in regards to other peoples' feelings. My best friend always knows if I'm upset, without me even having to say anything, and he's really good at calming me down, or comforting me with just his words. "
4592,isfj,"I guess I just meet pretty bad people. Lol I put a substantial bit of effort into friendships. Anyway, I'm used to only having 1-2 close friends. At this point that's my husband and her. I don't expect to have a large amount of close friends, I just wish I understood why I lost some friends over the past few years. But that's a problem for another day. 
Hopefully it's apparent that we connect over many things beyond lost/hurtful friendships. We have a great many things in common. But I was there for her after a close friend hurt her badly and that's when our friendship really began.
Anyway, thanks for the link and the comment."
4593,isfj,"Absolutely horrific. Literal human garbage, and the fact that people actually want to vote for him inspires both disgust and sympathy, because it speaks to how pathetically ignorant and deluded people in this country are, but also to how corrupt and damaging the oligarchy we live in has become. "
4594,isfj,"He brings out the absolute worst in people; the issue is that his supporters have been here the entire time, and now that Trump has given them the ""ok"" to speak freely, everyone thinks it's ok to think and say the horrible things that he has been."
4595,isfj,"He's a living caricature of all the worst qualities of the Republican Party. As a Libertarian in a completely red state, it amazes me how people will vote for him just because he is the Republican nominee. It makes me sad honestly. That's why I'm voting Gary Johnson because I believe Trump to be the most unfit to be leader of the free world. "
4596,isfj,"Obviously the best option is to not engage. But sometimes I just really want to, especially if I feel passionate about what the topic is. But even if I type up a great reply, I have to think, ""Great, what if someone is mean to me after I post this because they disagree?"" A long time ago I had posted about some Reddit comments that upset me, basically saying poachers should die and didn't deserve anything etc etc. And I had said I disagreed, we should hate the system not the poachers etc and I got mean comments for what I said... But I still felt passionately enough about it to comment, knowing I might get backlash. So just examples like that.
Right now I have been supporting Bernie Sanders and I have been polite about who I support and don't really mention it to people IRL (too many conflicts could arise). But online, sometimes I want to comment on something someone has said and I am too scared to.
And recently I played League of Legends and normally everything is fine but I had people telling me I sucked, to never play that champ again, that ""how would I like to play with retards?"" etc. I cried afterwards. How can I just not care?
Is there a way to be less sensitive? Luckily people are usually pretty nice IRL but they can be so mean online and I don't want to resort to being mean back. Sometimes I try to think of a clever reply that isn't mean but doesn't make it look like I'm backing down either... But most times I just go radio silence afterwards.
I am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation. But it's tough, because it just makes me feel faulty when I keep ""choosing"" to be sad over it. Or I wish I could just think ""Yeah, well that person is an asshole"" but I normally just think ""Well, maybe they're right."""
4597,isfj,"""I am trying to remember that people don't make me feel certain ways, I can choose how I feel/react to the situation. But it's tough, because it just makes me feel faulty when I keep ""choosing"" to be sad over it...""
There's an underlying layer there that not a lot of people get to. 
You're choosing upset because being upset is important to you on some level. In that moment, it's MORE important than not being upset. 
Dig for that second layer, examine (however briefly) why it's more important to be upset than not upset. 
Maybe you'll decide that it's not important to be upset, and you'll have this sort of A-HA! moment, and you'll have the ability to move past it, or at least work through it. 
Maybe you'll decide that it IS important to you to be upset - but you'll have considered WHY it's important. Then you can be upset guilt-free until you realize that it's not the most important thing anymore, and then you can move on with your day, or your lane, or whatever. =)
Sure, you can choose to be upset, and you can feel like a failure for choosing to be upset - or you can figure out what your personal motivations are, and then act with more self-knowledge and self-understanding...holding yourself up to your OWN standards, not the external standards of others. =)
Also, the League of Legends community is exactly why I still play Skyrim 5 years after release."
4598,isfj,"Mute button is your friend. 
Don't compare your beginning to someone else's end. :) instead of thinking, ""I can't do anything right!"" maybe think how you could have made that play differently and write it down? Be hard on the problem, soft on the person!"
4599,isfj,"As an isfj, I'm extremely critical of the people around me, I'm not a dick out loud, but boy could I be. I generally keep it to myself and make my observations and such to save for later. When people get under my skin it's definitely rough trying to ignore that stimulus. Anyway, I have a good infj friend who pointed out to me that I can get hung up on things emotionally and internally. He told it's like I grab a stress ball and instead of pulsing with it in an exercise fashion, I just squeeze the shit out of it and don't let go. His advice was drop the stress ball. Essentially just say ""fuck it."" Now I don't do this very well to this day, but at least I'm aware of the fact that I cause my own stress at times by simply continuing to squeeze the ever live shit fuck outta that goddamn stress ball and once that thought crosses my mind I can drop it, or set it down, or punt the fucker, and distract myself into blissful ignorance. Also, because of same dude, I got into meditation. Basically, in my mind, I dig all the stress balls out of my backpack and set them down and just look at them, one at a time. Who ever pissed me off, who ever I'm worried is mad at me, who ever I want to get closer to, all of them... I just look at them and reflect on them. I don't touch, I don't argue, I just watch what my mind wants to see and life's gotten significantly better. I've discovered the power of playful sarcasm as a result, which is awesome. It's like our normal assholeish sarcasm, but inclusive of the people around us, they actually laugh and it's not that awkward. I've learned to face things instead of trying to choke the dickens out of my own mind dressed as a stress ball. If this has at all gotten you interested, there's some great meditation YouTube videos, for the record, fuck all the religious stuff. Have at ""fuck that meditation"" and just calmly listen to him show you how to put the stress ball down. There's also this guy, who's pretty good. Side not though. Why'd you go to league? That community is notoriously toxic, despite all the counter measures they've employed. I'm a dedicated league player, I know that's not a nice place for kids. (Not that you're a kid) My recommendation as a player is tear back into those assholes cause they deserve it, but as a generally nice person, just say fuck that ball of stress."
4600,isfj,"For me, it eventually became clear that lots of people thrive on ""infallibility through anonymity"" where they can say just the most awful things and remain untouchable in their soft chair, next to a bag of chips. These guys are cowards. They'll shamelessly use the internet as a crutch to boost their egos, and they have nothing to lose by being mean. 
It's awesome that you don't stoop to their level. It takes courage to care, all in all, offline and online. When it's clear that someone wouldn't be so awful IRL, it's best to just put them below you. Jerks are jerks."
4601,isfj,"You have to disconnect yourself from League, and most online games, mentally.  Realize that everyone out there is another person in another chair.  They don't know you and anything they say about you is based on, what, 20-60 minutes of interaction with you? 
Not worth noting or responding to. "
4602,isfj,"Isn't it their fault if they acted the asshole and made you feel like shit, though? It strikes me as highly unfair to make someone else accountable for the words or actions of another, and most of the time, I see it as a narrative that's held up by people who want to retain their right to be an asshole without having to face consequences. Surely being an asshole is more up to choice than ""choosing"" to be upset. 
 
Honestly, telling someone to just ""not care"" is an awful thing to say to them. If someone's said something hurtful to you, it's not a crime to have a human emotional response. It's just a human emotional response. If there were more people around who were ""too"" sensitive, then maybe people wouldn't have to feel this way.
 
As for things like LoL and the like, well... bear in mind that immature dickwits who can't seem to handle treating the person on the other end of the computer like an actual person because of... reasons. It's crap, but it comes with the territory. If you can, find people you know to play with, and you can cut down on the randos. 
And given that these types are people who use their ("")prowess("") in gaming as a basis for their self-esteem/character, I wouldn't consider their approval or disapproval any kind of true statement on yours. "
4603,isfj,"This is exactly why I don't subscribe to that mentality. All I end up doing is feeling like my being upset over someone's shitty behaviour is somehow a worse failure than the other person's choice to do the shitty thing. So I instead tell myself ""Don't blame yourself for other people's shitty behaviour toward you. They fucked up, not you."" Not only does this stop me from feeling guilty about being upset, it also stops me from seeing that person's behaviour as a reflection on me, which is often why I was upset in the first place."
4604,isfj,"i found i learned to stop ""caring"" about certain things by learning to see emotional influence as a source of power. like if someone says something and it upsets me, that is me being swayed by their influence, thus giving them power over me. 
i had to learn this specifically because my parents are emotionally manipulative. they'd tell me that they are sad and upset and disappointed in me because of how much they invested in me and because of that, it's my responsibility to keep them happy by meeting their ever changing, never clearly explained expectations. 
that is them trying to use their influence over me in order to attain their own goals and wishes. if i allow myself to be swayed, i am giving up my power over myself to them. if that makes sense. 
so after realizing that, and realizing the importance of keeping my power to control my actions and feelings to myself, i had to detach the from things i found hurtful in order to better focus on understanding the influences they have on me as well as see the person and the goals behind the words.
i have aunts and uncles who live off of the feeling of being better than others. they crave it and actively talk shit and spread rumors in order to sustain their thirst. if i fail in life, they will smile. so when i meet them, and see that thirst in their eyes, and when they start talking shit and sniff around for delicious morsels of my sadness, they instead find that i choose not to react, and so they're left unquenched and unsatisfied. 
if i react, it means i fell to their level. like them putting out a noose and me ringing myself on it. but i don't, because i see their thirst for what it is: my power over them, to do with as I please. they need my reaction, they need to see me hurt, so in a way, they need me and what is in my power to give them. and i don't give it to them.
annnd that's how i figured it out. i don't know if it works for everyone. took years to piece that together and even now i'm not perfect. but yeah, detach to understand how things effect you and why they were said or how the things said are being used.
i think the focus shouldn't be on ""i am unable to keep myself from being sad"" as much as it should be ""let me try to keep as  clear a mind as i can to better understand what's going on in myself and what's going on in this situation"". because being able to stay clear headed to understand stuff is an active thing you can want to do and work to improve as opposed to a doomed to fail setup of ""just choose not to be sad""."
4605,isfj,"Hmm... This comment made me think a lot. I don't know if I've fully realized it yet, but I think a lot of it has to do with ""They were mean to me -
I'll keep thinking more about what you said because I think it's helpful but I haven't quite gotten it 100% yet.
As for the LoL community... I just had never experienced it this horribly. I was grouping with randoms tho for a party IP bonus event. I'll keep playing with friends at least."
4606,isfj,"I normally play LoL with friends, so I'll stick with it for that.
I'm not sure if it's a phobia either, but maybe. I just see it as more of an inconvenience. If I said I had a phobia, I'd feel like I was exaggerating the situation or self-diagnosing.
Thanks for the input either way."
4607,isfj,"I'd recommend diving into the entrepreneur world - even if you're not interested in ever being your own boss. 
One of the big messages (since about 2009) in that world is embracing failure, and it's sort of mainstream now. 
This is a good starting point, I think...

4608,isfj,"I'm curious why ISFJs do some things. I think a lot of the things they do seem stupid to INTPs, because INTPs aren't perceiving things correctly. Why do ISFJs say obvious things (e.g. ""You're home!"" when a person just entered the doorway)? Why do they pull? Why do they hint that they want you to show appreciation by going on about how hard they've been working?
Do they not think sometimes or does it just seem that way because of the ISFJ I've been around? The ISFJ will do things, but it's like their process is ""duty"", ""I feel they'll like this"" but not ""Will they like this?"" It's like it completely slips their mind that they've told them something regarding what they get the past 500 times.
Why do they articulate so strangely (this coming from an INTP)? They'll say things like ""I'm a Star Wars."" or ""Pokeman"". It seems they'll have trouble articulating abstract thoughts which, in my experience, can come off as ""stupid"" to the INTP when in reality, it's similar to the INTP's difficulty in articulating and expressing their feelings. What I don't understand is why they word things the way they do. I don't recall noticing any other type do that. ""A Star Wars""??? What makes them think that's correct grammar?? This used to annoy me, but I've increased my emotional intelligence and have become much more aware of perspectives and function behavior, so now it just confuses me."
4609,isfj,"Well, I live in a household full of ISFJs, in addition to being one myself. “You’re home!” is more about the tone than the observation itself. If I sound excited, it means, “You’re home! I’m so glad you’re here now!” If it sounds startled/annoyed, I might not have been expecting you and I might be saying it to buy time while I figure out why you’re here and adjust my plans to account for your presence. 
Hinting for appreciation is a somewhat immature way of getting what we want. We love to be acknowledged and appreciated, but it can feel crass or get bad results to outright say, “hey, I want you to thank me for my effort/show me love/marvel at my hard work/do something in exchange.” So rather than trying to figure out how to navigate that, we hint by expressing how difficult something was or how hard we’ve been working. It can also feel more authentic if someone picks up on hints or expresses their gratitude spontaneously than if you say “hey I want you to say thank you,” and the person goes “uh, okay, thanks.” 
Dunno what your second paragraph is asking. Please clarify your own grammar if you’re gonna shit on us for ours :P 
My family often jokes around by saying things weirdly or making references to stuff. Sometimes the joke is just, “I said it wrong/in a weird voice,” or sometimes it’s reference to a movie, or (in my case) a podcast/meme/etc where they said something in a certain way or whatever. 
Not sure what you mean in terms of articulating abstract thoughts. What kind of abstract thoughts? "
4610,isfj,"The part about, ""why do they articulate so strangely?"" stands out to me. I've noticed that in my experience, as an ENTP, ISFJs have to be patient with me while I try to understand and articulate my feelings. Sometimes this can take days or even weeks. (Thank god they're so patient lol.)
In a similar vein, I need to be patient with them while they articulate their thoughts. Unless they've been raised to be expressive or have trained themselves to be this way, it usually doesn't come naturally for them.
If I'm aggressive or express anything negative, the general response is for them to shut down and if they need to talk, they become rather inarticulate. The ""anything negative"" could literally be anything. It could be my facial expression, a slightly raised voice, my body language. These are usually things I'm not aware I'm doing and I have to be more aware of when I'm talking to them. Patience and understanding goes a long way, for both parties.
That being said, I don't know anything about your situation. But considering the title of the post is ""ISFJs seeming stupid,"" if you do think that ISFJs are stupid, you are likely communicating that message to them indirectly. I wouldn't be too surprised if they are picking up on that as the ISFJs I know are rather observant, even if they tend to keep their observations to themselves."
4611,isfj,"You're home! = I'm happy you're home! or Glad to see you! or I'm acknowledging your existence which means you're important to me!
Hinting about appreciation = They want appreciation.
I'm not sure I understand your second paragraph.  They're doing things they think will make you happy, but you don't actually like it?  You've told them to stop and they do it anyway?
Sometimes I use incorrect grammar/pronunciation as a joke, so that could be what's going on.  Still, the person just being bad at grammar or expressing themselves isn't outside the realm of possibility.  It could be a problem with the individual rather than with ISFJs as a whole."
4612,isfj,"""seeming stupid"" is a poor way of expressing clashing communication styles. I think some of what you're talking about may just be the person, not necessarily their personality. MBTI types don't dictate everything a person does, but it does help different types better understand each other. "
4613,isfj,"Sorry about that.
By abstract thoughts, I mean Ne thoughts. It won't be in english, numbers, etc. It won't be in a language at all. It's kind of like a thought or idea that isn't concrete or solid. I know INTPs can have trouble articulating abstract thoughts. If you ever get them to try to describe specific facial features, they'll probably have this problem.
It's similar to having an ""image in your mind"". Then, you have to try to put that into words."
4614,isfj,"I've actually noticed my sarcasm goes over certain INTP's heads at times. Lol. They start asking me ""Why did you say that?"" and I'm like ""...It was a joke?"""
4615,isfj,"It's not that. It puzzles me why they got what they specifically got. It's like they don't stop to think out their decision. It seems they recall me appreciating it one time and deciding to do it again without seeing the many other possi..Ah. Inferior Ne. Now, it makes sense.
I think Marge Simpson once said ""I'm a Star Wars."" in one episode.
I'm also confused why they have difficulty with tech given their Si. Maybe they need to experience it and get used to it first?..Actually, that seems to be an inferior Ne moment. XD That's pretty funny actually."
4616,isfj,"Ah. Sorry. I didn't know that. I've just noticed I tend to have this experience with ISFJs. Ever since I've discovered how much  communication relates to functions, function stack, and type, I've been wanting to find out more. I can often see things going on in a person's head, but I find it very difficult to do with SFJs. They're very confusing. Seeing into their head is like seeing a scrambled puzzle. It's like they use encryption software.
I've seen ESFJs seemingly check me out, but it's not clear what they're doing. It feels like they're using a trick they learned on some manipulative YouTube video that supposedly catches a guy's attention, and it'll seem like they think they understand me yet they don't. I think the reason for this is difficulty interpreting their behavior. Their Si is probably the most confusing, probably because I'm used to thinking ""What's the logical thing to do?"" whereas they're used to strategizing and treating socializing like a game of chess or behaving like a secret agent."
4617,isfj,"Huh.... I dunno, maybe we just think differently?? I tend to think in a combination of words and images, but I can’t think of an image I wouldn’t be able to describe if someone really wanted me to. Maybe you’re just expecting something that isn’t there? "
4618,isfj,"Imo ISFJ is definitely about experience and drawing on past experience. I see things much more black and white than my intp boyfriend e.g. I'll ask him about an opinion on food and expect him to hold that opinion forever (or for a long time at least), but he really means how he feels at that exact time. Whereas if he asked me, i would draw from all my last experience and then give an opinion. "
4619,isfj,"No worries, I too am fascinated with the functions and how they relate to communication. I think some types are more prone to manipulative behavior, but that doesn't mean that all engage in it. Personally I'm not very familiar with Si."
4620,isfj,"That'd explain a lot actually.
It's true. XD"
4621,isfj,"Relative to other ISFJs or in general?
From what I've seen, socializing itself can be seen as a form of manipulation. Manipulation and even emotional manipulation aren't innately bad. It depends on the context, reason, goal, and the manipulation itself. Is the person trying to hurt someone else or manipulate them for selfish reasons or are they trying to help them out of their comfort zone? Are you trying to respectfully (or disrespectfully, depending on the scenario) bring speaking power back to yourself or are you just wanting the spotlight on you due to narcissism?"
4622,isfj,"Hello,
I recently took the myers briggs test and found that Im an ISFJ, and it seems to fit me well. Ive looked on different websites for careers suited for isfjs, but was wondering if anyone here could give me advice on my situation.
I graduated from college within the past year with a general public health degree. I currently work as a health educator for a hospital, and am looking for a new position better suited for my personality. I chose this line of work because learning about health care had always interested me, and I wasn't sure which direction I wanted to go in. I like being able to help patients, but Im too much of an introvert for this position, and dont like the constant overlap with social work. I have full health benefits through my work, and cant really afford to leave my job to go back to school. Im looking for something I can go back to school for part time, or even earn a certification, so I can enter a different field. I like working in health care and want to use my bachelors degree, but I dont enjoy working with patients and definitely need my alone time during the day. Any fellow isfjs have any suggestions or insights? Anything would be appreciated. "
4623,isfj,"I'm an ISFJ and I work as a preschool teacher currently and love it. After finishing my education I'll be a school psychologist to help the little ones be the best they can be! There are a lot of jobs you have the opportunity to help others, you just have to mix it with what you're passionate about. "
4624,isfj,"I've heard nursing, and social worker as great careers. I'm an ISFJ but I love to work laborious jobs and making my boss/supervisors happy. I think  the more you sweat/push yourself the more quantifiable your results in a career are but that's purely subjective at best. Hope this helped :) :) "
4625,isfj,"I'm in Human Resources and it fits me like a glove. You would think the conflict would get to me, and it does, sometimes, but all in all, I like understanding people's issues and finding a win/win. Of course you have to find a company that values win/win too but it's been very professionally satisfying."
4626,isfj,"I'm a selector for a tape company. I basically ride around on a motorized pallet-jack. With an RF gun (radio frequency) I get tasks by scanning a printer that then gives me a ticket, and an unverified amount of locations to pick boxes from. Once the pick is complete I drop my pallet off to an auditor. If everything checks out the pallet is wrapped, and sent to whichever store has ordered it. "
4627,isfj,"I am a classroom teacher, middle school agriculture.  Teaching is a great career for an ISFJ.  We are often called the caregivers, and while being on during teaching, there are times to recharge.  Plus your classroom/students become like a family (most of the time). "
4628,isfj,"Leos are supposed to be social butterflies, the life of the party, always wanting to be the center of attention. I can show those traits when I'm with people I've known for a long time and am really comfortable with, but in general I'm much more introverted and awkward!"
4629,isfj,"Hey guys, kinda random post but I want to know what you think of this movie!
I watched it yesterday for the second time and, oh the feels! What a beautiful movie! I was thinking that maybe as an ISFJ I found the movie more touching because we rely a lot on memories and have a strong emotion attached to them, I can't imagine having my memories about a past loved one erased, even if I regret it. 
I think that the dreamy scenes about his past memories, from childhood to all the stages of his romantic relationship, are amazing and transmit perfectly the emotions that he has associated to each memory, it gave me a feeling of nostalgia even if they were not my memories. I am rambling a bit now, so let's go with the questions: 
what's your opinion of the movie? Do you think that as ISFJs this movie can be a bit more touching for us? Would you use that technology to erase some memories of yours?
Cheers! "
4630,isfj,"Hey everyone. It seems like most of the discord servers aren't serious anymore. A group of us have gotten together to create a new discord server where you can discuss all aspects of personality theory and in an enjoy environment. We are small and brand new so please join us!
https://discord.gg/URJzZqb"
4631,isfj,"I'll try to be fair on both sides.
One thing I know for a fact that I'm definitely Si dominant and Ne inferior. I like that sense of security of sticking with something I'm familiar with. While I'm open to new things it takes me a bit longer to try things than I'd like. 

Generally when I speak, I actively aim to speak knowing the social norms. While I'd prefer to be honest, I recognize how you say things can really affect how people react especially if you can become overly honest.
I like organize my hobby life quite a lot. Like I have fun organizing which games I want to play or anime to watch and in what order.
While I don't mind being by myself, I prefer to have some fairly active social life, I've been building social lives on online communities.
Speaking of communities I don't mind being a leader of them (and in fact I'm in charge of a few) but if I had the choice I'd rather work in the background.
In fighting games, if I recognize someone isn't as good as me, I'll purposely hold back since I'm afraid they'll quit if they get too overwhelmed from losing too badly.
I welcome criticism as long as it's constructive and said in a way that's helpful in a way I can actually get myself to improve. If one is too negative or says it in a way that's too mean then that's when I get my feelings hurt.
Sometimes I like making sure things are done by a certain time or day. Other times I procrastinate and just do things whenever just depends on the motivation I have for the task.
If people talk to me about problems I like to empathize but I also want to see them get over it so I also try to offer solutions (even if I'm not particularly experienced with the issue but I try).
When there's conflict or arguments.. I don't mind them if they are civil but if they get too out of hand then I'll try to stop it or avoid them for a while.
If there's a general negative air in a community I visit, I'll likely either take a break from it or never visit it again.
Very loyal to the people/things I like a lot. (This seems like something that applies to both though)
I believe I have a strong sense of right and wrong. I don't really like to enforce it on people. 
I'm usually more interested in hearing other opinions on stuff before expressing my own. Reading/hearing people's opinions on stuff is interesting to me even if it's very unique. As long as they aren't obnoxious about talking about it.
I HATE gossiping. I don't want to talk about things about people if it's not necessarily confirmed to be true (especially behind their back).
If I say something that's wrong and someone tells me it's wrong (even if it's corrected in a nice/polite way) I beat myself up for it.

If you have any questions, that you think would help clarify feel free to ask them. Thanks!"
4632,isfj,"I sometimes don't pay public transportation. Easy to do in my country. 
I also have a consensual nonconsent fetish. It's actually a thing. No, I/we do not condone rape. Outlet? Staged ""forced fucking"" porn, Hentai, imagination, etc."
4633,isfj,"if it's the middle of the night i turn on red at no turn on red intersections and i treat certain red lights as stop signs. it's 3am, no one is driving on these tiny roads near me.
i hang out at public parks after they're closed. some nights a good swing is just what i need. also there are deer in these parks and i like looking at them from a safe distance.
i guess this vice is my thinking law can be dumb and is ok to ignore. my outlets are doing those things.
i think some people suck. and i want to help them less even though i understand they need it more. but they really suck and i don't have infinite patience. i think this vice is... judgementalness? but it ties into self care, so...iono, it's iffy.
oh! so i'm super responsible when it comes to other people, my interactions with them, and my personal emotional well being. but i don't clean my room. it's the one place i allow myself to be lazy. i only do enough laundry for the week and i dump em on my bed. and the dirty clothes are all over the floor. because laundry is stupid.
also i don't fold my sheets. i just have a blanket nest i fall into when i come home."
4634,isfj,"

my worst vice is biting my nails, I can't stop, tried several times. It has also progressed to biting my lips. 


I smoke weed almost daily, only at night when I come home from work. I feel bad for not doing more productive stuff but I tell myself I also have the right to chill a bit. 


Sometimes I feel lazy and don't feel like participating in a group convo then I loose myself in my thoughts instead of being there actively involved.

4635,isfj,"I'm an ENTP and as you are my dual, I really need to learn to talk to you better;  I'm too used to N types because it's all I'm around.  So, please feel free to message me or just reply here.  
Interests: any kind of game (card, video(pc and console), board, drinking, whatever), electronic music (chill out, house, trance, dubstep, dnb, glitch hop, whatever), and film (any genre of movie, community, archer, dexter, walking dead, game of thrones, a handful of anime)."
4636,isfj,"I would chat but I have thought of replying for a few minutes, unsure whether to, as what is the best reply. I over analyse things and want to make sure I give the most interesting and informative answer. I don't want to generalise this to everyone as everyone is different, but i'm guessing they are seen as no one has replied, or has but then deleted the message as it seems a not quite right answer. As I am thinking of deleting this right now as it seems like babbling."
4637,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I really need a lot of time to think about what I want to say before I say it- especially with people I don't know. I find that my best ideas come when I've had some time to think about the situation, but when I do the ideas come in a flash and are well organized (which, unfortunately makes me a terrible conversationalist because I often don't know what to say in the moment). I also tend to take things very personally, so criticism should be given tactfully and privately. I don't know if all of that is indicative of ISFJs, but that's me.
To answer your questions about my interests, I like board games (especially party games like pictionary), but video games give me headaches and I find them difficult to navigate. I don't listen to a lot of electronic music but I love witty TV shows (Arrested Development, The Office). "
4638,isfj,"You really are the opposite of me haha.  I have no problem saying whatever in front of anyone.  I find that my ideas come too frequently and I have trouble acting on all of them.  My best ideas still come in a flash but they are usually about the way something should be organized if that makes sense.  I do programming so it might be some way to arrange code to achieve something, or maybe a way to rearrange songs in a mix (I DJ as well) for better flow.
As for conversation, I find that I can be witty, but it doesn't well for me because I tend to come off as an ass hole.  The one ISFJ I knew also took things personally.  Would you get upset if I said I didn't like a song by your favorite band?  As I mentioned earlier, I'm a DJ, and I actively seek criticism so that I may improve.  
Have you ever played Pandemic?  It is the people vs the board itself and it tends to be a good game for many types.  What is it about Pictionary that you enjoy so much?  
On the topic of video games, it sounds like you are mostly speaking about modern action games.  Do you feel the same way about games like Tetris?  
What you think of electronic music?  It's okay if you don't like it, I can handle hearing your opinion, but what I'm really interested in is understanding why you have that opinion.  I'd also like to hear about your tastes and also what it is about those songs that you enjoy so much.  There are no wrong answers here.  
I watched a lot of the Office but quit around season 6 I think.  Which version do you watch?  And also, who's your favorite character?
Have you ever heard that ENTPs are the most curious type? :D"
4639,isfj,Ya but when you come out of your shells and care about someone you're the best!  What kind of music do you like?  What do you like about it?  What kinds of things do you find yourself thinking about often?
4640,isfj,"Tell me all the things =]  If you have any questions for me, you can ask those too of course.  
What languages do you know?  What do you like about them?  I always struggled with language.  I used either too few words or too many.  I like to write the way I think which tends to be lots of phrases and the complete sentences end up being a mess.  It's like I want to say the same thing several different ways to make sure you get the point and I love using things like ... as a long pause and things like !?! or ?!? to combine question marks and exclamation points, but with more emphasis on one character than the other (I also will frequently do ??? and !!!).  I tend to be creative and while it is great to be creative in the things that you write, it turns out that it is really bad to be creative in the way you write things.
What is it about classical music that you like?  Is there any particular time period you feel drawn too?  I feel that my taste in music (electronic) is very much like modern ""classical"" music in terms of structure and long term flow/changes.
What kind of things do you sew and bake?  Do you feel that those are tasks that are relaxing, or do you like the sense of accomplishment from completing them?  "
4641,isfj,"Well! From your description your personality type is completely foreign to me. I don't know very much about ENTPs at all! I wouldn't be upset if you didn't like a song from my favorite band. The kind of thing that would upset me is if you were (for example) to snap at me a little, even if the reason had nothing to do with me, or if you were like that to everyone else too. This happened a few weeks ago when I was trying to explain the rules of a board game (Smallworld) to a man, but forgot to mention a certain rule. He was very short with me about forgetting and I just shut right down, even though we didn't know each other at all and he spoke rudely to everyone in the room. (I got over it by the next day, but I really shut down for the entire duration of the rest of the evening I had to be around him). 
I appreciate constructive criticism just like anyone else, but I find that I will take it personally because most of what I do already has so much thought put into it. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, which can sometimes be a nuisance!
I've played Pandemic, but only once, months ago. I think I would need to play it again to get a good feel for it uninterrupted by looking at the rules every turn. I like Pictionary because it's engaging and silly. I am not so much a fan of heavy strategy games because I find them to be a chore. (Agricola is the WORST).
With video games, it depends. Games like Tetris and Gameboy games are fine, and I love my N64, but even super mario bros and super smash bros along with modern video games are taxing. I get headachey and can't sustain playing for more than 15 minutes. I prefer to watch other people play. I actually find it fun to watch!
I honestly haven't been exposed to much electronic music to say one way or another how I feel about it. As I'm sure you can guess, partying is not my scene and I doubt many ISFJs like to party or frequent environments with loud crowds and even louder music. Is it weird that I feel like the beat of the bass drum is trying to change the rhythm of my heartbeats? Haha even typing that is absurd, but I would rather have a night in playing board games, watching movies or cooking with friends. Most music I listen to is either top 40 or folk, but I'm very lazy about music. I just listen to whatever my mood is on 8tracks. Lately I've been studying a lot so I've been listening to instrumental movie soundtracks to keep me focused while I work.
I watched both versions of the Office. I stopped at season 4 of the US version and picked it up again a couple weeks ago since I got netflix. I though season seven was PHENOMENAL and emotional and funny and smartly written. My favorite character would be split between Erin and Michael.
Tell me something about ENTPs, since I know very little about your personality type!"
4642,isfj,"Ulrich Schnauss (shoegaze)
Andrew Bayer (breakbeat)
BT whom I'm pretty sure is ENTP and actually does lots of dance, but this isn't dance.
Skeletone (jazzy liquid dnb)
And this is a youtube playlist of my own mixes and it covers the span of dance music I like.  Of note would be h², v², s², w², and y².  Each of these are different genres, so I hope you'll at least skip through them.  Most of the mixes fall somewhere around or between those 5.
copy and paste from a message I sent to a different ISFJ:
I think I tend to prefer electronic music for several reasons. I'd like to explain it, more for your own information and maybe to give you insight to how I process things. I'm not trying to convince you I'm right. First, I can't stand too much singing or it gets in the way of my own thoughts. I find it too dominating in most songs and since all humans have a human voice, I've simply grown tired of the voice. This leads me to another point about most genres, which is that they rely on the same instruments over and over again and I'm just tired of electric guitars and drums. The thing about good electronic music is that even though it is structured kind of samey through out a genre, each individual song has its own sounds. Further, those sounds evolve and change through out the course of the song. Now, on the opposite end of this, most electronic music carries a heavy and clear beat which is the opposite of what I just said so much. The predictable structures of songs (most importantly, predictable phrase lengths), allows my brain to sort of relax. I mentioned earlier that voices get in the way... Having some consistency in structure, allows even more room for my thoughts. This is then supported with just the handful of instruments that are really interesting to listen to. When I'm really focusing on it, I can literally go into a state of ""trance"" and ride the textures of the different electronic instruments. It is my form of meditation."
4643,isfj,"You are already on a vastly different page than my one experience with an ISFJ. She loved clubs, loud music, drugs, and has since become a stripper.  
However, I have actually had the music change my heart beat.  For me, it feels good when I get my heart in sync with the music.  I don't need it to be super loud, because my mind will actually regulate it to that tempo if I get into it.  I've done it on my own, sitting in a chair at home with headphones on.  I'm not really into the party scene.  I'm into ""dance"" music for listening if that makes sense.  Some of it is more chill out and softer, some of it is still ""techno"" but it isn't nearly as driving or forceful as club music.  
We get snappy if we feel ignored.  We have very short patience for reactions.  If we ask you to do something, you can typically do it kind of slowly... but please don't just sit there and not respond.  It won't go well for anyone.  We can take the negative responses much better than we handle silence.  It lets our logic move forward with your new answer in place.  If we don't get that feedback, we feel stuck.
Honestly, playing board games and having someone watch me play video games sounds amazing.  I really like playing more ""artsy"" games like Journey.  I do play some action games, but I actively try to play all genres.   It's funny you mentioned super smash bros though because that game is like a black hole for me.  When I'm playing, nothing else exists.
Okay... something random about ENTPs.... 
Well I can't speak for all ENTPs, but out of all the ones I've met (4), none of us are materialistic.  Sure we ""like"" gifts, but it is our last ""love language.""  For me, the absolute most important thing is touch.  Now, a lot of people jump to ""sex"" but it is way way more than that.  Shoulder massages just because you know I like them will make me fall head over heels for someone.  Ya, we do like sex a lot, but that is just like one slice of the pie.  We are also extremely vulnerable to loving people who cook for us.  I never realized it till I got older, but my mom is an ESFJ, and she loved to cook for us.  Turns out, that was like my favorite thing she would ever do for me.  I actually have trouble finishing her cookies because I don't want to have zero of them. 
Now, I don't know how much you know about cognitive function stuff, but due to our arrangement of functions, we have a huge tolerance for messy stuff.  If you want something clean, you either need to explain very literally what it is you care about, and we can take care of it really well.  But if it is something that needs to be done often, you are honestly just better off doing it yourself.  It isn't out of spite... but we just won't remember.  Repetitive tasks like that just slip through the cracks because we are off in the clouds thinking about our next project.  However... They need a pile of stuff somewhere and a desk is great option.  Then, just don't rearrange stuff much with out him or he will lose everything.  It is hard to explain, but if you clean up parts of my desk, I'll lose track of everything.
Now, the way I like to show my affection is mostly through physical stuff.  I don't sleep with many girls (all the real life ENTPs I know of follow this trend as well).  We tend to like monogamy.  We put so much value and effort into our physical contact, that we don't think we should share it.  You have to be special to deserve it.  In the example above about cleaning, if you asked us to join, and offered to give us a back rub afterwards, there is a good chance we would want to give you a massage too and I can totally see that leading to sex every time.  
Summary: touch good, chores bad (see: AWFUL), cooking great, questions?"
4644,isfj,"I completely agree with what you're saying about shutting down. As a fellow ISFJ, I will shut down whenever people get like that. Even if it's not directed at me, I will still shut down from the negativity. 
We aren't as quick witted as some and, as a result, I find that I almost become excluded from a conversation. (All of my friends are extroverts. No idea what their actual letters are though) You can't get a word in edgewise and so sometimes I just take myself completely out of a conversation. If you find one of us being totally unengaged or really shut off, approach us and talk to us about something completely unrelated to the conversation we cut ourselves out of. If it was GoT, maybe talk about what your weekend was like. Try to make it the most opposite thing from what we took personally so that we don't continue to think about the previous conversation. It will take us a while to get over the hurt. (Like the post above said. They were shut down the rest of the evening) Just be aware that we can take things personally and try to keep it in mind when talking to us."
4645,isfj,"okay so... a warning: I'm not sober....
Everyone is different from ENTP it seems.  We are the anomaly in the world as far as I can tell.  The majority of the world is S instead of N and most N's are more F than T!  I feel like I meet a fair number of INTPs and INTJs in the nerd community but ENTPs are much fewer. 
I don't really get frustrated usually, but some times the ST types just spend a long time on stuff that I feel is long past solved.  I have a friend I like a lot but he is ST and he will spend 10 sentences explaining something I understood before he finished his first sentence and that really does frustrate me.  I'm like yes, I get it PLEASE MOVE ON TO YOUR POINT.  
I find that the smartest and healthiest people I know are able to be nearly type neutral.  Anyone who is really strongly their time seems to have severe problems of some kind.
That is a huge list of languages!  I struggle with just English =[  I'm jealous.
I feel like electronic music also conveys many moods well.  All of the popular club stuff is the same; but that is not accurate to all electronic music.  That is just one tiny sliver of it.
It seems that ISFJ's like to cook... and I hate to cook!  I hope you meet an ENTP... And if so, just cook for them and they will never leave you lol.  I'm glad to hear you have projects.  I have too many to keep track of and I hadn't heard many other ISFJs talk about projects.  My limited experience with ISFJs gave me the impression that you loved tv haha.
What I want to know is....
Are you familiar with the idea of the ""functional"" stack that comes from your type?  This is really really important! Please answer!
Do you find yourself making emotional choices that you later justify?
How would you describe your process for making decisions?  Are there common questions that you feel like you ask yourself or automatically answer?  For example, I would expect a normal ISFJ to think about ""how would the other people involved feel about this?""
Following that, do you ever justify actions that might have negative long term consequences to justify immediate satisfaction?  Has this negatively effected you?
Do you like being ISFJ?  Would you change if you could?  
I really like the new google chat.  Want to chat in real time?"
4646,isfj,"Sorry for the late reply. As I was reading your comments it reminded me of my boyfriend. I made him take a version of the MBTI and sure enough, he is an ENTP.
I love cooking for people. It is one of my favorite ways to show someone that I like them. If I were to date someone new, I would bring them a pie. I also don't care for gifts much, but I (and likely other ISFJs) absolutely need verbal praise in order to feel good. Even saying nothing in regards to be appreciated can be very detrimental. I need to feel appreciated to feel happy. Sometimes this can really suck though, because I will often go out of my way to do something nice for people, hope for praise, and when it doesn't come I will be crushed. Because of my strong emphasis for praise, I can be a bad judge of character if I'm not careful.
What about when you disagree with someone? Are you the arguing type? Do you give the silent treatment? I'm curious about that."
4647,isfj,"I don't understand this question.
I do like to argue.  For me it is just fun and lighthearted.  It is fun to understand how people think and to understand what exactly they care in something like a movie or a song.  I don't like upsetting people, but arguing is not upsetting for me and I don't want it to be for others.  I don't even like to call it arguing... I tend to say we were ""debating.""
To me, the silent treatment is stopping talking to someone because they did something to upset me and I don't want to talk about it.
No, never.  I always try to explain why I'm upset and always try to reach out to them.  But, if there is something I care about a lot, I need time to process it and that needs to be quiet.  I know that when I'm in an argument with a girlfriend and shes getting upset, I sometimes end up with this face that looks completely emotionless and I'm just silent... but I'm thinking about what I want to say very carefully because she matters a lot to me (I wouldn't be dating her if she didnt matter to me).  This isn't a silent treatment, but just me needing some time to think so I don't say something stupid.
In a few rare cases where I feel like I've done nothing wrong and I have tried to talk things over with the person and they simply won't listen to me and won't see my point of view, I tend to just break off my relationships with that person.  It isn't really a silent treatment and more of a ""look, you aren't making the cut to be my friend anymore so I'm going else where with my time.""  I will always try to explain things and repair them first.  This has only happened a handful of times in my life."
4648,isfj,"Okay so, all this myers briggs stuff is really just code for describing what parts of your brain you prefer to use.  In a sense, it is describing the information you value at the most basic level.  No person spends all of their time in the same thought mode and you actually have two distinctly different ones when you are ""in your head"" and when you are processing the world around you.  The ISFJ stack is like a reflection of the ENTP stack which is one reason why our types are compatible.  
ISFJ = Si Fe Ti Ne
ENTP = Ne Ti Fe Si
Si = Sensing introverted = This is your primary mode of thinking and it is your ""in your head"" mode.  This is very aware of the moment and often times comparing current moments to past moments.  You look for the way things have always been and if a situation starts in a familiar way, you will have the feelings of the last event come to you.  This is largely about finding new ""data."" 
Fe = Feeling extroverted = This is where you make decisions and those decision are heavily influenced by the emotions of the people around you.  You are able to talk about your feelings some what openly compared to many types.  In combination with your Si, you will sometimes make decisions based on other people's past emotions as well.
Ti = Thinking introverted = When you really need to be logical, it requires you to stop talking and really focus I'm sure.  I also imagine this comes out in times of stress when you feel like your normal methods aren't working.  You are able to become some what rational so long as you don't open your mouth (because it is introverted, when you try to interact with the world it will kick you over to your extroverted mode).  You can likely think about things logically, but when you try to say it, you'll feel all the emotions of your words.
Ne = Intuition extroverted = This is like something you don't go to very often, but it is my primary mode of processing!  It is really about seeing connections in the world around you and pulling data out of patterns.   This leads us to be really good at reading people and anticipating their next actions and it also leads us to be really good at detecting liars.  It is that ""gut feeling"" where you ""just know.""  I would guess that you've probably experienced a few times, but it is something that I experience very frequently.  This is also how we are creative.  We are making connections between two things that may not have been connected in the past and suddenly we are ""creative.""

4649,isfj,"Wowzerz... Okay, I won't be getting back to all of the more personal stuff till later, but I wanted to share a few things with you.  You don't quite sound completely convinced that this ""personality"" type stuff is fun but not exactly fact. That's okay.  I'd like to present some new evidence for you to add to your understanding of it.  
Your type and the areas of the brain (the functions) are visible in EEG scans.  
You can learn more about it from this youtube about the research and the guy who gives that presentation came and did an AMA as well.  
I will get back to you about everything else.  But it is late and I must sleep and I want to give you a good reply.  Thank you for taking the effort to write so much."
4650,isfj,"You're not creepy at all! I am not the arguing type. I really dread confrontation. But when I'm in extreme stress, I will take it out on those closest to me for no real significant reason. For example, I was turned down a position in a program that I was working towards for the better part of 5 years. Of course, I'm devastated about this and I will find the tiniest thing to be upset about- SO WHY DIDNT YOU DO THE DISHES DO I SERIOUSLY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING MYSELF YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING AROUND HERE IVE BEEN WORKING SO HARD AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN AND I TOLD YOU TO GO TO THE BANK YESTERDAY DIDNT I?!? NOW ITS CLOSED AND BLAH BLAH BLAH.
Yes, I went and got help for that because it's not really me to argue."
4651,isfj,"Well, that's just really cool.  I hadn't gotten that far into researching my ISFJ-ness.  I was just excited to read other ISFJ's comments everywhere to know there were others who think and act like me.  My husband is an ENFP.  It's fascinating how similar people of the same classification are."

How would you describe your process for making decisions? Are there common questions that you feel like you ask yourself or automatically answer? For example, I would expect a normal ISFJ to think about ""how would the other people involved feel about this?""
Following that, do you ever justify actions that might have negative long term consequences to justify immediate satisfaction? Has this negatively effected you?
Do you like being ISFJ? Would you change if you could?"
4653,isfj,"I find that I talk myself out of doing things more than anything.  Then, after the fact, I regret not doing them.  For that I feel like I miss out on having some fun.
As for decisions that have to be made, I never want to out other people out, so I will do extra work.  I also have to go through the possibilities I can think of before making a decision to see which makes the most sense.  I often fear there are things that I didn't think of, and, therefore, I missed out on an alternative option.
I DO wish I were different...not so fearful...but, it seems like all the personality types would have a downside, so I'll just stay where I am.  "
4654,isfj,"If you want to ask me anything, I won't take anything personally or offensively.  If you find anything about ENTPs weird, I'm a totally open book.  
In all of the following questions, you can include ""and why?"" as a follow up. 
What kind of foods do you like?  
What kind of music do you like?  
What kind of movies/tv show do you like?
Is there any drugs that you like to take?  I'm defining drug as any chemical that can cross the blood brain barrier so this includes coffee and alcohol. 
Do you find yourself frustrated with any other types?
How do you define healthy?"
4655,isfj,"Is there anything about your personality you don't like?
I like a variety of music...my husband and I are going to the Americana festival which shows Bob Dylan and Wilco.  I like Counting Crows, Ryan Adams, old rap/hip-hop, smooth jazz.
I draw, crochet, and other random crafty things.  You like to play video games I saw, and, like the other ISFJ, I like to watch my husband play them.  He tried to teach me how to play Call of Duty once, but I spent most of the time with my guy looking up or down at the floor.  It seems that I don't understand the play in 3D worlds.  I can play side-scrolling games just fine...except for one thing...I get frustrated which quickly turns to anger.  Then, I have to quit.  I had to give up on all games on my phone except for Mahjong and Sudoku because they are actually calming.
What other things do you do to keep busy?
I have a degree in finance, though I am currently unemployed because they ""restructured"", I worked for trust companies and investment advisors.  I would like to work in a different industry though.  Something with health or helping others in a way that doesn't revolve around their investments.  My Holland Code letters are ICS, so I should be working in a service field that helps.  That is what I tent do naturally as a Guardian Protector What do you do for a living?  Do you like it or wish for a change?"
4656,isfj,"I have some albums for you to explore with my fav songs !! 
Sza- Ctrl: normal girl, love galore, drew Barrymore, broken clocks 
Cardi B- invasion of privacy: be careful, I do, bartier cardi 
Ariana grande- sweetener: R.E.M., goodnight n go, breathin, Pete Davidson "
4657,isfj,"So I listened to everything...I definitely like the vibe of SZA & I’ve listened to that album by Cardi B before 😂 the only song I liked was I Do haha. As far as Ariana Grande - I’ve listened to her Sweetner album before & honestly couldn’t vibe with her idk whyyy
But thank you for the music suggestions! 🥰"
4658,isfj,"Majority of my music is country, but I listen to a wide range of people. From Taylor Swift to Kanye West to Five Finger Death Punch to Halsey to Seether to Luke Bryan etc.
I’m open to anything really.
I started listening to kpop, lol, but I’ve been trying to find EDM that doesn’t include someone singing."

4660,isfj,"Hmm... EDM that doesn't include someone singing? I used to listen to a ton of that.
Check out stuff by OVERWERK. He's a Canadian artist, I believe he uses movie soundtracks as inspiration, lots of his stuff doesn't have lyrics. Check out Exist, and the Conquer album.
Ever heard of Monstercat? They're a huge EDM record label. My favourite artists are Televisor (check out the song Deluxe), and Tut Tut Child (check out Eat Me and Dance To It). Other popular artists are Stephen Walking, Marshmello, Pegboard Nerds, etc.
Also check out the Beat Saber album by Jaroslav Beck!! Some of them have lyrics, but most don't. And they are sooooo catchy.
Also. For more pep, I've been enjoying stuff by Doctor Vox lately. Check out Endgame and the related album The Legend of Doctor Vox, and DEATH."
4661,isfj,"Lamour Toujours and all remixes under the sun
Any Armin von Buuren. Example In and out of the love
Any benessi with dhany songs
Zyzz music compliations are great. Zyzz was bodybuilder who listen certain time of EDM
Paradise channel of youtube has nice trance too.
I am not gonna post my whole yt playlist so here it is PLyt513lo-xR43kSmIIs_XrAEo83cnVCbT "
4662,isfj,"If you like trance, i can't recommend enough you listen to Andy Blueman. 
[Neverland] (https://youtu.be/TPTZ_3zNqaI)
Also, i gotta say you have a very similar taste to mine. I loathe what's popular on the radio, besides classic rock, but do like some pop. "
4663,isfj,"I’ve noticed that as an ISFJ, I tend to absorb other people’s emotions and lately that includes a lot of bad ones from my coworkers! The store I work at is going through changes and not everyone is handling it well. My question is, how do you eat yourself out of that?? I’ve been trying to get back to being positive!"
4664,isfj,"Yes! Absorbing others feelings is so tough. 
I can usually get out of it with a few things: comedy TV rerun, playing with my dog, exercise. Just got to absorb energy from another source that's positive. "
4665,isfj,"I was reading an older thread in this sub in which the OP spoke about pursuing medicine as a career only to realize it wasn't a good fit for his personality. Is anyone else in a similar predicament? I've recently been pushed into a supervisory position, and I'm hating every minute of it. I've always been happiest being second-in-command, smoothing ruffled feathers, making sure all the background crap gets done, trying to make my superior and the rest of my crew as happy and stress-free as possible. Now I have to try to be a disciplinarian (I've already had to fire 2 employees). I'm failing to delegate tasks because I always tried to do the scut-work myself, and I continue to do so even though I'm letting other aspects of the job slip. I'm trying not to let anyone down because, well, ISFJ. This unwanted promotion is ostensibly meant to be a sign of faith in my abilities, but now I do more work that I dislike for the same pay, so I'm just feeling punished.
However, since my ""promotion"", I've found that I'm cooking and baking a lot more to relieve my stress. Following an orderly recipe, preparing my mise en place, and (hopefully) delighting friends and family with the results is bringing me the gratification I no longer get from my occupation.
So, fellow ISFJ's, are there others like me trying to compensate for an unfulfilling job with soul-satisfying hobbies? Or have you got the world on a string, working your ideal job and pursuing your favorite outside interests?"
4666,isfj,I work a corporate retail which I absolutely hate. More often than not I feel like my hard work is unappreciated which makes me feel awful. I always want to feel like I am an asset or at least bring some kind of value to my workplace but unfortunately in corporate retail you're only a number.  Quitting would be the obvious solution but for some reason I feel obligated to stay (why must we be so damn loyal). I'm going back to school to hopefully fulfill my dream of becoming a veterinary assistant. 
4667,isfj,"In my first half of high school I was set on becoming an accountant, and I was pretty good at it.  But that changed when I took a digital electronics class and discovered my passion for computer programming.  I've been a software developer for the past 15 years.  I'm not too sure if this profession is common among ISFJ's but I love the creative and the problems solving aspects behind it.  The people I work with are like my family and the software I develop is used in both the health care and education fields."
4668,isfj,"I graduated college with a business degree because, well, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I still think I would really like to work for a non-profit someday in some capacity, but I'm not sure exactly what capacity...
Currently, I'm in a bit of a unique position. I'm a ""Management Trainee"" within my company, which is quite large(40,000 associates world wide), and I ""rotate"" positions. I've held two so far, and I'm going to be starting a 3rd soon:


My first ""rotation"" was in sales. Saying I hated it would be an understatement. I worked the job 7 months, and learned that sales is forever going to be at the very bottom of my employment preferences. I hate feeling like I am a nuisance to people, and that is exactly what I felt like everyday working in sales.


My second position, and the one I am currently working in, is administrative in nature. Typical office work, with some client facing responsibilities. I've worked in this position for about 6 months, and I like it MUCH better than sales. I have responsiblities in this position which other people don't know how to fulfill, so I really feel like I am an asset and people need me. It is nice for everyone to feel needed, but I think as an ISFJ it is particularly important.


The third position, which I am going to be working in soon, will be as an IT project manager. Although I haven't actually starting working as one, the research I've done on the field makes it sound appealing. It is structurred, and requires strong organizational skills, which I believe I (as well as most ISFJs) have. Not only do I have strong organizational skills, but I really enjoy organizing and creating order. I'm hoping this will be something which works for me as an ISFJ, but I won't know until I try it!


Finally, as far as hobbies go. I really don't have any ""soul-satisfying"" hobbies, sadly. I've never really come across any that appeal to me in that sense. I like gaming, and watching movies/tv shows, but these are more to pass to the time, as opposed to something which really feels satisfying and meaningful. I'm big into fitness, which is more of a lifestyle than a hobby to me, and while it has without a doubt improved my life, it just isn't that ""soul-satisfying"" thing. I really spend most of my time working, rather than pursuing hobbies. I think I do this because I feel like my work gives me purpose, and is something people appreciate. I have a feeling this may hurt me in the long run, and it already has socially, but I just can't find a hobby which really fulfills me quite as much as working does. Only time will tell, and I'm fortunate to be young with lots of time left! Sorry for the novel..."
4669,isfj,"I'm sure there's something else that would be a better fit, but I'm working in retail which is the only kind of job I've had. I work in a pretty niche shop now and its so much better than being a cashier drone or a coffee drone, haha. I'd say I enjoy it."
4670,isfj,"I get really bothered when people assume that everybody wants to do, or will be good at, supervisory jobs. Being a supervisor is a set of tasks all of its own, and just because someone likes or is good at their previous position doesn't mean the same will be true of management. I had a manager at McDonalds who tried to talk me into being a manager. She made no secret of the fact that she was pleased with my work and it was clear that she wanted to acknowledge my progress and see me grow even more, but she didn't understand that the reasons why I liked and was good at my existing position (head hostess for the kids' parties) would not have translated to management at all. (I share your love of being a 2IC, though!) Thankfully she at least accepted ""no"" graciously - the fact that you got forced into it really pisses me off. 
As for my current job, translation, it fits my personality in many ways. I was first drawn to it because a professor said that being introverted would be an asset instead of something I would constantly need to suppress. Then when I tried it, I discovered that it really spoke to my dominant Si in terms of how important details are, and my J in terms of the organisation involved. I also notice that I do particularly well with humanities-related texts, which has to do with my Fe maybe?
Before that, I definitely compensated with hobbies. I did fan translations while I was still studying to be a translator, and I used to bring my translations to my day job and work on them during my lunch break, then go home and type them up. Even though I couldn't translate nearly as easily as I can now, it was still relaxing to take some alone time and do something that fit with who I am. 
I really hope you can find a better job soon. "
4671,isfj,"My wife totally concurs with you. She works corporate retail, as well, and you are truly nothing more than a number in that environment. And she and I both share your sense of misplaced loyalty to our employers. Good on you for taking the steps to pursue something better, because in retail it never gets better, just different. Her dream is to start a meal planning business, where students come to your kitchen and you help them create a week's worth of meals for their family."
4672,isfj,"What a wonderful opportunity you've been presented with! Will you have a choice of positions when you are through with your rotation, or is it simply to give you well-rounded perspective prior to pushing you into whatever position is open at the time? Sales truly sounds like an ISFJ's personal hell, so I hope you don't get stuck there.
As you say, you are young, so it may not be necessary yet for you to develop hobbies. I'm pushing 50, so I've developed mine over decades of working. They are simply a coping mechanism, a safety valve for my psyche when I'm feeling overwhelmed or under-appreciated at work. It sounds like you are being challenged enough by the variation in tasks that you don't need one at the moment. That, and your current devotion to fitness is probably more fulfilling than you think. Performing structured tasks, whether it be leg day for you or baking a cheesecake for me, can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that can be indescribably wonderful."
4673,isfj,"I've worked manufacturing jobs almost my entire life, and have enjoyed those jobs for the most part. It's just this most recent twist that has thrown me off. My wife works in corporate retail and hates the unnecessary politics of the job. She would probably love the type of retail you work."
4674,isfj,"My personal life is great, thanks to a great spouse. On the job front, your's sounds like one I would enjoy immensely. I loved doing illustrations when I was younger and regret to this day that I didn't pursue an education in the field of graphic design. I wish you continued good fortune."
4675,isfj,"We sound very similar. I just feel so far out of my element in this position that I get no sense of satisfaction. I used to have the time and freedom to perform extra tasks to keep things clean and running smoothly. Now it's just paperwork, trying to adapt to daily schedule changes with a crew that keeps getting smaller while the workload keeps getting greater, and dealing with a moody superior (he had this job before me), who is in over his head more than I am at the moment. The major difference is that he enthusiastically accepted the position, where as I was told, ""you might as well suck it up cause you're gonna be here a while.""
I envy you that you've gotten into a field that suits you, as I hope to. The company I work for is quite large and diverse, so there is room for advancement other than supervision. But our plant here in Las Vegas is small and aging, so I would definitely have to relocate to do anything else within the corporation."
4676,isfj,"What novel do you think an ISFJ would like? I’m trying to help an ISFJ get back into reading, so I think one that’s not too long, one that picks up quickly, and one that’s very enjoyable/rewarding would be good."
4677,isfj,"I don’t know if a preference for genre is defined by someone’s Meyers Briggs classification. I almost exclusively read fantasy and my tastes in this run the same as my INTP husband. 
How old is this person? What have they enjoyed in the past?"
4678,isfj,"Can't speak for all ISFJs, but I believe we're known to put a lot of effort, care, and affection into our relationships, and personally I very much prefer to DTR earlier rather than later. Really depends on the partner, but for me and my current boyfriend, I knew it was going to be something special from the beginning, and were exclusive from the start of us seeing each other."
4679,isfj,"I have, well had, been dating one for 10 weeks. It was just so easy and I adore him. He is still active on dating sites, though he says he hasn’t gone out with anyone since we started dating. I am still on them only because he is. He hasn’t told anyone about me. He matched with one of my friends (he hasn’t met her) a few days ago and it broke my heart. I know I shouldn’t be upset because we aren’t exclusive but it hurt. He has like no previous relationship experience but just still swiping at this point made me think he can’t be that into me and I am wasting my time getting more attached. It was so easy being together and we pretty much acted as bf-gf. I tried bringing up how I was feeling a few nights ago and he wouldn’t engage the conversation. I ended things last night only to find out he had no idea it was coming, he hasn’t thought about a future with me, and didn’t know the dating sites bothered me... he apologized for swiping on my friend for what it is worth. I just am at a point where I’d rather have control of my heartbreak than let this all keep festering inside and becoming worse in a few weeks. I really care for the guy but I have to take care of myself. I am just curious as to other ISFJ dtr experiences. Si is my inferior function."
4680,isfj,"ya that is shitty, that would bother me - the friend thing on tinder or wherever - but 2months is pretty short. I am almost 5 months in and just neither of us have bothered to bring it up i think we are both just comfy with where things are/dont need a label. but neither of us are doing the dating app thing anymore (its how we met). I could understand the frustation with him still being on, bc that def would make it seem like they arent interested in a future with things, which hurts when you do have feelings. definitely the better route to get ahead of anything getting deeper or more when they clearly aren't reciprocating a lot. hopefully some actual isfjs can help you get more clarity on their experiences. who knows, maybe he will come back realizing things."
4681,isfj,I don’t know that I am ready to call him my boyfriend but I know I don’t think intimacy can grow with still being on dating apps. I just feel like if he truly likes me then he wouldn’t want to talk to other women. Five months seems plenty of time to have that talk to me (ENFP)... but I do hope some ISFJs will give some insight.
4682,isfj,"We're unspoken-ly together, I mean we are monogamous which is similar to you what means the most to me. And to his parents, siblings, friends all refer to me as the girlfriend so its really no issue in my mind. could care less about making it fb official or not. i definitely was still more up in the air 2months in but definitely just a sign of maturity in the beginning if so"
4683,isfj,I totally get the whole not caring about Facebook official nonsense. I don’t ever like to post my relationship status on Facebook really. So my guy said he felt guilty talking to women on bumble and tinder but swears it never went past talking... if he felt guilty then why did he still do it? AND moreover why has he chosen to stay on the apps instead of seeing if our relationship would work? I think I made the right decision breaking things off. I really care about him but I value myself more. 
4684,isfj,"I'm 85(ish) % sure that I'm an istj. My boss, who is an isfj, invited me to her church. I opened up to her about my relationship, and my views on, like, religious views. She said ""right on"" (not actually) and then invited me to church. But she's married. And I'm married. I don't want to intrude into her life. What if her husband is not cool with it? He's a PhD mechanical engineer, or something, so he's probably some kind of  I x x J. And if he is he's not going to be ok with me invading his private life. 
Here's my question. Did she invite me because it's just in her function to be helpful? Should I ignore the isfj, because isfj is just being an isfj, and her
 I x x J husband will want to fight me?? Will isfj remember that I didn't go to church, and she will become vindictive? SHE'S MY BOSS. Only an isfj can tell me what I should do. "
4685,isfj,"I just don't know what to make of it. I'm going circles trying to figure it out. 
Edit we're not super close. If anything, she just listens to me talk, and has given me little, to no insight into her own life. That must mean she doesn't feel comfortable with me. "
4686,isfj,"As an ISFJ female who is married to an E, you need to be able to compromise your desire to be out and be sociable with her desire for peace and quiet.  The compromise needs to be on both sides though--she'll need to come to things with you even when she might not want to and you'll need to be willing to stay home with her (or go by yourself) on occasion.
When there's an event I don't want to attend I ask my husband how important it is for me to go along.  If it's important to him, I'll go; if not, he goes by himself.  I feel better going to something if I know a timeframe of when we'll be leaving, so it might help to tell her you'll leave a party at 12 AM or you'll leave after 3 hours, etc."
4687,isfj,"I am an ISFJ male and one thing I can't stand is conflicts. Try to avoid conflict and talk things out in a peaceful manner. If there is a problem don't make it seem threatening, other wise she might just shut down on you. I don't know. It could be just me. "
4688,isfj,I'm also an ISFJ female engaged to an E and we're slowly but surely finding ways to compromise on each other's social needs. Often out helps if we have friends over to our place; that way I don't feel too overwhelmed because I'm in my own space and it's easier to open up and be friendly.
4689,isfj,"Whoa....ISFJ/31/F here...this must explain why I love hosting parties so much...but only at my apartment! Typically I feel social anxiety and pressure, even at events my boyfriend throws at his place...but not if it's in my domain. Control factor?"
4690,isfj,"I sometime do this thing where I will relive past memories and feel the emotions that I felt then. I know that this is si but, the thing is, my memories seem to go in different directions. For example I relived a conversation that I had with my friend a couple of years ago and the answers he gave were different. I was reliving the conversation but I was also making up new scenarios at the same time and feeling new emotions. It came to the point where I could no longer distinguish the made up parts with the real parts. This may sound harmless but the scenarios can become extremely nasty. This just doesn't happen with conversations either. My brain will sometimes inject whatever I am thinking about in the present or something completely made up and put it into the past and make up new memories. When I was younger I would sometimes actually think that these made up memories actually happened. I am better at distinguishing fantasy and reality now, thankfully. Is this normal or am I just crazy or something? A couple years ago, when my mental health was not so great, my brain used these tactics to basically make me believe some really weird totally made up and borderline fantastical things about my childhood. I'm not going to say what exactly because you guys would probably just think I was trolling or something. Is this si gone wrong or something?"
4691,isfj,"You just described something I have been going through for years but never had the words to describe or explain! I wish I knew what it was too. It's gets really frustrating, especially since I usually can distinguish what's real and what's not."
4692,isfj,I do the same thing. I relive memories and try to imagine different outcomes of those situations and before I know it I'm thinking of future scenarios. I always end up imagining some terribly negative situation before I can catch myself and think of something different. Then I dwell on the negative feelings. ugh
4693,isfj,I’ve been dealing with this EXACT problem and even with things that aren’t memories. I come up with so many hypothetical situations and then feel the emotions associated with them. Idk is this Si? I’m still learning about the cognitive functions lol
4694,isfj,"memories revisited are recreated as new memories. memories aren't stored in our brings like data in a computer. that's just how they work. we try to keep them as accurate as possible. but they can be changed or influenced easily.
This is a quote from an article about memories and why it fails us.
""When we recall our own memories, we are not extracting a perfect record of our experiences and playing it back verbatim. Most people believe that memory works this way, but it doesn’t. Instead, we are effectively whispering a message from our past to our present, reconstructing it on the fly each time. We get a lot of details right, but when our memories change, we only “hear” the most recent version of the message, and we may assume that what we believe now is what we always believed. Studies find that even our “flashbulb memories” of emotionally charged events can be distorted and inaccurate, but we cling to them with the greatest of confidence.""
and hear is a study on how leading questions effect our memories:
https://www.ukessays.com/essays/psychology/leading-questions-and-the-eyewitness-report-psychology-essay.php
So, don't worry too much on it. just try to be accurate. and know that memories are fallible."
4695,isfj,"Yep, I do exactly this. I’ll have a disagreement at work, and then go over it and all it’s possibilities and escalations in my mind for 2-3 days before I can finally stop “processing” it. It’s kinda ridiculous"
4696,isfj,"i took the test with some of my colleagues at work today and while all of them had strong personality types (ENTJ, ENFP etc), i got ISFJ and i was considered the 'boring' one. i admit it bothered me more than i would want it to. i thought music would be a good distraction from thinking over the same thing again and again. i listen to piano pieces and OSTs a lot and while i listened to many after that convo, one particular OST just made me feel me. i felt like an ISFJ and it felt beautiful. its from Slumdog Millionaire - Latika's Theme. i'd love to know if some of you feel that way when you listen to a song. f you do, i'd be so happy to listen to it! listen to the song i mentioned and if you feel like i do, then man, that would be so cool. "
4697,isfj,"Don't trust this belief ISFJ's are boring. We are quiet and don't like to draw attention to us, but that is because we are humble and very observative of our surroundings, besides being very good listeners. So everyone has pros and cons. I love thievery corporation music, and specially a song called ""Until the morning"". I think it makes me feel ""me"" as you describe. "
4698,isfj,"Hmm. boring or not is all about perspective.. :)
​
I love music too. I'm like you, I feel most like myself and almost in a safe happy bubble while I'm listening to music.. the music I listen to is a little different from my peers as well.. and yes, like you I love listening to piano pieces, OSTs(film/anime) too ! i love Latika's theme as well :D it makes me feel so warm, emotional, somehow nostalgic like a mother's calm loving hum for her child? ...now that I think about it, it is indeed very ISFJ-ish hehe.. :)"
4699,isfj,this is so funny but my coworker recommended the same song to me earlier this week when i showed him the kind of music i enjoyed. i hadn't heard of this band until then. i listened to it and totally dig it. 
4700,isfj,"that's exactly how i feel when i listen to latika's theme! and i agree, it's very ISFJ like. i'm so glad you feel the same way :D
what anime music do you listen to? here's one of my fav: https://youtu.be/lL2mNLukkBI - the feels are REAL. "
4701,isfj,"wow loved this :D ..never watched Naruto but saved this piece, loved it especially towards the end.. 
As for me, I haven't watched many anime series - I listen to Studio Ghibli music - the compilations for studying/relaxation - piano, flute ones and original songs(Country Roads, ending theme of Only Yesterday, Ponyo song, Warabe Uta). And some other OSTs from anime, here's a few I feel really resonate deep within me - Prince of Key, Chiyoko's theme,  Girl in Byakkoya, Honey Cardcaptor Sakura, Hinageshi - Ranma, Clannad - Town, Flow of Time, People, City Hunter - Ai yo kienade (I'm into old Jap pop :D ) ..and other OSTs like Ghost in the Shell, Akira.

4702,isfj,"An ENTP friend sent me here. I am new to this stuff and she has helped me immensely. I am a 34 year old male from Melbourne, Australia. Just want to see if anyone can relate to this and if so feel free to contact me. I need to be able to manage this better. 
I have had a rough life. I had to go through school with my younger brother and constantly got told how he is better than me. I never had any friends and was a loner. I was always picked on. I attempted suicide a couple of times because of this. 
After school I made some horrible decisions. Bad ones in fact that I am ashamed of. I did stuff which I probably haven't forgiven myself for and thus think I am a terrible person despite people saying I am a good person who just made bad decisions. I know I'm a good person, but I can't help but feel I'm a bad person. 
The last couple of years I have been getting over that and working to put myself in a good spot, and I have, but there's a problem. I'm still alone.
Over the years I have had some good friends and we have drifted apart due to location and other things. One thing that has always remained is I am so caring and nice to people. I always want to help people out as much as I can. I am a good listener and want to be here for close friends that they can depend on me for support and advice without judgement or fear. I mostly put people's needs above my own and willing to help anyone. I I hurt someone that wronged me then depending on what it was, I may or may not feel bad about those actions. 
I am a confidence person. If I gain confidence I am such a good person to be around. But when I have no confidence I am a mess.
I am in a great job and I am a hard worker. I am a desktop publisher. My previous job I was basically the face of the company. Clients would always come to me instead of my bosses and I would help them out. I would put in so much effort that I never asked for anything or appreciation but I was never appreciated and wanted to be deep down. 
Past relationships with girls haven't been good. The types of girls that have been attracted to me used me deeply. I have been cheated on and used and the mother of a previous girlfriend kept telling her that I am not worth it and she can do better than me. So my confidence levels when it has come to that side of things has been shot. Problem is some times I think she was/is right. I will get to that later. 
As I have struggled to maintain friendships I am alone and feel like shit when people don't talk to me. So therefore I come across as so needy. I try to reach out to friends but when they don't respond or want to catch up I feel like I am not special. Therefore I need massive assurance and if I don't get it I struggle. 
I am making a lot of good changes in my life but the same thing remains. I am lonely. I am so fucking used to being lonely that I start to think I am going to be this way forever. 
I had a major high speed car accident when I was 20 and I walked away unscathed so I know I am here for a reason so that's why I always fight and never give up. I'm so resilient. 
I am told I am awesome and such a good guy and that people would be lucky to have me as a friend or boyfriend yet here I am alone and can't hold friendships so I wonder to myself are they just saying that to make me feel better? If it were true then why don't I have people in my life that want to hang with me or understand me. It's because they don't understand me. 
That's where this ENTP friend comes into play. She understands me and wants me to vent if it helps me but I don't want our friendship to become just that. I haven't met anyone that understands me so it's good talking to her but here is a problem. I can't help but feel it's going to be a matter of time until she grows cold of me and ditches me like everyone else has and that's the problem I have when it comes to new friendships. I am a massive overthinker and dwell on the past. I mean her no disrespect and even though I know she understands me I can't help but feel that way you know? She thinks I am great but I can't help but feel she is going to run 100 miles away. I feel a bond with her that I want to keep but am scared. 
That is where confidence comes in. If I can have a good friend and them not abandon me then I will get confidence back that I can have friendships. Likewise a relationship with someone. Despite past shit I am willing to put myself out there again but most girls would get turned off with me. If I was in a relationship with someone and it didn't work out and ended on good terms I would have confidence for the future. 
Anyway I can't keep relying on this friend because even though she has helped me a lot I want our friendship to be based on more. I want it to be genuine and we can talk about lots of different stuff, which we have shown we can do as we have a lot in common, but lately it's just been me venting. 
That is why I'm opening myself up here to see if anyone can relate to this and what they did to get over these heightened feelings I have.
No one has spoken to me in well over 24 hours apart from work colleagues and I am here feeling so crap. I have tried to talk to people but they haven't shown interest. All I need is someone to check in and see how I'm going etc. I don't need a conversation. I just need to be shown appreciation and love every now and then but no one can really provide it. I know they are busy or need time to themselves particularly the latter with this ENTP friend and I told her she can talk to me whenever she wants so I understand that, but I cant help but be fearful maybe she has gone cold when she doesn't and doesn't like me anymore. Basically I am so used to being lonely I can go days without talking to anyone and I feel like I'm going to be lonely the rest of my life. I need to be able to get rid of these feelings of self doubt so I can improve friendships. I need to improve friendships. I'm always looking to improve myself where I can. 
Don't get me wrong. I am happy with half of my life. I am just way too much of an overthinker.
Sorry for the long post. Just wanted to share my story and see if anyone out there feels the same. We can all benefit from each other. "
4703,isfj,"I’m sorry to hear that, are you seeing a therapist? It seems like you have a lot of issues from the past, and it might be helpful to talk through it with someone.
As for the depression, I can definitely relate. I had some issues with that back in high school. It can be tough to get through, and I ended up seeking professional help for it. Best of luck to you. "
4704,isfj,"Re: ENTP person
If she is sticking around, she likes you, ENTPs generally avoid anyone who doesn't stimulate their brains and you although will be tiring her, she will probably appreciate a challenge for her to help solve. It took me a while to learn this when I was dating one. It sounds like she, like most other ENTPs, are much better with advice rather than comforting. They don't need much comforting themselves so they struggle to reciprocate. 
Don't worry too much about trying to move past the venting to her. ENTPs are great talkers and listeners. If she wants to talk, she'll talk, no question.
Re: The rest
You've gone through hell my friend. Seriously see a therapist, they help you break down your overthinking into more manageable segments to try deal with. "
4705,isfj,Fellow ISFJ here. If you're struggling with loneliness you should stop to put yourself into perspective. Remember ... you are naturally inclined to introversion so I think part of the issue is learning to embrace and accept that you are ok and even better off alone. Once you come to accept and enjoy that inner core that makes you you then you are safe to explore friendships. We try to always wait for the perfect time or the perfect event to launch into something and perfect never happens. Hard lesson learned over time. We lack patience.
4706,isfj,"I'm not after my ENTP friend to comfort me. I know she wont be able to do that. Just advice, encouragement, lending an ear etc like she us doing at the moment. Im not really looking for someone to comfort me too. I just wanted to see if anyone out there can relate to this and offer advice. "
4707,isfj,"in light of the recent passing of Jonghyun (a kpop idol), my friends and i were distraught about the news. we're not totally fans but we empathize with his situation and are saddened with he probably have been through. anyway, i know my friends are still super sad about it and can hardly listen to his songs or anything related to him. but for me, i just cried myself to sleep that first night and then the next day i just can't cry anymore. and it still hurts whenever i remember what happened.
now i know everyone has their own way of coping (stages of grief, etc) but for me i hate crying. i feel like i would be a burden to other people if they see me crying. so i'd rather be their shoulder to cry on and cry by myself when i get some alone time.  or maybe distance myself from my sadness. but as it is, i can only count a few times when i've cried for myself. it's like i'm more welcoming of other people's pain than entertain my own which i think is not healthy. is this normal? although it's also occurred to me that i'm probably just depressed.
thoughts?"
4708,isfj,"I pretty much only cry for myself, but I always do it privately. I can only think of a few times I've cried in front of another person, and even when it's someone I love and trust I still find it humiliating and it makes me feel bad about doing that to the other person. 
Overall I tend not to cry very much, though. Sometimes I'll have bouts where I cry 3 times in a week, other times I'll go 6 months without so much as a sniffle. I'm bad at grieving though, honestly. I have trouble giving myself permission to feel those things, and I tend to propel myself away from emotions like sadness and mourning. It kinda messes me up worse than just being sad would, but I feel like I don't know how to feel those things properly sometimes. Like I know I'm avoiding them, but I'm terrified of what would happen if I just let them hit me and there's an instinctive drive to avoid them. 
So yeah, my ""mourning"" tends to be brief and private. Partly because I don't wanna burden others, partly because I don't really know what to do aside from bury the feeling and move on as fast as I can. "
4709,isfj,"This is exactly how I respond to grief too. When my grandfather died, I told myself that it was my responsibility to be the emotional support shoulder for my family to lean on, and that I could not allow myself to cry in front of them. I just bottled up the grief until I could let it out away from everyone else.
I doubt that this is a healtly way to respond to grief, but I do it nonetheless."
4710,isfj,"When my brother died in October I knew I would have time to grieve my own way, but I knew my family needed my support more than I needed to immediately grieve. I’ve always been like this. When something major happens my personal emotions shut down and I become a support pillar for whoever needs it. "
4711,isfj,"I cry easily, but I am more relieved when I cry alone. I also don't want to bother or worry anyone. When I saw my dad almost die four years ago, I was very distressed but I would say I managed the situation the best I could, and I know I did it that way for my younger sister, who was also at home but sleeping. Through his though months of recovery, even if I wanted to cry everyday I would do it in private (or with my SO presence at most). I took most of the weight in my shoulders to relief my sister of the burden, I visited my dad in the rehabilitation center almost everyday even if he was +1h away from my home and I had to go to classes, study for exams, etc. I didn't like to imagine him alone surrounded by other damaged people, it was a very depressing picture.
ISFJs are very protective of their loved ones and because of that, even in tough situations, we don't want to add more discomfort or worries. I would say in this kind of scenarios we may appear as one of the toughest types even if we are breaking apart inside. "
4712,isfj,"I don't cry at easily, and when I do it's always by myself. I don't like others seeing that vulnerable side of me. I do like to be that pillar as you mentioned always there to hear their grief and be by their side. "
4713,isfj,"I just let myself cry and trust that I will be ok. I find my emotions humiliating and have found there is no one, and I mean no one, who could make me feel better when I’m grieving than if I just processed it alone. Often I research advice though, find some mantras and distractions."
4714,isfj,"As an ESFJ married to an ISFJ, I just read this to my husband and insinuated it sounds just like him.  He said ""I don't know what you're talking about.""  So thank you for showing me he's not alone in his way of grieving."
4715,isfj,"I have a few good friends who are all ISFJs. 
As a virtual robot I have no idea what I did to deserve this, but please, may I have some practical tips on how to be a good friend to these people?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the thoughtful responses! "
4716,isfj,"we like genuine nice. genuine alone is okay but can cause some problems. nice alone can also be problematic because we prefer authenticity. but to have both is to put you right into our love zone.
also we understand each other through emotions and emotional motivators, so get that about us. and feel free to admit being crappy at it. admitting flaw is genuine and giving that warning is thoughtful and nice.
oh yeah, we like thoughtfulness. your form of thoughtfulness will differ from ours but if you explain it we'll be cool with it.
our thoughtfulness will be a lot about the effort put into something. intj's thoughtfulness i think has a lot more to do with results."
4717,isfj,"Really old post but here goes:
Don't expect me to have a plan. I got the first steps down and now I'm just gonna see what happens (unless I'm uncomfortable, which then I have more of a plan and will be oddly stressed).
Personally; ""physics"" is magic and I respect science and love chemistry, but whatever this doesn't work in my head (more the crazy theory and math stuff, its too abstract, if that's possible). Neither does math for me. 
I make up new words a lot.
I want you to open up to me.  I'm looking for any indication that something is wrong and its gonna bug me if something is and that I don't know and I can't at least be an ear for it.  But, if you don't want to talk about it that's okay too; just acknowledge that I know something is up and that I was right about it and just say you don't wanna talk about it.  I can understand not wanting to tell people how I feel."
4718,isfj,"As an ISFJ, I find myself genuinely believing that people mean well.  In other words, it's a massive surprise when someone does/says something scathing or uncouth.  It's partially the way I was raised.  Nobody in my family treats each other with any form of disrespect, so we all have to go out of our ways to express disappointment or hardship.
Think about that habit, and how it develops in a competitive world.  People do and say stuff all the time, and I've spent my life practicing responding to those scenarios tenfold.  If someone is honest, but rude or catty, the average ISFJ will respond by bottling it up for later, or exploding all over you.
The best way to get on perfect terms with an ISFJ is to engage in a non-competitive hobby with one.  Help an ISFJ cook a killer meal, make music, etc. and you just won a friend for life.  Most ISFJs bore of studies, and thusly of competitive activities (e.g.  video games, sports, the sciences).  If you take your analytical perspective and generally competitive nature into a non-competitive hobby (diagram cooking spices/techniques, come up with bad-ass ideas for that one friend who crochets), then you will find yourself enjoying the input as well as your friend(s).
Also, most ISFJs will subtly try to pull you into these sorts of things, but ISFJs don't wear their emotions on the outside like ESFJs, so just roll with it and try to catch onto the subtle hints."
4719,isfj,"More or less this.
It's very clear when I'm being ""played"" when somebody is telling me what I want to hear or because they think they've made a mistake of some kind.  What's unfortunate is many immature ISFJ's know they are being ""played"" and continue the game, simply for the sake of avoiding conflict.  
Be wary of anybody that might feel the need to keep you ""on call"" for their own needs, emotional or not.
Genuine interest is incredibly powerful, and surprisingly rare.
Edit - The same for people who cyclically keep you at arm's length."
4720,isfj,"INTJ here. My mother is ISFJ and I think you hit the nail on the head.  It's not that we can't get along, in fact my mother is one of my best friends.  I find communication is key.  The why seems to be very important to ISFJ's in my somewhat limited experience."
4721,isfj,"Whenever my SO talks about something he wants, I add it to a list in the Notes app on my phone. Later, I'll go through and decide if it's a) something he would actually use and b) which would invoke the happiest/most surprised reaction from him. Sometimes I'll even get him something slightly different than what he asked for if I know it will make him happy."
4722,isfj,"I hate buying gifts for anyone because I never know what they really want or need. And I hate asking them what they want because it shows that I don't known.
I hate buying something random just for the sake of giving something. It takes me forever to decide on something and then when I finally do pick out something I continue to second guess my decision. Ugh.
I've made an effort to listen carefully to the tiniest clues from my SO and when I hear one I, too, list it on the Notes app on my phone. "
4723,isfj,"I list their hobbies, and then try to think of something related to each hobby that they would like and don't already have.  Then research each thing to see how much it costs, whether people who have it like it, etc.  It's a pretty exhausting process, but it works!"
4724,isfj,"Remembering little things about them - esp. friends.  Helps if your friends have blogs or talk to you a lot about things you're not necessarily mutually interested in - favorite authors, favorite hobbies, etc. are goldmines of information!  On the flipside, I only buy presents for friends if I'm absolutely sure they'd appreciate it at least somewhat/it would be relevant to their lives."
4725,isfj,"From my experience can ENFPs can be some of the most excitable people to hang out with (positive energy) but sometimes can be the most exhausting in large doses.
I've had a few ENFPs Ive been really close with at one point or another but somewhere along the way due to different interests or something we all kinda just stopped talking.
That said its cool that it was cool the ones I made had similar interests to me."
4726,isfj,"My best friend is an ENFP!! She's absolutely phenomenal  and my absolute favorite person even though we've drifted a bit since she moved away for college about 4 years ago. She's so enthusiastic and thoughtful and kind, and so smart and funny and generally wonderful. I love her with my whole heart and we get along great even though we're really, really different people. 
She can make me feel so genuinely and completely loved and she doesn't expect me to be anything I'm not even when I feel like a terrible, undeserving friend. It's always a little shocking how happy she is to see me and that she reciprocates my feelings, but I can't doubt her. I really struggle with guilt and feeling like I'm a failure, especially when it comes to friends, but she's one of few people in the world who can really make me feel like I'm enough just the way I am and it means so much to me. I think I need to go text her and tell her how much I love her now! "
4727,isfj,"My brother-in-law is an ENFP and I love him to pieces. He's charismatic and outgoing and I admired him long before my sister married him. 
In general I find them really charming and I don't know too many but I love them. 
( keep doing these discussion topics! )"
4728,isfj,"One of my closest friends is an ENFP. Now, that I think of it, he seems to be the only extrovert in my small circle of friends. I like how he always has a story to tell, and the natural way he tells it - I really wish I could mingle so naturally in group discussions like he does. We share a similar sense of foolish humour - we love small stupid or weird things (I guess this is the Ne clicking).
Another thing I like about him is the way he brings together people from different circles. Five or six years ago I had almost no friends. I knew him from high school (we weren't even so close back then) and one day he invited me to have a drink with former hs colleagues. Naturally I would have said 'no' and stayed in my comfort zone. I said 'why not' instead and it was probably the best decision I made in the last five years. Through him I got back in touch with a former friend (INTJ) and I met one of my best and closest friends (INTP).
On the other side, he seems to have an alcohol problem - he's a heavy drinker and I am really not into it. He also has some issues from his troubled childhood and sometimes projects a negative energy around him. He complains about sometimes mundane stuff and I always feel drained/exhausted after he does this. Despite this, he's an interesting man and I enjoy his company."
4729,isfj,"I don’t think taking a test to determine your type is the best way to decide what type you are. Maybe provide a description of yourself, particularly, your thinking process, how you interact with others, your work habits, and how you act when you’re stressed. From there maybe we can figure out which type fits you :) "
4730,isfj,"I totally forgot your reply. Im sorry. Would you still be willing to type me based on: "" a description of yourself, particularly, your thinking process, how you interact with others, your work habits, and how you act when you’re stressed. ""? "
4731,isfj,"Hi all! So I met an ISFJ through a dating app, and I'm having a good time talking to her over text. Over the course of our conversations, she told me how she hates the idea of saying we met on a dating app to be the story of how we met, being a hopeless romantic. I've suggested that this hurdle can be surmounted by making the first meeting in person the substitute for the ""how we met"" story, and she concurred, though she added that it would have to be pretty memorable. So basically what I'm asking is, what would be the best ways to make a good impression on an ISFJ on the first date/get together? And on a more general scale, what does are the things that an ISFJ would most appreciate in a relationship? 
Addendum: I've tested as a ISFP when it comes to how I process information by default, but often exhibit ISTP traits in action, so I'm wondering how this may affect our dynamic in the long term if we start going out. Thanks for the feedback ahead of time!"
4732,isfj,"i'd pretend to be a stranger when you two ""bump"" into each other for the first time. you know? i'd like, playfully make it like you two just met and are clicking right off the bat.
other than that, iono, with dating advice, most of the time i say ""be open, be honest, and see where it goes"". the open and honest thing is what we isfj love."
4733,isfj,Surprise her with something that goes along with her personality or something she likes. I mentioned I was a vegetarian through our prior conversations and on our first date my now BF had ordered vegetarian nachos as an appetizer prior to my arrival. It meant a lot that he listened to our conversations.
4734,isfj,"I would guess it’s important to her that your “ meet cute” story aligns with the narrative in her head about her own life, so it may involve a hobby you two share, a chance encounter at a cool social gathering or place that means something to both of you"
4735,isfj,I hate being an ISFJ. I hate being such a pushover. I hate holding in my emotions. I hate having such powerful emotions. I hate my emotions in general. I hate how possessive I am. I hate being so aware of other’s feelings. I hate caring about people who don’t care as much for me. I hate worrying about what others think of me. I hate being so nice. I have that I have a “good heart.” I hate my very existence. I hate being alive in this world. I hate wasting people’s time and resources even acknowledging me. I wish I was a robot that could turn off and on when needed. I wish I didn’t have to think. I wish I could just do without any semblance of free will or choice. I wish I didn’t exist. I wish I were dead. 
4736,isfj,"I relate to this a lot. It took me a long time to accept the things that were part of my personality because I didn't like them. I don't like how mellow I am, soft, shy, boring, bad at conversation and making friends, etc. At least reading them here made me see them more as positive qualities than negative.
I think it's normal. We all want to be someone else."
4737,isfj,"(I realise that you probably just want to vent, and not looking for advice. But you posted it on reddit, so fuck that)
​
ENTP here. Pretty much your exact opposite in function and thought. Not a pushover. Not having powerful emotions. Not very aware of other people's feelings. Not caring at al for those who do not care for me. Not worrying about how others think of me. Not a very nice person. Not a very 'good heart'. Love my existence. Love being alive in this world. I would kill myself without free will or choice. Would like to stop thinking once in a while though.
​
It's not pleasant although it seems so. The things you list, the qualities you have and I lack are handicaps for me. I've often been blindsided because I wasn't ware of how people felt, hurting people when I really should not have or did not intend to. I'm in a relationship with an ISFJ and she's an absolute inspiration. She makes me want to be a good person, she made me realise that I actually am. I just don't show it. Probably afraid to show weakness. It is not weakness. It's takes honest to god courage to be sensitive in this hard as nails world. I get it, I really really do. It would be a blessing if you could turn those things off for a moment and breathe but you should realise that they are gifts, not curses. And we all have curses. Love yourself. Being an ISFJ is a fucking thing of beauty. Realise that the world does not need you to bear its burden, but we need you to be an inspiration to be good, to act good. I feel truly bad about myself hearing some of the stuff my partner considers or acts upon, not having has the slightest thought of such myself. She reminds me to be good. 
​
Again. Love yourself. Even just a little. You're not just an ISFJ. Your type is only a descriptor. Other people are not you. Chances are you worrying about that thing you said or that thing you did — everyone else has long forgotten. People don't think about you nearly as much as you might feel. Enjoy those that do. Allow yourself to feel. Don't fight. Experience your emotions. Cherish them. If you're an ISFJ chances are that everybody loves you. Except you. Work on that and you'll be invincible. . 
​
​"
4738,isfj,"Are you me? I feel like I could have written this at certain points in my life. I am thankfully no longer feeling this way all the time, and it took years to change my point of view about being an ISFJ. I am a nurse and a caregiver in my family. I burnt myself out two years ago and realized just how much I needed to work on growing a spine and having a voice. I had neglected to take care of myself for years, putting others' needs first. I was in full martyr mode and a lot of my work was thankless. I never took credit for my achievements either. I was crying every day and feeling empty and sad at my lowest point. After a breakdownI had to reach out for counselling (my first wasn't a good fit and it took a lot of energy to muster up the courage to see another counsellor instead). I even paid out of pocket for EMDR therapy to help process old painful memories that were possibly the root cause of my low self-esteem and lack of assertiveness. It made me work through life events I went through and helped me grieve that pain and process it. I had to work on my self-care, one step at a time. I started to bullet journal to help clear my mind and help me organize my life - one of my great strength as I love organizing! I started making myself warm healthy meals instead of living on protein bars and coffee. I made sure I got enough sleep. I started saying  no when I didn't want to do something. I discovered my ""love language"" so I could bond more with my husband, who is my #1 support.  I prioritized my important relationships and cut the garbage people out- I owe them nothing. I started taking better care of my home and filling my windowsills with house plants and surrounding myself with animals. Counselling and journaling helped me realize how much I love caring for things and how easy it is to take care of something you truly love.  There is beauty and love around me, and I can work with my strength for caring to improve my quality of life. "
4739,isfj,"This is really relatable: my wife is ISFJ and feels this way exactly. A few things that help her some times:


The title ISFJ is ""just"" a title. You can't blame it for doing you wrong, neither can it help you accepting who you are or dictate what you should feel. What it can do is help you to get the best out of yourself.


Your emotions are allowed. Our culture is shaming emotions like they're caves, dark and dangerous and therefore forbidden. Emotions are actually tunnels. In order to process them you have to walk through the darkness, but there is light at the end. The book ""come as you are"" by Emily Nagoski helped me realize that (the book seems to be about something merely different but it's actually a very good psychological approach to feeling and thinking in general).


Whenever you are anxious about reactions from other people on your actions, imagine the other doing that to you: how would you feel? Chances are they feel the same. 

"
4740,isfj,"Don't worry, my dear. With time, you will learn to love yourself and accept that your strengths and weaknesses both make you who you are. And as long as you always try to be a good person, everything else is just bridge under the water.
​
You will also learn to guard yourself more and learn how to deal with the intensity and other facets of your personality. You will find  good people who will appreciate you and who will not hurt you - but there will always be people trying to take advantage of you as well. That will never change but you will learn to deal with it.
​
It will all get better with time.
​
In the meantime, if you intensely feel like nothing is working or that nothing will get better, it is completely okay to reach out and ask for help."
4741,isfj,"Uhhh you described 15 year old me(now 26). Being a quality human is separate from personality types. Something isfj's refuse to understand is that the world cannot be helped or fixed. You have to accept it for what it is. 
Dont take shit from anyone. Dont let people talk down to you. Just because they are so and so with this title, doesnt mean jack shit. You dish respect out as you see fit. If someone doesnt respect you, dont allow them in your lives at all. 
Learn to love and respect yourself or else no one will."
4742,isfj,"When you hurt everything about you seems wrong.
But there isn’t anything wrong with you. All those things you listed are all positive, I’m an INTJ. And it’s the reason why I’m subscribed to this subreddit. 
Those qualities are all intensely wonderful and pleasant additions to the world. I like to sit here and read on how you guys “feel” about the world and how much you love and care for others.
I don’t look at the world like that, my world lens is more of a “think” then “feel”. But I’m envious that you guys do. And it’s a reassurance, at least to me personally, that there’s humans out in the world like that. 
At least from me, I am happy there are people who look at the world the way you do. Thank you"
4743,isfj,"been there. you don't hate all of that. those are the things that powers you, and it can get overwhelming.
this a phase you will go through every now and then. and it'll pass.
believe me, people cares about you. its hard to see that when you're like this. 
you will be alright."
4744,isfj,"Isfjs are so amazing, some of the kindest most giving people. Just need to make sure you are also kind and give to yourself too ♥️ make sure you talk about your feelings too, I think it can really help! Hope you feel better soon xx"
4745,isfj,I feel you and have had days where I didn't want to be an ISFJ but there's no point in being someone else. I'm sure every personality has days where they wish they were a different personality. My advice is to love yourself and realize you have strengths that other personalities wish they had and instead of using your personality as an excuse to not get better that you take your strengths as an ISFJ and try to be the best version of an ISFJ you can be. I know one problem we can have is that we can be perfectionists and beat ourselves up. I will say that we need to move from superficially developing Fe and truly developing Fe to be a well rounded ISFJ and the teritary and inferior functions will follow naturally. These two resources helped me with this https://mbti-notes.tumblr.com/theory and https://personalityhacker.com/podcast-episode-0229-developing-feeling-as-a-co-pilot-ixfj-exfp-types/.

4746,isfj,"As an ENTP with a similar opinion of my personality, I think sometimes the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Sorry you're going through a tough time, go listen to some Alan Watts."
4747,isfj,This thoughts are with me for a lot of time. But I live with this. Sometimes my mood is fantastic but sometimes I want to be dead or something else. I think this normal on our personality. I'm learning how to live with our weaknesses and I tell you it's possible! Our empathy and helpfulness is important and we must use it to make relationships. Also on relationships helpful is having someone who likes people and easily get new friends; with this person you have better start in some situations.
4748,isfj,"Well communication is quite an issue, especially between an isfj and intp (my gf and me) so thats definetly something all of you have to work on but we do to. 
I don't want to be anyone else, just learn to be the best version of yourself you can be."
4749,isfj,"The grass is always greener on the other side. ;) Really, though - today's world is all about striving to be, well, different. A better version of yourself. And a lot of the qualities that society seems to value today are things like extrovertedness, willingness to get ahead at all costs, adaptability to change... and wanting to travel!
​
(RANT: My God, I mostly hate travelling. I like seeing new places but I hate literally everything else about it because travelling is just CONSTANT change. But there's, like, this sense that you're ""weird"" if you don't have this urge/desire to go backpacking across Europe... like you're just a corporate drone like everyone else. Like, no, I just like my house and my cat and my three close friends and the familiar city I live in??? If I want to get out of town, I can just drive three hours to my parents' house or go camping in the summer.)
​
cough Aaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyways... So I used to hate myself a lot, but not anymore. I've learned to like, and some days even love, myself and my personality. I used to be really bad at communication and it ran me into all sorts of embarrassing conflicts that would get me into trouble with others and make me feel like I was OH MY GOD THE WORST PERSON EVER. Add to that the fact that I was unmedicated for anxiety, and... hoo boy, was I ever a mess. I was even suicidal at some point, although thankfully I am very far away from those days now... Let me tell you, is it ever hard to manage life when you're having constant mood swings and extreme emotions. I still have mood swings and stuff, obviously, but instead of being like extremely steep peaks and valleys now it's more like gentle waves on a river. I used to take things extremely personally, which didn't help, but I think part of the problem was that I didn't set appropriate boundaries with people so I allowed them to make fun of me, in a way. Like, they didn't mean to, but... yeah. Hard to explain.
​
What the hell is my point here? Oh, yeah. Anyways. There is a LOT to love about being an ISFJ, we just have to work on setting boundaries. Some random advice:


If you don't feel you can comfortably set boundaries with your friends, attempt to open the lines of communication. Most people are reasonable. If they react badly to you trying to establish boundaries (""hey I know you don't like electronic music, but can you please stop making fun of me for it?"" <- something I should have said ages ago and which also got me into trouble when I blew up on people), then they're not worth it.


Have higher standards for your friendships. We have the tendency to attract clingers-on who can't find any other friends because we are just too nice, usually because we were that person at some point and we know what it feels like to be left out.


Try not to keep tabs obsessively, but if you notice you do a lot more for friends than they do for you, attempt to equalize that OR stop doing as much for them. If you don't want to talk to them about it, the latter option is usually a pretty good way.


Learn how to set boundaries. ""Hey, want to hang out?"" (When you've literally hung out every single night that week and you need some time to yourself.) ""No thanks, I need to do X."" (doesn't always work) or ""Nah, I'm not feeling well."" and leave it at that.


​
Also, the things OP mentioned (paging u/Orchestrafanboy19):
If your emotions are overwhelming you, I'd honestly go see a doctor and see if maybe you have anxiety or depression or something like that. I take meds, but you don't have to - therapy and such is also an option. Granted, I currently can't afford therapy, sooooo there's that lol.
Powerful emotions can be good, though! Once you learn to listen to them, they can often tell you a lot about your life. Are you happy? Are you not? Do you need to make a change? Powerful emotions also gives you the capacity to care very deeply for people, which is a good thing often.
This can be both a good thing and a bad thing. I'm possessive over my friends and my cat because I don't want to see them get hurt. You just have to figure out when to rein it in. I broke up with my most recent ex because he couldn't control his possessiveness towards me, but we're still best friends and he's working on it.
Again - this is a good thing! It can give us insights into situations that others lack. For example, someone reacts strangely... Our Fe and our Si can oftentimes put together the pieces of the puzzle and start to figure out what's wrong. Sometimes our friends don't even know what's wrong, and we can help to figure that out.
A sadly necessary trait. But you can learn how to harness that power.
Honestly, a good heart and being nice are some of our greatest strengths out in the world. I volunteer, for example, because I love helping people and animals.
​
A lot of it is just learning how to harness your traits, and how to look at them in a positive way. That's admittedly VERY difficult (see: I used to be suicidal), but it's something worth looking towards. And, if you have trouble, there's other ISFJs here that can help you with it. :)"
4750,isfj,"I certainly can’t claim to speak for every ISFJ woman. However, I don’t really like clutter and having extra “things”. I much prefer an experience to a physical gift. For example, my husband and decided to do a date night to a special restaurant as our gifts to each other this year.
Not sure if this would be your wife’s sort of thing at all, but it’s an idea! "
4751,isfj,"I'll speak for myself, what I'd want from my husband? :)
I want you! Your silent presence, a hug and a kiss and quality time with me. If it was possible, a long hug for 24 hours!!
​
Other than that, take care of yourself. You'll stress an ISFJ out if you (our beloved) don't take care of yourself. (we love taking care of others, but still, we can only do so much, it ultimately depends on how an individual looks after themselves, in my experience, as the saying goes - You can lead a horse to the pond, but cannot force water down it's throat). Have a sense of responsibility to your 'home' and yourself. 
​
What's your type??"
4752,isfj,"I’m very practical. I like things I use more than things to look at. Things for the kitchen, my hobbies, or to make my life as a mom easier. (A roomba! But some women would be really bothered to get a cleaning tool as a gift, so fair warning) "
4753,isfj,"It would be best if you knew her love language! But i think something sentimental and meaningful would work for us, something that shows that you were really listening and observing. Thoughtfulness is the most precious gift"
4754,isfj,"I think you know your wife best :) can you give more insight as to whether she is more into material goods or experiences? Agreed with the posts here, experiences "
4755,isfj,"It's been said by others - something practical. Or a dinner (or a weekend trip) without kids. As an example - our dehumidifier broke down a few weeks ago - so what did I want or my birthday? A new one! :) If he had rather given me a perfume or a necklace I would have been disappointed...  
This being said: my love language is not gifts.. (As you can probably guess...) 
EDIT: Ah.. just realized it's your mother.. So a romantic weekend away is out of the question.. haha. But a dinner or something practical is still an option. "
4756,isfj,"I’ll speak for myself as an ISFJ man. I’m not interested in getting material gifts unless it’s something expensive that I’ve been wanting to get for myself but don’t have the money to do so. But mostly we just want quality time with our partners so a surprise adventure somewhere that she’s been wanting to go to might be a good idea. Also if you’re looking for a cheaper option, maybe giving her “coupons” for a personal spa treatment from you I think will make her happy specially after those long days. "
4757,isfj,"Something sentimental. We are a sucker for things like that. We are also super nostalgic. 
Get us something special that made you think of us. Or something that reminds me of a special time in the past. Or something that symbolizes your  relationship with her and how much she means to you. "
4758,isfj,"We have a deebot and let me tell you.... It's an amazing invention for owners of shedding dogs.  She's totally practical (as most of the suggestions here agree with) and she wouldn't take offense to that.  She also doesn't mind playing the traditional (dare I say vintage) role of mother / wife.
Thanks for your suggestion."
4759,isfj,"I read that estp's are supposed to be our ""best friend"".  My best friend is an estp and I'd like to elaborate on the friendship we have.  But first I'd like to see if anyone else had some experiences to share."
4760,isfj,In the beginnings of a relationship with an ISFJ and they always willing to come to anything I invite them to and seem to like me a lot when we spend time alone. But while we are at work together they don’t initiate much and kinda keep to themselves. Again if I initiate they seem willing to go along with whatever. And they also never text me first and havnt invited me out. Although a date that we have planned next week they said they wanted to plan.i Havnt given them much time to invite me out to stuff as I invite them out once every 2 days basically. How do I hold off inviting them out without seeming like I am pulling away now that I have done most of the initiating. Will I come off like I don’t care and scare him from inviting me out?
4761,isfj,"Communication. ISFJ's tends to like that others takes the initiate instead of them, and this might just be because they like to be the responding part and they generally like to stay in their comfort zone. If you want them to take more initiative, you need to tell them. 
The next time you guys meet just gently ask; ""just if you want to, maybe you could plan a day for us next time? I would love that. ""
They want to be desired, and they need to know that the other party actually wants them. Because if this is never expressed, ISFJ's always have that self doubt lurking inside them. But if you state that you want them, or want them to do something and that you would appreciate them if they did that, then I think the ISFJ would love to plan a date for you two. "
4762,isfj,Good to know. He is planning our date for Friday. What do you think about the at work stuff? Is this just them focusing on their job? For I can’t stop looking at him and wanting to go talk. When he’s free he’ll come talk to me sometimes but I don’t often catch him looking at me. At home though he seems to like me a lot. 
4763,isfj,What do you think about when I’ll text him and he’ll never respond to a message. It isn’t a question. Sometimes I’ll make a statement and most people will message me back and say something about it. Sometimes he’ll never respond at all. Like he was sleeping and missed it and didn’t feel like It was relevant anymore is my only guess. It’s so series because he 110% into everything when we’re doing stuff together and will pretty much always say yes to anything I ask him to do. It doesn’t seem like the enthusiasm I have for him is reciprocated. Is that something that happens eventually? I unfortunately get bored of a person if it’s not reciprocated eventually. It feels exhausting to have to do all the work. I don’t want to push him to fast but I also know myself and I don’t want to get bored before the relationship is given it’s best chance. 
4764,isfj,"Me too! I always, always have that self doubt in the back of my head. Am I bothering them? Do they really want to talk to me? Maybe I'm interrupting them. Maybe I'm boring. 
Self destructive thoughts, not good."
4765,isfj,"It sounds odd that he doesn't respond to your messages, I would personally always answer if someone sent me a message, question or not. A relationship is something that both parts need to give and take from each other. It sounds to me that you're the one that gives and he just takes. You should not do all the work, man.. talk to him about it and if this keeps up; bro I gotta say you should leave him"
4766,isfj,It’s not really. We’ll have conversations back and fourth where he texts immediately and other times it seems like he’s busy and forgets. I always give people the benefit of the doubt. My biggest issue is I play like everything is all Gucci until I can’t handle it anymore and go from 100 to 0. I hate that about myself. 
4767,isfj,"INFP fella here, recently I met with a ISFJ girl at a 'work place'. She seemed nice although quiet and unwilling, lazy, hard to talk to. After a few days we went to the city together and I finally get her to talk. 
I spoke to her god-mother(not sure if that's a thing but, best I could translate) who is in a very good relationship with her mother, so she knows a lot about her, she told she seems kinda sad, and is unwilling to do stuff - like go out and she doesn't truly have friends to hang out with.
She's been single for all I know (but didn't seem to me she had any attraction towards me). 
(Also not really go out with her either, but still...) 
My question is - should I talk to her about this? Should I go after her, ask her what's really troubling her, or are ISFJ girl like this sometimes and there's nothing I could do about it? Its really troubling me, to see her, so.. So lifeless,... But on the other I have no idea how she'd react,if I'd just go after with such 'accusations'........"
4768,isfj,"In short: don't.
ISFJs are the kind of people who don't like to talk about their problems with people they barely know. I'm not a girl, but it would make me really uncomfortable if someone from work tried to force me out of my shell."
4769,isfj,"I second this. Whether she's an ISFJ or not, it's really inappropriate for you to even bring up her personal problems when you only have a professional relationship with her.
If you found out about her problems via somebody else, it's even worse. People generally don't like to have their  personal struggles shared with the world, ISFJs especially, as we're very private people. It takes a lot for me to even be comfortable talking about my problems with someone I love and know well. 
If someone I barely knew approached me to talk about my problems, which I didn't even know they were aware of, I would be repulsed by them. And I would feel pretty betrayed by my friends/family for telling strangers about my problems in the first place. "
4770,isfj,"Excuse my language,  but the stereotypes of the ISFJ is bullshit.  For example : Doormat,Traditionalist, clingy, serve others, etc... 
I honestly can't stand that. I can only speak for myself.  I'm pretty nice to stranger's and people I care for majority of the time .  But if you start getting on my nerves or disrespectful I will shut your ass down.  Second, I'm not a fan of traditions.  I see no point in it.  Personally,  I'm an atheist , so traditions never done anything for me! Third, being clingy for me is a huge no. I love being around people I care for, but not 24/7. I have my own hobbies. An another pet peeve of my mines is ISFJ are forgiving.  I rarely forgive people.  If you betray my trust or hurt me really bad I will doorslam you forever.  I do believe I am an ISFJ, but I'm an ISFJ who can't stand bullshit and get easily annoy from dumb shit.  Sorry for the grammar guys. What do you guys think about the ISFJ stereotypes? Do you considered yourself the typical ISFJ or something else entirely different from the stereotypes. "
4771,isfj,"I mean, I think there’s some truth to most of them, but not in the ways that people think. 
The traditionalist one especially bugs me. I do have a really special place in my heart for some traditions, but ones that are personally meaningful even when they go against actual “traditional” values. I don’t believe in gender roles, religion, heteronormativity, I’m extremely hesitant to accept most forms of authority, etc etc. I believe in evaluating what works and what doesn’t and finding better solutions no matter how much things have to change. So, I like things that are comforting and familiar and make me feel close to people I love, and in that sense I do like tradition, but in no way am I “a traditionalist.” 
The doormat/“forgiving” thing is also wrong and annoying. I also don’t believe the “doorslam” is exclusively an INFJ thing the way some people talk about it, I absolutely do that too. If I’m done with you/break up with you in some way, romantically or as friends/family, I am absolutely done forever. There will be no second chances, and I may eventually forgive you, but I won’t ever contact you again, because I deserve to respect my own boundaries. I may let people cross them for a time depending on the situation and what benefit I think I’ll get from allowing the transgressions, but it’s generally a calculated risk, not me just having no spine. 
Also, the idea that we’re stupid (because Ni is the only “smart” function, right?? That’s how that works). My Si is a big part of the reason why I am intelligent, and the idea that it’s a useless function that keeps you stuck in the past or only concerned with familiar physical sensations is really aggravating to me. 
I dunno, I just hate that the perception of ISFJs seems to be like, your 50 year old bigoted housewife aunt. We make up a big portion of the population and we have a wide variety of interests, beliefs, and perspectives! "
4772,isfj,i hate that a lot of people seem to type their moms as ISFJ's... they always seem to be so sure that their mother is ISFJ and as a result say they can't get along with other ISFJ's if they don't like their mom
4773,isfj,"I've always wondered if the people who came up with these stereotypes have ever really met an ISFJ, or if it's something they've just theorized and haven't really observed in reality.
These two especially make me scratch my head sometimes.
Traditional - Most of the ISFJs I know are usually down to try new things. My ISFJ husband is usually the one pulling me out of the house to try new experiences funnily enough.
Boring - Out of all types, I find ISFJs the most mysterious and difficult to read. Especially the intelligent ones. Maybe it's because of my inferior Si, or maybe it's because they mask incredibly well with Fe.
No matter how much I talk to them or how long I've known them, I can't predict them. I can pretty much get a read on everyone else, so this makes ISFJs incredibly interesting to me imo."
4774,isfj,"I think stereotype is just that... stereotype. 
I'm also not traditional in the traditional meaning of the word.. (for example, I refuse to follow any religion but I do believe in God) ...infact, I am unconventional in many ways, but kinda traditional in my own way... IDK how to explain lol
After all these years, I have come to a conclusion that the stereotypical descriptions aren't meant to be taken literally, but the stereotype expresses the psyche of the person rather than the trait they possess.
The whole ""bakes cookies"" thing... obviously, not all of us do, but it expresses the kind of care or our way of caring for others = giving warmth, comfort (in tangible ways too, we like to show our care in practical way, not just emotional).
That said, I am forgiving.. very forgiving, I have also been called doormat, but in my eyes I am no doormat and have strong boundaries and individuality - just not in the conventional way of this era.. But it does come off in an ISFJ-ish.. on the outside.
I can stand bullshit.. I have high tolerance level but do not engage in anything bullshitty.. so it looks like I am engaging them but I can tell when something is bullshit, it's just that I cannot bring myself to give voice to such things, unless there are some exceptions ofcourse.. not assertive enough.
Same, love being around people, but need a good amount of time away from the entire world... and so on.
I guess, like I said, stereotype expresses our ISFJ-ishness rather than the trait we literally possess... and also, the way we come across from the outside too.. You may look warm and mild even if you don't forgive and are intolerant to bullshit - because the manifestation of a person's psyche in his persona involves so many variables, than just a single emotion."
4775,isfj,"Going along with what @dee-vee said about XSFJ's being everyone's moms (which doesn't make sense statistically), people also don't realize that basing XSFJ on their mom and older people alone becomes very misleading. As a function, Si is about our subjective past experiences... Mine, as a millennial who basically grew up on the internet, are probably going to be very different from your mother's. Same with younger XSXJ types, many of whom might actually somewhat resemble XNXP's in terms of outlook on life. Just that the method of process is different."
4776,isfj,"It’s hard to accept stereotypes from your own perspective. That is, it’s easier to describe others than oneself because you cannot really do it without bias.
Understand that the stereotype descriptions are relative to the perceiver. To an INTP, for example, we might see anyone who has ANY flaw in reasoning as illogical, so to them everyone is stupid. 
It’s all relative, and give it a chance that the descriptions/stereotypes may be partly true for a majority (not necessarily point cases like you)."
4777,isfj,"I'll  wonder how our personality type will be if we went down a dark path. Since our type is named the ""defender"", I could only imagined us doing some ""interesting"" things if we decided to not be defenders anymore. "
4778,isfj,"I think manipulation is how ISFJ-ness could be used for evil. We're always observing and thinking ahead about how to bring ease and comfort to those we encounter. But that also means we have a next-level awareness about the various dynamics going on. There's a subtle evil that could be switched-on if our motivations were different. And nobody would suspect a thing because of how we blend into the background :). 
Though the very thought of the resulting conflict would probably stop us from getting too far. "
4779,isfj,"I could see us being interesting as villains who are defenders, honestly. Wouldn’t it be a good villain, someone who becomes so twisted in their view of what they must do to protect certain people or even ideals that they’ll do something horrific without even blinking? I like that kind of villain. "
4780,isfj,"I always thought if I was a villain, I’d be a petty bureaucrat. I’d probably prevent the heroes from getting permits by being a stickler and that would force their hand into something illegal and dramatic. Then I would tell on them. 
Or I’d spread rumors about them under the guise of helpfully warning other people to take care of themselves. "
4781,isfj,"Probably the villian would be that sickeningly sweet professor from Harry Potter who pretends to be nice and wants order but secretly hates anyone who defies her
Edit:Found her
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/d/d2/Dolores_umbridge2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/215?cb=20161120214852"
4782,isfj,"Apparently Norman Bates was labelled as an ISFJ. I can see that one.
Some folks also called Narcissa Malfoy and Peter Pettigrew from Harry Potter Isfjs. Peter is a bit iffy for me... he completely back stabbed his best friend for some dark lord. It's possible that's associated with inferior Ne than anything else, but still strange. Narcissa Malfoy makes sense to me. Also I like how she was one of the causes of Voldemort's downfall, and he's an INTJ.
TBH, I can picture an ISFJ villain as very covert. And the motive being protection of someone close to them. Maybe a police officer, someone who has in-depth knowledge of police protocol, trying to protect a spouse who committed a murder. "
4783,isfj,"Firstly, I did say something interesting. Just because you didn't like it doesn't make it uninteresting. Secondly, this is the first time I've ever posted on this sub because because my need for conversation is fulfilled elsewhere. Just because I encourage you to converse doesn't mean I am in need of one. 
Thirdly, have you found a villain yet? In line with the actual thread (I was actually being serious), I can't see you guys as villains. Perhaps if there was a downvote button in real life... we may see some real havoc when someone says something to trigger the Fe. 
What qualities do you have that you think would make a good villain? 
Edit spelling "
4784,isfj,"Let's cut to the chase.  The  villian I pick is Willison Fisk from the television show Daredevil.  The reason why I picked Fisk is because it shows a great example of how a typical ISFJ can go down a dark path and unleashed a wrath on someone who keeps provoking them.  I honestly believe Fisk has a good heart, including intentions for Hell kitchen. But with his tragic upbringing and wanting to be a good person,  it's a matter of time before something snaps inside. "
4785,isfj,"Hello ISFJ people.  
Let's say you start dating someone and it goes well.  Do you need explicit clarification (a talk) that the relationship has progressed to something more serious or do you prefer to just let your interactions say it all?"
4786,isfj,"I definitely need clarification or at least frequent (not overbearing, though) verbal reassurance that things are going well in the first few months. The relationships that have been that way have generally been better. I really like having my mind at ease, and I like knowing that I'm getting back just as much as I'm giving."
4787,isfj,"I am an ISFJ and my bf and I have had a few awkward clarification talks, both about clarifying our relationship, and that I am an introvert, so my need for alone time doesn't mean that I don't like him. 
I need the clarification, or the lack of clarity dominates my internal monologue when I an around him"
4788,isfj,"I can assure you that is most definitely not true, haha.
I, recently in fact, went for the explicit clarification. Very glad that I did so, would recommend the same!
The funny thing as it turns out is she was waiting for that explicit confirmation as much as I was. ;)"
4789,isfj,"So I used to live alone, for almost 7 years.
I've moved in with my now fiancée, it's been a year and a half.
While she's also kind of introverted I don't think she's an isfj, probably more of a infp, I'll have her take the test some day but this is not what this post is about.
She needs her moments too and this makes the relation work great, we have our time apart when needed (like, I'm in the room on my computer, she's in the living room with a book or her laptop, we do our own things).
But last Friday I took a day off (because I was exhausted and it's rather calm at work), didn't do much, even took a nap in the afternoon and played video games a bit.
Her not being at home was a definite plus. It's different if she's in the other room or out of the house completely.
Now I love her and she really is my soulmate, we've been together for almost three years now and everything works and clicks perfectly.
But my mind/body really needs the time alone from time to time.
Does anyone encounter the same feelings? Anyone has tricks/tips regarding this?"
4790,isfj,"I don’t need to be totally alone, I just need to be left alone sometimes. My husband doing his own thing in the house or the same room is just fine. He’s an INTP and feels the same way. 
One of the greatest compliments that he’s given me is “being with you is like being by myself.” It kind of sounds rude but from an introvert It’s totally flattering. "
4791,isfj,"relationships require us to split up our lives in 3 parts: you, me, and we.
it's really important to have them. just make sure that all parties know what those are as they shift and change with time. it seems that she and you currently have different understandings on where they are at and where they should be. just make sure to talk a lot less clinically or technically than i am at the moment when trying to come to an understanding about them with her. this should be a warm conversation, full of love, understanding, and acceptance if you can swing it. and make sure to keep each other up to date on them."
4792,isfj,"I absolutely need my time alone, and I’m not sure that’s exclusive to a personality type.  Time alone is time you are most free to grow.
Be ‘selfish’ and take time for yourself guilt-free.  Tell her you need time to yourself.  She will appreciate it, I’m sure."
4793,isfj,"Try dedicating some alone time for yourself and keep an open mind since it may not always be in the comfort of your own living space. To me, my alone time away from my boyfriend is going to the gym. Even just going for a walk alone to think and clear your head I think can be very beneficial. Co-habitating is hard and maybe having just a simple discussion with your partner about your need to have alone time is a conversation that needs to be had. Obviously you love your partner and the time you both spend together, but when alone time is reenergizing and is important to make sure you have the time you need. "
4794,isfj,"It's wholly understandable, and sometimes more beneficiary than it seems. I got a lot more done at work last night because I worked away from the others, and I never thought that'd happen. (Also the """"""""boss"""""""" for the area sorta hates me, working away from her was nice.)"
4795,isfj,"I love how independent we can be as well as how great we are at serving others
Let’s take a moment to appreciate US, I feel I often neglect my own self & how great I can be. How about y’all? What do you love most about being an ISFJ? "
4796,isfj,"I love being attuned to the subtleties of those close to me. I can always tell if something is wrong and I know how to best help them based on past experiences with them. I also genuinely love helping and caring for my loved ones. My INTJ boyfriend is so kind and receptive to all of my emotional and material gifts! I can’t help but shower him with my affection! I love how much we care about the emotional well-being and growth of our close ones, which inspires us to grow and learn about ourselves! "
4797,isfj,"I like how Si can create cool connections. I can catch the thread of an impression and follow it to another experience that is sometimes wholly unlike the current one, and yet /seems/ exactly like it: 
A tedious, yet brusque conversation with a bus driver- it was like trying to zip up a stuck zipper from a weird angle where you can’t use leverage or your strength to move it. "
4798,isfj,"Hi guys, I've come to find that many Male ISXX types I've met are vehicle enthusiasts (mechanics, Auto-cross, Cars, Motorcycles, etc. ) and I'm wondering what other types are.
Some examples of people I know:
All Mech Engr. Majors:
My little bro is an ISFJ - CRX enthusiast, mechanic 
My ex also ISFJ - Motorcycle rider/ mod-der, 
My other Ex - ISFP - Enjoys working on cars (not great at it though), (Auto tech. major)
My friend ISFP - Subaru owner, autocross-er, mechanic, random car info buff
Older Bro ESFP - Mechanic of bicycles, laptops, cars (drop out)"
4799,isfj,"Wow so me!!  I'm a huge CRX enthusiast and have been a mechanic 10 years.  I started teaching myself when I was 14, by 17 I was doing an engine swap and nitrous in my crx.  That was 13 years ago (i'm 30 now)."
4800,isfj,"Hey fellow isfjs! Do you all ever have the feeling that you fit more than one type? I'm sure everyone does but I feel as if I move between my base most established personality of ISFJ and it seems more frequently moving to a more ESFJ mentality about things. I do feel like I am still most recharged by being by myself and doing the things I like. But lately I'm feeling more outgoing, sociable and still wanting to insert myself into my more turbulent friend groups to make everyone get along and be the glue if you will. Needless to say, I'm having some confusion between ISFJ and ESFJ. Any thoughts? Thank you!"
4801,isfj,"One is rarely 100% of a specific kind. I'm quite introvert, but I'm very passionate about sports and in those situations I tend to come across as extrovert. Especially at one of my sport unions they wouldn't think that I'm an introvert. I'm a trainer there as well and thus putting myself in middle of the entire group. During trainings I can be known as the loud guy. As soon as there's a party though I prefer to be with a small group of people or not being there at all."
4802,isfj,"I would wager that you have been exercising your auxiliary function which is extroverted. If you have always been recharged by others then maybe you could be ESFJ, but since you say this has only been going on recently I would wager it's more your secondary function than anything. 
Also don't think that any social interaction is draining for introverts. Close friends and family often have a positive effect on them, especially for ISFJs. We are often called the most extroverted introvert for a reason after all. "
4803,isfj,"If you're up for a bit of reading, check out ""Quiet: The Power of the Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking"" by Susan Cain
Although it's mainly focused on exploring the otherwise quiet introverts, there are sections that discuss what you're talking about. Simply put, there are four categories:
Introverts (pure)
Extroverts (pure)
Introverted Extroverts
Extroverted Introverts
Sounds like you may be fall into either of the last two. I too feel a disconnect between calling myself an introvert or an extrovert. Rather, I find myself to be more of an extroverted introvert. I love to socialize and hang out, but do need some serious downtime as well. It's about finding a balance for yourself."
4804,isfj,"I'm an INFJ and I recently started seeing an ISFJ. I like him, but I want to know more about ISFJs.


Is it normal for y'all to need some warming up time? I saw someone say ISFJs have ""layers."" What composes each layer from outermost to innermost? What's going on in your heads?


Are ISFJs more carefree or intense?


What does an ISFJ need/desire in a relationship? It seems to me that the guy I'm seeing may be into words of affirmation/validation because he gives them pretty often.


What kind of qualities do ISFJs like in a partner? What qualities turn an ISFJ off?


Any ISFJ have experience dating an INFJ? If it worked well, what aspects of the two personality types complimented each other? What made the relationship great? If it didn't work out, what seemed to be the issue? What could help these two connect?

"
4805,isfj,"I cannot answer for INFJ-ISFJ but I'll tell you my experience... Also I am a bit tipsy and rambly.
1) Yes, I need time to warm up to a person. My inner layer is all my insecurities and inner thoughts and things that I think that make me feel like I'm crazy. It's very tough for me to open up, because that would mean revealing how I honestly feel and I have been told in the past I need to just get over things and my emotions are stupid and wrong. I also do not have many friends and it is very hard to meet people I think I would like--I desire like some sort of instant friendship where we bond immediately and know each other's thoughts... but that doesn't exist, and it's so hard to open up to someone so I'm not sure how to get to that stage. It probably took me a year to feel truly comfortable around my boyfriend -- enough to tell him how crazy I thought I was, or to tell him ""look, I know it's stupid to feel this way but I was upset about blah blah blah and I can't help it."" My outer layer is just that -- kind of a fake mask I put on around people I don't know well and I pretend everything is fine with me.
2) I think I can be carefree -- it's taken a while but at this point sometimes I just walk around campus and give zero fucks and I consider that to be carefree. Trying not to think about what people may think of me. Idk if this is an ISFJ trait, but I often will be thinking in my head and wondering if I am really at the center of something like the Truman Show... like when I walk out of the classroom class stops and everyone starts talking about me. I know it's crazy but... I don't know how to explain why I feel that way sometimes (even while knowing it's not true).
3) I think I need to feel appreciated. Appreciated for doing the minor things. Like I clean the kitchen because my boyfriend didn't feel well, but then want him to tell me I did a good job or something. It's also strange because as much as I want to feel appreciated, I hate getting compliments -- I think it stems from a ""Well I should do it, so why am I getting complimented for something I should do anyways?"" Like I want recognition but I also get embarrassed by it... I would tell my mom not to compliment me while I was growing up because I felt I didn't deserve it for just doing my obligation.
4) I like security. I like feeling like I will not scare away my partner no matter how crazy my emotions may get. I know they're crazy, I need someone to tell me I am not weird and that my feelings are valid. I guess validation is another thing I want, and to feel treated as well as I treat my partner. What turns me off are cheating (on tests or on partners) and materialism.
5) I have dated an INTJ. INFJ (Ni Fe Ti Se) versus INTJ (Ni Te Fi Se) so you both lead with the Ni. Communication has been tough. We miscommunicate often without meaning to. I've commented a lot about it before, so you could probably get a glimpse by looking at my prior comments."
4806,isfj,"I can only speak from experience, being an isfj. 
I generally want to feel useful to my SO, her happiness is my happiness. Acknowledgment of what I do for her tends to be a plus. I'm not carefree, but I don't hold strong opinions either, in an effort to remain in a position to support her.
I'm not a fan of confrontation and over-competitiveness. I'm fairly sensitive and I try to keep our prides and egos intact. 
I like a partner who is laid-back and open with their feelings. I'm at my best when I feel trusted. I usually have very few words but every now and then I let the floodgates loose when I feel safe to share. So, I appreciate a non-judgmental person, who can contribute positive feedback. "
4807,isfj,"I am female ISFJ with a male INFJ in a relationship for 6 months only. But i will give my 2 cents contribution because I have read a lot of comments saying that INSJ and ISFJ are not compatible. And for me, he is the only people who correspond to me so I want to believe all this theory have limits.

We were friends initially which might help to answer to your first question. It really helps to talk to someone to open the first layers. When I realised he could really appreciate me for what i am and understand me it helped to open myself. ISFJ are very secretive people i would say, because we are sensitive so it is a shield and also because we are introverted so it takes time for us to built relation. (the first comment is totaly correct as well).
Being in a relationship wont open the same layer as easily than being friend because you can share more openly with a friends.

By talking, we start to appreciate each other. 
As a ISFJ i am a very good listener, I even built relationship by conversation and common interests. So this is a very important aspect of the relationship moreover at the beginning. It can even happen that you never talk to an other Introverted because I/I do not start conversation easily and the first time you will talk to the person, you will discover how close you both are.
- As he is INFJ, my listening gave him appreciation and support which was really important for him. As it was important to him and INFJ are very dedicated to others and selfless, he gave me back the same listening hear and dedication that makes me comfortable.
- His appreciation, which is the most important for INFJ (INFJ put others people first and feeling that what they do for others is appreciated is the best reward for them), our relationship took a step further.

If you feel you cannot go to the second layer, my advise would be to open up yourself first, which i believe for knowing a INFJ is not something easy and you need trust to do so. You can start with basic conversation about life - any type of sharing will help. Do remember ISFJ are very good listening and emphatic people caring for people close to them.

For each layer i would say, we are scared of being criticize/rejected for our idea (the most deeper ideas we have) which seem to be different from other people, as we are sensitive we do not appreciate criticize and we take it very personally reason why we do not want to open or it is very difficult to do so. Moreover, sometimes talking to intuitive type do not give the appreciation or support we need while sharing feelings.


Not sure i understand but we are very caring about people and serious about relationship. We only see relationship as long term commitment. 
Most of the time, we hide this part because we do not like to expose our feelings and we are seen are insensitive, cold, distant, rude people even so it is the opposite. 


Personally my relation with a INFJ is really good because we share very similar values, we are both altruist, very caring about each other feeling, dedicated to others, we have strong sense of ethics (which i appreciated in myself as well as in others people), sharing same values (commitment, upright, genuine)


It is important for me to find someone who can appreciate myself for who i am and share the  same value (moral, ethical and universal values). I would sy i just love him because he has all the values i appreciate in someone and he is really really good. It is say the INFJ are soul of the world and it only represents 1% of the population.
ISFJ share feelings very often and needs to feel secure in a relationship. They need to feel that they are ""Still"" after few months, few years appreciated; which for my boyfriend is really annoying. For him, he said it once and it wont change.
I read something about ISFJ which give you a very accurate explanation ""They need to be needed"" ISFJ do everything to suit their partner, we are selfless because that the way we fulfill ourself : by serving others. If others do not appreciate what we do for them, we feel useless and we lost motivation and can become depressed. We cannot fulfill ourself without others thats why we are very good in social work because it gives us a meaning.


Values (moral, ethics..) being faithful, trust, all this is included. IFSJ as well as INFJ are very upright and have high sense of loyalty.
What we really hate is immoral people (it wont be your case), lying and laziness, anything related to sins.


What complemented each other. Almost nothing cause the only different is between S and N which apparently is not good in a relation because one focus on past and present (S) and the other one on futur and potential outputs (N). 


What is GOOD in the relationship is that we are similar:
- it is easier to appreciate someone who has the qualities you really admire
- it is also rewarding and re-insuring to feel that in the other side, the person recognize your qualities that most of people wont recognise
- it give a lot of spiritual connection
- with time you will realize and probably your boyfriend will realize that there is nobody that you can trust and rely on as an ISFJ INFJ.
the issue is
1-  when it come to the difference. When there is a problem to solve (pragmatical, financial, anything to plan) you will have two differents points of view. and you might feel like you cannot communicate with each other.
2 - When you will have conflict, it will be worsen by your similarity. with conflict ISFJ (due to feeling - become overwhelmed and can become aggressive while they are waiting for validation of their feelings). While waiting for this validation during a conflict, instead of giving it, INFJ shut down (ignore until the storm is over) which worsen the conflict in the ISFJ point of view.
ISFJ become more aggressive and INFJ get lost because they have done their best to stop the conflict by ignore it and it become worst. Thats a very difficult situation to resolve. You need to understand what the other is expecting from you during a conflict (BEFORE a conflict happened) and to do it instead of having your normal reaction. It will come with time.
Am saying, the conflict is worsen by your similarity cause during a conflict there is things you cannot give and you are waiting for the other to give to you (for example for ISFJ it will be reinsurrance). It wont come easily cause we are both IFJ.
3- To help to connect, ideas you shares in terms of relationship, INFJ are very idealistic which is very reassuring for ISFJ. ISFJ need to be reassured and the comfort of the idealist and caring of the INFJ is good for us.
Connect with all the ideas, values you share. For me, i believe values are very important. The values of an individual make the person good thats how i appreciate him. "
4808,isfj,"My observation with ISFJs.  They are so kind hearted, that they often attract their opposite. - the Takers. -the selfish people.   Yet, they want to see the best in people but it often overlooks their true colors.  Be willing to question your feelings when/if you see  red flags. And don't beat yourself over it for being honest with yourself.   Plus having a quality friend to bounce ideas off doesn't hurt. "
4809,isfj,"I haven't dated an INFJ, but my best friend of 10 years and current roommate (more than 3 years) is one. We get along well because we both have a great deal of compassion. Neither is quick to blame or get angry. 
Really, the only problems are 
she's so idealistic that I can't believe her sometimes. For example, she works in healthcare and she seriously thinks she can help every single patient change. Some days it's inspiring and some days it makes me sad for her. 
I instill order to our home by cleaning and organizing. That one of my strongest ISFJ traits, put chaos into order, but she's messy. She just remembers where she dropped something. I ""clean"" it into what I think is the objectively correct spot, hiding it from her. So I think I should be getting thanked when really I'm frustrating her. 
I think that being late is a common trait for INFJ, that hurts my feelings. Like I'm hardly being squeezed in. I want to be a priority sometimes. 
But, we are both introverted, duh I guess, and can just shut our door and not hurt the other one's feelings. That's very important to me. 
She's been willing to wait for the layers to peel off. It literally has taken years. It is scary to feel the vulnerability of good friendship. She could reject me as weak because of my sensitivity. All in all, I have found the two personalities very compatible. 
And yes, we absolutely need some warming up time. I, personally, would be put into a nervous frenzy of cleaning and stressing if someone tried to move a romantic relationship quickly. I desire someone who will be encouraging of social outings and adventures. And who will say nice things super frequently, even though I will probably not take the compliments gracefully. "
4810,isfj,"Oh my god I think you might be my boyfriend, but a lady.
Genuinely this is cracking me up how alike you sound. He both wants complements and praise but also thinks he's just doing his duty, so he shouldn't actually need them. He gets really flustered if his parents show him affection or complement him, and he never wanted praise or excessive attention from them growing up. At the same time, though, he loves if someone subtlely shows him appreciation for something he did, and he gets veeeeery cranky if he feels underappreciated. He also LOVES security and needs to feel like he has a safe space with you where you'll validate all of his emotions and his hobbies no matter what. Haha, this is so great, you really sound a lot like him."
4811,isfj,"It's reassuring to know that ISFJs need some warming up time, so do INFJs. It is scary to be vulnerable. I am seeing how ISFJs and INFJs can be compatible due to what you mentioned, but my new relationship is off to a bit of a slow start because we're both introverted and take time to warm up to one another. It's good to know what will help make an ISFJ feel at ease and valued. Thanks!"
4812,isfj,"It's okay, it was interesting reading your insight.  You're right about them not being able to see it.  If I told him that though, it feels like I'm being ""bossy"".  I guess I've grown up to be too passive?  Idk. "
4813,isfj,"Spring's good and all, but the thing that instantly blows it for me is: Allergies.
​
mAN, allergies just devastate me. Just that one thing makes me feel meh about Spring season.
​
Summer means a long break—about 2 full months—from school, but that'll be gone once I start working full-time :' )
But, this season is vacation/ice cream time so ayyyy
​
Personally, I prefer autumn/fall the most since it is neither too cold/hot, no pollen, and all those leaves falling down~~~ (but, people need to rake and clean those up so ehh)."
4814,isfj,Wow. I get that nostalgia too! I don't know how to describe it but it's just nostalgia sad feeling that there's something I am longing for. But at the same time I love the warm weather and my mood has definitely been changing as it gets warmer. I get really excited and talkative randomly too and the warm weather seems to bring it out. The other week my friend asked me if I drank or smoked before coming to campus because of how hyped up I was. I'm usually super mellow
4815,isfj,"I’ve dated many types....here’s a quick summary:
ISTJ—boring. Way too similar to myself and didn’t challenge me in any ways or bring new insight into my life. Too uptight, not fun. 
ISTP—greatest love of my life. Loved how deep, technical, introspective and good with his hands he was. Also kinda liked his aloofness. Super funny and chill. Struggled to express emotions at first, but once we got over that it was wonderful. 
INTJ—was really drawn to him...something about INTJs intelligence is sexy as fuck to me. Ultimately it didn’t last long. Don’t think he appreciated my conventional nature. However I’m still really drawn to them and love to listen to what they have to say.
ENTP—very interesting. Not sustainable but I did learn a lot from the relationship. We just were on different wavelengths most of the time and pushed each other’s buttons. 
ISFP—wonderful, almost as wonderful as my relationship with the ISTP. He is warm, affectionate, full of wonder, peaceful, calm. He makes me relax so much and not worry. Super sensual, but also introverted and does have giant displays of love. Beautiful mind. 
That’s my thoughts so far! However, I hate to define each type based on the one particular person I dated. I wish I could know many people of each type and have a better sense of healthy and unhealthy versions of each..."
4816,isfj,"Currently in a long term relationship with an ENTJ. Totally love our differences. We’ve helped each other grow a lot and keep each other grounded and real. I value honesty highly and I think that’s what attracted me to him most of all, that and his charisma. I always know where I stand and I can trust his judgement completely.
Before him, I was with an INTJ. I’ve clearly got a thing for XNTJ’s! He was also really charismatic and I enjoyed his intellect a lot."
4817,isfj,"My husband is ESFJ. So we're pretty similar, except for his extroverted-ness. We have a lot of the same values as far as relationships and family go, so it was easy there. Our biggest problem is how introverted I am, and how extroverted he is. He's not an extreme extrovert by any means, but it has taken a lot of talks/discussion to find some common ground with how much time we spend with eachother vs with friends."
4818,isfj,"Took me a long time to find anyone I wanted to be in a relationship with who also wanted to be with me. 😆 I married him recently. 
I was attracted to his confidence and humor, I think. And also that he could deal with my anxiety LOL. I sometime resemble a 4 or 6.
He’s an INTP 5 but several years older than I, which I think contributes to his extroversion, uncharacteristic for his type. 
Prior to that, I had mostly been attracted to men who were uninterested in me and probably emotionally unavailable but whom I felt a desire to save. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Edit: Also - goals. Values. They lined up pretty well."
4819,isfj,"ISFJ 9w1 :)
IDK my first boyfriend's type. he seemed sensitive, has this silent strong outside, soft inside aura, had this protective, stable vibe about him. He was very practical, I think he's a thinking type for sure..
Second boyfriend was INFP (he introduced me to MBTI :p)  I loved everything about him, everything about him was attractive to me. <3 the connection I had with him was/is only something I can dream of. Yes, there were some aspects about him that used to get me worried for him, but I loved him. Sometimes, it still depresses me that I had to part with him."
4820,isfj,"Lately my boyfriend (who is a wonderful, kind, caring person) has been in a massive slump. For privacy reasons I wont get into specific details, but it started with physical health issues and then work issues and then some life issues. I can see him spiraling down into this pit of negativity and it's started to affect our relationship as he is being very closed off and distant. 
I love him dearly and I don't like seeing him like this, but how can I help him get out of this funk? "
4821,isfj,"i'm with k_blz
if i'm in a bad place and somehow i ended up able to help a friend in need, i feel a lot better. or helping someone i care about. or a random stranger. different ways i help people effect me in various ways. but its always positive."
4822,isfj,"Now may be a good time for support and tenderness. Having you to lean on may give them strength to bear whatever they are dealing with. 
ISFJ’s do things for people to show they care. Do things for them and they will easily interpret that support. Is there anything you can do for their health issues? (e.g. they’re diabetic and you show support by cooking diabetic friendly meals, and you make a lifestyle change in support.) 
Take care of some tasks for them so there’s less on their to-do list. ISFJ’s typically like a clean decluttered environment. Clean their house or room. Do the laundry. 
Tell them what you appreciate about them and what you think others value in them. "
4823,isfj,"That same desire to help and make everyone happy can also be a huge source of stress and anxiety.  People tend to take advantage of our generous nature, intentionally or otherwise.  Try to find out if maybe he just has too much on his plate and feeling overwhelmed, then try taking some of that load off of him. I’m currently in the process of getting out of a similar slump with my wife’s help.  She noticed that I had just started shutting down over the past month and was starting to worry.  Not sure where I would be without her. "
4824,isfj,"reassurance is good. make sure he knows he's loved and needed. care for him. and ask for his input or help in things and reward him for it with appreciation and more love.
best i got. this is really vague but privacy is important."
4825,isfj,"I’ll start


I don’t care that much for rules. I’ll break a rule if I think it doesn’t make sense or just not care if other people break it.


I know there is a stereotype of us being the most Extroverted introvert. However, this isn’t true for me I need a substantially amount of alone time and can get quickly drained around people even if I’m enjoying myself with close friends or family.


I’m definitely not very organized. My closet has so many papers around it and I don’t care to organize my room very meticulously (pretty sure this is because of blind Te). I also put off doing the dishes until I feel like it.  

"
4826,isfj,"same, i am a minimalist, but I can be organized. I am not messy but i am not super organized either. I really pay attention to rules, and tend to always follow them. I feel like the isfj's and the infj's are the two types that will use a zebra crossing no even if there are no cars on the road. lmao... I also like one on one social interaction (3 people and the social interaction becomes extraverted) I love being alone but i also really like being with ONE friend(1).. but just for a small amount of time..
The older a friendship is, the more value I find in it."
4827,isfj,"

I've always been accused of 'not listening' during work training, because I would try it the company way, realize it was stupid, and figure out my own my to do it. That mentality got me into the top 3% of my position in the company.


I get drained very easily, and I have a large, noisy family, and I still get drained around the people I love. I have noticed, though, that I am more talkative around the people I love and am most comfortable with.


I am really good at organizing, and I like to reorganize. But... I leave clothes on the floor all the time and I have a bad habit of procrastinating by chores. I hate dishes.

"
4828,isfj,"I'm the same as all of these, I'm not neat/tidy at all naturally but I do find being pretty minimalist is a good way of helping me to do this without trying
Also, get me in the right mood and I'm super sociable. I do need to chill away from people for a while after though."
4829,isfj,"I’m similar with rules. While I ultimately would consider myself a very responsible and rule-abiding citizen....sometimes I really just don’t give a fuck and do what I want. In the past I have had times where I acted like I was above the rules bc I am intelligent and kind and that I can get away with things. But this tends to catch up with me. Ultimately I do think rules and structure are very important for society on the whole. 
I feel like ISFJs are stereotyped to be the most religious types. I am very much not religious and don’t like the conformity of religion.
I’m not great with money. I am the opposite of frugal, have a very fancy taste and can be quite materialistic. I am super organized and have a detailed budget....but sticking to it is challenging. I am driven by financial success, second to having a large beautiful family. 
ISFJs are stereotyped to be rather boring and conventional sexually, however I am super kinky "
4830,isfj,"When I was a little kid, my parents were told that I need to be taken out of private school and put into public because the structure of a private school would hamper my development. I needed more free will. I love structure, so long as I create that structure myself. 
I don't like the ""tried and true."" I have my own ways of problem solving.
My memory sucks and I don't remember the details about people lives.
I don't like jobs that require detailed bookkeeping type of work.
I'm not religious."
4831,isfj,"

Exactly this; if the reasoning behind a rule seems flawed to me, I am liable not to follow it.


I live alone and still need a ton of alone time. Even when I go visit my family I spend a lot of time alone. Totally relate!


Omg, I am a mess too! I'm actually starting to find tips for people with ADHD as I find that a lot of those tips are actually useful for trying to organize oneself. 😅


Also I am very awkward with hosting and am totally not at all the selfless helper in every social situation that we are often made out to be. I'm more likely to sit in a corner, lol."
4832,isfj,"

ISFJs dont really care about the rules? Interesting. I almost always try to follow them or even reinforce them when I can. I guess i break the sterotype there. 


I am very much an extraverted introvert, in short bursts. At most i can get in maybe 4 hours, if im lucky, of socializing with friends and family, and I'd need at least a day to recharge. There have been times where i overloaded myself by not doing this for a week and i crashed.  hard. 


Naturally? Im definitely not organized. I put dishes off for a while sometimes, even when i think they look horrible. I'll throw most of my stuff that is my room around and not clean it for months. My schoolwork i am very organized with though since ive adapted to that. 

"
4833,isfj,"I’m the same with the clothes on the floor 😂
The clothing that is in my wardrobe and closet is impeccably organized and folded...but I can’t be bothered to put my clothing away or in the hamper after a long day—I just chuck on the floor. I end up doing deep cleaning and organizing every couple days as opposed to being super organized and clean everyday. 
I also find that sometimes it’s easier for me to organize other people’s spaces than my own. I’ll help my family organize their desks and become super functional....and then mine will just be a disaster. "
4834,isfj,"Never thought of ISFJs as religious. I'm an atheist personally, but i do find a huge interest in the lore and such. I dont find conformity by faith of religion either. Maybe that's just because i have more faith in science though... "
4835,isfj,"See, I have trouble following rules if I don't see a good reason behind it... Like speeding! :) School zone? Yeah I'll slow down. Empty highway on a nice day? This speed limit of 100 km/h is stupid and arbitrary and does not follow the 85th percentile rule at all.
I also tend to sometimes flaunt the rules because I guess I get a bit cocky - goes back to the intelligent and kind thing. This has caught up with me before as well. Personally bureaucracy and the organized system of laws and rules and norms in our society kind of impresses me!"
4836,isfj,Do you mind talking about how you know you are an ISFJ? I don’t know if you’ve read up on the functions but this sounds more like you are an Fi user. Fi users will stand up for their personal beliefs if they feel like a value is violated. 
4837,isfj,"oh I just think;
- quality instead of quantity
- have few things
- if I get new stuff some shit's going out 
I am not an extreme minimalist but my mind is ..quite minimalistic, I don't need many objects "
4838,isfj,"I need time to recharge after social activities even though I do enjoy going out with friends. I am extremely outgoing when I am in a social setting with friends though, so people sometimes do mistake me as an extrovert. However, I don't initiate/approach strangers, I don't usually speak up in classes/ask questions in front of people and usually don't talk if I am intimidated. 
I focus a lot on the past - first impressions mean a lot to me, takes me a while for me to change an opinion of someone if they made a bad first impression because I hold onto my past experience with them. I find it difficult to let go of grudges and I use past experiences to determine my decisions. 
Even though I am logical and practical/realistic, my feelings are more dominant. I know ISFJ's are known to be push-overs/people pleasers but we do stand up when we feel strongly about something. However, I find that I am not scared about confrontation and feel that in order for us to proceed friendships/relationships, issues need to addresses and worked through where confrontation is necessary. Whereas I have friends where they would rather cop the issues and avoid confrontation.
I am organised and enjoy planning. I wouldn't say everything is in order and sometimes I am messy but I don't enjoy being messy and much prefer/function better in a organised environment."
4839,isfj,"Besides listening to music or watching movies :p

So, how often do you engage your imaginative side? 
Do you experience any challenges in creative expression?
What creative arts do you engage in?
Anything else you want to say about creativity?

As for me, I've always been bad at creative writing. But can get a little(very little) creative with cooking sometimes. I also sing a lot. And, got into pencil sketching a couple of months ago, absolutely loving it and I really wish to get more creative - have my own ideas rather than look at something and sketch it down... I cannot go beyond a limited level of creativity when I sketch.. there's this block, I want to overcome it. IDK what I am aiming for, but want creativity to burst open rather than show itself so minimally in me."
4840,isfj,"I love project-type stuff, so I’m more into arts and crafts than straight art. I usually run across pictures of something and then look at a million related pictures and then decide I’m going to use books and videos and self-teach. I then immediately launch into intermediate level projects. I skip the scarves and go straight to knitting sweaters.   That kind of thing.
Making things makes me happy and looking at pictures of stuff people make makes me happy. I’ve done sewing, crochet and knitting. I’m in the middle of learning quilting and almost done with my first quilt. Things I want to do in the future are reupholstery and woodworking. The wonderful thing about crafts over art is that if you have trouble being creative to the extend that you want, crafts allow you to work based off of plans or instruction that you can the customize to make unique, or just invest a lot of time and patience in so it’s done well. 
That being said, I do also enjoy some art. Right now I’m really taken with urban sketching. (Check out instagram for #urbansketching. There is some amazing talent out there. It’s hard to find time with kids, but I try and get some sketching and watercolor in."
4841,isfj,"I'm more an art-appreciator than an artist, myself. I took art history in college so I would have a better understanding of what I was looking at, and I found that made my viewing experience richer.
Like you, I do like to get creative in the kitchen. I also recently moved into a new apartment and I'm enjoying slowly decorating it to my tastes. "
4842,isfj,"My favorite is baking! I greatly enjoy the result of all the time and effort I am investing. The structure of a recipe helps me to focus and keep myself from getting lost in the possibilities. Obviously, practice makes perfect,  the more you do something the better you'll be. "
4843,isfj,"I’m not as imaginative as I would like. I will pick up on a trend or style and experiment with it. I like starting out with the bare necessities of whatever creative tool or medium and do a lot of self discovery. 
I turned a hobby into a career and I’m a user experience web specialist. I like to dig into the root cause of an issue or workflow and piece together both visual and functional solutions. 
I get really self conscience when I have to copy someone else’s work to either solve something adhoc or to put a fire out with a bandaid or patch approach. I’d lend that to a perfectionist attitude. Getting better at that though. 
Can’t for the life of me write. It’s because I’ve built up the way in which I’ve learned things and while in high school could never figure out English studies. No one could explain it to me like I consumed math, science and social. I would like to as it would help me immensely.
When working on something I need my focus time which helps recharge my batteries especially when I have my enlightenment moments with what I’m doing that can contribute to a conversation pieces with friends.
Thanks for the thoughtful question.  "
4844,isfj,"Props to you because I stopped trying to be creative a long time ago. It just isn't for me. However, I am actually really good at creative writing but not much else besides singing and playing viola. These are, of course, things where the song has already been written and I'm not actually creating as much as recreating. So I guess my advice is strive to do what you want to do but some people just aren't that creative and you have to accept what you can't do just as much as what you can do. :) good luck"
4845,isfj,Creativity is incredibly difficult for me. It seems I’m the perfectionist type. I feel like it has something to do with the ISFJ’s duty-oriented side. I’ve never been one for artistic flow vs following directions well. I make attempts but it always comes off very mechanical.
4846,isfj,"I draw. Mostly fanart, because I find original ideas to be unfulfilling and dull. I more like how I can watch myself improve, the whole thing is nicely predictable. I prefer sketches with pencil and working towards giving my drawings character over big finished pieces using other mediums.
I also quite like crocheting and knitting. it's a stress reliever and if I have an idea of what to make, I can do it but there's tons of existing patterns out there. "
4847,isfj,"I’ve been a drummer in bands since I was 13 (30 now). Played for church bands as long as I’ve been drumming, so I’ve never really had downtime in between projects. I used to make songs on my computer from early high school til a couple years ago. Currently I’m in a hardcore band and having a blast."
4848,isfj,"I totally get what you are saying! I also felt like this might be a commonly shared challenge of ISFJs. So true,agree that this has something to do with duty-oriented nature of ISFJ :( I feel creative sometimes, with practical things(like simplifying a task or something work-oriented), but not arts... is it the same for you??
I'm working so hard on it though.. I wish I had my own ideas, like you said have an ""artisitic flow"", a confidence to push boundaries and make my own sketches rather than imitating 90% of the time :( The thing I love about creative arts is, they are so soothing, satisfying, enriching and relaxing to me even as a passive participant with minimal creativity of my own.. 
Do you think we will never be creative, especially in arts? :(  I admire it so much in others, and their work, and want to be like them.."
4849,isfj,"I have a really hard time creating things from scratch, but I enjoy art. I solve this problem by taking on structured creative projects like paint-by-numbers and embroidery kits. I also can’t draw things out of thin air.. but I like to draw things right in front of me. I don’t practice enough so it’s never very good but I do enjoy it."
4850,isfj,"I completely agree with you on that because I am the same way. I like having a formula or blueprint for what I'm doing and I can't really think creatively at least as far as art. But I think its important to brace your lack if creativity because its part of who you are, just like some people lack the ability to follow a set script or formula. Your strengths and weaknesses are part of you and you should be proud of who you are"
4851,isfj,"The thing about the ISFJ is we go after what we want and, more often than not, we so gracefully attain it. Dwell in that truth!
Most importantly. Don’t put yourself in an ISFJ box or a “this is how things should be” box.
I think you need to redefine creativity and art for yourself. It is subjective after all."
4852,isfj,"So I am an ESTJ and 26. I am significantly younger than my isfj friend. He’s 63. NO interest here, my friend or maybe not friend has a wife. This issue has been going on for a long time.
I have this friend who has been diagnosed with diabetes. And he took the news with a really hard hit. I get that I think he’s unhealthy as an ISFJ and as a person. Anything little he doesn’t get his way with he’ll break down crying. If there is a situation that is a little more difficult he’ll have a melt down. He was so upset for two weeks after his diabetes diagnoses there was no consolation. I took out the weight calculator and we determined that he is over 80 pounds over weight use to be 100.
This time he was arguing with me over whether popcorn is junk food or not like a little kid. Yes no yes no yes no type of thing. I try to prove logically that it is. And he came up with popcorn from the store isn’t like theater popcorn. Popcorn is corn so it’s healthy. The biggest pile of crap I’ve ever heard. I became a little frustrated and he hung up on me. We were discussing his junk food habit. He’s 80 pounds over weight and he claims he’s cut out junk food but when I pointed out it’s a once a week thing he couldn’t take it. I stressed a healthy lifestyle. He got this my fitness pal type thing and he can see the breakdown on there. Sometimes he can see why he is over goals. I try to tell him there is something more simple than doing the diary just keep in mind of the portions and don’t eat unhealthily. And when he eats junk food he really goes for it. Two bags of fritos and a almond joy. One time he had 20 of some sweet cracker cookies. His weakness is food. And he over eats anyway. He tries to make excuses for eating a lot. “I like eating” “I am a man” and all sorts of other stuff.
How am I suppose to talk sense in to him? And how do I help him if he doesn’t want help?"
4853,isfj,"Im pretty sure unbuttered popcorn is a pretty healthy snack... Compared to most other savoury snacks anyway. Have you compared the calories?
How does your friend feel about you helping him out? To me, it seems controlling. Maybe that's what he needs though, i dont know enough context.
like you said, you're only (maybe?) a friend. he has a wife that should be helping him. Maybe you need to take a step back or take things slower. Tracking calories on mfp is a good step and maybe he just needs some time to cut down on the unhealthy habits. Doing too much at once might seem too daunting/overwhelming for him. "
4854,isfj,"Well thanks for a reasonable response.
Well, I am sure it is buttered he bought this from the store.
Well, I don’t see it as controlling so much as trying to help but I suppose it can be seen that way.
I guess that’s what I do take big steps to fix problems that’s how I am.
And yeah, well his wife is in a nursing home and not usually any help."
4855,isfj,"Hi everyone, i'm a newbie in this subreddit and not sure if this is the right place to post this (i was thinking of posting in socialskills but i figured i will get more 'focused' responses here) so mods feel free to delete this post if you think it's inappropriate. Anyways enough of that intro..
I've been single for a long time and i thought maybe i should put myself out there again so i installed a dating app for the first time. Had a few matches but eventually the conversations fizzled out (yep i got ghosted a lot of times) until one day this INTJ guy (it's included in his username, also the reason why i thought of this sub) messaged me and immediately asked for my number. I gave my number thinking it's more convenient and i guess i thought he really wanted to know me.
So we started texting each other, the usual getting-to-know-you stuff, random topics, and even had long phone conversations. But then one day i was extremely busy at work and i wasn't able to reply to his text (the topic was at a dead end and didn't know how to continue). And he didn't call so i thought he was busy. The following day he texted that i was too busy and was ghosting him. I was surprised by this and replied that i wasn't ghosting him, that sometimes i really don't reply immediately even with friends (true story), and maybe we should start again? He agreed but it was never the same. He would only have one-word replies to my texts and even told me that he doesn't text first if he thought the other person doesn't have time for him. It got to the point that i was running out of things to say, it felt like talking to a wall. And then it turned worse when he finally called again but i missed it. I returned the call but he didn't answer. Apparently he got pissed at me and texted me that i should just text him back when i have the time, that i shouldn't have stopped ghosting him and not apologised but didn't make up for it because i was being insincere. So i acknowledged that my commitment issues were questionable and i didn't make up for it enough. And he replied that knowing it isn't enough is one thing, making up for it is another. I didn't know what to reply on that one so that was the end of the story.
TL;DR: Socially awkward ISFJ installs a dating app and meets INTJ guy. We exchange numbers, had several conversations until one time i didn't know how to continue the conversation. Guy thought i ghosted him, tried to talk with him again but apparently it wasn't enough.
So my question is, how do you deal with someone who come on too strong? I'm not sure if it's just me or my personality but most of the time i really clam up around people who are kind of intimidating. I really struggle with human interaction (i think i mentioned this to him and he just laughed at me jerk).
Also is it also difficult for you to converse with others? Personally i like listening better unless a topic is really interesting to me but most of the time i still end up listening. How do you practice your conversation skills?
Finally, do you ask the other person their personality type when you date? Which personality types do you get along with in your experience?
Sorry about this mess. In hindsight i should've probably ghosted him for real and spared myself from trouble."
4856,isfj,"As others have mentioned on this thread, this has less to do with personality types and more to do with his insecurities (which are not for you to solve). To answer a few questions:
""how do you deal with someone who come on too strong?""
There are some cases where we need to reconcile with strong personalities (i.e. family, work settings), but this isn't one of those cases. This is more about you setting your boundaries. You don't need to deal with this person or any manipulative person for that matter.
""Also is it also difficult for you to converse with others?""
Yes. Communicating my thoughts (pictures) with words isn't an easy task. I prefer to listen too, or just observe.
""How do you practice your conversation skills?""
I don't think many people practice this skill, it tends to develop through life. One trick is to be interested, and not interesting. That is, ask the person questions about their life. It gets them talking, so you can keep listening if you prefer :) 
""Finally, do you ask the other person their personality type when you date?"" 
I don't think it's fair to ask someone their type on a date, and it could be seen as slightly intrusive. For one, types aren't fully developed until middle age (i.e. 30 and above). Second, there's more to a person than their type, and some people take offense to being categorized given their unique background. Finally, part of the fun is figuring the other person out too. Leave it for a later discussion.
""Which personality types do you get along with in your experience?""
I'm not sure, but I think types that have the same functional stack as me (i.e. they have Si Fe Ti Ne somewhere). "
4857,isfj,"An INFP could be a good option for you. Similar on many aspects, different in others and you complete each other so well because even though you usually share the same values, your strenghts and weaknesses tend to be opposites so you can help each other out. Both INFP's and ISFJ's aren't quitters when it comes to something or someone they truly love, because both types are highly caring and dedicated to serving and pleasing each other, doing their best to make the relationship grow. And this guy you mention... regardless of his typing, he sounds like a jerk. Don't pay too much attention to it."
4858,isfj,"Looks at post history. But this is your only post...
Anyways, that neediness looks like a red flag to me. It sounds like it would get annoying/frustrating If you have to message the someone everyday. As mentioned by others you're better off moving on."
4859,isfj,"I don't know if you can even account for personality type here lol, it sounds like they just had the misfortune of meeting an insecure asshole. Although I certainly think that plenty of ""INTJs"" are mistyped. "
4860,isfj,"Might have been mistyped, but I think the insecurity overruled any personality here. I know if I thought I was being ghosted, I certainly wouldn't accuse the other person of doing so. Sometimes it just doesn't work out, no harm no foul."
4861,isfj,I broke up with two girlfriends over communication. I dated each around 5 to 6 months. With both of them I honestly should've broken up earlier in the relationship but I kept trying to make things work when instead I should've seen that we were just not compatible.
4862,isfj,"I see. My ex bf(isfj)broke up with me too bcz of communication too. Could you help me to understand? I did realise now that when he had a real hard struggling with his depression(thinking that everything is so wrong around him-we live in different countries)I should have confirmed with him again and again that I was with him instead of trying to help him to solve the problem itself. But he made a promise to me, that was our first friction of communication we had once in a year. then 2 weeks later he just told me that the fire is gone, it’s over. Whatever I say or do is of no help. Even tho he bought the engagement ring already. I can tell he’s heart broken, he said he doesn’t want to break up either, he still loves me but it’s over, and he want me to be his friend. I simply don’t understand, the communication can be solved for sure. Why? Is it possible for him to come back to again in the future? Could you help me to understand? I much appreciate it that! "
4863,isfj,"I just don't see how an Si user wouldn't. All I hear about Si is ""planning, memory, follow through."" Like I feel like every Si description has this underlying theme of other types can do whatever the Si dominant does better, but just simply lacks the interest. I'd be pissed. It'd be like playing basketball and everyone constantly saying shit like ""You know I could be better than you if I tried right?""
Hell I'm just a tertiary user and I find it insulting. It also leads to just unending arrogance over on the ENTP forum. Go to google type in ""arrogance entp"" and you can find unending swaths of threads with the ENTPs laughing over their arrogance and saying shit like ""it's just a feeling that if I tried I could be better than everyone."" I can't help but feel it's due to the wrap that Si gets in the mbti community. I just wish someone would be like ""look Si is fundamentally good at x, no other type can claim that."" There must be SOMETHING the Si dominant excels at in hobbies apart from ""learning from mistakes due to memory"" right?"
4864,isfj,"But that’s the thing tho. If they’re saying they’d excel at something “if they tried” why aren’t they doing it? ISFJs are known to do the tasks others wouldn’t do bc it’s tedious or boring or small or whatever. But tbh, if an ISFJ stops what they’re doing, people can FEEL an ISFJs disappearance bc something that used to be in such order is now in massive disarray. 
Also, I think the strength of the ISFJ’s Si is mostly evident through time and consistency. Like, other people can say they can do X “if they tried” but if an ISFJ has been slaying at doing X, other types wont come close and able to produce the same output. If they did, they wont have the same consistency in giving the best work an ISFJ has. 
Of course, an ISFJ is only as strong as how much he or she develops his/her cognitive functions. If an ISFJ is unwilling to learn new things/skills bc of inferior Ne, for example, this wont allow dominant Si to grow, and that would just hinder the ISFJ in the long run. "
4865,isfj,Honestly I agree with you I'm planning on doing a post highlight my dominant function too reduce misconceptions  and biases that come from descriptions. Most of these descriptions are written by intutive types who have a poor understanding of what sensing functions are. I think Si Doms are specialists and have the potential to become experts at our fields. 
4866,isfj,"U lived with a Si lead?
Guessing no.
""HAY STOP WASHING DISHES IT IS MIDDLE OF NIGHT!""
""Um, okay, but it is morning.  The sun is up.""
""No it isn't and I am going back to bed.""
""Um, yeah it is look at the window.  It is morning.""
""IAM NOT LOOKING AT THE WINDOW.  BE QUIET.""
""oh i sooooooo vacuuming now""
Si leads dont care about reality, much like Ni leads.   "
4867,isfj,"Typically because they get bored of doing the same thing over and over.
100% agree.
Yeah this is probably more likely.
Can an inferior ever grow? I've always assumed that it's a lifelong struggle where you are unable to access the benefits of the inferior but are paranoid about its downfalls: i.e. INTP trying to be hyper careful with speech to not offend, isfj unrealistic Ne worries"
4868,isfj,"Of course your inferior function can develop. Humans aren’t fixed beings after all. But it’s a matter of being aware of your strengths and weaknesses to know what you should work on. I’ve noticed that I’ve become more self-aware because of MBTI and I use that to my advantage to improve myself. 
For example, being an ISFJ and learning and accepting how an ISFJ works best, I’ve realized a LOT of things about myself. My inferior Ne makes it //difficult// to imagine the big picture of my future. Like, if you ask me what career I want to pursue I burst into tears because i’m clueless af and i’m overwhelmed by too many things. So if that’s my weakness, what’s my strength? 
I’ve realized that I’m a creature of routine and I’m at my best when I have my day planned out. Within my plan, I put in small things here and there to develop my functions. To develop Ne, for example, I expose myself to new ideas and look up a lot of things on the internet. To develop Ti, I also do some reading, listening to debates, and just really training myself to ask questions and find answers. I try to learn as much as I can and I try to develop my skills. Point is, i’m focusing on the HERE AND NOW because it’s something I know I can do, and little by little, I’m solving my problem of my cluelessness at life by approaching the problem in a different way vs sitting down, thinking about the future, and bursting in tears bc i have no idea what to do with my life hahaha
...i might’ve gone off tangent a bit haha, but that’s just where I’m at in life rn. 
Tl;dr MBTI helps us pinpoint our strengths and weaknesses and taking advantage of our strengths to overcome our weaknesses can develop our inferior functions ✌🏽"
4869,isfj,"That’s subjective. What I mean by that is it depends on what the Si user finds interesting. Si users are skilled at For example, one Si user is interested in finance so they become an expert overtime through incremental learning and being tenacious. I believe Si users are skilled at logistical intelligence. Other types can become experts but are they willing to put in all the detail-orientated work to do it?"
4870,isfj,"Si is an expert in their own field, whatever it is.
Si can remember a lot of details, so if they are well versed on a topic, good luck besting us. 
Where other types have an advantage is if we are in a situation that is new/unfamiliar. Where Si has the advantage is if you are, essentially, in their own domain."
4871,isfj,"I wonder how to pass as an ISFJ, when I'm an ENTP.
Can y'all give me pointers to make my impersonation as convincing as possible ?
On a side note : it's mostly a pretext to ask y'all about your ISFJness, out of curiosity. I'm not sure I'll be able to pass as my complete opposite.
I can make a rather correct INFP impersonation, though."
4872,isfj,"Hey, are you that entp that made a post on /r/infj to call infjs shifty because they didn't talk about their minds in a non-abstract way? You have a similar writing style- not sure if that's an entp thing or a you thing. "
4873,isfj,"Yep, good pointer. Someone did that today or yesterday after I commented... Looked later at the ISFJ frontpage and the post was gone. I have also deleted quite a few of my posts after feeling embarrassed about writing them out."
4874,isfj,"Posted that on /r/INFJ.
There is two older ones, but I'm too ashamed of them to link them back to you.
I don't understand people who use factoids and specifics, so I don't understand why I would ever complain about INFJs talking only in metaphors an symbolics."
4875,isfj,"It will be really hard for me.
I just can't jet a stupid idea just pop in my mind and not act on it. =D
I suppose it's why we're only a bit less of 4% of the total population, instead of about 6%. We earned some unnoticed darwin awards …"
4876,isfj,"As you can see, we're a quiet bunch. -- Don't say much, keep yourself to the wall, and slip out quietly when no one is watching. When they ask you later where'd you go, just say you had a long day and needed to turn in early but it was great seeing everyone and you had a wonderful time. The end."
4877,isfj,"Hmmm, the similarity between you two is threefold:  
1, Curiosity about the sub's mbti type as the stated motivation. 
2, Playful, irreverent tone. Filled with emoticons and low density phrases that primarily convey the author's attitude/personality. 
3, Mildly insulting in an effortless- perhaps blithe- way"
4878,isfj,"I guess it wasn't you! (See my previous comment for why I thought so)
The entp I remember posted a thread challenging infjs to prove they could say exactly what was going on in their minds, instead of resorting to ""generalities."" Then he rejected everyone's response. It was a total shitfest, but also hilarious because the entp had no idea that it was :p"
4879,isfj,"That's why I'll need to pass as another type if I wanted to pull up this antic.
Honestly, I don't really anymore.
I was tired and I got this silly idea. I made the mistake thinking it was a good one.
At least I have a good pretext to talk with you guys !"
4880,isfj,"1)
Most ENTPs are deeply curious. Some just burst nearly constantly, unable to hide it, others are more contained and collected.
It's about age, I think. It means I'm fairly young, witch is true. I'm in my mid 20's.
2)
The playful tone is because I'm a troll. =D
I'm not a sadist, just someone who likes to dance around spouting random slurs. Playing the dumb.
For the emotions, I don't like to let other wonder about my intentions. I think the most sensitive can really anticipate my move better than those who use logic on me.
That's the point : promoting feelers and ethics. Break the standardized Thinker paradigm.
3)
How can someone be insulting and joyful doing it ?
I just bring back flaws of things and mock them. Never the flaws of people.
It's insulting only because people identify to those things that don't work, but it's not my concern or my responsibility.
I did my job, there. Taking measures is not my duty."
4881,isfj,"I don't need to be a thinker to know it's not about kung-fu, mojo or projecting a narcissistic persona.
It's about our inner flame, and we don't have to show it for those who care to see how bright it is.
Only ExTPs have little enough dicks to feel like showing everywhere they red sport car, they bough to compensate their lack of purpose and their fear of the future.
But I don't. Because I know everyone has this inner flame that reminds me that nothing can go wrong. I'm not naive. I know some use this power to hurt others and sit their influence.
But they forgot they didn't knew what to do once in power.
And they forgot that the most powerful and sacred power come from friendship and teamwork.
But thinkers forgot that with their cities of arrogant towers, made of cold steel and and colder glass, they lost what's really important. All that was built on concrete, more used to forget there is the corpses of those who sacrificed themselves on those undeserved pride's altars , more than anything else.
All technic and no heart. I'm a sick INFP who hide his disgust behind a mask of stupid wittiness.
I'm not an ENTP.

Feels or no feels ? =)"
4882,isfj,"Thanks for your perspective, very interesting. I understand how it matches up with the visible actions you have undertaken!
As for your question: 
First, here is the definition for blithe I was thinking of:
""showing a casual and cheerful indifference considered to be callous or improper.""
Here is what I am certain of: I have witnessed that the blithe way some entps talk about isfjs and infjs on the internet is mildly offensive to isfjs and infjs. 
And here is my hypothesis for why: IFJs have a fundamental emotional/valuational framework that they use to understand the world and themselves. The framework is not just a tool- it is their identity, and how they approach life. 
Not treating this framework with respect before questioning it feels to them like an attack (CORRECTLY OR INCORRECTLY) on who they fundamentally are. Here is the rub: You are welcome to keep doing only what you think is your job, and  ifjs will not blame you for it. You do you, you know? However, if you are actually curious what the fuck is up with ifjs- most won't open up to you if they feel threatened this way. "
4883,isfj,"Hahahahah!! Go you, you must've found the true special snowflake within your soul XD
Good banter sir....now I must reciprocate with an ENTP impression...it will come, but it will be a sneak attack when you least expect it "
4884,isfj,"Ugh. ""Rule followers.""
I really need to understand that. I have no idea what kind of thinking it is.
I know there is reasons, but it's pretty vague in my mind. So vague I prefer deciding in case by case if I respect some customs or not."
4885,isfj,"More like it, indeed. Google translate isn't as precise.
I'm really interested in y'all. And in INFJs.
So no insulting cheerful indifference.
Me too. I just learned to keep my jimmies in their sleeve, so they don't end up rustled too much.
I think the fact I'm able to use logical frameworks instead really helps. I'll be more broken by a surprise reveal, contrary to my worldview than by being questioned on my beliefs.
I don't know any other way to get input on someone's ethics other than questioning it.
I'm not sure I know that. I was justifying myself for so long I don't even remember I could just do things before asking for permission, or acting illegally.
Advice on alternative ways to do that without looking threatening ? "
4886,isfj,"It's genuinely cool of you to be interested in other mbti types, and other people's perspectives in general. :) Avoiding hurting people's feelings is my life's passion, so here's a massive wall of text. 
First, that ""you do you"" line is me covering my bases :s Because really, you don't have to do anything differently... unless you want to receive a different response, of course. 
So as to prying the deep dark secrets from the grabby hands of ifjs:
So no insulting cheerful indifference.
Here is something for you to consider that I, as a feeler, think is essential to communication: Even though you mean no offense, and would feel no offense in another person's place, that person can still feel offense. And they, as one of the unique and fascinating personalities bouncing around this space rock, feel fully justified in having those feelings which we may not understand. 
So even if one thinks these feelings are unjustified, even if one is searching for some greater truth which these feelings don't seem to be a part of, one still has to at least PRETEND to respect them and try to understand them in order to have a non-argumentative heart to heart. Feelings are some fuzzy shit yo, but they are really important to feelers. 
Anyway that was vague, so here are some tactics:
1, compliment sandwich: write your comment, and then go back and add something nice at the beginning and end. For example:
""Hello, first of all thanks for responding to my question! 
Anyway, that's what I do, but I'm curious to hear why you don't like drama.""
So you are questioning their point of view, while first affirming they are okay in having it. You are conveying that you are just curious, and not looking to fight or be mean. 
2, Ask open ended questions that invite people to explain themselves instead of challenging them to prove something or saying how weird you find something they do. 
Translated into ifj: ""I think you are stupid. I think I know better than you. Prove me wrong."" Regardless of what you meant, that's not inviting to ifjs. 
Here is your question with compliment sandwich and open ended questions. I've also taken the liberty to soften some of your personal opinions: 
""Thank you for your reply! Can you explain why you respect the rules so much? I really would like to understand that. It's pretty vague in my mind, since I prefer deciding in case by case if I respect some customs or not. I hope to hear your perspective.""
It's still questioning and saying how different you are. But it first affirms the other person's right to their feelings, so they don't feel attacked. And it hides how much contempt you feel for rule followers (because no one wants to feel they are in contempt). 
Once again, you are not obliged to do any of this. But I guarantee you'll get more personal, detailed, and interesting responses from ifjs if you compliment sandwich, ask open ended questions, and try hide your contempt for things they do differently than you. "
4887,isfj,"haha oh alright then.  My counter-attack will be in full light of day.  I'm going to have to go omohyoid more than omoplates.  Here's a small impression of an ENTP for starters...
XNFX: Wanna be friends? excited puppy face
ENTP: Unsubscribe"
4888,isfj,"Yay !
""Do like you always did and you'll get what you always gotten""
Considering insults and kicks in the stomach is what I got in the past, I think I need to do differently.
But there is still a shadow in my past I feel like prevent me to do otherwise.
A stone still hurt a person's head, regardless of the intent of whom thrown it.
I've registered that as a manipulation tactic. Big nope.
I thought I was just conveying curiosity. I really need to wrap my message in that blanket of preconceived niceties ? Wouldn't it totally cloud what I try to convey ?
And take the risk to have an unrelated answer ? I already have hard time to stay on topic.
I think you're right, in hindsight : relevancy isn't probably as important to most people as it is to me.
Ok. Let's try.
You're bringing really good points there ! I'm not really used to this kind of language structure. Can you tell me more about how you've come to such techniques ? I feel like it will really help me, in any case. Thank you !
The version I had in mind : 
It sounds bland. Not empty, just smooth. Too smooth. I prefer conveying warmth an cheer when I mean it, and still have the place for harshness and critic. It's still balanced but feels ironically mechanical. 
I tried to hide that, already. But I feel like I needed to display it anyway. I know I shouldn't be scornful, but I am.
And I wanted help to fix that, so hiding it would just have delaying that. Again.
For once, and I'm oddly happy about that.
I'm not sure. Maybe it has to do with that shadow of my past I talked earlier in this comment.
What does ""being non confrontational"" mean to you ?
I really like wall of text because they are often meaningful. But this one as so much meaning I need time to fully process it !
Thank you very much."
4889,isfj,"Use pop culture references instead of technical terms. We do that only when our interlocutor ask for it, or try to make some non nerdy person flee.
More than ""unsubscribe"", chances are you'll get more a meh shrug. It tells like ""I've seen too much cute cats on the internet, your technique don't work on me""."
4890,isfj,"I'm 19 years old and haven't discovered my passion. My friends are smart walking encyclopedias and I want to be like them. An example would be learning about capitalism. Without the will to read, my introductory book to capitalism is useless. It doesn't help that my brain can't absorb anything I'm forced to.
My next problem: friendships. When talking to some of my friends, I often have to walk on eggshells. I can't always be understanding, considerate and helpful. Sometimes their sensitivity and weakness come off as very stupid to me. These thoughts aren't revealed to them, but sometimes I slip. Cutting them off to find more suitable friends isn't an option because I care about them. And then there are my smart, matured and developed friends who are difficult for me to handle. Most of the time, I feel like we're not on the same wavelength and can't keep up with them.
I have no fucking idea what to do here. What kind of friend should I be? Which type of person am I?"
4891,isfj,"First I'll say you are 19 years old.  Most other 19 year olds also have no idea what they are doing.  I'm 33 and barely know what I'm doing most of the time.  If you see reading as a chore find a good netflix documentary on capitalism or get an audiobook on the subject to listen to while you are in the car.  As friends go I have learned over the years as an ISTJ to just keep my mouth shut.  Not many people want what I consider to be constructive criticism, they just want someone to talk to.  If asked ""what would you do, or what should I do.""  then I give my honest advice.  I'm always quick to apologize when I hurt people's feelings because honestly I don't think anyone intentionally means to just hurt people.  I try my best to explain ""hey sorry sometimes I don't see that I'm being an insensitive asshole"".  The best way to be a good friend and good at social situations is being around friends and in social situations.  It will take time to stop the 'slip ups' and learn to find the balance of being yourself and being too much of yourself.  "
4892,isfj,"Hey bro then the best thing about our personality is to explore! :) I did that and found my love for music and film photography. 
As for friends, find one or two who you can at least ramble to. And be with humble people :) "
4893,isfj,"This isn’t the best advice, but know you’re not alone. For me, I had to ride it out — I was lucky enough to be motivated in college, but I suffered in a lot of other areas, including friendships. At 24 I’ve come to terms with the fact that some people that you care for will not ever be those “close” friends, and that some people you consider “close” friends will never feel that way about you. You will find those people that mean everything to you and vice versa, even though it may take a few years.
With regards to “knowing what you’re doing” — good luck. Like I said, I’m 24, have a great job, have a good support system, and life is still throwing me huge curveballs. The secret is winging it indefinitely. And finding something that you enjoy — maybe not even in terms of a career; just something you like that you can pour some energy into. Running, hiking, learning, music. Anything."
4894,isfj,"Thinking is the weak spot of ISFJs, why you are going for more thinking sessions instead of real life experiences?
Make use of the creativity like 3 years old deep inside yourself to keep you moving and discover what makes you happy and tell you who you are."
4895,isfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/istj] How did you know yourself? I have no idea what I'm doing.

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
4896,isfj,"This. I hate being thought as “the quite guy” in a lot of situations because of this. Like believe me, have a LOT more to say than you really want to hear😂"
4897,isfj,"This. I never found the one thing, I found many things over the years. They were all meaningful and fun. I used to think I was lost and that I  needed to find my passion but I realized collecting information and experiences is my jam. "
4898,isfj,"I'm an ENTP/ENTJ and with assertiveness, I would say it just takes practice if it doesn't come naturally to you. You just have to know that you're right and accept the fact that even if you're wrong its okay because everyone is wrong at some point and everyone makes mistakes at least once in their lifetimes. "
4899,isfj,"I had the same issue. But with a mom who's an ESTJ and also a boss at work who is also an ESTJ, they've taught me to stand my ground on a lot of things if I know I'm right, even if it causes a discord or argument. I usually walk away from arguments because I can't be bothered over stupid things. But these ESTJ people know what they're talking about and the same goes for ISTJ (my sister). I take a lot of my braveness from those two types. 
As has been said above, it takes a hell of a lot of practice, and might I add, a lot of heartbreaks (on my part) to become more assertive."
4900,isfj,"i found it easier to be assertive the better i know myself and what i want or need and the better i understood the people around me.
there are people who are assertive because they just want stuff and they take stuff with little consideration toward others.
but for me, because i consider others so much, it was difficult at first.
but when i am self assured in myself, when i know what i'm about, and when i understand people enough to navigate around their needs, it feels more like i'm the adult in the room and what i want and need revolves around taking care of everyone else. and it's easy to be assertive about those goals. when i don't speak out, it's because i'm letting the others do their thing. and when it matters, when i feel like i have to step in, i do so with confidence because i know i have to do so and i have to get things done for the sake of me/them/everyone.
so assertiveness because easy only when i know what i'm about and when i care enough to do something about it."
4901,isfj,"I would say knowing that being assertive can end with the better outcome rather than being nice and demure to keep up with other people's sensitivities. Sometimes, everyone else needs to suck it up and be told the truth, even if it's by you."
4902,isfj,"I really like how this site describes the types by explaining how their cognitive functions work not generally but type-specifically.
Too many different things I want to quote haha -- hope someone else enjoys reading this!"
4903,isfj,"Hello my dear ISFJs. I am an ENFJ and my SO is an ISFJ. Not sure if this is important - age wise, we are more than a decade apart, him being the older one.
I am writing to ask if 1) I am showing my SO enough appreciation and 2) how I can communicate my needs without hurting him.
Firstly, my SO is the gentlest, most giving, and most loving soul I know. Loyal, intelligent, always The Eye of the storm. I love him to the ends of the world. He takes care of me in the littlest ways, which is a wonderful change because I am always the one who is taking care of people in my circle. I try my best to care for him in kind.
He travels overseas for work regularly, and I make it a point to show him more love and concern so he wouldn't feel lonely or homesick; I am always asking about his flight details so I can welcome him home no matter the time; I always encourage him to have fun while he's not working. I write little notes for him on little occasions, and I gift him with things he likes. I also thank him for every little thing he does for me.
Is there any other way I can improve? What am I missing out?
Here's the thing: I know he appreciates me, and I have told him that I understand that it is not easy for him to express his feelings (to which he nodded vigorously and sheepishly). I would NEVER push him to do what he is not comfortable doing.
However...my love language is words of affirmations :'( I told him that multiple times. Today, he told me he was lonely until I found him, and I told him that I wish he would say that more often because sometimes I feel unimportant. He would tell me ""if you weren't important I wouldn't xxx baby..."" I don't even expect much - I don't need declarations of love, but I would appreciate more ""I miss yous"" and ""I can't wait to see you"", things like that.
I feel like I'm holding back, a lot of the time. I want to shout to the world that I love him, but I don't want him to feel pressurised into saying it back. I told him that I care about him, and he would say that he knows, and give me kisses.
The fact that he travels a lot is an important point - for the last 12 years, he has been alone. I am the first girl he has opened his heart to, but I think his heart is still pretty guarded because one day he will leave for another country for work again and he wouldn't want me to go through all that pain. I think he has closed himself off to prevent himself from feeling all that hurt - of leaving his parents, his siblings, his nephews...
My approach is different - him and I, we probably have limited time together. I want it to be as transparent and as intimate as possible, and I don't care if it hurts when he goes. I just want him to know he is loved and cared for, and I feel so sad that he has to close his heart off to protect himself and the ones he love. 
I feel like a selfish bitch because he does allllll these things for me and logically I know he cares so much about me....yet I just NEED the verbal affirmations...yet I don't want to push him to do something he is not naturally comfortable with.
Help me, ISFJs... How do I broach this topic with him effectively?"
4904,isfj,"Bring it up gently, of course, and don't make it out to be something he's doing wrong, but rather something that would make you feel happy and loved. 
Have you talked to him about the love languages system? If you approached the topic that way, it could be your best bet. ISFJs tend to express our love through physical touch and acts of service, in my experience. Verbalizing our feelings can be extremely difficult for some of us, and it definitely doesn't come naturally for us.
ISFJs are generally very accommodating to our partners, and when we love someone, we'll be willing to bend over backwards to make sure they're happy in the relationship. You could start a discussion by asking him what you can do to make sure he feels loved, and see what happens. Odds are, he'll want to know what he can do for you, as well. 
Just be honest with him, and tell him that while you really appreciate all he does for you, and you know he loves you, it would make you really happy if he verbalized it once in a while. 
Personally, I needed to have that pointed out to me, when I was young. My INFJ mother sat me down when I was about 11, and told me that people need to actually hear that you love them, sometimes, and while it was all very sweet that ISFJs will break their own necks in acts of service for other people, sometimes an ""I love you, and you're special to me"" can go a long way. It was sort of a wake-up call for me, because that hadn't even really occurred to me before then, until it was pointed out. It still doesn't come naturally to me, but I do try to push myself harder now to be verbal about my feelings for people.
As far as making him feel loved, the subtle gestures go a very long way. I recently started dating an ESFJ, and he has this way of taking care of things for me, and predicting my needs before I even know them, and it just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside. He can tell immediately when I'm feeling tired, and he starts packing up to take me home, without me having to say anything. If I'm cold, he puts his arm around me to warm me up, without me even having to mention it. I went to an all-day event with him on Saturday, and he made sure ahead of time that there were vegetarian food options at every location, so I wouldn't go hungry. The little gestures like that mean a whole lot to an ISFJ. We spend so much time trying to take care of everybody else all the time, it feels very nice to be taken care of by somebody else without even having to ask for it, once in a while. "
4905,isfj,"You are already doing a very good job for showing an ISFJ appreciation. If I had a SO those things would mean the world to me.
The other topic is more difficult to me since I myself am quite open about my feelings. That you are saying that it means a lot to you the few moments that he speak words of affirmation is a good start. What Houndberry suggested about asking him first what he needs is a good idea. It's very likely that he will indeed return the question. A good way for him to learn it, although it may not be something that you could suggest, is if he makes a routine of it. Making it a routine is not the most romantic, but if he writes that he hopes to see you soon before he flies back, saying how he likes it to see you again when you pick him up (or welcome him at home) and that kind of things or even write in his agenda to say something of affirmation it will become easier for him to say it at other moments as well. Some things in life are scary or uncomfortable at the start, but after that it becomes a normal, but valuable skill for you.
For the approach of the time you have left together the only thing you can do is having an open conversation about it which you probably already had or tried to have.
You are not selfish from what you write. Good luck with it!"
4906,isfj,"I have always felt weird telling someone that I love them. It always seemed  unneccesary to me. I would really do anything for my family and girlfriend, and I love them, but I never told them. But I would start doing that for sure if I knew that they need that. "
4907,isfj,"I think he's missing the point. I think he thinks your beef is about whether he loves you enough, and doesn't realise that you're actually talking about how you want him to SHOW it. So maybe emphasise that. And definitely tell him this part:
This kind of feedback is super helpful for me because it's specific and also says that it doesn't have to be this huge, difficult/scary thing.
Good luck! :)"
4908,isfj,"Thank you so much for your input! :) 
I have been pretty explicit about the fact that I have Words of Affirmations as a top love language, and have always encouraged him when he gave them - ""I love it when you say that!"" I also asked him twice if his love language is Acts of Service, but he seemed to want to avoid the topic. 
Honestly, I think he is too used to being alone and is taking longer than usual to come out of his shell - which I am okay with. 12 years of being single, 17 years of being alone! I am willing to sacrifice my need for transparency if that is what makes him feel most comfortable."
4909,isfj,"Thank you so much for your validation!
I will definitely start asking him what I can do for him. Right now, I am on trial on error mode, because I have already asked him but he would always say, ""no baby, you don't ever have to do anything for me, just don't stress when you are with me."" I am a law student and get a lot of anxiety, so I understand him wanting to take care of my needs. However, I also derive most pleasure and happiness from taking care of my loved ones, HAHA.
And yes, I will try to encourage him more and have an open conversation with him :)"
4910,isfj,"Can I ask a few questions, if you don't mind?


How old are you?


Is not saying I love you a learned behaviour (from bad past experiences, or whatever reason), or something that is intrinsically you? My SO has no issue saying he LOVES his mother, but not me :(


What is the best case scenario for your loved one to approach you about needing to hear that you love them? I am afraid that I will break down crying and cause him to withdraw even further.

"
4911,isfj,"Thank you for your reply! I really appreciate it.
I've always been very assertive and straightforward, but this time around it's just so difficult. I know he hates conflict/ confrontation like most ISFJs, so I try my best to focus on his other ways of showing concern and therefore not subject him to it."
4912,isfj,"How long have you guys been together, just out of curiosity? I know in my case, it takes a fair bit of time before I feel entirely comfortable expressing my feelings verbally with somebody, and often times, it's only after they've expressed themselves verbally, first. 
For example, if I'm feeling crazy about somebody I'm dating, odds are, I'm not going to verbalize that or tell them, unless they confess similar feelings first. Even if I know they're interested in me, and they know I'm interested in them, a part of me always fears the rejection, and opening myself up like that makes me feel extremely vulnerable, so it's just not very likely that I'll come out and say it without a little prodding on their end. 
I'm personally trying to change this habit, but it feels very unnatural to me, and I could see it being even more difficult for an ISFJ who's been through different circumstances, is used to being alone, and/or is male, because male socializing doesn't put a lot of positive emphasis on verbal expression of feelings. "
4913,isfj,"I am 28 years old, but maybe my english proficiency is for 15 years old person. :)
I haven't  had bad experience with saying something like that. Maybe it's not isfj thing, maybe I just learned that from my family. We were always very close, but we never talked about loving each other. 
My girlfriend should just tell me honestly that she needs that. If I have find out that my SO write something like this for me, that would be more than enough. It would be even great, it's always nice to find out that you are needed (atleast for me). Just don't mention mother, some guys are pretty weird about it. :)
Btw, I am really new to mbti, so maybe this is not valid for all isfj people, it's just what I think."
4914,isfj,"Our situation is a peculiar one. First off, him, myself, and my other boyfriend, are all non-monogamous. I know this might seem very un-ISFJ of him, but I promise we are just normal people who have had to adapt to our circumstances.
He moved to my country about a year ago. Due to the nature of his job, he never got to settle down, and has been single for 17 years. He never thought it was right to leave a woman yearning for him while he travels for work. In the past, as a young expatriate, he had his fair share of flings and one night stands, with lonely but friendly professionals just like him (and a lot of alcohol). It never sat right with him, but a man has his needs. His colleagues would often push escorts and prostitutes to him - he had to accept to seal a business deal - but he would often send them home on a taxi once they have reached the hotel. Quintessential ISFJ - can't do the deed without a legitimate emotional connection.
My ENTJ boyfriend and I are budding non-monogamists (just discovering this part of ourselves), and met ISFJ on Tinder. His colleagues made him the account because they were worried about him being reclusive, and also because he was tired of being pursued by gay men when he is very heterosexual.
My ENTJ boyfriend and I never thought we'd be so lucky. ISFJ is perfect in every way - unbelievably caring, loving, respectful. ENTJ has ZERO worries about placing me in the care of ISFJ. We are 3 people who just really like and respect each other as human beings. From the beginning, ISFJ and I established that it would be a friends with benefits situation, except even we knew that we valued the friendship more than everything else :) When I first kissed him, he told me ""I have been waiting months and months for someone to kiss me and I am so happy that it is you.""
Along the way, I realised I am polyamorous. Not an issue for ENTJ or ISFJ. ISFJ and I act like a couple, but I don't need the confirmation. He hints at it sometimes, but I just wished I could hear explicitly that he cares, a little more. So there - he is perfect for us - ENTJ and I are way younger than he is, and he provides so much guidance and comfort to us when we experience hardships in our families, school, or work life. In return, ISFJ says I have brightened up his life as his companion. It's not a job to me. I genuinely care about him as a person, and I make that known without reservation. I believe he prefers to NOT be my ""main"" boyfriend, although I don't necessarily establish any sort of hierarchy. He is busy enough that he seems that way, practically.
He is so thankful to have me in his life, I really know. I told him once that I really enjoy Words of Affirmations and it makes me the happiest girl in the world. I think he could tell that I was wishing for more from him. The next day, he told me ""What I love about you, is how you open your heart to people you care about. I LOVE that about you."" It made me the happiest girl in the world, but I am truly a little broken inside because I think I am holding back more and more, whenever he doesn't respond to my verbal affirmations to him :(
Ah, that was a jumbled mess. We have been dating for...5 months, but because of this peculiar situation, it has been a lot of love right from the start. He is also older and mature enough (due to his job) to not have to go through all the niceties - he knows what he wants and did not hesitate in zeroing on it. In that sense, he did not need to be ""warmed up"", but I understand if vocalising his affection is not something he can do naturally.
Edit: I want to add, that there is nothing ""dirty"" or overtly sexual about our relationship. My boyfriends and I are so...normal. We have a lot of emotional validation and loving familial support amongst us, more than any kinky sex that people would typically imagine of non-monogamous relationships, haha."
4915,isfj,"Hmm, this is a bit of a tricky situation.
I can't read his mind at all, so really, any guesses I make as to what he's thinking are just gonna be grasping at straws.
Based on what I've heard, though, I'll give you my input as an outside observer.
ISFJs are generally pretty guarded when it comes to people, and I know in my case, I won't fully open up to somebody unless I can see it working over the long-term. When I fall, I fall very hard, and I have to protect myself in that way. If I don't see myself being with somebody for the long-term, I'm going to keep them at an arm's length. I might still really like the person, or love them, even, but I won't be able to really let myself fall head-over-heels for them, and I'm probably going to keep some emotional distance. I'm not likely to share my deeper thoughts or feelings with them, especially. 
It could be that he really loves and adores you, but maybe is having some trouble accepting the arrangement of your relationship. I, myself, could never do a non-monogamous relationship. If I liked someone enough, I could see myself falling into a situation where I tried it, just to try to keep that person in my life, but I couldn't see it lasting, for me. When I love somebody, I don't think I can share them very well.
There's also a bit of a social stigma around polyamorous relationships, and  I could see that being a roadblock for a lot of us, because ISFJs do generally care about societal standards and traditions. That could vary widely from person to person, however. 
On another note, I personally can't be pushed into affection with people. If I feel like somebody is getting needy, it shuts me down so fast. If I'm going to express my love and affection for somebody, it has to be on my own terms, and I just can't fake it or force myself to say things that I don't mean, for their sake. If I express affection for somebody, it's gotta be genuine, because otherwise I feel like I'm lying to myself, and I just can't do it. 
If you want my advice, I would suggest giving it a little more time, and try not to push or pressure him into anything. If he's not receptive to it, definitely don't ask him probing questions, because that rarely goes well. If we're going to share things, we'll share them in time, but it can't be forced out of us. 
If you can, try to be conscious of not getting needy when it comes to verbal affection. I know that's probably very hard for you, because in my case, when physical affection is my main love language, it's easy to feel deprived and unloved, if I'm not getting any. But if possible, just try to consciously pay attention to the ways that he is expressing his love for you, and appreciate that for what it is. The fact of the matter is, we can't change other people. If verbal affirmations aren't one of his love languages, it's probably never going to come very naturally to him, and he may end up feeling like there's something wrong with him, that he can't fulfill your needs like that. "
4916,isfj,"I understand, thanks for your input!
I have a few responses:
First, I think he's actually more than happy with this arrangement - happier than if I were monogamous and single really, because if I were, he would likely feel very pressurised to commit to me. My Mother is also an ISFJ and I understand the resistance towards non-monogamous relationships, but my ISFJ is different - because of his life experiences and work needs, he does not believe in monogamy. He believes that people can love more than one and in an ethical manner. He told me that if he were to ever find a long term partner to legally settle down with, she has to have the same mindset as I do towards love and relationships.
Two, I completely understand what you mean by loving within limits, and I think I can sense that from him. He is used to a life of leaving behind the people he loves, and would want to continue protecting himself and me as well. A little reservation is necessary, and I can accept that.
Three, I also understand that ISFJs can fall hard and that it scares them. He has spoken to me about this before. It is so wonderful and adorable. He is constantly involving me in his life - buying my favourite snacks when he shops for groceries, even when I'm not with him, buying me bath bombs, sending me pictures of his lunch, etc. I really genuinely appreciate it and thank him for everything.
Four, I'm probably not as needy as I appear in this post 😂 Trust me, us ENFJs are extremely conscious of how we appear to others too. I probably see him twice a month due to conflicting schedules, but he makes it a point to talk to me every day. I have never expected him to do so, and I am always ready to have our dates cancelled, because work takes priority. The fact that he does so anyway should indicate to me that he cares.
Five, thank you! Honestly, talking about everything has helped me understand how much he cares. I will definitely heed your advice and try to focus on his love language - acts of service and touch."
4917,isfj,"Aw man, seeing him twice a month could be the biggest problem here, honestly. 😂
Based on what you've said, it definitely sounds like he really loves and cares about you, and it sounds like he's cool with the non-monogamy, so that probably isn't the issue.
For me, it takes me some prolonged time being around somebody before I'm cool with verbally expressing things. If I was only seeing somebody twice a month, I don't think that would be enough for me to open up very much, because I'd feel like I was only just getting used to being around them  again before they left. Even with people I know pretty well, when I first see them again after some time apart, I have to spend some time with them before I start to share very much. And even then, my levels of sharing are much lower than yours may be, as an ENFJ, just because ISFJs are such private people to begin with. 
Have you ever spent more prolonged periods of time with him, more frequently? That could really solve this entire problem. 😊"
4918,isfj,"True. I ask him a lot of questions all the time, and he is always ready to answer them. I realised that he speaks in 3rd person when he is slightly avoidant of the sensitive topic at hand (""You know, sometimes people will come and go in your life... You just learn to deal with it, even if it hurts your heart...""), which is super cute HAHA. I tend to just want to bare my soul to people I care about and have an emotional validation session haha.
Thank you so much /u/HoundBerry, you are very sweet for taking the time to answer my questions :)"
4919,isfj,"Hello ISFJs! Anything will help, but here’s some details: Long story short, I’ve been into this girl for way too long and gone nowhere. We’ve been on a few informal dates randomly over the past few years, but nothing more has happened. The word ‘awkward’ comes up way too much between us and is probably the best way to describe our interactions. I honestly feel like I really don’t know her as she has never even slightly ‘opened up’ to or around me, she is very quiet and seemingly anxious. In other words, it seems like her personality hides like a turtle in it’s shell whenever I’m around. But somehow I can’t seem to get my mind off of her. I admit, I see her as being very attractive, but do also admire her personal traits. At this point I feel like I might have tried too many times (like planning one date which is followed by nothing). But still we ‘text first’ just as much as each other. 
Please help, I’m really confused, can’t get her off of my mind, but am hesitating to even initiate conversation one more time. 
Thanks! "
4920,isfj,"ISFJs are typically reserved around people until we warm up to them, at which point we become more comfortable (this usually takes me several weeks of regular interaction). It seems to me that in your case, you just haven't been around each other enough yet for her to open up to you on the next level.
Take the initiative and make it clear that you are interested. You have to be the one to get the ball rolling. If you begin to open yourself emotionally to her and she is actually interested, she will probably respond in kind. ISFJs are like an emotional onion, and it takes some time and effort to work your way through the layers."
4921,isfj,"My ISFJ told me she gets nervous around ESTJs. We discussed the fact that the ESTJ is the ISFJ's natural supervisor (in Socionics Model A) and she said she thinks there's something to that. ESTJs don't really seem to take her feelings/information as seriously as she'd like, and the information/feelings coming from ESTJs can hit her pretty hard in a very direct way. When she gets feedback from ESTJs or even just a response, it is often corrective in nature. Just sharing this in case it helps you figure out how she may be experiencing your relationship."
4922,isfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/estj] I’m an ESTJ guy who’s into an ISFJ girl, can anyone give some advice??

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
4923,isfj,"Thanks!
But I must express that the few stretches (never more than a few days or so) that we have spent time together, I quickly begin to think that she is not interested (which might be true, but I have heard otherwise and also, as an ESTJ, tend to completely miss emotional queues) and that I should stop seeing her to prevent being too pushy or aggressive. 
Do you think I should just persist a bit longer?
Or am I actually being pushy and am/will be at risk of hurting/scaring/annoying her?"
4924,isfj,"If you are still interested in her, I would just ask her plainly if she feels the same way. If she says that she isn't interested, then just move on, no harm done. If she says she is interested, go from there.
If you aren't good at reading emotions and want to know where you stand, you're just gonna have to man up, be direct, and communicate with her. If you do it in a way that's sincere, you are not going to scare her! 
As an ISFJ, I can say that I personally would appreciate it if someone who was interested in me was the one to break the ice and tell me directly."
4925,isfj,"ISFJ's often like homemade, DIY stuff, gifts that come from the heart or at least have some thought behind them. But honestly you just need to get her a gift that shows you know her and know what she likes in some way. If she reads pick out a book that sounds good for her. If you know her favourite candies/chocolate buy some of those for stocking stuffers that I assume she'll have if she takes Christmas seriously. You could get her a gift card or something for a pedicure/manicure (maybe a massage if you think she'd like that) if you wanted to go with the experience gift. If you put effort in and try I'm sure she'll recognize it and be happy. Get a nice card and write something sweet and meaningful in it and you should be set."
4926,isfj,"ISFJs appreciate when you put thought and effort into a gift - if it's something you can create yourself, all the better. My mother's an ISFJ and the best present I ever gave her was a collection of CDs I made with 1960s pop songs she used to listen to as a kid. Money's not an issue so much with ISFJs - they like when you pay genuine attention and choose with care.
That said, is your GF into makeup? If you're crafty she'd might love a custom-built battle station/vanity.  "
4927,isfj,"Yes, definitely write a card from the heart. ISFJs love true honesty. Have a purpose for every gift that you get her. Has she mentioned anything that she is interested in pursuing? I went through a big drawing kick and my sister got me pencils and paper. It wasn't an expensive gift but I liked it so much because she supported my interests and showed she was listening to me. Hope that helps!"
4928,isfj,ENTP here. She seems interested but gives only short answers and it's hard to get her to talk about herself. Any tips? Does she want me to share more about myself so she feels more comfortable in sharing about herself?
4929,isfj,"I am absolutely horrible at talking about myself, and even when I do, I manage to find a way of making it turn into a question to ask the other person. 
One way that helps me open up is when someone asks me a very personal, or thoughtful question. Something that can lead to a meaningful discussion, beyond the whole ""What do you do for work?"" or ""What's your favourite food?"" If you feel brave enough and think she may be responsive to it, try asking some questions on this list: https://blog.udemy.com/thought-provoking-questions/ Good luck!! :)"
4930,isfj,This was good advice. I took the information and went a little different way with it. I won't go into details cause maybe she's on this subreddit and I'd like to have a little more mystery than what my reddit account provides.  Thank you!
4931,isfj,"Two people I know are ISFJ's, one is my best friends boyfriend, the other is my sisters fiance. I found it funny that these two people I'm close to have ended up with SO's of the same personality type to me but that's besides the point. When I talk to the guys, it feels like I completely understand them to the point where I don't even need to talk to them because I know what they're feeling and how much they probably don't want the attention on them in that moment, and little things like that. I'm so perceptive of other people's comfort levels but nobody can ever tell what I'm thinking and suddenly I've met these people where if they caught on to how similar we were they'd know exactly what was going through my mind and that's kind of unsettling. 
On a slightly unrelated note, I also know I would work terribly with someone of the same personality type to me if I were in a relationship. I bounce off of people's outward personalities, and quirky qualities that are different to my own. I've only realised that since meeting people of the same type to me, not sure if anyone else has had that experience?"
4932,isfj,I haven't met another ISFJ that I know of in real life. But I can understand how it might be a bit of a challenge to be in a relationship with someone who is the same type. But type doesn't make the person who they are. 
4933,isfj,"I've been a cat person my whole life mostly because of bad run-ins with dogs, but now I'm reeeally wanting a really big brute dog for some reason. They're just so big and cuddly and wanna be friends with everyone. Still love my cat though.. So no preference, both :)"
4934,isfj,"I love both dearly. I have a cat, which was a recent and impulsive decision. Never thought I'd actually get one but I am VERY glad I did. She's super sweet and loves cuddling with me. The other pets I have owned are sugar gliders, own two currently and they're absolutely perfect for me. They sleep all day so when they're bonded to you they can just have them sleep in your shirt, pocket or a bonding pouch around your neck. It's just really relaxing to have them with me. Plus, play time is lots of fun."
4935,isfj,"Am cat person, but also like dawg.
But for real. I like dogs, I just personally can't own one. They're high maintenance, and I'm more into pets who can do their own thing while I feed and clean their boxes. My cat is super chill, so I'm good with him.
Dogs you hafta take on walks and make sure they get the right exercise. I like dogs when they belong to other people and are trained properly! Pitbulls are adorable."
4936,isfj,"I'm just an animal person in general.
I currently own a dog but don't own a cat (that's changing in August, though!) I love dogs and cats in different ways. For me it's more about my connection with an animal. I just ""click"" with certain animals. I feel a deep connection with my dog, and had one with my previous cat before she passed away."
4937,isfj,"I am more of a cat person. I like dogs but there are alot about dogs I don't like. And I am also afraid of dogs. If I go over to someone's house and they have a dog, I ask ""what kind, How Big"" and just stay in the car...LOL Somtimes i ask if they can put it up and i hide behind my husband..haha"
4938,isfj,"I'm interested in how a person's circumstances shape their personality. I believe my own personality was in large part determined by my upbringing, and I can point specifically to my father, my religious background, and my first relationship as large influences on who I am today. But these experiences, without going into detail, are specific to someone who types as INTP.
I'm curious about the experiences that might shape an ISFJ. I'm planning a story with a protagonist who loosely fits into that type, and I need some inspiration and reference for backstory and character details.
What from your past makes you you?"
4939,isfj,"The entirety of our existence shapes us, most importantly though we shape ourselves regardless of circumstance.
Though how can we define ourselves at all? ""We"" only exist as a thought in our sense of self. True self is without form! :)"
4940,isfj,"Religious upbringing that made me resent religion but it’s engrained in me to BELIEVE in the higher power- without practicing. 
Lost my father at an early age (cancer) and since he was our source of income, we struggled a lot financially. For 20+ years, I’ve been at the poverty line, and still at 26 I’m struggling more than ever before. But that’s also my fault bc as an ISFJ, I tend to use all of my resources to help/do things for my loved ones. 
Anyway, the whole religious thing has prevented and still prevents me from experiences in life, because in my mind they’re ‘bad things’, but most people would consider as fun/normal. Plus, those things are extra and not in the budget. I guess they go hand-in-hand. "
4941,isfj,"Yes, I think this type of thing is significant as well. I'm sorry you had to go through that, danysiggy. 
Growing up at a really young age because of dysfunctional adults in my life changed me. I needed to take care of myself and make sure 3 younger siblings were as safe as they could be in bad situations. "
4942,isfj,"I know we're all a bunch of private, modest, shy people who would rather put the focus on somebody else.
But let's face it.
We all probably put in a fair bit of effort on our appearances, so why not take a moment to showcase that?
I'm also curious to see what we all have in common when it comes to appearances.
You guys go first.
I'll share when all the focus is off of me. 😄"
4943,isfj,"Well, since everybody is leaving me hanging, I'll bite the bullet and go first.
I have a perpetual baby-face and look much younger than I am.
http://imgur.com/a/VS5vk
There, that's me.
Now somebody else jump in here and share before I feel awkward."
4944,isfj,"I'm pretty self-conscious, so I'm a bit reluctant to post my picture. A few of you did it though, so I guess I'll join in. 
I have a lazy eye, so that's why one of my eyes looks a bit off. 
http://s5.postimg.org/qxgq34dl3/IMG_20150521_1.jpg"
4945,isfj,"You're so pretty, and I love your eyebrows! 
I actually just shared my pictures for another subreddit's ""what do you all look like?"" so I'm gonna copy-pasta that! 
I can't wait to see others' pictures. I wonder if there will be any physical trend among us! "
4946,isfj,"I just took this test today and found out I am an awesome ISFJ, then obviously I came to reddit to figure out more and found this thread. 
All of you ISFJs look like such kind people! Very cool. "
4947,isfj,"Just curious how many have taken the Big 5 test to compare and what your numbers looked like. I took the one at: http://personalitylab.org/tests/bfi2_self_pol.htm
Extraversion - 29
Agreeableness - 79
Conscientiousness - 92
Negative Emotionality - 44
Open-Mindedness - 56
for the longest time I thought I was INTJ until I retook a few tests which placed me here as ISFJ. I'm a male in my late 20s in case anyone cared.
Cheers! "
4948,isfj,"It's interesting because openness to experience is highly correlated with iNtuition, to the point where they're probably the same construct. Obviously it's not as simple as 0-100 with 49 being a sensor and 51 being intuitive, but I'd love to see a true comparison between sensors and intuitives and their openness scores!
I'm an INTJ and my scores were:
Extraversion: 56
Agreeableness: 62
Conscientiousness: 73
Negative emotionality: 65
Open-mindedness: 81"
4949,isfj,"Never heard of this test but I decided to take it. I connect mostly with the ISFJ description and that is what I have tested to be twice before. Early 20's. 
Extraversion - 54
Agreeableness - 73
Conscientiousness - 69
Negative Emotionality - 40
Open-Mindedness - 79"
4950,isfj,"I've known an ISFJ for half a year now and I think we click quite well but he seems very shy at social events and more often than not isn't willing to step out of his comfort zone.
any advice on how I can help him out in that regard and is there any material that he may find interesting or helpful like books etc?
what do you all generally think of ENTJs? I would love to read some of your experiences and interactions with ENTJ! 
he has also agreed to come for social events and make new friends the next time I ask him out so that's good progress I think! "
4951,isfj,Hi! Isfj here! I am in a relationship with an entj and we have been together 5 year and will also be getting married next year! So isfjs and entjs make good friends/companions as I feel he is also my best friend =) with what you are concerned about you must understand the difference between and extrovert and and introvert. You as an extrovert get energized being around people while for an introvert it takes energy away from from them to be around people. With this in mind yes introverts can be around people but not for extended periods of time. So you should take that in to consideration with you are out with your isfj. It also seems that your isfj friend is willing to go out with you if you are with them so don't try to push them to hard and expect them to act like a extrovert. I hope I have helped! 
4952,isfj,"Entj with isfj sibling here. My advice is: run while you can. The J clash is horrendous, I have a lifetime of experience; save yourself the trouble haha.
Though one of my best friends is also isfj. So in all seriousness: Isfj are quiet and loyal but sensitive, they work so hard for romantic relationships and friendships, almost to the point that they put them before family. They seem to cling to whoever is nicest to them. And they like small nice gestures. They have a lot of trouble letting go, almost to an obsessive degree. Just be aware of this and good luck not stepping on their toes cuz they hold grudges forever.
I myself am dating an istj... replace the f function with a t function and now you have something much more compatible with entj.
Sorry this answer is not as encouraging as you would have wanted."
4953,isfj,"My only complaint: Ne would also consider things like ""what if we had a circular peg?""  Changing the situation is one of my main ways of coming up with new ideas.  Swapping out conditions or objects from possible scenarios.  My very first thought upon seeing the problem was to chop off the excess.
I think Ni's plot out the points they want to hit, then connect the dots.  Ne's just ""test"" every possible option and when they find a good option, they see the whole thing at once."
4954,isfj,"I have next to no difference between Ni and Si, so maybe I have a bit more insight into this? Both the looking at core ideas and looking at specific facts are things I do. I think I do both at the same time, like I'll know a substantially-larger-than-average amount about topics that are interesting, but I'll also be able to see the theories behind them fairly easily. If I'm understanding the difference correctly."
4955,isfj,"
I have one each as relatively close friend and am ISFJ myself, and I have to say that both types do appear rather similar. Many times we have similar interests, which show more easily with Fe.
As an ISFJ, Ni gives me more grief, despite having pondered a lot about it (I know many XNTJ people, so it's hard not to consider it). It's like their intuition is magic that pops out from nowhere at times! At least with Si, I've usually experienced something before, or can point to where it's coming from.
I have at least one friend of each INFJ and ISFJ, but I would have to say that I've encountered more ISFJs. 
"
4956,isfj,"I’ve taken the MB twice and always get ISFJ.  I was hoping the second time to read up on my type to find out how to better interact with people.  I lost my twin/best friend to suicide 9 months ago and have been trying to survive this period of my life.  Being introverted and keeping it inside has not been ideal, but I struggle with finding a way to express my the immense amount of grief I feel on the daily.  
The only person I felt close enough to share my thoughts with would have been my twin who took his life.  My wife has been helpful but the relationship they had makes it difficult to to fully open up to her.
I’m doing grief counseling which helps, but it’s not like having a friend to confide in.  I also do a support group which I am sure most of you an imagine doesn’t help too much.  I speak up plenty for an introvert, I just don’t like sharing what’s really going on inside my head.  I’d rather offer insights to people and help them than share my problems with the group.  
I’ve read a few books, tried to use the experience/knowledge from them but I still can’t seem to get back to normal.  My normal introverted alone time has become a nightmare, usually I do nothing but scroll reddit or wish I had someone I felt comfortable enough to really express myself to.  I probably feel my worst alone which is counter intuitive, I’ve tried journaling to my twin but because of the nature of his suicide it hasn’t been ideal.  
I met a guy who lost his twin the same way ten years ago, and I have met with him a few times.  I find these conversations very helpful but I also feel like I am inconveniencing him since it feels one sided.  
Thanks for reading this far.  Just writing out all this has helped.    If anyone has tips for dealing with something like this I would greatly appreciate it.  "
4957,isfj,"Hey OP, I don't really have any specific advice, but my heart goes out to you. When I'm struggling emotionally I alternate between isolating and desperately reaching out to anyone I can think of. I think finding a healthy way to grieve is key. Art can be very cathartic. I write poetry when I'm depressed. I have bipolar and have been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. I know it would hugely impact the people around me and I apologize on behalf of people like me to you and everyone who has been impacted by the suicide of a loved one. It's even heartbreaking to me that there's a part of my brain that is like that. Maybe this isn't helpful, but all I can say is I'm sorry. "
4958,isfj,"OP, it pains me to hear that you are going through this situation. I don't claim to be an expert counselor, but here's a few thoughts I had based on my own experiences:
I would encourage you to keep up your conversations with this man who went through the same situation that you are experiencing. I know that as ISFJs, our gut reaction is to assume that we are inconveniencing others; but if this man has already had multiple conversations with you already, that's an indication to me that he is more than willing to help you.
The worst thing you can do is bottle these feelings up. Bottling up will conceal your emotions for a time, but it won't make them go away. When my grandfather passed away, I bottled up my emotions and didn't seek comfort from anybody. I rationalized this action be telling myself I needed to be strong for my family. But refusing to acknowledge the need to express my emotions and release that pressure did nothing but cause all of those pent-up feelings to burst out all at once 10 months later in a very unhealthy matter.
I guess my point is that it's imperative for you to find some sort of outlet for your frustrations. That's probably gonna be continuing your conversations with this man you met, or somebody else you feel comfortable talking with (friend, family member, minister, etc.). I also highly recommend you take up some kind of new activity to help you take your mind off your worries (I put on a Hardcore History podcast and take a nice, long hike. Whatever works for you). 
I suppose the key to grieving is to take control of it. Grief is natural and appropriate, but don't allow it to dictate your life. Personally deciding when, where and how you will grieve will releave pressure and act as the spillway that prevents the entire emotional dam from collapsing."
4959,isfj,"Hey thanks for reaching out.  I tried your poetry idea I actually cried a bit so I think it was cathartic, appreciate the idea.  
I feel bad just thinking about what you said about being apologetic.  My twin was the last person who wanted to die.  He would take so many vitamins and was very into his health, even before he got sick in the head.  Just don’t know how to deal.   "
4960,isfj,"Thank you for the advice!   I’ll try to get better at reaching out.  I started playing a musical instrument which is something I’ve never done before, so hopefully that can help distract myself when I need something totally different.  "
4961,isfj,"Kay Redfield Jamison has a book about suicide called Night Falls Fast. I've only read excerpts, but her other books about bipolar were hugely important me to coming to terms with my diagnosis (she herself has bipolar). She is a very skilled and compassionate writer, and is well known in the field of psychiatry. Even as someone who oscillates between not wanting to go on and making ambitious long term life plans, it's hard to describe what the difference is. Sometimes I can forget about the existential dread and sometimes it crushes me and even getting out of bed seems impossible. I take 10+ pills a day between the vitamins, supplements, probiotics, and medications, but the depression still catches up to me every now and then. Maybe someday scientists will figure it out but until then we all just keep trying to deal. Again, I'm so sorry for your loss and what you're going through. I'm glad the poetry may have helped some. "
4962,isfj,"How comes ISFJs find it so hard to communicate by writing?
My S/O finds it hard to get her thoughts into writing. Its making it hard for her to succeed in her job.
Has any ISFJ found a way to improve this?"
4963,isfj,"For me, it’s the opposite. I find that having the time to really refine my thoughts is exactly what I need to properly express what I’m thinking. If I have to do explain myself off the cuff, I often times get flustered, self-conscious, and have difficulty formulating cohesive sentences! "
4964,isfj,"I think the only way to get better is writing frequently on your own,  no deadlines. I'm good at writing objectively but my own thoughts?  I can't even speak it because I can't find the words or I'm worried about the perception of me.  "
4965,isfj,"I actually find it very easy to get my thoughts into writing - my thoughts are usually linear, somewhat organized (and when they're not, I'm having what I call ""Ne thoughts"" where I'm thinking outlandish and random things, making mental connections between things that are happening in my life, reflecting and figuring things out and thinking, ""Oh my god, if they said this, that means that happened... and what if this happened too?  Actually, hypothetically, what if that happened?"") 
Are you sure your SO is an ISFJ?"
4966,isfj,"I have the opposite problem. Usually, it’s easier for me to convey thought through writing than by speech. My mouth can’t keep up with my brain sometimes so it’s easier to write thoughts down without being pressured by someone waiting for me to finish my thought.
Also, what is her job?"
4967,isfj,"I am far better at communicating via text, and am terrible at phone calls and very anxious in person. A lot of my activities at work get delayed unnecessarily because I am just too nervous to make that initial phone call or meeting request."
4968,isfj,"What alignment would you say you are?
By alignments I'm referring to something like this, like from Dungeons and Dragons:  http://easydamus.com/alignment.html
I'd probably be somewhere between lawful good and lawful neutral. I hate injustice, but I often am too anxious to go out and stand up to bullies. I also don't usually break the rules, like for example I don't really torrent because I like to pay to support content. I kind of admire the system of rules and roles that makes up our society.
But then also sometimes I speed and do other minor things like that, so... I have some self interest marring it, but otherwise I try to be the best person I can within the constraints I have."
4969,isfj,"I would say I'm neutral good. I really dislike when people break legitimate laws and rules, especially if it's for personal gain, but I think doing the right thing is more important that just doing things by the book."

Edit- I just realized that the first one I posted  was rotated. Here is the chart as I first got it. 
http://imgur.com/b7aym0a
Interesting that it's similar to a lot of yours"
4971,isfj,"This is my result chart! I did it on my phone, which was a pain in the ass, but ultimately interesting to see.
Edit: I'm seeing quite a few similar shapes here between the comments..."
4972,isfj,"I still can't really determine if I am a Si-dom or a Fe-dom.
What I've noticed is that I am energized by interactions with certain people and not others. If it's a person who I want to like me, then I get almost ""high"" on the interaction with them to the point where I am jumping out of my skin. When it is someone who I could hardly care about, I get ""drained"" and just want to whither back into my shell.
The folks I ""like"" seem to be the type of people who I feel I have to work towards, or I actually accomplished something by being accepted by them. As in, I had to carefully manipulate my personality to get them to like me. As in, I can't just sit there and do nothing and expect them to gravitate towards me. The people I am drained by are people who are very very interested in me for, what seems to be, absolutely no reason at all. Like, I can be completely boring and unengaging around them, and they wouldn't give a shit; they'd treat me the same.
I also get drained by the presence of people who I think have treated me poorly in the past, and ""introversion"" shoots out.
Finally, I notice that I talk out loud a lot when I'm thinking.
Can any of you guys relate to this? Or am I probably more towards Fe?"
4973,isfj,"How do feel about having many social obligations? As an ISFJ, I can be alone for a while without getting lonely and it's much harder to get to know me compared to ESFJs. Most of the ESFJs I know are on the go all the time and are constatnly connecting with other people. Also do you prefer a small group of close friends or large group of acquaintiences?
This is also a good thread with the differences between the two. 
https://www.personalitycafe.com/sjs-temperament-forum-overseers/1171186-esfj-vs-isfj.html"
4974,isfj,"I found myself certain that I was an ISFJ after I read about the inferior functions - inferior Ne was something I immediately related to, as opposed to inferior Ti.  Do you think your Ne is inferior or your Ti?"
4975,isfj,"The difference is actually a bit confusing for me since even aux-fe wants to ""fit in with the group and make everyone comfortable"". I interpret the difference as Fe-dom is a bit of a leadership role, meaning they want to boost the morale of the group as a whole. Whereas Fe-aux is more of a behind-the-scenes instigator of harmony, and would rather work with people one-on-one than all together at once. Is this true? "
4976,isfj,"This is a tad difficult for me to answer as I have social anxiety and struggle to make friends most of my life. What's ""a while"" to you for being alone?
I think, due to my anxiety, I prefer close friends as I can ensure they truly care about me, and there are no jerks in vicinity who will real havoc. However, somehow I feel the happiest when I am ""at one"" with a large group of people. I.e. when someone posts a relatable comment and they get a lot of likes, so I know I'm similar to lots of people in that regard. Also, I had lots of fun at bingo night where there were 30-ish people. I think I am fine having a large group if and only if everyone is on the same page and everyone is being included. I just might not personally be very social due to anxiety, and allow others to take control and be the center of attention. 
One thing that stood out to me in that thread is the person saying Si-doms are ""super detail oriented"" and ""super in tune with their bodies"" which is true for me but I've met those who are even more so these things.
I also am very detailed about people's faces... but otherwise struggle to be detail oriented in general. "
4977,isfj,"Sounds like you’re on the right track. The way I understand it, Fe dom is the most comfortable and adept at identifying and nurturing social harmony.  The further Fe gets from the 1st position, the less competent the person is at handling social iniquity. 
My ENFJ (Fe dom) friend can immediately identify if something is off in our group and works instantly to alleviate the tension with humor and a talk-it-out approach. My INFJ (Fe aux) friend also can immediately identify social problems, but reacts in a less constructive way, usually with exasperation and irritability. I think the reaction is helpful to show where Fe is in the stack."
4978,isfj,"I think a while is like 8 hours or even a day with minimal people interaction. I would suggest you read descriptions of introverted sensing and extroverted feeling found at this link https://www.psychologyjunkie.com/2018/02/23/introduction-cognitive-functions-myers-briggs-theory/
​
Then after you're done with that think about your first go to function in every situation. (Si or Fe?) Then the difference will become more clear. Also read up on Inferior Ne (ISFJ) and Inferior Ti (ESFJ) more and see which one you relate to more. "
4979,isfj,"The inferior function shows differently in different people, but for many Si-doms (including me,) it is indeed true that inferior Ne can make us think up negative possibilities - for me, this only really tends to happen when I'm stressed.  I'll find myself worrying about things that have not happened, or trying rapidly to prepare myself for what COULD happen.  Inferior Ti is a bit more than insecurity about intelligence, and once again, it does come out differently in every Fe-dom - for example, I've noticed that some Fe-doms have a general lack of self-analysis, which can lead them to not understand or not recognize something that may be obvious to others.  
It also depends on whether you feel you use tertiary Ti or tertiary Ne - as an ISFJ, I use my tertiary Ti to analyze my past mistakes, rationalize my problems and make an effort to develop an understanding of them that feels true to me, find ways to actively improve myself and be self-critical, etc.  "
4980,isfj,"Hello! I am sorry I am responding to you so late, but you wrote something very interesting. I am leaning towards ESFJ strongly now, but there is still occasional doubts in my mind. I am wondering how does inferior Ne manifest to you?"
4981,isfj,"Yes. I don't think I heard this before, but I knew where the joke was going once I read 'quizzical'...
but as I think of other similar jokes, I would have to say...
I need to heard out loud/see it written out."
4982,isfj,"Married to one. We are completely opposite of each other but still have the same goals in life, so it works well. There were many times when we butted heads early in the relationship while we were still learning how we communicate. For example, I’m more reserved with my word while he spoke whatever come to his mind. ENTPs also tend to debate their way out of things, but I’ve learned how to handle that as well."
4983,isfj,"At this point in my life, all the ones I've met have pissed me off lol. They've mostly struck me as needlessly argumentative (and not in what I would consider a fun, respectful, debatey kind of way; it's always been more of a stubborn, ""well you're wrong"" kind of tone) and needlessly rude, which, as an ISFJ, are two of the worst things you could possibly be imo. They've also tended to come off rather condescending and/or self-pitying, which is a combination that's pretty much guaranteed to raise my blood pressure. 
I am always interested to see that there are ISFJs who have had wonderful experiences with them though, and I hope some day I'll be mature enough to meet a similarly mature ENTP and get along well. "
4984,isfj,"Well I'm basically doing research now :P 
Thank you. "
4985,isfj,"Hi friends! I am an unwavering ISFJ, and have been struggling lately with my purpose on this earth, why any of us are here, etc. I’ve seen a couple posts on this sub about this topic, but I want to take it a step further. 
The part I’m struggling with most is how I spend my time. I’m a recently graduated 24yo F, and I just got my first job post-grad school in an amazing research lab (immunology) at one of the best universities in the world. I am so lucky to have this opportunity, and I still pinch myself sometimes that I’m here, but I find my self feeling so often that I’m not doing what I love or what I’m passionate about. This job is mentally exhausting, so by the time I’m done with work, I have little motivation to be social, explore hobbies, etc. I feel that I am constantly being emptied and don’t know how to fill myself back up.
I’m also so interested in understanding myself, understanding why we’re here, how to navigate life. So my mind automatically goes to “I should go back to school to be a therapist” (many people say that I am like an armchair therapist). While part of me thinks that would be an amazing career for me and it could be my “passion”, another big part thinks that I’m just running away from this life that I have now, and am hoping for happiness in the next stage. That the grass will be greener if I have a different job. Logically, I know this is probably not true, but it’s still an internal struggle nevertheless.
Have any of you ISFJs felt similarly? Like you’re stuck in the future, and have trouble being satisfied in the now? Or that you feel that something is missing, and a passionate career is the way that you should feel most fulfilled? I’m curious if anyone can relate.
Edit: age. Fat fingers."
4986,isfj,"I'm almost in the same place! I'm a recent grad at the same age with an awesome job that I love... but it also wears me to the ground and has me thinking about the next step(s) in life. I think as ISFJs we're planners, naturally, and now when you have everything set up, you're looking for the next thing to do. Maybe instead of trying to reboot your career, you try making a smaller long-term goal?
For me, this is travel. I've been trying to go somewhere every year and the process of saving up money, planning my vacation, coordinating the details, and actually going on the trip keeps me from trying to over-fix other aspects of my life.
Also remember: you career doesn't have to be you life's passion. Your career should facilitate your passions--sometimes this means, yes, you're working in you dream job, but for a lot of people, this means having steady work with steady income that lets them go out and find passions outside what supports them."
4987,isfj,"I have no advice but I totally relate (19 M). I recently went back to school because I don't want to be stuck in jobs I hate for the rest of my life, so I decided to try to get a basic high school diploma in IT. I feel like I'm completely wasting my time because, just like you, I also want to explore a bunch of other things and learn more about my passions but every day after coming back from school I'm just too tired to do anything other than browsing reddit and chatting. Even when I have free time I tell myself how cool it would be to learn about something but I'm just so lazy that I often end up doing nothing. That could just be a problem of organization because there are so many things that I might feel overwhelmed and never actually get myself to look into them. I usually try to do things that will help me with my life in the future but I helplessly feel like I'm unable to enjoy the present. Maybe I'm just focusing so much on my future that I've been missing out on having fun."
4988,isfj,"I can relate. I think I totally chose the wrong career and pretty much just accept my demanding and stressful job. However, the jobs pays well and considering I’m in my early 40s, I think the money I make and save will help me long term finance my passions."
4989,isfj,"I am very future-oriented, so I’ve had similar feelings through a lot of my life. I’m not a particularly happy person so I’m always trying to think of what I can do now that will make things better in the future. 
I spent a lot of time in a job that wasn’t fulfilling because I knew I had a good shot at being promoted, which would improve my prospects when I changed careers. I’m working in my field now and still not sure if what I want to be doing long term, so I’m just trying to identify opportunities for growth to give myself options. 
I’ve been trying to be more open to trying new things, because you never know what might really strike a cord with you. "
4990,isfj,"I relate to that too. When I finished my degree and after several familiar/personal struggles I was exhausted and without a clear idea of  what to do with my life. I had always wanted to be a veterinarian but after finishing university I realized I didn't felt passionate about the job and wanted to do something more meaningful to me. After 6 months of apathy closed in my bedroom, I decided to switch careers. I didn't studied a whole degree again (could not imagine to do that for 4 years more), but enroled a biomedical research master (only 1 year) and started working in an oncology lab. 
I am loving the experience so far. But I totally understand thatis overbearing the amount of time we put in this work, the stress to get funding/good results and not screw up the experiments,etc.I think is not the perfect environment for a ISFJ because of the high stress, but I also consider we are gifted for this kind of job, where attention to details and perseverance is really important. What helped to me is that I have a very good relationship with my supervisor, and after months of hard job and taking homework home every weekend, I had a talk with him where I told him I couldn't keep this rythm because I had no time for all the tasks assigned to me, and my personal life was suffering. Luckily he understood...if not, I would jave reconsidered my career. 
If you like your current job and you think you are overloaded with work, maybe try to calmly talk with your boss/supervisor... But if the situation doesn't change and you feel like shit everyday, maybe is better to change paths. "
4991,isfj,"Thank you so much for posting about this! 
I am going through something similar, I just finished my MPH, have a pretty good data analyst job, but am feeling the same way, thinking I should have explored becoming a nurse more.   It might be helpful to remember that being a clinician or clinical person in any sense while maybe less exhausting in a TI-sense, they can also be super stressful and exhausting, but for even more hours per week than a research job. "
4992,isfj,"I am also an ISFJ who works in a cancer research lab! Just graduated two years ago and I feel exactly the same. It feels so good to know that I'm not alone. Planning trips is what keeps me sane right now, I feel like I work to be able to travel. "
4993,isfj,"Please share your experience. I'd like to quit my day job and start my own business. But as you know, ISFJs need to have a detailed plan before we feel comfortable taking any action. Thanks in advance!"
4994,isfj,"Indeed. The only job I've had is online. I really do prefer to work on my own schedule, in my own environment and have control over everything. Quitting your day job should be done after you have something already established and making money consistently. 
I don't think I can really offer much advice as it's not so much of a business that I run, different areas. 
Best advice is, keep your day job until you can for sure make enough to support yourself. Don't rush and try not to strain or stress yourself too much."
4995,isfj,"Hey I am a doctoral Student at a University in the South. I am studying flirtation behaviors, specifically trying to catalog specific flirting behaviors taken from several experimental studies. I was wondering if I could post to this community as it seems relevant to my topic. Thank you in advance for taking the time to take the survey there is an opportunity to win a gift card if the entire survey is completed. You can back out at any time.
Here is the link to the survey
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JMQP5PJ"
4996,isfj,"There are a number of questions on which I can't discern if you're asking about my specific opinion about, for example rules about gender roles, or if you're asking if the reader is aware of the socio-cultural norms and ideals about such topics"
4997,isfj,"You ask in the beginning about sexual orientation, but then ask questions about interactions with “the opposite sex.” I don’t think it should be assumed that everyone taking the survey is attracted to the opposite sex. There might be a more inclusive way to ask those questions. "
4998,isfj,"For example, inferior Si in ENTPs results in forgetting goals while working towards them, losing track of time and falling out of a routine, and getting obsessed with following a routine that we'll never actually follow - at the expense of doing something more important/interesting and resulting in us just sitting around doing nothing.
Notice how the first two examples are about a lack of Si use, but the last example is about the inferior Si manifesting and being used just enough to avoid picking up a new routine."
4999,isfj,"When things go wrong we try to fix things and inevitably make things worse. Good examples are accidentally being insensitive, then commencing to try and cover it up by comments that only make it worse, ending only when we decide to flee he country and change our name."
5000,isfj,"I'll add a bit about how my Ne manifests later in my thought process, small decisions and life choices. I'm really curious to know how other ISFJs use Ne. Please also mention what age or general range since maturity level matters. I'm not stating that age absolutely determines someone's maturity."
5001,isfj,"I'm 13, turning 14 in a little less than a month.  I think my inferior Ne is what makes me kind of... ""weird"" sometimes, I guess? When I'm alone, I like to make different faces, laugh randomly, and make jokes to myself. I sometimes have really impulsive thoughts that I just won't act on: ""Okay, I'm in a class right now, but what if I just got up and ran out?  What would this teacher do about that?  What if we lived in a world where people could just do that?"" Of course, while I'm having these thoughts I'll be peacefully staring up at the teacher.  I tend to actively plan for my future so that nothing bad can happen - I haven't gone off to high school yet, but I'm already looking at careers and joining things to assure I'll be prepared.  I'm researching colleges, college expenses, etc.  I'm trying to study for SAT's and ACT's.  I think a lot of my inferior Ne comes out in anxiety about my future, or difficulty with big changes.  When I started middle school, I cried every day when I came home from school because I was so uncomfortable in the big and new environment.  "
5002,isfj,"I'm 23. Ne make me so interest with psychology and have so many question about it. Cuz Ne is about ""meaningful"" things for me. I'm also love to hear other people story. For decision and life choices, Si hero still be my main function cuz i'm ISFJ.. Ne also excite me about things that i must share.. but in Si way like telling other people what i like and what i have experienced.. i'm also really like things that have meaning behind it or some detective story (Ne: linking things)"
5003,isfj,"I’m 29. I noticed as I get older I crave change. When I was younger change terrified me. I think it’s both personal development and having an entp boyfriend and intp best friend. As I’ve aged I enjoy the idea of freedom/being limitless much more and have a much harder time being ok with the “same old same old”. Although I want and crave Ne it still low key stresses me out at my core, but not nearly to the extent as when I was younger. I loooove me some Ne. I’ve also become a lot more playful in making connections and being more open minded. I also get bored very easily now, and am less inclined to get obsessed as in depth about one way of being, compared to my younger self. I put less pressure on myself and see much more potential in myself, others, opportunity, etc."
5004,isfj,"I'm 15.
Ne makes me sometimes anxious and nervous, it is perhaps what is holding me back sometimes. it also makes me fear what people might do, or might say. but sometimes I get a work flow where I have very intense focus !"
5005,isfj,"I'm 14, Ne usually makes me nervous, and most of the time when I use it I seem kind of strange and random. It always pops up at the worst times too. Usually when I use it it's negative, like imagining things that can happen in the near future, or maybe just things that are just plain impossible.
I think another time when my Ne manifests is when I go off topic in conversations. That only happens when I'm in a hyped up mood though :P
Lately I've been getting sick of having some things the same as they were last year, and I've been wanting more change in my life. I think it's my Ne kicking in....? eh probably.
I'm interested to see how your Ne works :)"
5006,isfj,"Ne is said to mostly manifest during speech or speaking. So for me, what Ne does to me since my brain is trying to connect some information together, I cannot quite speak straightforwardly, I stutter, I have pauses, I change subjects etc. That's what Ne does."
5007,isfj,"I see! Cool. Hm, so I'm 24, so a bit of an age difference. I was talking to people about my type and I may actually be an ENTP, with a much underdeveloped Si (which would explain a lot of things) and have been looping for a while and in the grip during my worst moments. 
I'll still explain how my Ne works though. Ne usually manifests in my desire for growth in knowledge, experiences, and to understand different perspectives, but more importantly, the logical processing (internal reasoning) of reaching those perspectives (Ti influence?). I'm also clearly impulsive, disorganized, and bounce off between projects to no end. 
I never have a daily routine, or that's what my INTJ boyfriend says. I always say or Seem to have a schedule but things never go as planned because I come across different ideas in my mind or different opportunities across the day to do other things. I end up doing or going with what I feel like doing, so instead, going with things based on new information. 
Ex 1: Wow, I just made an 8-destination itinerary for the day, not quite a minute by minute schedule but I don't want to spend time figuring that out. It takes too long. Generally it takes X hrs to do this or that. We'll see what happens. And even if I don't hit everything, it's pretty cool to have done any. (ends up hitting 3/8 of those points)
Ex 2: Tells INTJ I'll be doing X, Y and Z. Decided to do A, B and C instead. (Literally every or every other day)
Since a lot of people who replied are under 20, I'll make this a little more relatable by talking about what I remember doing Ne-related at that age: 
At 11, I came across paganism because I thought it was really cooled based off one of the many young adult books I absorbed when I was younger. Paganism led me to delve deep into its practices, beliefs, the symbolism and I spent maybe a good 3-6 months obsessing over it with friends that I pulled in. Then I became interested in other religions and read about eastern and western beliefs. This time not with as much detail  because I got the gist of what religion was/entailed, but was still fascinated by their different ideas and way of reasoning. 
One of my favorite subjects in high school art history and math. I love art history because it was all about teaching me the connections between the historical idealogies of certain periods and their relation to how art at the time was created. And it revealed to me how the connections between the past and future. I loved digesting all the information from that class. Next favorite was trig and alculus because with that, I could finally see the relationship between math and the world. I saw the funky equations in math at the time as symbolic logic. It honestly changed my life to see what math really is, and probably kick started my Ti. 
Found college was a gateway to what I thought and still believe was a plethora of possibilities for exploring the world and its endless ideas with broadness and hopefully depth. So I told myself to be the perfect student to get into the best school. I idealized a lot of schools and what college would be like. Haha. With a weak Si, I barely had followed through and stretched myself pretty broadly in activity and classes, so no, I wasn't the perfect student (did too much). But still got into a really good school somehow because I did well enough. 
Fast forward to college, same idea, did a plethora of things like double- majoring in Physics and Criminology (makes no sense), joining research labs 3 different fields (criminology, physics, cognitive science), being a mentor, being a radio DJ, working in the cafeteria, working in the high ropes course, etc etc. Basically for involved in nearly everything possible in college out of partly sheer curiosity and partly because it looked good, and though I had a singular dream career for the longest time, didn't end up going with it. Instead, went with an alternative that was just as awesome in its own way. Thought and planned to go to graduate school in cognitive science or physics (couldn't decide), but ended up last minute finding a job as a laser engineer instead. So this constant pattern of making plans but never following through whether they're short term or long term, and changing my mind and doing different things based on new information, AND my desire to experience and understand new things is how my Ne manifests. 
Miscellaneous:
It's also easy for me to see all the possibilities given the occurrence of Event X, and see all the possibilities of why X occurred. I laugh at jokes/stories when they're only a third or half of the way there because I already saw the punchline coming based on logical reasoning of what was already said. I don't say all the possibilities out loud because its just too much and I don't find it necessary because I think other people must see them too. I'm always looking for and dreaming of new ways to grow my career because I absolutely cannot be doing the same thing and living in the same place for the next 3-5 years. I like meeting new people and being something more, or at least knowing I'm on that path to be more. 
When I'm with my INTP friend, because my Ti is weaker, I'm always asking her why-questkons, like how she arrived to her conclusions. What made her see that, etc. And I do the same with people I come across who I find are different from people I've known. Why did you decide to do X instead of Y, what makes you believe Z instead of A? Can you explain your line of reasoning or thought process? Lately, I've become bored of asking people those things because I feel like I've already gotten the gist of different viewpoints and where they came from. So I've moved onto other things to pick apart and learn.
I'm not verbally witty, so my Ne doesn't manifest that way. Might be because of the anxiety and fear of social rejection. 
Oh yeah, my possible Ne-Fe loop: gives me a shit ton of anxiety about people liking me and fitting in. I function best when I don't care as much so that my Ti and Ne can lead me through life. "
5008,isfj,"Damn, Ne sounds pretty complex. Eh, that's probably since it's way down in my stack, but I've always found Ne really cool.
I'm pretty bad at following through with things too. I get hesitant before I do certain things and that makes me lose the opportunity altogether. I guess it's because my inferior Ne gives me so many bad possibilities before I actually go through with it.
How bad are your grips? How did you manage to get out of it?"
5009,isfj,"Follow through should come with self-development, but don't think of developing follow-through in terms of cognitive functions since functions are about cognitive processing and not so much behavior.  Completing Things is about self-discipline and being decisive. 
If inferior Ne gives you bad possibilities, try actively imagining good possibilities.
When I'm in the grip, let's say Si grip, I don't see any future for me or what I do see is just bleak. I fall into depression and lack the motivation to so anything because what's the point? I hate the future. I have an irrational fixation on the past and can't let go of it and embrace potentially better opportunities because I just don't See them. That's weird because I can usually imagine tons of great things possibly happening. So what helped me break out of it was when I was presented, by INTJ, an alternative future. That got excited and motivated again. He fueled my Ne and that broke me out of it."
5010,isfj,"Thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it. :)
It's good that you had your boyfriend to help you through that hard time. Breaking out of the grip must be pretty difficult, I imagine. I don't think I've ever fallen into the grip before, but I think I've fallen into the Si-Ti loop quite a few times. Although I'm not too sure about how that works either ^^;;
Do you happen to know how any other loops/grips work? Cognitive functions can be pretty interesting when you add these sort of things to the fray."
5011,isfj,"Hi! This is for a research abut MBTI & Music, some of you have answered the simple test (only two questions) and I have received a lot of feedback telling me to do another less simple with more genres I listened to you guys and here it is! Thank you for your time I really appreciated also shout out to ""ThePixelHunter"" for helping me in this! 
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6AQZ7D2pA604k1OsTpQl_gd1d8ZvLeS4hcmasZjBzaMWWog/viewform"
5012,isfj,"Hey guy's,  I need some help to figure out If I'm really an ISFJ.  Here is some traits about me.
.   Introverted, but If I get to know you I can be extremely silly.  I love making off the wall remarks if I'm comfortable with you.
.  I hate traditions and religion.  Personally I find the both of these concepts pointless to me. To each his own I guess 
.  I love helping people,  but only those who needs it and want it. I don't want to save the world.  I just want to help people who really needs it. 
.   I'm not a pushover.  Most people considered me a really sweet guy.  However,  if I think you're getting disrespectful I will check you. 
.   I have an obsession  with my past.  I'm always thinking about my mom,stepdad,  and other love ones who passed away or left. Including my past mistakes. 
.  I'm really hard on myself.  If I make any mistakes at work or anything in general I overthink on how I can prevented my mistakes. This sometimes leads to a bad depression episode.  As an heavy equipment operator apprentice, I'm extremely hard on myself.  I even had my boss tell me more than once I'm to hard on myself and I am doing a good job.
.  I'm always thinking about the future and wondering how my life is going to play out. 
. I am extremely loyal to my friends and family.  But if you betray my trust or hurt me,  I will cut you out of  my life permanently.  Including family. 
I have taken the personality test multiple times.  I was given INFJ, INTJ,  and ISFJ. I honestly don't know what type I am anymore.  Sorry for the grammar mistakes. "
5013,isfj,"INFJ and ISFJ are very similar, and are basically the same person, living in two different worlds. The INFJ lives in the conceptual world, and the ISFJ lives in the real world. They both have amazing memories, although for the ISFJ it is about concrete details about their past, and for the INFJ it is about conceptual things, such as stories, things they've read, and quotes. I never knew this about myself until people told me. Yeah apparently I like quoting people  ¯(ツ)/¯  ISFJ tend to think about their past with fondness, and with a bit of a rose-colored tint. When they view the future, it is always with dread and uncertainty. When I think about my future, I have hope. When I look back on my past, there is only regret. The future is a frightening place for ISFJs, who only have an inferior Ne to process it, which translates to many uncertain and frightening possibilities. But INFJs Ni tend to come up with one accurate prediction about the future, thus ... even if it is a negative future, they will be well prepared for it. ISFJs tend to be neater -INFJs messier.
That's all I can think of for now. I hope you found it helpful!
source: INFJ with an ISFJ sister"
5014,isfj,"From this, I'd say ISFJ
They tend to be much harder on themselves regarding past mistakes - it's a common theme from ISxJ (and ISxJs who are mistyped and think they're INxJ - Ni's don't care.) They also both regard their futures, but in different ways - INFJs with a calm, singular knowingness, and ISFJ with more concern or concrete planning
ISxJ's aren't defined by being ""traditional and religion."" While many are, many aren't as well.
The real difference, as goodthankyou noted, is: ISFJ lives and breathes concrete; INFJ lives and breathes conceptual
I just wrote a post on this in /infj if you want to read it."
5015,isfj,"Hey,
As the title suggests, I'm an ENFP, and I like to meet new people of different kinds. I haven't met many ISFJs in my life, but you guys seem fascinating so I'd like to get to know you better. I feel like there's a lot that we can learn from each other, given that we're so different.
I prefer skype for communication but can use something else if you wish. Send me a PM if you'd like to talk! : )"
5016,isfj,"Just wanted to say hello. I’m a 30 year old who has previously always been a completely polar ISTJ, above 90% on all the categories. I’ve had some pretty significant changes to my life in the last year, a divorce, experiencing another love, losing it, finding myself alone, significant job changes, giving up a house, basically everything I was sure of before, I lost. It’s really made me re-evaluate a lot of things about myself and I decided to take test for the first time in a couple of years and I tested 51/49 as a feeler. I’ve realized how important it is to have people around you who care. I’m not immune to pain or heartache like I thought I was. I think that I’m still working through a lot of these things and my resolve is pointing more and more towards the ISFJ with the ISTJ traits slowly fading.
Has anyone else changed types? Where did you come from?
Edit: I hate that I can’t edit the title. Converted*"
5017,isfj,"I test ISTJ when I'm stressed. I came up high in ISTJ functions when I took keys 2 cognition at times. When I have feelings for someone I swear I become an ISTJ lol.
​
I'm sorry to hear about everything, perhaps major life changes has made you in tune to others more? Do you have a support network of friends?"
5018,isfj,"I typically test ENTP, since my early 20s. Ruthlessly logical T. I’m now 50. But over the years I have developed my F. In particular after becoming a father. I’m more empathetic and compassionate.
A couple of times in the past decade, I took the MBTI and I came out ENFP. I think I was living out the F traits. I’ve since settled back into ENTP and I recognize that I’m a a Thinker at heart but I also bring out my F. That’s just trying to be a well-rounded, whole human. Sounds like you’re on a similar growth path."
5019,isfj,"I used to suspect that I may be near the border of ISTJ and ISFJ, but after looking at the component functions of each, I can see why I almost always test as an ISTJ (albeit, one with a strong sense of empathy).  If you want better answers about your type, don't use tests - they're often inaccurate because of the wording of questions and ""either/or"" design.  Look at the functions, specifically feeling and thinking (which is where ISTJs and ISFJs differ), and decide based on your knowledge of yourself whether you're more ISTJ or ISFJ.
For me, extroverted thinking (an ISTJ trait) stuck out as highly descriptive of my way of thinking - I'm constantly looking for ways to improve the efficiency of everything around me. Introverted thinking, on the other hand, corresponds more to my ISFJ SO's tendency to dwell on things and ""pull them apart"" mentally to find the truth inside.  Your statement, ""I’ve realized how important it is to have people around you who care"", sounds to me like it came from a place of reasoning and practicality, which is more of an ISTJ thing in my opinion.
ISTJs might be thinkers more than feelers, but the ""cold robot ISTJ"" stereotype is only accurate for people lacking emotional maturity.  I've felt as much pain and heartache in my life as any regular person.  I just don't really show it because I prefer to deal with it myself (maybe an introverted feeling trait)."
5020,isfj,"You should check cognitive functions, that would be far easier for you to tell instead of doing tests like 16 personalities trying to quantify how much you're a feeler or thinker based on clichés questions ;)"
5021,isfj,"Definitely look at the functions :) you’ll find we all use thinking and feeling! So it could be that you’re tapping into your feeling function more right now due to stress, or that your feeling function is developing more."
5022,isfj,"I didn’t have a close network. Lots of acquaintances and people to keep me busy, but I couldn’t open up to anyone. But it’s growing. I was never the type of person to ask others for help, and with everything going on and feeling like there were real problems, I didn’t really talk about them and spent most of my time trying to salvage things with my wife. There was the one person along the way who I really opened up to, but because of my turmoil I messed that up and lost her too.
I definitely did become more aware of others feelings through this. I had to learn it at first and it took a lot of effort, but the need was enough to spark the change, and now I see my old self as more flawed."
5023,isfj,"That is probably the right way to look at it. I am just barely starting to look at the traits and functions more, and I do think I ride that fence a lot. Even when going off the questions, it close enough to 50/50, and I can see how I behave one way or the other in specific situations."
5024,isfj,"From what I'm aware of, INTJ and ISTJ can become lovely people when they age and develop a mature Fi, especially if their circumstances have made them question their old self and make effort to improve their way of life and interest in others. It is possible you could be ISFJ, it is also possible you have hit a state of self actualization from things that have gone wrong."
5025,isfj,"This manual is part of a series of guides originated by @intpboard!  
Congratulations! You have come under the care of your very own ISFJ unit, probably because you needed help with a task and they needed an excuse to procrastinate.  They have offered you this manual in a simple attempt to assist you.  You should be pleased that they have chosen you to benefit from their helpful nature!
Your ISFJ unit will come equipped with the following accessories:
One (1) large cup of coffee (refillable)
Four (4) extra jackets to give you if you are cold
Two (2) semi-fancy outfits
Three (3) casual outfits, one of which they strongly prefer
One (1) calendar to keep track of important dates
One (1) coffeepot, for refilling coffee cup
Three (3) grandiose, altruistic life paths
One (1) large dog
Infinite (∞) support, patience, work ethic, and enthusiasm
Software:
Your ISFJ will come preprogrammed with the following traits:
Si: Your ISFJ will often be preoccupied with thoughts about the world and people around them, and may zone out during these times.  Don’t be alarmed – this is normal.  They are just gathering information about their surroundings, processing their impressions, and filing everything away in our vast internal filing cabinet. Disturbing them during this process will often result in blank stares and confusion.
Fe: This trait is activated only when necessary, following the processing phase. After your ISFJ has updated the filing cabinet with the gathered information, you will find them very interactive, friendly, and helpful! They contain a special chip which makes them particularly intuitive and responsive to all your feelings and needs, as well as overly willing to assist you in anything you may need. When making decisions, will first consider the needs of other people and the impact of the decision on them and others. 
Ti: Occasionally, instead of Fe following the processing phase, your ISFJ will need to withdraw and spend time deeply analyzing the information gained.  This trait allows them to balance their people pleasing side with their analytical side. Occassionally enjoys puzzle games or analyzing the information we have learned through Si. Form an inner logical framework of how the world works. 
Ne: The weakest trait of the ISFJ, Ne works with Fe to prod the ISFJ into trying new things.  It is also responsible for their occasional bursts of creative ideas and plans! However, it is only able to activated for fleeting periods of time; pushing an ISFJ too far out of their comfort zone for too long will cause them to revert to the withdrawn, silent behavior that characterizes their original information-gathering mode.
Getting Started: 
When you first start up your ISFJ, do not be alarmed by their silence! The first stage of ISFJ programming requires distant observation, which allows them to gather information about their surroundings!


Place included cup of coffee in your ISFJ’s hand.


Set them on a bench in a busy location.


Allow your ISFJ to charge by observing details about the situation.


If step 3 does not work, place included dog on leash and hand leash to ISFJ; Fe mode should trigger when ISFJ is approached about dog.


If your ISFJ still doesn’t start, announce a task with which you need assistance.


Modes:
Selfless Giver (default) – In this mode, ISFJs will jump at any opportunity to help others, regardless of their own schedule or plans.  They will never complain about this type of service.  Even if they do not want to help you, they will – regardless of any inconvenience it may cause them.  Taking advantage of this mode too often will result in an unhealthy ISFJ that will shut down in response to future requests.
Nature Lover - Activated when outside in nature settings.  ISFJs love nature, particularly the solitude and silence they can find there.  This allows them to process information without the interference of additional information.  They are likely to bring you outside with them, in an effort to help you silence your mind as well – even if this is not your idea of fun, please be patient. They are just trying to help you.
Humble - Activated in response to any type of praise.  ISFJs prefer to downplay their own accomplishments, as they are uncomfortable with overwhelming praise.  This often results in their successes being claimed by others, which upsets the balance of the ISFJ and often triggers Clowning mode to hide anger and disappointment.
Observer - Activated in busy situations/places. Your ISFJ will be content to sit back and watch the action around them.  Although they will be lightly conversational, attempting to engage them more deeply will not be successful – they are too busy processing their surroundings.
Clowning - ISFJs are prone to self-deprecating jokes. They use this as a defense mechanism to hide their emotions. A shield of laughter is the best defense of all! To this end, they also find joy in puns, wordplay, and any unique jokes. Their sense of humor never ceases to surprise, so try not to be taken aback!  Activated most often around NF units.
Relationships with other units:
NFs: ISFJs have very close relationships with NFs, because they are both concerned with the care and well-being of the other.  The ISFJ also often balances the NF, who prefers an “outside the box” way of thinking to the more traditional views of the ISFJ.  NFs can also be too demanding of the ISFJ – they need to know when to let up or they will burnout their ISFJ unit.
NTs: NTs have a very strong drive and work ethic that the ISFJ greatly admires; in return, the NT admires the way ISFJs care so deeply for others.  This is a relationship that can produce a lot of mutual respect.  However, NTs are far more logical than ISFJs, who are more focused on emotions, and this can cause friction.
SJs: ISFJs get along very well with other SJs.  They are both responsible and trustworthy, as well as equally willing to take care of one another.  This creates a nurturing environment for the ISFJ that is very important for their health and security.
SPs: SPs are fun loving and carefree, capable of assisting an ISFJ with big plans, ideas, or experiences triggered by the Fe trait. However, the SP must recognize that the ISFJ has a limit and be respectful of that – if not, their wild, impetuous nature can quickly wear down an ISFJ.
Feeding:
When busy, an ISFJ will often forget that food is necessary. This is especially true when engrossed in a project that will help others or while bringing one of their ideas/adventures to life.  To properly care for an ISFJ, you must feed them at least once a day.  If they are resistant to stopping long enough to eat, tell them you are feeling hungry and allow them the option of preparing (or paying for) the meal – their overly kind nature will override their natural enthusiasm for work and in making sure you are fed, they will feed themselves as well.
Grooming:
Your ISFJ will groom on a regular basis, as it never knows when it will be called away to help someone else.  They will always keep themselves clean and their appearance tidy – they never want to call too much attention to themselves, so they groom and dress in a way that allows them to blend in.  You will not need to monitor this function for your unit, and you should leave it to the ISFJ to take care of at all times; insinuating that your ISFJ is untidy in any way will cause them to feel offended and could result in total shut down until you apologize.
Sleeping:
Your ISFJ unit will sleep regularly, as being well rested is necessary to support the enthusiasm with which they approach their day (whether their day is at school, at work, or being with others).  Despite this, they often need naps or a large amount of caffeine to keep running in Selfless Giver mode – this mode drains their energy very quickly.
Frequently Asked Questions:
How do I get my ISFJ to relax and take a break?
You don’t!  ISFJ’s are not capable of “relaxing” in the traditional sense.  During their dormant periods, their brains are still rapidly processing and filing information.  The word “relax” is foreign to them and will confuse them if mentioned too often.
Help! I lost my ISFJ!
Don’t worry!  ISFJs often need a break to recharge by going into one of the aforementioned dormant periods. They will reappear shortly!  If it has been more than six hours, brew a pot of coffee and wait.  The smell of coffee should bring your ISFJ out of dormancy.
My ISFJ does not like to try new things?  What do I do?
ISFJ units come with a preinstalled love of habit and familiarity. Attempting to change too much at once can lead to a complete crash if you are not careful!  To deal with this, introduce your ISFJ to new situations, places, and people very gently.  Be patient and they will adjust in time.  Their Fe and Ne traits will also occasionally activate and push them into trying something new – make sure you take their lead and do not over stimulate them. This will cause them to withdraw into dormancy and will require additional coffee to fix.
Again, congratulations on your newly acquired ISFJ helper unit!

5026,isfj,"Love this mode best. I think ISFJs are beasts at scrabble because of their wordplay talent.
​"
5027,isfj,"I've never seen a topic like this but it's quite fun and interesting.
​
Feel free to unpin my other topic so you can keep this pinned since this is essentially a more creative version of it and we only have 2 topics that can be pinned at a time."
5028,isfj,"Thanks, I needed this. Not so much for its usefulness, but because it’s damn funny. It had me laughing out loud, which triggered my ISFJ wife—who just so happens to be a coffee roaster and barista—to look at me with a puzzled expression. I’m an ENTP myself and can attest to the logic vs. emotions conundrum."
5029,isfj,"Also live in a cold country, can confirm not broken unless she doesn't go outside when it's warm either. Low key debated calling in sick on Monday when it was -38 Celsius with a -51 wind chill. (-36 temp/-59 WC for you Fahrenheit users!) Went to work anyway, but suffered greatly."
5030,isfj,"Haha! For sure. Our biggest point of contention, however, is something else. I will start new projects every week and abandon them just as quickly; rarely finishing anything. She will relentlessly follow through on any project she starts—no matter how agonizing it becomes—and see it through to the end. Her adherence to work ethics are out of this world. That’s one of the things I admire the most about her. I think we understand each other quite well after 9 years together, but we still learn something new about each other every now and then."
5031,isfj,I know in Socionics the ISFJ-ENTP is called the duality relationship with great compatibility. Have you looked into Socionics? If you have Do you think that concept can be applied to your relationship?That’s true for me to I don’t commit easy to things but once I do I become very committed. I definitely can have trouble grasping the larger picture. That’s one of the thing I admire about the Ne users in my life how they are so inspirational and help me see the bigger picture and not get bogged down in the details.
5032,isfj,"Nope, I haven’t heard about “Socionics” until now! Did a quick Google search and found (a very extensive) Wikipedia page. I’ll check it out—Thanks for the tip!
Honestly, I’m not sure how much weight one ought to give to MBTI and similar ideas. These ideas are certainly fascinating in many ways, but sometimes they feel like an oversimplification to me. The methodology seems a bit pseudo-scientific, but still useful as something to jiggle one’s thoughts a bit.
I have been taking different MBTI tests for years and noting the results. The first few times, I typed INTJ. Then a few years later I typed INTP. For some years now I have been consistency typing ENTP. Perhaps there is a spectrum of some sort, I don’t know.
Sorry for the rambling, I got a bit caught up and carried away there…"
5033,isfj,"My identical twin is an ISFP.
We get along, but we don't understand each other.
We always seem to be slightly on different wavelengths, and we've never been the kind of twins that are super super close and share everything. We're extremely different people, with different goals and desires in life, different hobbies, different ways of doing things.
We've often clashed when it comes to the way we prefer to live. I'm very traditional and organized, and very much into the stereotypical white picket fence lifestyle, and I value fairness to an extreme degree. Growing up, I always wanted things to be exactly equal, and I insisted that rules were followed. She didn't care so much about those kinds of things, and she didn't mind bending the rules. I've always been very people-oriented, and I invest a lot of emotional energy in the people I hold close to me, whereas she doesn't seem to value relationships nearly to the same degree.
My ISFP twin, on the other hand, is a lot more free spirited. She's sort of the edgy artist type, she doesn't care so much what people think, and she just doesn't have the same interest in people as I do. She's much more shy, whereas I'm a lot more outgoing. She gets along much better with animals, and she keeps to herself a lot.
We have a pretty comfortable relationship, and we don't have much conflict, but we're fundamentally different people at the core, and we want very different things in life, so while we enjoy spending time around each other and we have fun together, we don't exactly share many deep conversations, and we're both quite private around each other."
5034,isfj,"I dated an ISFP towards the end of high school and into the beginning of college. It was a long-term relationship, but we argued over trivial things a lot. The distance killed it, and looking back, I do not regret it ending.
That is the extent of my limited experience with ISFPs. Based on that, it wouldn't be my type of choice."
5035,isfj,"I'm dating one right now. He's quiet like I am, and more introverted than I am. He'd prefer to stay at home and play games with his friends online. I can't say much about his S or F other than the obvious, and I can say that he prefers things to play by ear. He's very chill and relaxed, and simple. "
5036,isfj,"Reading this gave me a feeling almost of déjà vu; the relationship I have with my mom is very much like this also (I'm the ISFP).
We're very similar in some aspects but as far as what we want from life and core values, we're totally different."
5037,isfj,"Pretty much the only thing I hear about ISFPs are

They're really quiet, even moreso than ISFJs apparently
THey like to do things at their own pace, could create imbalance with ISFJs who like to do things in a predictable shared pattern
They are ARTISTSof some kind. Which is a dumb stereotype obviously but I always wondered why it leads up to that stereotype
For some reason theyre considered more quiet than INFPs? Does introverted Se-ni make it hard for them to express words they feel or something?
"
5038,isfj,"Yea I'm super quiet; I don't really know how it compares to INFPs and ISFJs though. I think it might have to do with aux Se vs aux Ne? I feel like Ne is better at making things up to talk about. As for me though, I'll stay quiet until I feel like I have something to add. This really only applies to new people though - if I'm comfortable around you I can talk for ages. I can also fake it til I make it, but that drains me.
I do like to work at my own pace, but within deadlines. I work best when I'm told ""This is what I need. This is when I need it by. That's all"". It gives me the freedom I need to work, but gives me a definite timeframe so I don't end up just not doing it (if that makes sense. It's an odd mix of freedom and structure. Pure structure destroys my will to work, though). 
And I guess relating to the first point, I am very bad at expressing my thoughts with words. I'd rather express it through action. Maybe thats the Se-Ni working; theres no way I'll find the words to express what im feeling, so here's this thing I made.
As far as the artist thing, I feel like it's more in terms of having an air of gracefullness? Or maybe just appreciating aesthetics, idk. I mean, I do write and play music but that's not my main way to express my creativity, you know?   "

5040,isfj,"Hi all,
Anyone else wondering why an electrician is listed as a possible ISFJ career?
Source: http://students.usask.ca/current/life/employment/PDFs/ISFJ.pdf
I learned that ISFJ are very people-oriented, and that almost all the career options are in the health, business, education or social work field. But it's the hands-on work that appeals more to me. 
I know I'm not bound only to what is on the ISFJ career lists, but I'm just curious why an electrician (and no other trade) is on a list where the career strength is servicing people?
Any ideas would be great. Thanks!"
5041,isfj,"You already know this, but just to reiterate, you can truly do whatever you would like to do. Certainly certain trades would fit an ISFJ's ""natural"" thought processes better, but one's nurturing of certain functions could lead them elsewhere.
I think that being an electrician would be a good idea if it appeals to you. What I think I personally would like from an electrician job would be the daily projects I could focus on, accessing the needs of the customers, problem solving, finishing tasks correctly, etc.
I really like projects that I can focus on, especially on the computer, but also like almost all aspects of customer service except the possibility of angry/upset guests. In high school, I also was on my robotics team, so I have an interest in all of that stuff even though I was never very good at it, I by the end I was doing a lot of PR stuff at competitions.
And to me, the work of an electrician would contain some of the same elements as nursing, food service, designer, etc. (which are all listed there) because they assess the needs of the customer, problem solve, and finish a task, even though each of the skill sets are all very different. So really, you would be giving a service to people.
This may have been a little long and ramble-y but I hope this makes you feel a little better!"
5042,isfj,"Wow thanks for the great reply!
I guess an electrician really does serve peoples needs, never quite saw it that way. I have been debating the electrician thing for a while. A lot of people have been recommending it for me. But my only reservation so far is that I don't have a big interest in electrical work LOL. I know your saying to do this if it appeals to me, but none of the other career recommendations really interest me. That's where I'm kinda stuck, almost all of the suggestions don't appeal to me. It must be normal to think that, but's it's frustrating lol. Electrical just seemed like the only one where I get to at least use my hands and be mobile.
But I would have to do more research about an electrician to see more what is involved. Your post definitely raised my spirit. Thank you for your help!"

and yes we are going to take into account that its a self reported test. one thing we are going to try and do is measure the percent of each intelligence in terms of the total and see if that changes things. ill keep yall updated with any new information!"
5053,isfj,"You all are so cordial and wonderful to friends and family. I have have had some signs that my crush (an ISFJ) is maybe interested in me romantically, but it could also just be how you are all such wonderful at making people feel comfortable and at home. Are there any specific clues when feelings pass that friendship / romantic interest line?
To add more detail: he's told me i am a true friend and he loves me for it. We have been camping together, when i say love me or leave me, he replies he's not left. I've spent the night at his house and he said he was glad i felt comfortable enough to do it. And we hug often. He has even talked about us living together, but also later said that i would be fine living alone when i have expressed that i dont believe i ever could live alone. But then it seems like there is a wall up, that things are only to go so far, and no more. Is that his shyness or is that the friendship line that i shouldnt cross? I dont want to jeopardize our friendship, but hes the only guy I've felt i can depend on and so serious about. The thought of ""the rest of my life commitment"" doesnt scare the crap out of me with him.
Also, I am not sure I am his type. I'm kinda messy and and INFP. More on the dreamy, illogical side. But there have been what, the intuitive side of me, would call signs of a romantic interest from him. But my intuition isn't always correct. So I'm asking all you wonderfully grounded people for advice."
5054,isfj,"Thank you. This actually confirms some of fwhat i thought. I'm still apprehensive about going a step further because his friendship means so much to me I'd hate to lose that. But i know he is really shy. That and so much more about him i just find so charming and adorable. 
Thank you for your reply. :)"
5055,isfj,"So I am wondering, when do you laugh and smile a lot around someone vs. Looking completely disinterested? Are you more open and happy when you feel more comfortable? Or is smiling and laughing a nervous reaction?
Edit: changed alot to a lot. Lol."

5057,isfj,"I always like meeting new people because there are so many people out there in the world.
However at the same time I'm either afraid we might not start off with a good impression of each, they have a not so good personality."
5058,isfj,"I enjoy meeting new people as well, but sometimes I feel like it's hard to snap out of that small talk mode and move on to different topics, I'm not sure how to properly transition and such. Then I get self conscious and wonder if I'm being too boring or something and ugh..."
5059,isfj,I definitely like meeting new people but I have a hard time with connecting to and staying interested in people. I also have a hard time being the one to initiate conversation or keep communication going between us. 
5060,isfj,"I'm not sure why I keep people at arms length. I never get too close or attached because I feel like these friends have even closer friends  or maybe they won't value our relationship as much as I do. 
I always noticed how i dont have a ""best friend"". The only person who knows the worst and best of me is my boyfriend. I dont hold anything back from him."
5061,isfj,"I have different reasons, depending on the person and circumstances.
If I don't know them very well, or they're just distant friends, it's just because I don't know that I can trust them fully, and it takes me a lot of time to fully open up to people.
I definitely think I keep most people in my life at an arm's-length. The only exceptions to that would be my identical twin, my best friend and my boyfriend. I've known my best friend since I was 10 years old, and my twin has obviously been there since day 1, so I don't remember having walls up with them.
With my boyfriend though, it took some time. It took probably close to a year before my walls were really coming down, and now, a little over 2 years in, I feel like I can trust him fully and be open with him about anything. I will say that there are some parts of me that I may never share with another person, and I may always be somewhat private, but if anybody knows me, it's him. He's shown that he's a genuinely kind person, and he really cares about me, which was the biggest factor in letting my walls down. He probably knows me better than anyone else in my life at this point. "
5062,isfj,"I have been abandoned by people who were very dear to me, those I would do almost anything for. I will never get used to the pain of abandonment after I have given everything into the friendship or relationship, which is why I am careful not to get too close to anyone anymore. I let them in a little but never to the point that I will be broken beyond repair when they ditch me."
5063,isfj,"I don't trust easily because of people I thought were my friends were not there when I needed them the most. I'm friendly to people for the most part, but most of the time it's only a select few that I can feel comfortable opening up to. "
5064,isfj,"I definitely do this! I feel it is because I’m so future oriented & tend to think about all the “what ifs” for example I often debate someone’s true intentions or I wonder how a new relationship will affect me later on in life whether it be 6 months or 5 years. 
I don’t particularly like this trait but I do it to protect myself. I’m so sensitive & care about people deeply. I don’t want to put myself in a bad position in the long run. "
5065,isfj,"I feel insecure about many things and it makes me not want to get close to others. And I feel like by keeping people at arm's length (by being really polite+quiet+not initiating anything) I won't have to deal with negative things like criticism and embarrassment. Also, I get really pessimistic about interpersonal relationships and there's some part of me that believes that if a person was actually right for me, they would just somehow make it work. I know that's kinda dumb, but I know that deep down it's a part of my logic."
5066,isfj,"(ISxJ F)
I keep a lot of people at arm's length partly because it takes so darn long to explain certain things about myself. I only tell a select few my life's story and after that interaction with that person becomes a lot simpler.
Another reason is because I'm kind of an all or nothing person. Either we're going to be best buddies or just acquaintances.
And, no, I don't keep my husband at arm's length. That would be a bad idea for spouses in general."

5068,isfj,"Exactly! People tend to get confused about that.
Idk if it's the same for you, but I consider a lot of the people who I am friendly with to be friends, despite not being deeply emotionally invested. I know some people would call that superficial but I have two or three people I can really share with and that's enough for me."
5069,isfj,"Yes, I do. I always hope I am wrong and just paranoid but they eventually prove me right which might have some sort of a confirmation bias on my part. It’s just hard for me to fully trust people again, especially romantic partners. At the back of my head is the expectation that they will betray me sooner or later."
5070,isfj,"I'll always try my best to be friendly to people.  Definitely strangers. Even though we all have our own demons,  I never take it out on innocent people.  However,  if someone wronged me in the past then fuck them.  I can't grasp the concept of people taking their anger out on people because they're hurting inside.  You never know what somebody is going through. Real talk. "
5071,isfj,"I have been friends with this one guy for a while and just last week we confirmed we liked each other and have now been talking. Ever since that day its almost like he fell off the face of the earth. He works quite a bit, so I understand that but even when he worked this much before he still had time to text me and even hang out but now he suddenly doesn't???? I'm so confused. He's only sent like 2 texts every like 15 hours all week. 
I'm just so confused. Is this normal for you guys???? Or?? "
5072,isfj,"Work stress has a huge impact on how I relate to acquaintances, friends, and family. Stress takes up all my energy, and leaves nothing for socializing. 
Acquaintances/unsteady friendships: when I’m stressed, I do my best to end conversations/avoid acquaintances. No energy for that. Same with friendships where I have to maintain a face, perform a role in those people’s life- they expect a lot of effort from me. 
Good friends: I tell them I’m going to vanish for weeks because of stress. 
Family/friends who are like family: I vent to them throughout times of stress. 
I suspect a burgeoning relationship makes your relationship difficult to perform for your isfj, so they may be avoiding it for self preservation. Good friends 
Or he could be trying to ghost you :( I don’t know him- only myself as a pretty polar isfj. "
5073,isfj,"Hey OP, I believe I'm going through something similar. I'm currently seeing an ISFJ whom we mutually agreed to give things a try last month. She's been really busy lately and I haven't been hearing much from her, but when we do talk over the phone I couldn't sense disinterest. Maybe it's just how they function?
I'm not sure if they are the work first, play later type, but it's kind of rubbing off that way to me. Perhaps an actual ISFJ could shed some light for us. (Am an ISTJ)"
5074,isfj,"Did he ignore you this often as friends?   
Perhaps I'm not the best ISFJ at giving advice, but I myself would make time to talk to someone if I truly liked them. There is no excuse for ""2 texts every 15 hours all week"" without a good reason. Confront him about it."
5075,isfj,"I don’t know but I am an ISFJ, and while work day might have been stressful, I always find time to reply to TEXTS. I do this at least within 1-2hrs or at the end of the day the latest. I treat emails as “when you have time to respond”. I care too much about making the other person feel like he/she doesn’t matter..."
5076,isfj,"Putting this under the previous poster as I agree with most of the things he/she said. I am an ISFJ and not only does stress play a huge role in how I manage my various social relationships, but as an Introvert, after a long day at work I just want to go home and be alone for a while. I also spend a lot of time introspectively fussing over how I may come across to other people—especially people I care about—which then makes me more stressed :’)"
5077,isfj,"Second time dating, this time for real. I've known here for 7 years, friends the whole time. Dated her once but wasn't ready to settle down.
Anyway, nothing is off limits.
She's a teacher, hates bananas, and is a sexyaf ginger.
I was thinking about getting her something banana related. Like a piece of art, or a banana that also has another function, like a vibrator, or paperweight, or something. Maybe an artsy golden vibrator she can also use to weigh down papers?
She does want a 23andme kit, so maybe that.
I dunno. Any thoughts?
She doesn't like a whole lot of attention. Maybe a little get away?"
5078,isfj,"What's the occasion?
I know for me, I tend to prefer more traditional gifts, and while joke gifts can be funny, I don't appreciate them as much if it's for a special occasion. 
It doesn't have to be expensive, but sentimental stuff means a lot. My boyfriend got me a silver bracelet for our first Christmas together, with a panda charm on it. We have an inside joke about pandas, and he went to a ton of different stores trying to find something with a panda on it. When I opened it, I nearly cried, just because of the sentimental value of it, and how hard he tried to find something that would be meaningful to me. 
I don't know about all ISFJs, but I tend to dislike gifts that are just going to be clutter on a shelf, that I feel obligated to hold onto for a while because it was a gift. I much prefer something practical, that I can actually use or wear.
This is going to vary a lot depending on her own interests and hobbies, but I would suggest trying to find something that is personal and sentimental to her, and I wouldn't recommend getting her a joke gift if it's for something important, like a birthday or anniversary, unless it's a side to her real gift. "
5079,isfj,"lol, omg... everyone does this
you just cut us off a slice here - I could make a case for almost any type using pieces of info - but sure, maybe
but to be honest? if you were truly xNxx and she was truly xSxx, the biggest indication would be simple: conversation. so..."
5080,isfj,"I can see how it can be very good. There isn't the spark I had with INFJ, but I can see it has more potential. The draw is deeper
I've also been lucky enough to have an ISFJ roommate and I can see what she brings me. It's more of a nurturing relation, good for growth and serenity
I have a hard time accepting that that relationship is equally beneficial though. Even reading about [ENTP ISFJ duality in socionics] (http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/17-Duality-Descriptions-Meged-Ovcharov) it seems it's mostly about how the ISFJ can help the ENTP and the ISFJ likes that. Sure we bring novelty, maybe reassurance, confidence in the future/vision.
Maybe what the ENTP brings seems very normal to me and what the ISFJ brings looks so hard and valuable. But I have a hard time seeing it as a fair deal "
5081,isfj,"Yeah, I'm trying to avoid overanalysing things through mbti. 
I think having us both using mbti and including it in talks about us may be a great risk of that.
I guess I'll wait until it's a settled theory for me and not a brand new shiny all knowing one. My older colleague used to say ""learn it, understand it, then forget everything about it and go on with your life"". I don't know what he told me that about though, but I think it applies to MBTI, behavioral things, maybe soft sciences in general."
5082,isfj,"Researching on Wikipedia is something most types do these days. People want to be confident in what they are talking about. 
Playing it by ear is something I do. We don't need to plan everything out. 
Everyone's introversion is different. Some people are more open than others 
The isfj isn't an absolute it's just you tend to lean that way. Everyone's different but we just rent to follow those traits some people more strictly than others  "
5083,isfj,"I can second both sides of this story (yours and u/FirmPeaches) as an ENTP married to an ISFJ. He can handle everything himself and is incredibly self sufficient, so sometimes I think this way as well. 
But I think what each of us brings to the other ultimately, is peace of mind. I believe he's the only person I can truly relax around. He handles everything that stresses me out. I handle everything that stresses him out. These things come naturally to us.
Because of this, life is much easier for both of us. He handles the everyday details while I support him. I plan for our future and work around any problems that arise while he makes my visions into a reality. It is not so much what each of us bring separately to the table, but that we're better together than apart.
And so, because of these things, we can both relax and just enjoy each other's company with very very little conflict. I find that incredibly rare in a romantic relationship.
I agree that there isn't the spark that I get from INFJs, but then again, I've never been able to fully let my guard down around an INFJ and just be whoever I wanted to be. In romantic relationships with them, we tended to argue too much for my liking. Those exciting debates quickly got very tiring. Ultimately I valued stability and my peace of mind."
5084,isfj,"Oh you lovely entp, it’s a fair deal, I promise. Couldn’t ask for anything more in a relationship. My entp breaks me out of my comfort zone, getting me out of Groundhog Day. He helps me see things from different perspectives, makes me laugh like nobody can, is secretly a huge teddy bear, makes everything cooler than it appears otherwise (how do you guys do this?!), helped me learn to juggle, longboard, play chess. We moved across the state together on a whim, and with him I felt excited rather than my go-to fearful self. My entp knows how to love me the way I want it without asking. <3333
Insights, advice, pitfalls: I think this relation does best once both have their 3rd function developed/ing, and are on the cusp of having that potentially unknown desire to unlock their 4th function. Within that, it’s amazing. I imagine beyond that it just gets better. :D"
5085,isfj,"Thank you. My thoughts exactly. Put into words, and confirmed with first hand experience.
You didn't suggest any pitfalls, advice, etc. I rarely see any about ENTP/ISFJ. Is it that simple?
Edit: firmpeach already answered that below. Confirmation always welcome but don't feel obligated... I feel like I've been asking a lot of questions ;-)"
5086,isfj,"We'll, that's enthusiasming!!
I'm exactly at the point of 3rd developed/ing(can't say, might go further..), and definitely have the known desire to develop 4th (with some minor progress already)
She's an engineer, I'm pretty sure she had to push her Ti through. How would you say that appears in an ISFJ?"
5087,isfj,"It's funny how to me your explain for 4 goes against your explanation for 3. In fact, i guess, you like adventures, but planned out adventures. (I'm not saying planned out adventures aren't adventures it's just not that natural to me to think that way)
Ok case in point: she went to an outside pool with friends. She didn't do the waterslide and as I understand it, it's because she couldn't see inside the slide beforehand. It didn't appear to be a claustrophobia thing, just not being able to now what's going to happen beforehand.
The things where she'll display a let's see later are like should we meet Saturday at 12 to do A, and maybe later we do B, or maybe we do A longer and skip B? We'll see. And that I would have guessed wasn't most natural to an ISFJ, and would have thought she was maybe mirroring or accommodating me or something like that. But others here so to find it normal, I don't know really..."
5088,isfj,"I am cautious putting someone I don't know that well in a box. Now I have knowledge about her that doesn't come from observation but theory...
I am even more wary about sharing the frame of reference because then we could start saying ""oh you're just saying that because of Si"", ""off course I feel that way, you should know, I'm Ti"" whatever, that's entirely made up but I guess you see where I'm going.. basically forcing things into made up boxes
MBTI is a good model, but it's not the truth. Socionics defines very close types, but just a little different. So someone could be different types in both theories, which would give different insights about them. None is superior. They're just both partial.
Until I am confident in my ability to not take mbti too seriously, yes, I beware of overanalysing things with it
I guess this is a little disorganized, but you know, I'm ENTP so it's normal that I ramble a bit, I'll leave it this way"
5089,isfj,"Yes, it is that simple. This is what my relationships with ISFJs are like in general. Easy and with minimal conflict. So if this girl is an ISFJ, I would probably advise you to not overthink things.
Imo there's a reason why most of the married ENTPs in the ENTP subreddit are married to ISFJs. And yet, I rarely hear about drama with this pairing.
The reason for this, at least in my case, is because my spouse and I are almost always on the same page despite being two people with different ways of doing things. 
This may be because we have the same interests, life goals, and both of us are rather easy going. But also because we share the same cognitive functions in reverse order, which imo plays a part in bringing about harmony in a relationship, considering my relationships with other ISFJs are similarly harmonious despite not sharing as many interests.
Because of this, if we do have arguments, they're usually based off of miscommunication as opposed to an actual difference of opinion. For instance, him reading my body language to say one thing when I really mean another. As a result, these arguments are usually resolved very quickly.
Even when we do have an actual difference of opinion,  which is rare, I usually find a way around things because this is how I operate. His inferior Ne makes him surprisingly open to new ideas. And so, problem solved. There's really not much to argue about. We spend more time finding ways to work around things and implementing these new ideas than arguing about how things should be done.
In the even rarer occurrence that he's skeptical because he's never experienced this solution before (and I've only seen this happen once), I'm able to get him on board by showing him how others have gone through similar experiences in the past and have succeeded. Because even if our current situation is new to us, I highly doubt anything we experience or the solutions I invent as a result are truly new to mankind.
Really, sometimes I think this relationship is too easy. I'm used to having conflict in a romantic relationship where the constant psychological and physical proximity would probably drive most people crazy after a while. But because things are resolved so easily and there seems to be a natural balance in this relationship, there's not too much to discuss about this pairing. 
Regardless, I'll walk you through the biggest potential issues. The rest I'm sure you can figure out in time by communicating and paying attention to your partner.
As an ENTP, I find that I need a lot of relatively challenging mental simulation with new perspectives otherwise I will get bored. And a bored ENTP is never a good thing because then I start creating chaos and conflict because I find it entertaining. This is destructive in relationships, especially with an ISFJ who probably won't be able to understand why I'm pushing their boundaries when they're trying to make me happy, which in their mind, does not mean having debates.
I find that ISFJs can provide thoughtful input and we can have in-depth conversations (especially if their Ti is relatively developed),. We can even have fast-paced, witty banter, which I really like. But they cannot be my sole source of mental simulation simply because they aren't the type to provide new and unique perspectives I haven't already considered, minus the emotional perspective.
Because of this, I set aside some time every week to get mentally simulated elsewhere. The more sources, the better. (Eg. Podcasts, Reddit, etc.) Anything that will help me learn something new, so my mind can constantly be chewing on something.
So this is my biggest piece of advice to you. As well as the biggest potential problem imo. 
My husband's biggest piece of advice is for the ENTP to find a way to talk to the ISFJ in a way that allows them to feel comfortable and cared for. This is one of the things that takes the relationship to the next level. The first being the ENTPs application of Fe, and the other being the ISFJs Ti. This vulnerability allows for a deeper relationship and the meeting of the mind and heart.
ISFJs tend to be very aware of body language, as well as tone of voice. This is how they read people like a book. But these are also things I'm barely aware of since I'm usually focused on people's motives based on what's being said or omitted.
I've had to learn to speak in a more gentle and patient tone of voice. Same message, different approach. I've noticed that as I became more patient with him, and he became more comfortable with me, he also began to express his Ti opinions more frequently and far more quickly. So funnily enough, our conversations have now become one of my sources for mental stimulation.
If you have more questions, ask away, though it might take me some time to respond. :)"
5090,isfj,"For me at 29, I’ve become more interested in reading/learning and analyzing (compared to my younger self when life was experiences and people mostly if that makes sense). I’m less hurt by directness if I can see the logic in it. Less worried about others feelings and more concerned with finding truth and different perspectives. I am more interested in fairness because it makes sense, versus my younger self who would Fe to the point of it being illogical. So I suppose as Ti improves, we appear less doormat-y/butthurt, and more interested in finding the truth based on our experiences (physically and metaphysically). "
5091,isfj,"Exactly my understanding of it.
Here's the deal with unplanned adventures (I've had my fair deal). It's fun not knowing and not caring. It's exhilarating finding solutions when you have nothing to rely on. You'll end up in really good situation that there's no way you could have planned your way into. But it's also a lot of wasted time looking for solutions, a lot of really poor situations, uncomfortable, and if your prone to that stress, definitely.
I'd suggest the easy not-so-planned adventure: fly abroad, rent a car, bring sleeping bags and carry some food and water in the trunk. You know your worst case scenario is a night in the car. Plan nothing else. Don't even read a guide beforehand, ideally don't bring one, ideally only ask people for what you should do, where to sleep and eat. The real fun starts with following people, try to bond a little before asking for suggestions, ask for their stories, say yes as much as you can. Don't pick a crammed touristic place of course. Pick a country you feel good about, and you feel good about the people (fun fact, many countries you might not expect to are both extremely safe and friendly, you can read about that beforehand)
About the slide: would it be wise to nudge you a little too help you do it? Maybe better reassure you/help you visualize how it is going to be? In the end you would be glad to have done it?"
5092,isfj,"I'm wondering if anyone else feels like they are a P type rather than a J type at times.
When I originally took the MBTI, I tested as P rather than J as I love new experiences (if I have time to research and prepare), new ideas (provided a good argument) and am very open minded (which I attribute to a strong Fe). 
I am in a family of J types, and they seem to fit to ""J"" box a lot more strongly than I do. Does anyone else, as an ISFJ, feel like they are fairly open minded relative to other J types?
I feel ISFJs get stereotyped into liking their set routines and never deviating from them, but I don't feel that's exactly true for ISFJs."
5093,isfj,"Yeah, I agree. SJ’s typically get labeled as close minded. I’m not sure if that’s the case on a large scale, but I pride myself in being open minded and laid back. I am also pretty J though, in terms of liking things a certain way and being a planner/organized. "
5094,isfj,"I agree so much. The very first line on 16personalities about ISFJ sort of addresses this, not just for J/P but for the other traits as well.
I do agree that a lot of the cliche stereotypes miss the mark. And think there's a lot more beneath the surface than most give us credit for."
5095,isfj,i’ve flipped between ISFP and ISFJ for a while now. ISFJ seems to fit me the best I think though. I always thought it was really strange when I wasn’t very artistic at all when i thought i was an ISFP. 
5096,isfj,"I've known my ISFJ wife for close to 20 years.  I'm an INFP.  I wouldn't say she's close minded...she will question her beliefs and can change and adapt if she feels she should.  She also enjoys new experiences, especially when it comes to food/drink and vacations.  But she definitely loves set routines and this is probably where the close minded stereotype comes into play.   I'm more likely to say ""what if we just try it this way to see what happens""  or if I'm not feeling something that day I might just throw my routine out the window.  She does not like that at all and will sometimes persist with routines even when they clearly aren't working that well."
5097,isfj,"I have flopped between J and P in different times of my life. I used to be very P but then a few years later I was slightly on the J side. Now I am a P again but not so extreme. Like 60% P, and this definitely fits me the best.
It's very interesting and I can see how different times in my life can make me switch between the two."
5098,isfj,Thanks for your comment! I prefer set day to day routines and the predictability that comes with them too. My XNTP husband also throws them out the window frequently :) ... I might have gotten accustomed to that lol 
5099,isfj,"Haha yeah I guess it's unavoidable, you're either going to adopt or get accustomed to some of your spouse's traits after a while.  I know i've definitely changed.  I'm more likely to set routines and follow through with them now.  I'm more punctual as well.  I guess i'm just less flaky than I used to be :)  Some of that comes with age but a lot of it was due to her influence.  "
5100,isfj,"So I basically I'm secretly jealous of all the guys my age who have apprenticeships in plumbing, electrical ect...im thinking of going back to community college and doing a course....unfortunately I've always had trouble of working with my hands and fixing things (wood work, electrical...) currently I work at a supermarket filling shelves and I've been promoted to a supervisor role which means I have more responsibility. I know I'm good at ny job (I'm the best lol) but I don't see myself working there in my future. I need to develop a skillset that will help me...a part of me wants to get into the medical field but its completely discouraged by my family. My family want me to be doing a trade rather...i just feel so lost"
5101,isfj,"My brother what is it YOU want to do? That's the big question. What will make you the happiest? Make that first step toward it, whatever it may be. Go to trade school/apply for medical school. You have to do it. Life's too short to settle. Look before you leap, do some research, ask around, and go for it if you wanna try it."
5102,isfj,"One of my friends in high school once described me as having an ""eternal smile"" Really not an act on my part, it makes me genuinely happy to merely see the ones closest to me. 
Thinking back I've always been inclined to wearing my happy vibes on my sleeve. Only on rare occasions it can be a helpless feeling, if you know what I mean. :D But most of the time not a big deal at all for me.
Still not 100% sure about my mbti type though. I keep reading about stuff and it's either isfj or infj. I do realize mistypes between these two are common. So take my account of it with a grain of salt pertaining to isfj'ness."
5103,isfj,"ISFJ guy here. The expectation that one should be happy all the time may be an American/Western one. You know, the mentality behind the standard answer to ""How are you?"" being ""Good"" or ""Well"" instead of ""Normal."" In Finland, McDonald's employees were told not to smile while greeting customers because business is a serious activity in Finland and people didn't trust them.
When you think about it, a constant temperament, whether artificial happiness or absence of emotion entirely, is disconcerting. It is impossible to get a baseline for predicting behaviour because we sense that a person's true emotions and reactions are hidden from us. It is difficult to trust a person without predictability. They may have ulterior motives, or be a psychopath. You can't tell, and neither is safe, and people like safe.
I don't think it's a categorically ISFJ thing. Though, it might be more prominent to us Sensing ISFJ's."
5104,isfj,"This is me. I just react to other humans with a smile. I guess thinking about it, my parents did too...we are just smiley people. Ha. Even if I feel down I don't want to take anyone out with me, so I tend to keep smiling! I just feel...receptive to other people and welcoming, even though I'm not at all outgoing. 
I keep testing as an INFP but I'm a bit suspicious so I'm reading a bit about other types. "
5105,isfj,"I'm in information technology, primarily a system administrator, but also some desktop support. It's definitely a job where you have to get a lot of accumulated experience if you're not an intuit, so my early career was really hard. I felt really stupid and my first manager at my internship was an intuit who got annoyed by me bringing every problem to him asking ""Hey, have you seen this issue before? What is the solution?"" I thought of switching careers repeatedly, but my first real job was very supportive and didn't make me feel dumb or unsupported while I made mistakes. Now I have 12 years of knowledge and feel really confident about my skills. Once you've got it down, the consistency is nice - Windows Server 2016 is similar to 2012, which was similar to 2008, which was similar to 2003. If I'd tried to go from 2003 to 2016 my brain would have exploded, but tech gives me lots of opportunities to link the new to the past.
I really enjoy it. I initially enjoyed it from an Fe perspective - I loved helping the users in the company, fixing their problems, helping them work better, giving them better equipment. I felt like I had a lot of value enabling the employees to do their best work. Now that I'm older, I value it more for the feelings of competency and accomplishment it provides."
5106,isfj,"Warehouse. I do work with others, but I don't have to talk to them, which is perfect. It's physically demanding, but it pays handsomely. I also work nights, so I rarely ever have to deal with traffic. "
5107,isfj,"I recently bought the house cleaning business I worked for so I run that now and I'm studying in my last year of science at uni, I feel like I'll need to do a couple different things part time for a career, I couldn't work in the same place everyday "
5108,isfj,"I'm a sysadmin, provide technical support and training, a supervisor and work on office refit projects.
I enjoy the people. It can definitely be stressful, sometimes, though.
I used to work in hospitality and studied hospitality management. I prefer where I am now, though."
5109,isfj,I am a veterinarian but never worked as one (just during my interships in college). I decided to switch career with a master and now I'm finishing my internship in a bioscience laboratory. Now the only animals I work with are the laboratory mice. I'm fine and would like to continue with a PhD (fingers crossed). 
5110,isfj,"ISFJs are compassionate, generous, and nurturing. We appreciate tradition, we work hard, and we're meticulous with our work. ISFJs are good observing and noticing things about people.
Basically, being a teacher fits every quality about ISFJs lol"
5111,isfj,"I have two employees at the moment, one is a really good friend and she's good at her job so no problems there, the other I'm starting training with this week. I've trained people before and I find when it's a choice between being nice, or telling it like it is, telling it like it is will make them perform better and that's going to improve my business so I'm fairly okay with discipline. Plus I really like teaching people how to do things so I look at it more as improving their abilities than pointing out all the things they've done wrong.  "
5112,isfj,"I always try my best to learn everything that I need to do in my everyday life. Even the ones that I just occasionally need to do. 
This is becoming a problem at times because I see other personalities relying on other people and that is ok. Even if I'm on the other side and i'm the one being asked for help, I always do my best to help and never think that this is a burden at all unless i'm obviously being taken advantage of. 
Personally though, I always think that i'm being a burden on others when I ask for help and I find myself apologizing profusely and thanking them too much as well."
5113,isfj,"For me, definitely.
I have this weird fear of asking for help, because I always feel like everybody has more important things to do, and I don't want to be a burden.
I also have a tendency to volunteer to do more than my fair share of work, because I want it to be done right, and I don't always trust that other people will do it correctly.
It's sort of counter-productive though, because when I'm overworked like that, I can't do things as thoroughly as I would like to."
5114,isfj,"I have an issue where i just don't trust people to do things how I do them. I'd rather do something myself so that i know it gets done how i want it.
I also have quite a bit of social anxiety, so asking someone for help for something can get my heart racing, and i'd rather take the burden even if i know it would be alot easier with someone else. I think this is what specifically made me independent, I just can't bring myself to request help unless i really need it"
5115,isfj,"While I ask for help when I really need it or if it's not too hard in general when doing tasks I try not to ask things that would burden people for a long period of time or get them to worry about me.
I just feel bad when people start to overly think about me a mix of not wanting attention and using up too much of their time."
5116,isfj,"Se-users are often described as indulgent and hungry for new experiences but what about Si-users?
With tertiary Si I can't fully make sense of it but I noticed that I almost never like something (food, music) the first time I try it. Only after processing the new sensations in my mind can I decide that I like it and only after longing for something for a while can I fully enjoy it. I'm careful about new experiences and mostly stay loyal to my favorites. Unlike Se-users I'm quite picky and pay a lot of attention if something feels right or if I should stop because my body isn't really calling for it. But these are only some vague ideas about what could be Si.
What do you think is the Si approach to sex and sensual experiences in general?"
5117,isfj,"Music tastes have a lot to do with personality, right? So, I'm just wondering if there's any music that you'd think other ISFJ's would like. 
I don't get into many bands or artists, but when I do it gets really obsessive. Bands I've obsessed over so far are twenty one pilots, Radiohead, and I'm looking into more! 
Maybe music tastes have nothing to do with Myers Briggs personalities, but who knows? Some of us might have quite similar music tastes after all!"
5118,isfj,"I love language and finding the strange concepts we've decided to name is a pass time of mine. Using them where it has no real bearing is my small way honoring our language with being too pretentious. 
I hope you enjoy whatever you listen to! "
5119,isfj,"Hmm I've never thought of honoring language that way before. That makes me want to brush up on my vocabulary XD
I listened to some of your playlists on Spotify for a few hours. I'm not a big fan of remixes but everything else I really enjoyed. A lot of it was very calming :)
Oh! And I just remembered that I saw Jon Bellion live when he was an opener for twenty one pilots in February! He seems like such an awesome guy who makes great music; he really got the crowd moving."
5120,isfj,"Hi! :)
My sociological mind started ponderng why people watch the shows they watch on tv/streaming (specifically reality) and I was wondering - do my fellow ISFJ peeps like reality tv? And what genre of tv do you enjoy the most :)
(Personally not a fan of reality, love comedy and dramedy with a healthy inclusion of ABC Australia :))"
5121,isfj,"Eureka! It’s campy, sweet, and it feels like most characters are genuinely good people. It makes me so happy, like soul balm. Be forewarned, though. It definitely takes a few episodes to hit its stride. 
I don’t like reality. Unless it’s nice, like Great British Baking show. "
5122,isfj,"Yeah. ABC on Wednesday, ( and 702 in the car) , buffy, ( watching it now, and some sci-fi but not endless episodic shit).  So happy!, lost in space ,  but not killjoys or the expanse.  Firstly season of a lot of stuff, not so much second. 
No reality, cooking, sports"
5123,isfj,"I can't stand reality tv but this may be because I used to transcribe for several popular (terrible) shows in the early 2000s.. I feel like I should be getting paid $14/hr if I watch anything reality. 
I'm into comedy and drama for the most part. Right now I'm watching the Handmaid's Tale, Barry, Bob's Burgers.. "
5124,isfj,"The Office, HIMYM is a classic, The Big Bang Theory, Blackish, New Girl, and South Park. I’m in to most sitcom shows. I also like Orange is the New Black and 13 Reasons Why. I also love watching NFL and NBA. "
5125,isfj,"Hi, I have a two-part post.
1) Does anyone else ever ""search for their hero""? I am not sure how to describe it, but basically I just crave someone to protect me, to feel a sense of ""if I am in trouble, they will be there to get me out of it."" I think it stems from all the bad relationships I've been in, and how I never realized they were bad until I had multiple friends telling me I should get out.
Recently I was watching a tv show with my roommates, and a character on the show got beat up by a little kid. He goes home, his older brother sees him and just asks ""Who did this to you?"" He then proceeds to go find the little kid, threaten him very meanly, and chase him off...
After seeing this, I was just like ""I like that guy."" and my roommate says ""Well he is an asshole."" And... I just thought of this reply, and didn't realize how much it really meant to me at the time -- ""Sometimes people need a douchebag to protect them if they can't protect themselves."" I want someone like that, I want someone to protect me and to see when I have been downtrodden by someone and to take charge and go up and be like ""That girl is amazing, if I see you treating her like that again I won't be happy."" I guess I just want a big brother-type figure, or even a menacing boyfriend lol...
Vaguely related-- do you ever just wish that your SO would be more like you? Or do the things that you think to do? For example, the other day my bf (he is intp/intj) and I miscommunicated and I thought he was coming to my place when he was not. Well, he apologized etc but the whole time I was thinking ""Well, now I told him I was upset... is he going to come over here to make me feel better? since I thought he was going to come here now?"" -- and I literally convinced myself maybe he would show up, bc if I had done that to him and knew he was upset, I thought that I would've walked to his place to cheer him up. Ofc he didn't, but it is a big problem for me bc I keep thinking well I would've done this when he does not even think to do those things for me... I am trying to work on this bc I know it is just my pushing my own expectations onto him.
My second question is-- Do you have problems idolizing people? Or maybe idealizing is the better word.
Example - I met a guy online, he seemed really great. We talked and knew each other for over a year, we met up in person, etc. We had a lot of rough patches but were good friends. Well, I started talking to a mutual friend and am now much better friends with her (both are INTJs btw)... Well now, she has basically opened my eyes to how this guy was never as amazing as I thought, in fact he's kind of a dick but I never even realized til I had her perspective on it!
It's like I just become easily obsessed with people and am blindsided to all their faults. Currently I do not think this is going on with anyone, but I am really scared of it happening again without me even realizing it.
Sorry for the long post and if it is a little confusing."
5126,isfj,"Yup, I've been guilty of thinking like that in all of my relationships. Not just romantic ones. The thing is though, as an ISFJ. I 'm extremely self sacrificing on behalf of others. Because I care more about making them happy than myself. I wish I could change this a little. But, it's so deeply rooted in who I am. I want to have relationships with people who would honor my feeling so much. Though, I feel as most people are too selfish for me to ever find that. 
It's hard being so empathetic and willing to see the good in people I care for. Almost to a point of ignoring flaws. This however only applies to people I begin to care for. The rest of the population.. not so much :)"
5127,isfj,"Holy crap, I think a lot like you. When we were dating, I always expected him to do things for me that I would do in his position... it could be little things like visiting me after class, or if we argued over the phone, I would hope he'd visit me that evening rather than the day after. It caused a lot of problems because I kept assuming things like these. 
I've realized that I can't expect him to read my mind, so I've learned to vocalize my needs a little more. Of course, it means the world to me when he shows he cares without me asking. Unfortunately, things didn't last; it's been pretty rough. :("
5128,isfj,"It is not confusing at all for someone who knows exactly what you're talking about. I want to be Batman's little sister or best friends with a gang member or something like that. I idealize people all the time but usually only until I am able to spend enough time with them in person, get to know them better, see how they react in certain situations. So far noone lived up to my ideals, some of them turned out to be quite the contrary but over time I've learned to make a difference between my fantasies about them and the reality. 
EDIT: I should probably note that I'm an INFJ though."
5129,isfj,"yes. i do this. a lot. it's a big problem that i'm trying to deal with. it's called the halo effect. but yeah, i would find a trait in someone i consider admirable and kind of forget to see the person as a whole. that trait sticks out so much to me on an emotional level that that person just feels so amazing."
5130,isfj,"Yes, the expectations are the worst part of it all, because I think my ""ideal partner"" would know all my needs and emotions without me having to tell them ""I'm sad and upset, come comfort me.""
Luckily I am learning that communication is essential and talking does help, even if it's incredibly difficult for me to admit to my boufriend that I am upset bc I don't want to upset him! I've also found dropping hints to an intj/intp is literally pointless--they listen to what you say, but do not really get what you mean by it if that makes sense.
Did you ever find any way to deal with the unmet expectations? I realize sometimes thst my expectations are just too overwhelming so I have never told my boyfriend, but it does eat me up inside sometimes."
5131,isfj,"Yeah I know what you mean, hints didn't do much for my boyfriend either--usually, it just set myself up for a misunderstanding later because I'd assume he got the message haha. However, try not to bottle up your feelings! It only causes your feelings of disappointment to accumulate. I know it's hard to discuss, because I knew what I was feeling was sometimes irrational, however it helps a lot. I'm sure your boyfriend will listen with an open mind :).
For me, what distanced us apart was how reliant I was on him to 'give' me happiness. This happened gradually, but I felt under-appreciated and he felt too overwhelmed with my needs. I can't say a found a solid way to deal with the unmet expectations, however I learned to acknowledge that these feelings were unreasonable at times, and that he has his own life to worry about too. Talking it out with him made me realize how silly my thoughts were, and allowed him to understand how I think. 
Just know that some guys aren't the best mind readers--but it's okay, that's just how they are. Don't let his actions (or lack of actions) get to you, and keep communicating. :)"
5132,isfj,"Don't get me wrong, I am not a horrible person but I have never really been close with many people. I think a lot of people are incredibly shallow,superficial and will stab you in the back if given the chance. Maybe I mistyped myself even because a lot of ISFJs seem warm and nurturing and are more socially oriented. "
5133,isfj,"It's a very common introverted thing, especially if you're more awkward socially. 
If you're an ISFJ it doesn't mean you like everyone - you might just be nice and polite to them just because that's what feels right, or you want to avoid unnecessary conflict. And there's also the possibility of a Si-Ti loop, where you use Fe less than it's normal and feel more disconnected from other people. I know I do.
And ultimately yes, you could have mistyped yourself. But I would skip most of the type descriptions and read more on the function stack - see what functions you actually use."
5134,isfj,"holy shit, you just described me. i've never seen anyone on this sub mention this, but i sometimes feel like an outlier of the isfj's because deep down, i think most people are superficial and annoying. but i'm also described as really nice. i thought maybe i mistyped myself as well, but i feel like the functions line up with me. "
5135,isfj,"I can relate too, although this feeling was more prominent a couple of years back. I forced myself to become a bit more social, and I found that some people was good company and it was my mistake not to socialize, but I still find a lot of people that is not my cup of tea precisely. I am polite because I don't have reasons not to be nice and I don't want to cause any unnecesary problem. 
I don't know about you, but I am very bad at lying and if I don't like someone I try to limit my interactions with them because I am paranoid that my face will show my disapproval. "
5136,isfj,"Yes, I experience this a lot. Granted, there are one or two people I would do anything to spend every day around, and that don't irritate me, but I will admit that sometimes I am shallow and superficial. I should work more on being around people and not burning bridges. "
5137,isfj,"I rather have a small group of persons in my life whom I have close and intimate contact to. Would also say some people are shallow and superficial. Maybe even backstabbing, but for some reason these people are not really part of my life. Apart from colleagues, neighbours, etc."
5138,isfj,"Oh ? Too late.
I didn't thought about it until you stated it.
That's a human thing. We can't know more than about 150 people at the same time. We reached a saturation point.
You're just at least cynical. I don't get why it worries you : most cynics believe to be more mature than their fellow idealists."
5139,isfj,"When I was a MBTI test only n00b I usually got ISTJ. Whenever tests asked if I was more emotional/feeler vs logical I went with logical. 
However after researching functions and retaking tests afterward I realized my logical sense was more Ti based than Te based (I prefer understanding why things are instead of making sure things are objectively the way they should be)
I realized F(e) doesn't necessarily mean you are overly emotional (which Im not) you just have your own personal subjective values you stick to when making decisions.
I realized I have more conform-y ""Fe""eler decision making as opposed to strong inner Fi values. In fact, Ive felt like my inner persona is almost nonexistent at some points in my life.
I feel more satisfied when doing things that make people happy or making thing harmonious as opposed to making absolutely sure things are objectively the way they should be.
My Si has always been very strong so at least Ive always got that part right!"
5140,isfj,"I'm the same way, but depending on the test and my current mood, I'll get either ISFJ or ISTJ. I'm split almost exactly 50/50 between F and T, so it really can depend on the situation. I can be very analytical, but I also value other's feelings, and sometimes feelings trump the facts of a situation. I try to take both into account whenever possible though. I also like to make people happy and diffuse conflict. I feel like I'm accomplishing something that way.
I've never really understood the Fe/Fi, Ne/Ni, Se/Si, Te/Ti thing though."
5141,isfj,"Oh whoops guess I should have emphasized ""a set of"" subjective values since thats more Fe, since you are conforming to a set of values set by others
I realized this sentence contradicts what I said later in the post (which I believe is more correct)"
5142,isfj,"Hi ISFJ's! So I met a really sweet girl and we've been getting to know each other, she's an ISFJ and I'm an INFJ, and she mentioned that she has some pretty bad anxiety at times. I really want to be sensitive to that struggle and respond to it as appropriately and compassionately as possible if and when it comes up. So my question to you guys is, what's the best way (in your minds) that someone can respond when you're really feeling it in a given moment? Is there anything that I could do that would make it better, or is it best to just let her find her own way through it?
Thanks for your insight!"
5143,isfj,"I'll add that it depends on what is triggering it. ISFJs can go through intense emotions at times, we are very exacting & tough on ourselves, a good reminder at that time from someone else can be in form of appreciation of what we do because we're seldom appreciated & recognized. We also take things very seriously and burn ourselves out internally, so sometimes help can be in the form of a loving, caring reminder to lighten up and not takes things so seriously. These are a couple things that work for me when coming from a close family member. Try to find out what triggers it, that will give you clues as to your next steps. 
There can be other things that are triggering it as well. We also have anxiety when we're faced with new stimuli, some change from the norm, in that scenario a good reminder is to tell us to not panic & give this new thing an opportunity to unfold and let it take its course. We're not good at embracing change. Also, we have a huge backlog of repressed feelings, so that can catch up to us very quickly and be a cause of anxiety, in that case a good form of help would be to encourage us to not bottle our feelings up so much and to regularly be aware of how we're feeling and to express our feelings in a healthy way before they build up too much. Another source of anxiety for us is conflict, in that scenario what works for me is to not engage in conflict and in some cases realizing that a particular environment is too toxic, and the healthiest option is to no longer be a part of that toxic environment. So you see there are different causes of anxiety for us and different things help to deal with that at different times. 
Also unconditional love and reassurance from a close person in our life, as mentioned in the other comment is always a good thing as well, can't go wrong with that as the base of your interactions when your partner is anxious but these are some additional things to ponder as well on top of that."
5144,isfj,"My anxiety is mostly manageable, but it does sometimes give me problems.
I'm dating an ESFJ, and he's been fantastic every time I've had trouble with that.
Usually he just hugs me really tight, and either listens to me (if I feel the need to talk about it and have a bit of a word-dump), or he calms me down by telling relatable stories of things he's been through. 
He also reassures me that he's gonna be there for me through whatever it is that I'm stressing about, and no matter what, I'll have him, which is really comforting to me, because when I go through a period of intense anxiety, I tend to develop a mentality of ""the sky is falling"", and I catastrophize everything, so just knowing that I don't have to worry about him taking off is one less thing for me to panic about."
5145,isfj,"If they're there with me, then holding me or holding my hand or otherwise touching me in a comforting way would help immensely (factoring in being a Physical Touch person) - though I'm talking about my SO here and not just any person. 
Reassuring phrases that counteract the negative things I'm saying. Reminders that I'm safe, that I'm not x negative trait, etc. Talking me through it if it's very serious, or making me laugh/forget about it's something minor. "
5146,isfj,"Hello! :)
I'm really into this MBTI stuff and I had a lot of research about it (cognitive functions, even socioncs, enneagram, Big5 etc.) but still I'm not 100% sure about my type. What made me think that I'm an ISFJ is that I definitely recognise Si  and Fe in my function stack. I easely notice things that changed, I'm very aware of my phisical state (how can people forget to eat? :D), I like to collect things that remind of a pleasant or important event (like cinema tickets, the armband from when I was in hospital, and even candy papers :D), I have a lot of small routines (some times I'm sick of them, but if I don't go by them, I'm really guilty about it). So I think that's my Si. 
I think my Fe is not very much developed. What motivates me in my behavior toward others is to prevent them being angry with me. I very sensitive about someones negative feelings for me (when I notice this, I always freeze and don't know how to treat the person and the situation). So I really like to make people laugh, I often shock them with my weird,crazy, sometimes cruel,dark and inapropiet humor, but I always stop when I notice that someone is hurting.
I also think that I use Ti sometimes. I love to pinpoint logical inconsistency in theories, some of my friends call me critical. I love learning new concepts, I enjoy debating about scientific or philosolhical topics for hours.  I'm a sceptical and sarcastic person, very pessimistic about myself, but optimistic about others.
What made me doubt that I'm an ISFJ is that I loooove living in my mind. I've created multiple worlds in my head. I spend a lot of time daydreaming aboug myself in different situations (where I have superpowers, or maybe I have to be saved, or I'm a crazy villain), and I also love to create new ,,movies "" in my head with already exisisting characters but  with different stories. I can entertain myself like this for hours. Is this Ne or Ni? Or maybe this doesn't do anything with cognitive functions
So, what do you think? Am I an ISFJ? Others have told me that I could be an INFJ,but I doubt it, I don't really understand how Ni works, no matter how much I read about it, and it's so rare too, I don't want to be one of the mistyped INFJs.
I've also tested INTP, INFP, ISFP, ISTJ, INTJ, but I start to doubt the accuracy of the tests. 
Feel free to ask. :) "
5147,isfj,"I agree with you. Couldn't push it further on those functions.
I suggest you approach it through the role function, it may help:
http://leontsao.com/2017/02/03/428/
How old are you? You seem to have developed your third and fourth function, regardless of which they are 
How do you feel about Te in general? Efficiency, acquiring knowledge from books?
Are you sure you are an introvert? What makes you say that?"
5148,isfj,"Wow, thanks for the article, it's a completely new view point for me!
I'm 20. 
I know a Te dominant, and I really like her, but sometimes she drives me crazy because she always wants to be productive in some way. It really irritates me when people are trying to do things usefully every time (even when they are trying to have fun). I will never understand workalcoholics :D. 
Ohh, I'm really sure that I'm an introvert. I love being on my own, taking a long walk in nature, going alone to cinema etc. I must admit, after two days of being alone I usually become unmotivated,depressed etc. But loud people and huge gatherings scare me :D."
5149,isfj,"That fits with Te being PolR (6th), so Fe-Ti 2nd and 3rd.
Because of that I will not question your introvertedness. But recharging with people pr rather discharging when alone could be a sign of extravert. Some extroverts, in MBTI's sense are not fans of huge groups and parties. I for one, energise in small group conversations, but large gathering, noisy bars, etc just shut me off.
That, as from the beginning, leaves you with Ni or Si first. I definitely get a general Si over Ni feel, but with no clear tell.
Did my link bring any insight as to which your role function could be. I gave it because if you have Si 1st, Ni is role, so you'd still have Ni, just expressed somehow differently, so I'm hopping it may clear up the situation to see how each would look as role."
5150,isfj,"Hey, permaro, just a quick heads-up:
jist is actually spelled gist. You can remember it by begins with g-.
Have a nice day!
^^^^The ^^^^parent ^^^^commenter ^^^^can ^^^^reply ^^^^with ^^^^'delete' ^^^^to ^^^^delete ^^^^this ^^^^comment."
5151,isfj,"Does the Si-Ne/Ni-Se difference make it difficult for the partners to truly ""connect"" with each other?
I get along really well with ISFJs (as friends). They really help me be more practical. However, I cannot have theoretical discussions with them which is a bummer. They take things too literally whereas I struggle with taking things at face value. Yet, our introversion and auxiliary Fe make us both value harmony + focus on pleasing our loved ones, which makes it easy for us to get along. I have always been curious what it would be like to date one...

I pulled this from a post on the INFJ sub*
"
5152,isfj,"Definitely a disconnect in communication as you said. However this is referencing my 30 year relationship with a family member. I find frustration lies the most in infj giving advice when it wasn’t requested (majority of the time), and the isfj fearing letting down infj because said advice wasn’t desired. I also find the infj gets snappy in an Se power play type way, but because it’s inferior it comes out like a child tantrum which is hard for me to handle. On the flip side my inferior Ne creates the inability to see alternatives which annoys infj. However now that I’m older and exercising my Ne I have a hard time committing to one linear path. 
Otherwise as you mentioned the Fe Ti saves us. That sounded more negative than positive, but I assure you there is plenty of love in the family relationship. "
5153,isfj,"Yeah I have never had an INFJ SO. But I’m friends with an INFJ. I like them I find that we get along pretty well and both have solid Fe and Ti working together. However, it can be hard to keep up with her Ni sometimes and to understand it (I try my best to). I can definitely see some of the Se in her lmao. "
5154,isfj,"I am dating an isfj and I'm an infj.  We both like pleasing others so we have this plan one of us picks three things to do and then the other picks the one.  It's nice to have someone that cares asuch about others as I do.  We like to snuggle and watch TV.  Sometimes we go on dates, my favorite was a wine and paint.  We both like similar vehicles and turbos.  We both have steady jobs, but aren't concerned about fancy things.  "
5155,isfj,"Oh boy!! That’s me. Sometimes I do give advice when it’s not verbally asked for because their body language (as they were speaking) asked for it. Thanks so much for clarifying this for me. 
I really valued your input. 
[saved]"
5156,isfj,"Indeed. In the beginning we were always focusing on each other such as cuddles, massage, helping with homework when we were in high school together. It felt like we were making new journies for ourselves.
The trouble came in when our immaturity reared its head. I felt held back and never expressed those feelings while she expressed my overbearing nature and neurotic perfectionism felt like I wasn't truly appreciative of her. Something I indeed kicked myself for quite often after we broke up.
To this day she checks up on me on social media (snapchat) however she doesn't reach out. I can't help but wonder why. :3"
5157,isfj,"I get my feelers hurt ridiculously easily. In my desire for harmony and acceptance, I struggle with even the most basic conflicts that other types wouldn't even think twice about. I am a complete softie to an extreme fault. "
5158,isfj,"when someone is angry, i feel responsible to calm them down. when someone is having a bad day, i feel responsible to cheer the person up. anytime anyone feels shitty, i feel like it's up to me to make sure the person is ok. it is exhausting and sometimes i wish i could just stop but i'd feel guilty if i didn't do anything."
5159,isfj,"I agree with ObliviousReporter. Similarly, we tend to be very considerate towards others and feel disappointed when they don't treat us the same. We are also prone to being taken for granted in relationships because of our giving and loving nature."
5160,isfj,"I don't know if this is an ISFJ thing or if I'm just weird, but are any of you guys really bad at goodbyes? I avoid them at all costs and don't say goodbye to even my closest friends when I leave somewhere for a while."
5161,isfj,"I am not too fond of nights, since I will go over every single interaction I had that day to see where I went wrong; Even I didn't do anything wrong, it takes a while for me to convince myself that what I did was okay."
5162,isfj,"It hurts to even say this by I am the sissy out of my circle of friends. It makes me feel unloved by my girlfriend and guy friends. 
I think I became an ISFJ because I was pretty spoiled when I was little. My parents were great but I was too dependent on them so I ended up a little sheltered. "
5163,isfj,"I always feel the need to take control of things because I feel like no one else will do it. It could be finishing a project, organizing an event, helping someone with their problems, or something as simple as meeting someone for coffee. I am always the one who has to take initiative or I end up feeling guilty. It's different in my work life because in my career (veterinary medicine) many people are J's and like structure and a plan. But most of my friends are  people who like to keep their options open and as a result end up doing nothing. It drives me up the wall. "
5164,isfj,"Ugh the fact that I take everything on, even if I don't want to. 
It's like I feel I have to to all the cleaning and cooking around the apartment even though my roommie or boyfriend offer multiple times. If I see them doing dishes or cleaning something I have to get up and help them. They often ask ""What are you doing? I'm cleaning, you don't have to too."" 
Also holy self-criticism batman! 
I'm always pretty hard on myself on how I speak my second language (Spanish) because I'm going to be a Spanish Teacher. I feel that I'm decent at best, but all my peers tell me that I'm really good. The first time I heard what they thought I was shocked that someone thought I was good/great at it. One person even told me
""If you weren't so hard on yourself/more confident, you'd be even better"""
5165,isfj,"Saying goodbye to people tears me up emotionally. Being ISFJ, I think we understand people better than the other personality types. We get absorbed into our relationships and become attached. I will say goodbye if I have to, but I try to stay connected to close friends at all costs."
5166,isfj,"I guess it depends on the way the ISFJ likes to communicate. Personally, I like to work out any issues that come up on the spot. Otherwise, the issue will eat me away... this doesn't always work with other personality types, some people like to push away issues and not deal with them up front.
Also, harsh criticism comes down very hard on us. I have no problem with sit down discussions and compromise, but I can't stand in-your-face confrontation."
5167,isfj,"I usually fall in love with men who are unemotional, but show emotion, rarely. 
I find that there is a good balance between my extreme emotions, and their lack of. 
This sounds odd, and kind of hard to understand...
But, another reason why I seem to be attracted to those guys is because of when they actually do show affection, it's more important to me, then when they show it everyday.. Because if they do, then it feels.. odd, fake even? I feel like, showing it everyday means less, then someone caring about me, but complimenting me when it counts the most.
For example, I would be more disappointed if someone complimented me for my looks everyday, then someone who did it maybe once a week. Because then it's more special..
Do I make sense?"
5168,isfj,"I'm very much the same way.  Unfortunately, my partner is not, and will often shut down if I try to talk things out when he's not ready.  It's been a long process of trying to meet each other halfway."
5169,isfj,"I am an ENFJ male who just recently started getting into a relationship with an ISFJ female. We met online about 3 months ago now, and have been seeing each other on a fairly regular basis since then. Both of us are coming off of serious long term relationships that each ended about a year ago. The first part of our relationship really focused on helping her sort through the feelings of her past relationship. It was her first serious relationship, and the guy hurt her badly.
I am very comfortable with how I feel about her, and I've been very honest and open about my feelings. She has been very hesitant about being in a serious relationship. I'm almost always the one to initiate activities. She rarely turns down an offer to spend time together, and she appears to enjoy herself when she's with me.  
She really needs her routine and becomes flustered with new situations, which she's had a lot of recently. I don't know if for our relationship to work, I need to become a part of her ""routine."" I'm trying to be patient, but I've never been with a girl who appeared so hesitant about being in a relationship.
I'm just not sure how long that takes for an ISFJ to warm up to someone, or if I'm even approaching this the right way. I'm more than willing to give this girl time, I just don't know if I'm waiting for something that'll never happen. I don't know the best ways to try and move an ISFJ out of their comfort zone. We both fit our respective types very well from everything I've read.
I'd really appreciate any and all advice and insight. I really want to make things work, I just don't know how best to do that.
This is also my first post, so please be gentle... "
5170,isfj,"First I'd like to it's awesome you're working on this! I am no master of ISFJ or psychology, I just feel you should get a response and  going off how I would feel if I were this girl. 
Likely she gave her everything to the previous relationship and is entirely exhausted from that. ISFJs are usually very considerate of others and less considerate of themselves, so she could be incredibly unstable and in a bad state still and not dealing with it because shes focused on everything but herself. What she needs is to face herself and figure out what she wants. This is incredibly difficult!!! 
It's also difficult for her to initiate relationships, especially if she is vulnerable then she will be more scared to put her heart on the line again. She will take a while to open up, but the fact that she is generally okay with things is hopefully a good sign. Watch out though, she could just be okaying them to be nice because you're helping her out with coping with the break up and she feels obliged to reciprocate. Let her know there is no pressure and that you are there for her because you care about her and want her to be happy.
If/when she opens up she will be the most caring wonderful type of girlfriend possible. (possibly biased answer) I wish you the best of luck!"
5171,isfj,"That girl sounds just like me. In order for me to be in a relationship with someone, they truly do have to be a part of my routine. I have to have a deep, personal relationship that intertwines directly into my everyday life. I am dating some one right now and that is a struggle for me, since he doesn't know any of my family and only a few of my friends. It is something I am trying to work on. I am trying to be a bit more flexible (especially since he is my exact opposite, an ENTP). 
Do you know her other friends and family? Do you only really ever hang out one on one? 
My biggest piece of advice is patience, which it sounds like you are practicing quite a bit, and also getting to know her family and friends. It's really important to become an active part of her every day life, someone who is knitted into her other personal relationships. "
5172,isfj,"I have gotten to know her parents and a number of her friends. I get along really well with them all. She definitely kept me at a distance from them all for awhile, but I've slowly sort of made my way into that sphere of her life. She's currently back living with her parents so I have dinner with them relatively often. I've started hanging out with some of her friends even when she can't join because we get along so well.
It's been really good, but I think they've also made her feel some pressure by asking about us. At least they all seem to be in favor of us being together.
Thanks for your input. I can't tell you how helpful it is :)"
5173,isfj,"I thought the ISFJ one was funny, but pretty true! I feel, not just in romantic relationships, but all of my relationships the way I act most of  the time is along the lines of ""I did this thing for you, please like me..."" "
5174,isfj,"I feel like I do ""I did something for you. Please like me."" way too much with people to make friends.  I guess it's any easy way to interact with someone and have a topic I really can engage on.  Maybe that's just me?"
5175,isfj,"I feel like it's pretty true, too. I never have understood or felt comfortable with ""normal"" flirting (whatever normal is), so I try to do something nice to show that I like someone. I don't think they always pick up on it, though..."
5176,isfj,"I feel like given our personalities this can be a possibility that can be common with our type.
I've actually been called this by one who was once an online friend but got kinda stuck up.
Sometimes I can be self-conscious when I'm the quiet one of a group or one on one conversation. Sometimes I try to force a conversation 1 on 1 which works for a bit but then it proceeds to get quiet/awkward."
5177,isfj,"I relate to this so very much. 
Personally I have social anxiety. I always try to look constantly for things to talk about and make sure I don't say the ""wrong"" shit. I worry too much about having an awkward 1 to 1 conversation and then just end up having one anyway... And then yeah, I feel as though I come of as boring. 
Looking for some advice too."
5178,isfj,"I clicked this thread so fast. I have been called boring and honestly, it really hurt. I was told I wasn't interesting and was boring. I thought my entire world was crashing because it was my partner at the time saying it. I was younger and he later explained things and apologized for the incident. It just really struck me and sticks as a vivid memory.. 
I get why we can be called boring. I do. Like I'm really hard to talk to, I have a hard time conversing, especially in groups (if it's people I don't know at all, forget about it). Someone that doesn't know me would definitely call me boring, quiet, aloof maybe heh. But they don't know me and what I really think and am like. My routine and enjoyment of things staying the same can be called boring too but I do enjoy doing little things to make the days different. Like going for groceries, seeing a friend, going for a walk, etc.
I just don't force conversation. If someone talks to me I'll talk to them but otherwise I don't speak to or approach anyone unless I have to. Sometimes I do feel bad for being quiet when I'm with my best friend (ISFJ as well). She's better at conversation than me, asking questions and such so she makes up for my lacking areas. 
Hope I didn't ramble too much, I just feel really strongly about this subject and haven't seen a good topic here in awhile so thank you for bringing it up."
5179,isfj,"No one's ever called me boring (that I know of) but I can totally relate. I definitely do not have the gift of gab and can immediately detect when I'm being boring, however, I am a good listener. So that's pretty much all I do in social situations. I listen to everyone else's conversations. XD"
5180,isfj,I know I'm boring and I know others think I'm boring but I've never been called boring. That would hurt so much. I think I would punch someone in the nose! So sorry you were told that. What a jerk! I don't talk much but I smile a lot especially when listening to others. I'm a great listener.
5181,isfj,"I recently met an ISFJ who may be one of the most beautiful woman I've ever laid eyes on. Physically she's like a work of art and mentally she seems normal. I'm very attracted to her caring side and it makes me want to praise her non-stop, although I hold myself back because I don't want to come off as over the top. But if I'm being completely honest she has me completely, drool from the mouth, infatuated.
I've been doing a lot of reading and I'm afraid that her not having that mental energy that I so often need to express to someone may be challenging in the long run. I feel that our relationship could be very loving, but I'm just afraid that after the butterflies subside we will see how different we truly are. At the same time, my desire to be with someone who is honest, faithful, and caring is strong and she basically embodies that to a tee. We are still pretty early on in the relationship and haven't committed to anything. I don't want to end up hurting her and myself by going through a rollercoaster relationship (this happened before with my ESFJ gf from high school). But would it make sense for me to end things now for the fear of what could happen? I don't think so
In just interested in hearing some isfj's thoughts on this. "
5182,isfj,"Well, obviously everyone's experience is going to be different, regardless of MBTI type. There are a whole lot of other factors, like whether you share the same future goals, what your love languages are, how emotionally healthy you are, etc.
That being said, I had a very long ongoing relationship with an INTP, and  I'll share my experiences.
When things were good, they were very, very good. He made me laugh, he was smart and charming, he could be affectionate, and I was drawn to the fact that he was slightly eccentric and didn't care what other people thought of him. 
However, when things were bad, they were so bad. There were so many ups and downs, it was a real emotional rollercoaster. 
Our communication styles were different, and we ran into a lot of issues with that. I wanted a lot more emotional openness and vulnerability than he was willing (or able) to give me, and I often felt like he had a wall up. I felt completely deprived of affection at times, and I often felt like the relationship was very one-sided, with me doing most of the work.
I'm a very affectionate, nurturing sort of person, but I do need a certain amount of that in return, and I most definitely wasn't getting enough from him. He would go through phases of obsession with something like a videogame or a hobby, and I would feel totally ignored and neglected. To me, it often felt like once he had won me over and figured me out, he dropped me for something else that he found more interesting, and it was kind of a cycle that would repeat.
When I would try to communicate these issues with him, or explain that my needs weren't being met, he felt attacked, and from his perspective, it felt like I was pointing out his flaws. I honestly don't believe he was even capable of giving me what I needed in a relationship, and I did feel neglected often, while I'm sure he felt smothered, to a degree.
When we had any kind of conflict, he would stonewall me and give me the cold shoulder for days, which always killed me, because I can't stand that kind of treatment from somebody I love and care about. 
We brought out the best in each other, but we also brought out the worst, and I've never experienced so much love, passion, conflict and anger in a relationship as I did with him. 
Granted, my INTP had depression and low self esteem, which was probably a contributing factor when it came to some of our issues. I was hung up on him for nearly 6 years off and on, and I had so much trouble moving on from him, just because there was so much love and chemistry between us. 
As of now, I've been in a relationship with an ESFJ for a year, and it's been such a different experience, it's only now that I feel like I've really come to terms with how toxic my relationship with my INTP was. I feel like all of my needs are being met, communication is a total breeze, he puts in about the same amount of effort as I do, and our love languages are similar. We haven't had any conflict at all, versus my experience of having a massive fight every couple of months in my previous relationship.
I think an ISFJ-INTP relationship can work, but it may be difficult at times, and you're both going to have to put in a lot of effort when it comes to communication. You're going to have to make a real effort to be gentle with her feelings (we are very sensitive), and try not to become irritated if she does get hurt easily. She's going to have to have a thicker skin around you, and rely on outside family and friend relationships to have more of her needs met. If you guys can learn to resolve disagreements in a civilized, polite way, and you're both trying to make sure you're meeting the other person's needs as best you can, I think you'll be alright. It may not be the most natural or easy pairing, but I certainly grew a lot as a person from my relationship."
5183,isfj,"I am an INTP and my wife is an ISFJ and we are extremely compatible. Rather than having an emotional disconnect, I am able to observe and intellectually comprehend what she needs emotionally, which oftentimes is just a calm and rational sounding board, which is very easy for me to be.  Likewise, it is very easy for me to validate her emotions.  Meanwhile, she is kind, honest, and caring, and this reliability helps me stay secure and comforted in the stability of our relationship (that is, she gives me nothing for me to over-analyze or be anxious about).  Also, she really is the most extroverted introvert, and handles/maintains our social life, which works great for me, and is very patient when I come down with a bit of monomania.  So much depends on the individuals involved, but if you focus outside of yourself on the other, this personality combination can be a rewarding and satisfying match. I don't mean this to come off as boastful, but it really is my experience."
5184,isfj,"Thanks so much for sharing that with me, I really appreciate your honestly and your advice. Im still unsure of how I want to approach the relationship, but I suppose the best thing I can do at this point is try to ease myself mentally and emotionally for the time being and let events play out. 
I know what you means about the ESFJ thing though. I had a relationship with a ENT/FJ about a year ago and it felt so natural. With this new girl I feel like I have to search my mind for the right things to say to her and it's a little exhausting. But at the same time it's really thrilling and I love the feeling of butterflies. Also, this may not be related to personality at all, but physically I feel more attracted with her than my previously mentioned ex. It's that intense physical attraction paired with the loyalty and loving nature that is puts me in a weird state. "
5185,isfj,"This is such a great comment.
The communication. Ugh. It is so difficult. She (ISFJ) does not hear what I (INTP) am saying. I do not understand why she is saying the things she does. So, so difficult. So much work.
Source: married for decades"
5186,isfj,"We've recently started dating, although it seems to be getting very serious. The dynamics of our relationship are great. I go to work and do all of the projects around the house, while she's the type that really just wants to make me happy. She's always doing stuff around my house. Cleaning, cooking, etc. She is truly wonderful.
Problem is, we seem to have a hard time with emotional communication. If I am upset, I shut myself away from the world and do something productive until I feel better. I find no solace in talking about things. 
From her perspective, she just wants to make me happy. I know that she's an emotional person, but she doesn't handle it appropriately. If I'm upset she sees herself as failing to make me happy. She sees herself as failing because I don't feel comfortable talking to her about things. She reacts with anger, and honestly it's a bit intimidating. Once she's mad there's no turning back. Here's the kicker. I really don't like stress or fighting. So I've tried deescalating things by opening up and explaining myself. Which REALLY puts me out of my comfort zone. I hate it, to be honest. And by then, it's too late. 
There's so much compatibility between us. And honestly, I definitely see myself marrying this woman. But this is definitely putting a wedge in our relationship and I really don't know what to do.
TL;dr YOU GUYS ARE CONFUSING"
5187,isfj,"Haha wow--- even as an ISFJ male that is a pretty accurate description on how I react to similar situations.
If I have family, friends, and co-workers who have a bad day and are emotionally pissy, its very, very hard for me to remain compassionate to their needs when they wont let me ""help"" or at least confine in me the source of their problem. Interestingly, I've observed myself mirroring their emotional state after being around with them a couple hours, either because that's how I coup with the problem or have become angry myself. I could be having the greatest day of my life, but if you stick me with someone who is having a shitty day, I'll lower myself to their level.
Sadly its just how we are. Things that help:
1) While you don't necessarily have to open up about what is causing the issue, you can reinforce her confidence by assuring her that whatever is the source of your stress is NOT her.
2) Let her do something... ANYTHING to attempt to help. I.E. Tell her a cup of tea would make you ""feel"" better. Or let her give you a giant long hug, let her make you cookies or whatever. Those acts of ""help"" from us are not burdensome... we actually derive our energy from helping others and feeling appreciated about doing it.
But really dude, you get a lot of bonus points for seeing the problem so clearly. Nicely done."
5188,isfj,"I've had two jobs.
1) In highschool, worked at a use bookstore. I stamped books with our stamp, I stacked them, ordered them, put them on the shelves, alphabetized the shelves, helped customers... This honestly would be my dream job, if I had a choice and I could've made a living doing this. This job was just so unstressful, I could not mess up. I really just like knowing that I am doing everything right and I don't have much chance of messing up. I also liked that I didn't have to manage anyone -- I was the one being managed.
2) Teacher (kind of). I work at a conservancy/park and we do once-a-week classes for homeschooled children and I lead this class. I also lead educational stations during field trips to our park. I enjoy this work, but it is also much more stressful to me. The fieldtrip stations are not bad, once I have done the station I am comfortable doing it again (as we have set programs we do, and repeat stations often). The homeschool class is a bit worse only because each class is something completely new, and I used to have nightmares the night before I would teach the class... Thankfully I have finally gotten somewhat used to it. This job has probably helped me a lot with some of my anxiety regarding speaking in front of people... much less intimidating to speak to a group of kids!
If I could choose, I would happily be a book-stamper and shelver forever. But I do realize that the job where I am working with other people and kids has really helped me a lot so I am happy I am doing it :) It's also super cute to get cards from kids telling me how great I am lol."
5189,isfj,"Not a ISFJ myself, but from the ISFJs I know:
female ISFJ friend #1: social worker
female ISFJ friend #2: teacher
male ISFJ friend: started his own company with his friends and is selling medical care stuff, vegan food and several other things (they divided it into several shops); besides that, his family has a farm and he loves to help there in his free time every here and then"
5190,isfj,"I am Quality Assurance Engineer. 
I've always like Computer Science development but the actual programming side is too stressful for me.
Being able to be part of the team, making sure the app works as it should, building a good relationship with the team client, and just seeing the customer being a satisfied with the app is very satisfying. 
Generally QA doesn't get as much attention from other members of the development team or client but the few people who openly appreciate what I do make me happy."
5191,isfj,"I work at an animal shelter. Mainly doing assistant work for the Executive Director and higher ups. But, I do get to go to a lot of events with the dogs and walk them and advocate for them. Absolutely love my job, wouldn't change it for the world. :)"
5192,isfj,"While not an analyst i did consider being a teacher before but decided to go to IT field instead
As long as you work with a team that gives you solid work and appreciates what you do you should really like your job.
I really like mine"
5193,isfj,"My late isfj wife was the best functional / business analyst I ever met. She started as web programmer to know what it was about, and then evolved to the analysis part.
Also of course she was too dedicated for her own sake, and it's only by being a consultant correctly paid by the hour that she could somewhat profit from doing the workload of 4 normal persons. She still had a hard time invoicing all her hours, it took long to gain the confidence that she merited all the hours spent. "
5194,isfj,"I think any job we ISFJ's take on can be depressing. But honestly, social work is very rewarding. 
I used to work with youth and they can be quite a challenge. But the moment I got through to one of the youth, even if it was to convince them to agree to something very small like eating breakfast, it trumps all the challenges and difficulties I had to face prior.
So the rewards in this field outweigh all the little drawbacks you may have or feel."
5195,isfj,"I just like lurking in a lot of the threads. I also contribute to advice threads like on r/relationships or r/depression. Some of the main page stuff makes for good conversation in the real world since it seems like news usually hits reddit before the news on tv.
Then I guess other than that reddit is mostly about cute dog or cat pictures."
5196,isfj,I started enjoying reddit much more once I unsubscribed to most of the default subreddits and found one that are  specific to my likes and interests. Got any TV shows you really like? Hobbies? Like watching cute animal gifs? You can find a subreddit for just about anything you're into. 
5197,isfj,"I like reddit for the communities, big and small. As for finding what you like from the website, just search for subreddits for things you like/are interested in -- for example, my most visited subs are r/AskReddit, r/television, r/femalefashionadvice, r/TalesFromYourServer (since I used to work in the service industry) and my hometown and college subs. If you find something you like, look on the sidebar, they probably have links to similar content.
Give yourself some time to get used to the website and don't be afraid to unsubscribe to any default subs (I actually recommend this for some of the bigger ones cough r/funny cough). Eventually you'll get it tailored to your liking :)"
5198,isfj,"Don't worry about doing it ""correctly"". Just take a look around, hang out on the subs you like and that's it. Reddit has its etiquette like all social media, but it's pretty easy to work out if you read the sidebars and lurk for a little while.
I like Reddit because you can learn so many random facts and because of the filthy humour. I'm a big fan of /r/explainlikeimfive, /r/nostupidquestions, /r/showerthoughts and /r/lifeprotips."
5199,isfj,"ENxP here.
I like reddit because there is so much information. I spend most of my time just reading the titles and wondering if the content is worthy of my time or not.
I ironically usually taking more time wondering that reading the whole thing.
I also often end up with my /new/ feed emptied by my frenetic inquisitive curiosity. 
TL;DR : Don't be like me. You've probably far better things to do IRL."
5200,isfj,"I unsubscribe from most of the default reddits and look up various ones for entertainment, interests (like Asian Beauty and photography), and go from there. I lurk a lot, upvote a lot, and comment some. I would like to be more active though because it seems like a good way to maybe meet some people."
5201,isfj,"Trial and error, really. I've spent a load of time on certain subs and then completely stopped going to them at all. I've subscribed to a bunch of subs (and I definitely second the recommendation to unsubscribe from any of the default ones that don't interest you) but often end up just visiting a couple of my favourites. The sense of overload will fade soon enough and you'll get a sense of which stuff you want to give your attention to and which stuff you don't."
5202,isfj,"Well I don't really spend too much time on Reddit. But I glance at it in the morning
 and look at the front page. Then I'll check the subreddits I care about to see if there's anything interesting. It's really up to you lol"
5203,isfj,"I used it and did have a few relationships from there. In my region, a lot of the matches were looking for something more casual. They were respectful when I mentioned I was hoping for something more serious though. I'm still friends with 1 I matched with from years before.
The only one that I had a negative experience was an INTP I matched with- I introduced him to MBTI casually and he used it to magnify our differences. But I think it's just due to his immaturity rather than his type haha."
5204,isfj,"I met my boyfriend of a little over 2 years on Tinder.
He's an ESFJ, and by far one of the best things that's ever happened to me.
I really just downloaded the app for fun, I had no intentions of actually meeting up with anybody on there.
He was the first guy I matched with, and the only one I talked to for more than like, an hour.
After 3 days of talking, we met in person and things have been going great ever since. :)
I deleted the app after our first date, so I guess my success rate is 100%.
Our bios/profiles were equally stupid, mine just said ""If you put jam on your grilled cheese, I don't think we're compatible."" His had two lines, ""Can I walk your dog?"" and ""My mom thinks I'm handsome.""
He was looking for a serious relationship on there, and while I wasn't expecting to find one on Tinder, I was open to a relationship at that point in my life.
I've known tons of people who've had to weed through tons of gross people on Tinder before having any luck, if at all. Lots of people I know have found a long-term partner on there. I think it all just depends on how you use it, and what you're looking for. It's definitely worth a shot, IMO."
5205,isfj,"My two friends and I used it. Succuss rate is 2/3 :)
I did't even know what am I doing it for, but in a week there I found just the guy I needed. People are quite sceptical of Tinder in my country and not many users search for anything serious there. I guess I am very lucky :)
Same thing happened to my friend, although she lives in another country and, I think, her boyfriend was the first guy she met on Tinder. We both are certain we found perfect men :)"
5206,isfj,"I know it has worked for a lot of people, but it didn't work for me. I got way more success from OKCupid, where I met my girlfriend (infp) that I've been with for nearly two years. It just gives you a lot more to work with, like lots of personality questions to answer so you can find a great match. "
5207,isfj,"Somehow I have met all my boyfriends off tinder. I’m so shy and humble in real life that I end up being in the background and not wanting to draw attention to myself and have people pay attention to me and thus get overshadowed by all the ESxx types. I just can’t for the life of myself flirt out in the world. Like maybe if I’m out at a bar or party or something that is specifically relaxing time. But if I’m out and about, at work or doing my responsibilities....I am not seeking attention and just come across quite reserved and uninterested. This is not intentional, just is 🤷🏼‍♀️
I didn’t date until I was 21 and started online dating for the reasons listed above. If I am able to attract someone’s attention online first, I feel much more comfortable flirting with them in person. I end up feeling like they already see part of the special side of me that isn’t obviously evident when someone meets me for the first time in person—particularly in a stressful social situation (which lets be honest is every situation that isn’t with my best friends or family). I feel like they had a chance to get to like me a bit and then I can be charming in person. 
So I’m really drawn to tinder, ok Cupid, etc. HOWEVER the shitty part of this is that a lot of people on dating apps, tinder specifically, are just looking to fuck around, not seeking commitment, just flirting for the shit of it. So I’ve been blown off many times, which is super frustrating for a reliable and honest ISFJ. But then again it has taught me to be more cautious with my feelings and to not get my hopes up too early. So all in all I think it’s been a great lesson for me to put myself out there and learn how to navigate the dating scene and grow as a person. "
5208,isfj,"I’m often drawn most to extroverts. However I find myself in more deeply satisfying relationships with introverts. It’s such a paradox bc I like having someone do all the talking, so I can listen and chime in as I see fit. However I also really am drawn to mystery and introverts are super mysterious. I love trying to figure out what’s going on in their brains. Yet here are many moments of silence with these partners that I wish were filled with someone. So it’s a matter of learning to be comfortable in silence with an introverted parter, which is totally attainable :)
My first bf was an ISTJ. Second ISTP (strongest love of my life thus far). Third ENTP (very interesting relationship, but ultimately unfulfilling). Currently dating an ISFP who is flipping adorable—I really like him. 
So ultimately I’ve been with more introverts than extroverts. But I think it’s really a personal preference there."
5209,isfj,I’m a Project Manager/Executive Assistant/PR Manager at a company that builds and operates restaurants and bars. Our leadership team is only eleven people for 26 businesses so needless to say we all have three job titles 
5210,isfj,"Worked as a legal secretary for a few years, somehow made it to a state job where I review consultant contracts and sort of liaise between the consultants and the agency.  
I was an English major. It’s a surprisingly good fit for me, what with editing the contracts and learning the lingo and all the details of the process. "
5211,isfj,"I planned on teaching secondary social studies but the school I was looking into doesn't offer that program anymore but does offer ma in elementary ed. Plus, there is a shortage in my area of k-5 teachers.  I would be happy to get any teaching job, though."
5212,isfj,"More into software. Reason for that is cause I have all the tools to to see how it works in real time and practice with it. Hardware would require more abstract work and I won't be able to see how it works in real time straight away at my disposal
I'm working mostly with C# and Unity cause I can see straight away how the code impacts, I think that's key for sensors to learn"
5213,isfj,"That's surprising to me that a school would offer an MA in Elementary Ed. Is this a common occurrence in your state/province? There seems to always be a shortage of K-5 teachers. Never a shortage of Secondary though. Damn coaches! Haha! 
I take it by the name your a big history nerd? Any particular time period you like?"
5214,isfj,"Its through WGU. I live in a really small town and a lot of teachers here have gone through WGU since the closest uni is 3 hours away. I have also seen a few other schools that have masters programs in elementary, secondary and special ed. I guess a lot of schools now expect teachers to have a masters degree. And yes history is fascinating to me! I am currently taking a class on the history of China and Japan which is exciting but I like to read US History as well."
5215,isfj,What's WGU? I suppose the masters degree requirement must be something common in your state. That would annoy me to death. Although in TX it would be redundant since we offer a Bachelor's degree in Education. I'm totally on board with US History. The other two are really not my cup of tea. 
5216,isfj,"I just noticed something and was wondering if any other ISFJ experience the same. 
While at work listening to someone telling a story, I found myself being the only one that laughed mid way because I could tell where the story was going and why it was funny. While everyone else waited for the story to finish or the punchline of sorts. 
Do other people not laugh mid way because its seen as rude and interrupting? or do they not see why its funny until its explained? "
5217,isfj,I laugh at a lot of things no one else does. Someone will say something or do something that isn't intentionally funny but for some reason I think it's funny. And I'll laugh. And no one else will. Then I have to explain myself
5218,isfj,"This happens to me, too!
I haven't actually thought about the reasons behind it. 
I always just assumed I had a slightly different sense of humor from other people, and I generally find the entire story to be funny, not just the punchline."
5219,isfj,"ENxP thing.
I even sometimes rush the end of regular stories just to reach the morale quicker. It's about not wasting time in pointless salamalecs.
More than really laughing, I display more a goofy smile and let them handle how to finish the joke with best effects before laughing.
I'm personally really genuine in my expressions, so it means straight face for jokes I find unfunny, and deadpan delivery of puns and wordplays.
It has it's charm as it can be seen as hopelessly rude. It has the good advantage to allow me to know who can appreciate me, and who to avoid, to not bother them of my presence.
Again, it sounds like a huge saving of my admittedly precious time, to me."
5220,isfj,"I have a group of ""friends"" but i feel like they just see me as acquiantances which is somewhat true although they may never say it in my face or whats wrong. 
Ive always been the ""listener"" in the group and most of them would dominate the conversation whereas me and 2 introvert pals would just listen. Mostly they would talk about their fave kpop idol, kpop shows and pop culture whereas i dont care about those.
Im glad they were accomodating towards me but i just wonder if they just tolerate me because they find it hard to confront me in a kind manner but i understand anyways.
I know i may sound demanding when it comes to friendships but i want a quality relationship.My mom even accused me of being selective when it comes to friends"
5221,isfj,"Yo I worry about that all the time! Sometimes it's because I'm not really compatible with the friends; sometimes it's because I'm just like, socially inept and think they're just keeping me around out of obligation but not because they like me...
Idk. I have pretty high standards of people though, so it's hard for me to make friends. But once I do I usually keep them."
5222,isfj,"I don't think my close friends necessarily see me as acquaintances, but I do often worry that they don't value me as much as they value each other.  It's not that I want to be everyone's best friend, but if I care about you, I want to know that I have some place in your life.
And yeah, I struggle to relate to some of the things my friends talk about.  They talk a lot about things that I don't find interesting, or that I've never seen (for example, Youtube videos or memes I've never seen/heard of, are things they make references to.)  I feel like when I try to talk about something, it's shut down."
5223,isfj,"Kpop♡♡♡
How old are you?
If you're young, you will find deeper relationships in the future.
We ISFJ's are selective when it comes to friends. I would rather not have friends than being very involved with people I don't feel comfortable with. Luckily I have gotten a little friend group. Remember, there are some people you click with, and others who you don't.  "
5224,isfj,"*predominantly, whoops
I thought it was pretty fascinating that a majority of sites mention that ISFJs are about 15-20% in females but 6-8% in males. Even if you guys are feeling extroverted, it's still the same big gap of female to male ratio. 
Do you see yourself having feminine qualities? Are you comfortable more around guys or girls? How do you differ socially around a group of men? "
5225,isfj,"This is an interesting question to try to answer for me. On one hand I do feel like I express some more feminine qualities in my personality than most of my male peers, however; I wonder how much of that is due to societal pressures on both genders to fit into certain roles. I don't see myself as particularly feminine but when compared with others it could certainly come across that way.
Eh doesn't really make a difference to me much when it comes to being around people. When it comes to more private or sensitive conversations though, I definitely trust and rely on my female friends much more heavily than I do my male friends for my own personal issues. If my male friends start those deep kind of conversations though I have no issues engaging with them but they usually have to be the ones to initiate such a conversation.
I don't think I act much differently than most guys. There's a lot of unspoken rules within male culture and groups on how to interact. These rules can be rather frustrating at times as most of them are along the lines of don't show emotion, be a manly man etc which is not at all in line with my personality for the most part. The closer I get to my friends the less I play the game so to speak. Around acquaintances and new people though it's not terribly difficult at all to fit into the general male way of interacting for me. "
5226,isfj,"I do. I feel I have a balance or fluidity to my gender and gender expression as a man.
Gender doesn't matter much to me, actually. I'm comfortable more around people with whom I share a lot in common.
Sometimes I feel like an alien around groups of men unless they're gay men."
5227,isfj,"Do you see yourself having feminine qualities? 
yes, i guess. but i've always grew up thinking gender roles were stupid. my sister has some stereotypical masculine qualities and i have some stereotypical feminine qualities. it's almost as if gender traits are socially conceived.
Are you comfortable more around guys or girls? 
Usually i'm more comfortable around girls. They're more in touch with emotions than guys typically. Though as I interact with older males, they tend to also be more in touch with their emotions. Though it is less common to find guys who are open about emotions.
How do you differ socially around a group of men?
I don't want to get a bunch of guys uncomfortable by talking about emotional stuff. but this is in groups, when it is one on one i don't differ much."
5228,isfj,"Well, I'm a girl, but I used to think I was a guy...
Oddly enough, I didn't take an MBTI test until after I figured out I was trans (MtF here).
That it's a predominantly female type makes a lot of sense in hindsight."
5229,isfj,"Sorry for the late comment, I just discovered this sub.
I do, recently a new friend asked me if I was gay because I have some feminine qualities. I don't think it's a lot of feminine qualities, but definitely more than the average guy.
When I first meet a group of people, I'll tend to interact more with the girls. For a while I just assumed it was because I was single, but really I am more comfortable around girls. But if I'm close enough with them, I will actually be more comfortable around guys.
I think I follow the general rule of including more cussing and talking more blunt and crass when in a group of guys. My more feminine qualities will definitely come out more when I'm talking with just girls. "
5230,isfj,"I'm pretty much the same as this guy. I tend to gravitate toward female friends than male friends. I grew up with just my mom and grandma though, I am pretty comfortable/good at being around women, whatever that means."
5231,isfj,"Alone. Unloved. Miserable.
​
After I lost my (ISFJ) mother and the one other (ISFJ female) person that would listen to my analytical ramblings of passion, life was hell.
​
My father shamed me and told me that I was autistic. My sister that I loved most, found me annoying, lame, and repulsive.
​
I gave up my one activity that joined by problem-solving nature with an expression of emotion: Music. ... My emotions were no longer ex-pressed, so they began to be re-pressed. My health took a noise-dive.
​
When I stumbled upon Quiet, by Susan Cain, I felt so loved and understood that I wanted to jump for joy - which was unusual for my thoughtful and internalized personality.
​
Years later, when I discovered MBTI, I found that I was an INTx and I just kept shouting ""Yes! Yes!"" as I read about others with my same difficulties, loves, weaknesses, and strengths.
​
Finally, I realized that I am not an INTJ:

decisive
dresses formally
tends to dislike physical touch
does not require emotional or social validation from others.

​
Instead, I test clearly as an INTP:

indecisive
dresses casually and creatively
tends to crave physical touch, caressing, and hugging
desperately seeks emotional or social validation, which is inconvenient because INTPs crave mainly non-social environments.

​
Also, INTPs and find it extremely draining to maintain most social relationships. Showing up in a way that is agreeable to others, especially extroverts, is like balancing a stack of books on my head: it is an enjoyable challenge for about 30 seconds, and then from that point on, it is painfully inconvenient.
​
Ever since my family saw the Matrix (1999), I felt a special connection with Neo. I idealized Neo. I pretended I was Neo. I put Neo in my artwork. I only stopped referencing Neo once I reached the age when I felt to intimidated to be freely creative in my own geeky way. ... It was just this week that I realized that Neo was symbolic of an INTP living his/her full destiny and ""learning to fly"".
​
Now. A recognition of my ""better half"": the ISFJ or Defender personality. ... I can already tell a difference in my ability to love and accept myself, even before I have found an actual friend or lover who is an ISFJ (female).
​
So even the idea of there being a group of people out there who would be happy to know me. And who I could make happy without me wearing a social mask, without me pretending to be someone that I'm not: is incredibly refreshing.
​
I read a post from an ISFJ female who mentioned that she thought that we INTPs aren't attracted to ISFJs. And I just want to clear the record to say that just that thought of you ISFJs, let alone your actual presence, is to us INTPs completely:

endearing
inspiring
adorable
attractive
life-saving.

​
I believe that the ISFJ female I'm mentioning had just gone through a painful breakup with an INTP. ... And for what it is worth, just like I gave up my love of music for years because I thought that it ""wasn't practical and wasn't actually helping anyone in need"", we INTPs sometimes can forget how much our love for art and love for each other is ever so practical for health, happiness, and is so worth upholding.
​
Some people refer to ISFJs as fake. And to INTPs like me, ISFJs help us remember that love is real, and life is really worth living.
​
God/Universe bless all of you ISFJs wherever you are. I love you forever. -INTP"
5232,isfj,"Among other things, my enduring love of ISFJs makes me question my own type. Although I typically feel more introverted, being around an ISFJ makes me feel like a genuinely social creature. It doesn't hurt that ISFJs have told me that they could listen to me talk through philosophical tangents indefinitely. Si and Fe are definitely the ""energies"" that I consciously value and crave from the world; I'm just shaky on the ordering. "
5233,isfj,"As my first post ever on Reddit and as an INTP who makes silly errors, I made an honest mistake and accidentally had got mixed up on the acronym. Did I not successfully delete that entire article before re-writing it with the proper acronym of ISFJ and posting it in the proper thread?"
5234,isfj,"Your profile is called INFP_Lover_of_Music while you refer to yourself as INTP, I did check if you deleted that or not, clearly you did which is good for you. But honestly this is way to complicated for me to care."
5235,isfj,"oww man :( 
So sorry to hear.. yes, please focus on your health and well-being.. It can be reversed, praying that your health issues go away and that you find positivity in life.. you are trying to move forward, that is in itself a step towards the better.. don't stop okay :) "
5236,isfj,"My perspective changes from day to day. Haha. :) I used to believe that I was an INTP, but I was typed by some MBTI YouTubers as an ENTP.   
This morning, my take is that there is an impossible-to-eliminate tension between a technical understanding of ""introversion/extraversion"" and the understandings of the layperson. In pop culture, it's fairly easy to pinpoint someone as extraverted. They're bubbly and ""out there,"" engaged in the world. The thing is, Ne is a perception function, and you can definitely sit stoically at the sidelines while mapping out the endless and ever-branching intuitive patterns of the world. I'm pretty persuaded at this point that I use Ne more than I use Ti, even if I appear to be fairly reserved.  
So there's a pragmatic problem that I'm not sure how to solve. Technically, I'm leaning towards ENTP, but if the layENTperson came to my channel find a kindred spirit, they would not find someone who aligns with the stereotypes. I appear more like an INTP.  "
5237,isfj,"It is something that's held me back from making friends and getting a girlfriend. I can easily hold a conversation if someone else is coming up with the topics to talk about, but once we're done talking about whatever we were talking about, then I can never think of something else to say. You can easily see why I don't want to go out on a date with someone like this, I don't want it to end up being awkward.
All my close friends are good at small talk and I just easily talk with them. I don't think I really hate small talk, I enjoy hearing people's jokes and other banter, but making small talk is not something I'm good at. I think some of the times I'm just daydreaming, other times I really just don't have anything to say, I stay listening to whatever the person will say next. I'm not afraid to say what's on my mind, but it is just that I don't have anything to say.
This is something I've been struggling with my whole life. There are good people I would like to be friends with and a few friends I used to be close with that I just lost contact with because I don't want to ask them to hang out and then I seem disinterested because I have nothing to say. If we are doing something, like at an event, I can easily make comments, but I'm talking more about just sitting around and chilling. All the conversation stuff I've read has to deal with meeting people, but what about friends you've known for awhile or even family? I feel like I don't have much to talk about to my parents because all they do nowadays is support me, they just work and that's it. Any help is appreciated."
5238,isfj,"I am the same way. I feel like I never have anything to say! But I did read in another subreddit (I think it was /r/socialskills) that people love to talk about themselves. So any small details you can pick up about a person, ask them about it. For example, if someone just started a new job you can ask them how that is going for them, what does their job entail, etc. I have yet to try it out, though. I would check out that subreddit, it's pretty insightful. :) Good luck!"
5239,isfj,"I struggle with small talk as well. My brother and father are both great at it, but unfortunately I take after my mother and just don't do well with it. Honestly, when out on a date or in any social situation where I'm kind of forced into it, I just make it a point to talk about the other person. Ask what they do, how do they like they're job, what are their hobbies. Talk about sports, talk about traveling. Talk about the latest movies, tv shows, etc.. Read Yahoo news and talk about an interesting article. Talk about things you want to do (doesn't necessarily have to be things you've done). It all sounds very inane and stupid, but it gets me through.
I actually have a bad habit of trying to think 2 steps ahead of the conversation to think about what to say next. Sometimes this leads me to not paying close attention to what the other person is saying, but that's just a matter of re-focusing. 
You have more to say than you think, just step outside your own head for a little bit. I think small talk takes practice, but just keep trying. "
5240,isfj,"I used to have this problem, and I still do to a certain degree. Then I had to do a series of interviews for a high-school psychology paper, and it occured to me that as long as you don't perceive the silence as being awkward, it generally won't be. Now, whenever an ""awkward"" pause occurs while I'm talking to a person, I just lock eyes with them and smile. More often than not, they will re-initiate. If they don't, I ask them to. It was REALLY ball-busting and terrifying the first times I did it, but now it's basically part of who I am."
5241,isfj,"same
try to have a few topics in mind (something that you are passionate about? something that your friend/parent is interested in that you want to get to know more about?)
i think that you have to make an effort to ask them to hang out and this means putting yourself in a potentially uncomfortable situation, in order to show that you are trying. the key is perhaps finding activities that involve some action or something to talk about (a comedy show? visiting a new food cart in town? going to have coffee at chapters and wandering around in there?). i find that i dont really do one on one things with friends because of this anxiety of ""having things to talk about""/holding a proper conversation and i end up seeing individual friends only once in a while or in small 2-3 people coffee dates so it's not AS difficult/potentially awkward! I will HAVE to have something to say because over a few months i'd have had to have done something in my life and with smaller groups you can branch off with what other people say but it's still quite intimate/relationship enhancing. not really sure what you can do about the girlfriend thing though except to be yourself and not verbal diarrhea garbage words out!"
5242,isfj,"My ISFJ girlfriend has similar fears I think, though she doesn't voice them. Read up on two aspects of cognitive psychology which are actually logical errors in the brain to help you deal with any anxiety you may face in social situations, the spotlight effect, and the illusion of transparency. 
Once you start to understand some of the errors in your and everyone's thought laid out in bits of cognitive psychology like this you'll begin to see socializing as a less daunting and important task :).
-INTJ"
5243,isfj,So yeah I would like to ask you dear ISFJs if you feel exhausted after you´ve lead people. Because of my job i sometimes have to lead other coworkers and I like it and and enjoy it but most of the time I feel very exhausted after that. Also if any of you have a tip against this problem or how to get better at leading people as ISFJ I would be very thankful.
5244,isfj,"Absolutely! Though I haven't been a leading people in a job, I've certainly been a leader in academic situations. However, I don't think this is a leading people problem--I think it's just an introvert problem. There's nothing wrong with feeling exhausted after putting your energy into leading people in your environment. Introverts just need alone time to recharge and even though helping and leading others is an ISFJ's core trait, it is simultaneously rewarding and tiring. My advice to you is that, if possible, you spend time by yourself in a healthy way before these instances where you're going to lead people. Read a book, watch a movie, listen to music, etc. Even if it's just for 30 mins, quiet alone time is a must for introverts. I understand that you can't exactly get ""alone time"" at a job, but even maybe setting up a schedule every night before bed would help. I'm not sure what your life is like, but if you're not having alone time, schedule it in :)
Also, if you feel overwhelmed/tired WHILE leading people, and perhaps someone is asking questions that require lengthy discussion, ask them politely if you could get back to them about it. Sometimes I put questions and messages on hold when someone needs my attention because I just don't have the energy to deal with it right away."
5245,isfj,"I used to run a clan in an online game and although I was a kind and fair leader, I hated the exhausting feeling that came with it. People would rely on me at different times and we'd run events that I would have to be online for, lots of social interaction. 
At work I'm not in a leadership role but give helpful tips and basic orders to new staff, which can make me feel tense at times."
5246,isfj,"I work as a receptionist and I thoroughly love helping my coworkers and customers over the phone, but yeah as an isfj I'm drained every night when I go home. I recoup by listening to meditative tracks on the drive home and sitting down for about an hour to do a little bit of creative writing.   I also have good days and bad days. On bad days I'm not necessarily mean but I don't go out of my way to be extra helpful. I also tend to drink a lot more green tea :)"
5247,isfj,"Not really sure where this post is going, but I'm sick of joining mbti discord servers advertised in here and finding theyre all full of INTPs... No offence but they're usually a bit weird imo. And I mean, my boyfriend is intp and hes weird but in a lovable way. But it's just not what i was hoping for.
Sometimes i try and trawl /r/makenewfriendshere or /r/needafriend. I want to help people out but usually i get frustrated because i feel like i can't (usually because they need professional help). But i just feel a bit lonely and want to talk to more people sometimes :(
if anyone has any suggestions, let me know please :) <3"
5248,isfj,"I always found the best way to make friends is to join a group with similar interests. If one likes singing, join a choir. Like photography, join a photography club. Like reading, join a book club. Like nature, join a walking / hiking group. Like gardening, join a ""grow your own food""- club.. "
5249,isfj,"This is not really a suggestion as I have not tried it myself..but I have seen the school of life has made an app to help people make friends and it seemed to be aimed at us, introverts. Give it a try if you want :) 
Also, I understand the frustration of wanting to help people and not being able to. As I found that it is hard to get people to say whats wrong when you can feel they are in distress. "
5250,isfj,"I agree with this person 100%! ^
It’s silly, but I recently realized maybe I’m the reason why I’m not making friends... 
I’m quiet & I usually separate myself from my peers because of my anxiety. 
I guess one day I decided that I didn’t want my anxiety to get the best of me anymore because I want to meet people & have friends. I decided to join two clubs - one for my major & the other is practicing Mindfulness. Granted I haven’t made any new friends (yet), but I’ve met some really kind people doing so :)
I still have a great deal of anxiety tho, it’s a work in progress."
5251,isfj,"So, in a couple of months I will be changing jobs and I'm really struggling with the fact that I will have to say goodbye to my work colleagues/friends. I have always been bad with goodbyes, it makes me extremely sad when certain stages of my life are over and I have to change environments and people. I never know what to say and if I say something I end up choking up/crying. I would like to know if anyone else here is like this and how do you deal with it, thanks!"
5252,isfj,"Goodbyes are hard and emotional for people I like. It's like ripping the bandaid off, I just get it over with.
Slightly tangential, I hate goodbyes at parties. Not because I get emotional but because I don't know what to say. I'm getting better because I know it's rude, but in college I would almost always Irish-goodbye because I couldn't stand it."
5253,isfj,"I switched from second shift to first shift at work, and it was very tough at first!! I had great relationships with a lot of colleagues that I didn't want to lose. I found the goodbyes quite difficult honestly. But over time, I made new relationships."
5254,isfj,"I kind of avoid goodbyes. It’s easier for me to just be gone and that’s it. I recently had to say goodbye to my mother, as she moved halfway across the country, and it broke my heart. Definitely cried."
5255,isfj,"Because I do. I hate my personality type, and I hate who I am as a person. I hate that I can't ""live in the moment"". I'm always thinking about the future. I feel as though I have no connection to my body. It's just kind of there. I'm not good at anything I try. I'm thinking of just giving up on any educational pursuits and marrying an abusive man because I deserve to get physically abused after grief I've given to other people. I'm stupid. I hate myself. "
5256,isfj,"Coming from an ISFJ who's struggled with anxiety and depression, I get the thoughts you're having. You are not alone. I have a few thoughts that have comforted me that I hope will comfort you:

You are so unique. There is no one on this planet exactly like you. You have the ability to impact people around you like no one else - literally no one else in the world - can. You matter. You are precious. You are who you are for a reason. Don't hate yourself for being who you are.
The world needs people who can plan and think about the future. Sure, there's a balance between the extremes of recklessness and extreme constant planning that everyone can reach - but it's okay to be more on the planning end of the spectrum. As long as it's not obsessive or anxiety-driven, it's good to think ahead! It's good to be realistic and think about consequences of your actions and to be careful about your future. That's a good thing.
I used to feel very out of touch with my body, too, until I started listening to it. Pay attention to the little things it does when you try a new food or go for a jog. You'll be amazed what you can pick up when you really look for what your body is telling you.
You do NOT deserve abuse. Ever. Period. You are a unique human being with a valuable life and you matter. You. Matter. No amount of perceived grief you've given others or past mistakes or ANYTHING make you deserving of being abused. You don't deserve an abusive relationship. You are far, far too valuable for that.
For me, it's easy to overthink about how other people perceive me and how much of a burden I am to them. I can tend to microanalyze every encounter and conversation and text message and build up how I perceive someone thinks about me - and that's not healthy. And 99% of the time I'm wrong. You are probably MUCH less of a burden than you think. And your value doesn't depend on what other people think of you anyway.

I hope this helps. I really do. I hope you find peace in who you are and how your brain works. Please feel free to PM me anytime. I mean that. I'll talk to you about anything. Know that I'm praying for you."
5257,isfj,"Meditation can help you live in the moment. It will be a few weeks practice till you understand what I actually mean about this.
It'll make you also hyper aware of your thoughts. Sometimes I realise my brain is stupid while I meditate like why is my brain thinking of this bs that is so pointless etc. give it a go I suggest"
5258,isfj,"You don't have to fix who you are, you just need to figure out who you are and use that to your advantage. Find a way to give back to other people. Find your passion. What can you do for hours and not get tired of? Find something bigger than you to believe in. (This is so important but I don't think this is the best place to talk about it, so feel free to PM me.) Also, here's a hint - everyone else is trying to figure out their lives, too. If someone seems like they have it all perfectly together, they're just good at faking it. We're all figuring it out one day at a time and that's okay."
5259,isfj,alright so this might be hard for you or maybe not you guys are rather foreign to me and i dont know if this is hard for you guys anyway i would like you to name every single thing you hate or dislike or just dont find very neat about a INTP. why? curiosity. and dont worry about hurting my feelings or anything i can take anything you could say. EDIT-just realized i said about you and i should have said for you but i cant edit it so just pretend it says for you if you would. should also mention unless you ask a question or say something along the lines of respond to this im not going to respond since this is not defending intps this is just gathering some info
5260,isfj,"My husband is INTP
The utilitarian drive to leave things out because it’s handy and then being oblivious to the mess. I don’t suffer from anxiety, but clutter really puts me on edge. 
Also, if we’re both upset, trying to debate out the problem right away. I need time to calm down and think about why I’m upset or think of how to best vocalize it. He will press and press until I say anything and then he’ll try and argue a solution when I’ve only worked out a fifth of my feelings. It makes me feel like my feelings or the problem is being trivialized. 
I know he does this with the best intention of making things right between us ASAP, but it comes off as aggressive when I’m feeling tender. He’s learned to just leave me alone for an hour and then try again with a more conversational approach. "
5261,isfj,"One of my best friends is an INTP. She's absolutely fascinating and I adore the way her mind works. If I were to name any flaws ... I guess she's kinda stubborn. Other than that, I guess she could pay a little bit more attention to me. I love being there for others but sometimes I also need someone to be there for me."

It's not on purpose. I see things in steps and can often combine two or three together. I have many times called my process 'controlled chaos'. It looks like clutter from the outside but I know the exact order everything (should) be in.
The way I see it is: If our natural state is calm and happy and we're upset then it needs to be 'fixed'. Like the steps I mentioned above, even when we're arguing/debating/talking about one thing, I'm also thinking about the problem and how we got into the situation. Was it my fault? Maybe it was a circumstance of the situation? Bad day? I need to know. Information is power and the only way I'm going to move forward is by talking it out...
Feelings are hard! I can barely figure out what I'm feelings in a given moment. So I rely on my logic and thinking. Unfortunately that often does more harm than good.
It took me a longer than I'd like to admit to learning to this aspect of my wife. It's helped wonders. "
5263,isfj,"I've always kinda chose to never seek out and have a 'romantic' relationship with anyone. There is another thread going on about deep connections with others that hit close to home that made me start thinking if others feel the same way. I don't think there is anyone that I can say I have a 'deep connection' with... I thought I did recently, but it isn't working out. Am I lonely? Sometimes, but not very often... It's usually when I see my friends 'happy' in their relationships. It always fades after I go home, back into my comfort zone. I honestly adore being alone on those days that I don't have 'anything' to do; and I kinda don't want to change it... I don't think I want a family, or kids... Long story short, I'm very happy with my lifestyle right now, however, often times I wonder what it would be like to have someone else around; since I hate doing 'things' without a 'friend' around to do it with... 
With that out of the way, I've come to the conclusion that after observing and watching others around me always seemingly to fail in their own relationships for various reasons, (the one that always sticks out to me is my observation of how much damn work it takes to maintain a relationship) You know how we are; ISFJs, we are always 'there' to help others with their problems and give them advice on how to fix it. My logic I placed onto myself for a long time now to avoid the issue; I've chosen to never seek one out. A friend says I'm afraid of commitment. That's not the case since I'm great with my obligations; Work, paying bills, rent, dieting (I lost 75 lbs!), keeping my space clean, taking care of pets, car maintenance, etc... I just don't want anything to do with all the crap you have to deal with in a relationship. Do any other ISFJs feel the same way by chance?"
5264,isfj,"i am almost 29, i've met 2.5 people i've felt like i could be fully open and free around.
everyone else, even when i feel really close to them and care about them deeply, i talk to them in a very controlled way. i consider how they feel and think very carefully when i spend time with them. it is straining but makes the communication smooth.
i've also tried dating someone that i didn't feel like i could be open and free around, thinking that maybe i'm just too picky and over time things will become easier and i can express myself more freely. but that didn't work.
but i do think about how amazing it'll be to have that someone in my life one day. someone that spending time with doesn't drain me, someone i can split chores with, someone to share incomes with, someone who can help me get lower taxes in the eyes of the law via marriage with. it'd be great to have someone in my life who also wants to reach similar life goals and wants to partner up so we can help each other do em."
5265,isfj,"I can relate. Although I haven't had too many romantic relationship issues, I have an extremely difficult time getting and maintaining deep friendships for similar reasons. I find it hard to put so much effort into something that I feel like I don't always get as much back in return. Friendships are a difficult balance, and while I have many casual friends, I never really have a lot of ""dependable"" friends in the way I am dependable towards others, if that makes sense. Its too much effort to open up to people who I don't know if they will be there."
5266,isfj,"In my case, it's weird, because on the one hand I want to meet women and improve my dating life, but on the other hand when someone who I feel attracted to shows interest on me, even if it happens that I also like them, I end up avoiding contact. It makes no sense. 
I relate to this post, too."
5267,isfj,"I've felt some of the same things. For similar reasons I avoided relationships for the longest time. I usually feel a bit lonely or some longing for that when I'd always see my friends appearing happy in their relationships, but I also enjoy being alone and like you said, it always seemed like maintaining relationships takes so much work. I graduated university and still had never dated anyone, and I was fine with that. 
On the other hand, I've also always appreciated being able to connect with people at a deeper level. In the other thread, there was some talk about not being able to do that unless in a romantic relationship. I would disagree and instead say it's harder, even more so for those of your romantic gender interest. I had and have several friends I consider very close that I would tell pretty much anything to, but they're not romantic in the slightest. That being said, there is something about being in a relationship with someone that opens doors for these connections to form, and often opening up to one another and helping one another are shared goals in a relationship. That intentionality really helps connect with someone. 
In terms of your question on avoiding relationships long term, I think it depends on the person and who you meet. Several of my elder family members have felt similarly and have never gotten married. I had no intention of dating after I moved, even after I met my current SO, but after getting to know them over a year or so, I gradually felt more comfortable with the idea. We both have our problems, but after spending time with them over a year, I found that most of their struggles could be helped but wouldn't bog me down or make me feel like a big burden on my time (particularly with how much I enjoy helping people). We both enjoy alone time, and we both are learning to better respect boundaries and time. It's a big learning process for me and I don't know how long this will last, but after a year now I'm so glad to have been in a relationship with them. I'm pretty sure most people I could be in a reasonable relationship with I would not enjoy, for reasons you've stated here, but I met a person I ended up growing to feel otherwise about and that changed (for now). I get where you're coming from, so you're not alone. :)  "
5268,isfj,"I'm an ENFP [41]. My ISFJ fiancé [45] may be in denial of sharing a similar conviction. It's to the point that I think I may have pressured him into engagement. We've been engaged for a year and this guy has developed so many excuses for not being able to marry or converge homes it's comical. 
We have been living in separate homes we own and maintained separate bills for 3.5 years. Its getting so old. Things were going great and we had worked through lots of personality differences but recently found out he had established some whimsical state (""Get right"") we had to get to that only he could define in order to plan our future. 
if I argue about it, it resets the clock. ""We argue too much. Have to get right before we make any plans""
but... um... what's this ring mean? halp!
So if you got pressured into engagement could you imagine yourself doing the same thing? Could you see yourself agreeing with words but digging your heels in action? It sounds like keeping the ""taking care of my own shit"" status quo you described. 
I really hope I didn't pressure him but it's getting difficult to think he just can't fully be in a relationship. Got any ISFJ insight?
Edit: some words and clarification 
Edit 2: fixed fecently my most hilarious typo ever"
5269,isfj,"You took this right out of my mouth ! I'm in the same boat as you , I enjoy being by myself and everyone always telling me I need to try to get into a relationship , with commitment I have no issues as well I too lost a whole bunch if weight 95 pounds . I just don't want a relationship and don't want to go through all the issues it brings , I like being by myself and when I feel lonely I have good friends to spend my time with or I just read and game doesn't bother me one bit . Thanks for sharing this I'm glad I'm not alone . "
5270,isfj,"ISFJ's might not be good at expressing emotions, but they cans still be seen, and fir me that's enough. A person doesn't have to express an emotion to me for me to know how they feel, and that is enough for me. Even though i am INFP and we seem to be known for being very emotional, i would almost rather see the underlying love from someone than to have it always said to me. It seems more genuine somehow. "
5271,isfj,"I'm sorry you're having such a frustrating time getting on the same page and up to speed in the relationship... I can see myself doing something similar. The only way I ever get motivated to do something 'new', even if it's something I want to do, is to be pressured and helped along to do it by someone I trust. It's part of the whole 'hates change' thing. Thats all good if it's something I want to do without any doubt, however if it's something I really don't want to do, or his case wasn't ""ready"" for yet, I know I tend to try to avoid it if I committed to do it for whatever reason; be it that it's important to someone or it really needs to be done. In that case, I tend to drag my feet and put it off for as long as possible before I start to feel guilty. Often times, I see myself making up some excuse to not do it, by that I mean 'making up' a more legit reason as to why not do something to not hurt feelings as opposed to saying outright the silly way we seem to thing about this stuff.  A real reason in my case would be something along the lines of not ""I just don't want to do it, it's too much work"", or depending on the situation I see myself saying ""Yeah, but I'll do it later"" if the answer is no, and then if they follow up I will say that I ""forgot to do it"". Marriage is a huge commitment and a massive lifestyle change. I know for a fact that I would be in a similar frame of mind, wanting to put off a decision like that... I have a very hard time explaining my real reasoning as to why I refuse to do something sometimes, I can understand why someone could get frustrated with that response. 
You should ask him flat out what the story is. Maybe that will be that ""push"" he needs to get it going in the right direction. He should be willing to work with you if you tell him how important this is to you. "
5272,isfj,"Possibly! Tons of ISFJs are type 9s though.
I'm also dating an ISFJ 9 :-) He is very sensitive and conflict avoidant but I've learned to work around it. 
I can imagine him dilly dallying about these important decisions, especially if you approach it in a ""we need to have a serious talk"" kinda way. 
I've changed my approach to a ""heyyyyy bb I have a small request can you fulfil it for me 😊❤️"" one and it has worked way better! In that case, I was asking for more words of affirmations and asked him if he could call me all sorts of endearments. He loves doing things that would make me happy and I constantly ask him if I can do little things for him too. He readily agreed to my upbeat way of asking him and said ""sure princess, I love doing anything for you"", etc. I'd imagine it would be less effective if I disclosed my needs in a serious, ""we have a conflict to resolve"" kinda way.
Does this help? :-)"
5273,isfj,"I'll occasionally torrent stuff like anime with subtitles, but other than that, I try to purchase most of my media legitimately or through subscription services. I've got Google Play Music, Kindle Unlimited, and Crave TV, and I plan to sub to that Disney thing when it comes out. (No cable though because it's overpriced and not worth it.)
I find oftentimes people act like you're kinda dumb for paying full price for things, but if you wait for sales then you're not paying full price and anyway, you're supporting the creators! I think that's really important. Idk. Maybe it also speaks to my privilege though, that I can actually afford things."
5274,isfj,"Uh... personally, no.  I wish I could say I prefer to pay for things - I mean, it'd make me a better person... but no, I do like to view things free online.  I know that it's wrong, but I can't bring myself to feel bad about it."
5275,isfj,"Yes, I have the means of obtaining it after being blessed with my current situation, so I will support whatever I choose to watch.
Now if it’s not accessible due to location blocks (looking at you media blackout policies) I’ll look elsewhere.  But if I’m able to pay for something, then I’ll go for it."
5276,isfj,"Hi lovely ISFJs, 
After a lot of time observing and interacting with my workplace crush, I've realized she is not an INFJ as I had originally thought, but rather a very thoughtful and warm-hearted ISFJ. Therefore I have two big questions I'd like any help with.
1) I've heard plenty about ENTP-INFJ magic compatibility, however ENTP-ISFJ is not talked about as much. I personally believe that there is a lot of room for each side of this pairing to benefit, given the huge differences in personality, but I can also see the struggles. What do ISFJs think of ENTPs? 
2) I'd love to know if any of these behaviors I've noticed about how she interacts with me are telling of a possible crush on her end as well: 
-will laugh very loudly at almost every joke I make, especially if we are alone, but even when we are in groups
-seemingly treats me differently in solo interactions (more attentive, open when I ask questions, willing to engage with my silliness) than group conversations (checking her phone, giving brief unrevealing answers, trying to play it more cool towards me)
-Almost always eats lunch with me. If more people are in the lunch group, she will often stick it out until others leave and stay and keep talking to me for another 10-15 minutes. 
-She always joins to go out to a restaurant or bar after work with me and other coworkers. But as far as I can tell, she never elects to drink at these outings even if she does drink with other friends (afraid of showing feelings?) 
-beginning to tell me more private things out of the blue that she doesn't tell other members of our work friend group. This is still very rare, but it does happen (talking about things she doesn't like about her job, or gripes about co-workers/friends outside of work) 
-She very rarely initiates conversations in person and though she responds if I IM her, she doesn't typically engage in drawn out conversations with me that way
-There aren't a lot of other young males in the office and of the other young males, but I am the only one I have ever seen her engage with socially, in a non professional manner 
I have other examples I could give if needed. I'm still trying to figure her out and am willing to wait until she is more comfortable with me, if needed, as she really is one of the most caring, conscientious and quietly clever people I've ever met and I think that's exactly all an ENTP guy could ask for. "
5277,isfj,"(sorry for my english as it's not my native language) 
I am an ISFJ female in a long relationship (+7years) with my ENTP SO. I would say it has not been an easy road, although we are young and we have gone through a lot of changes and personal growth while our relationship was developing. We have overcome several issues, mainly related with the way we communicate and express our feelings.
1) I love ENTPs! I love that they are always able to start an interesting conversation with anyone, their dark witty humor, their ability to think out of the box. But I have also resented my SO for some ENTP traits like: thinking he is always right (relentless debater), underestimate the importance of emotions, being disorganized and messy (it has caused arguments about house chores, etc).
Though I have also been a disastrous and inmature ISFJ in the past and for sure he was resented of me sometimes. I needed a lot of reassurance from his part (messaging frequently, jealousy issues...), my feelings were hurt easily depending on the way he expressed himself, sometimes he felt he could not debate thinks with me because I was doubtful of my own opinions to state them, I usually avoided confrontation and shut down if a lot of pressure is put in me (this one I am still working on haha)...
Anyway, this remains in the past. We have grown and understand each other better, and we  have even ""exchanged"" some traits that make us a more complete person. My conclusion is that if both people are mature enough and put communication first, this relationship is very enriching for both parts.
Now, point 2) I speak from personal experience and don't want to cause an impulsive reaction from your part haha. But from what you say, I would think she is interested. She looks actively to spend time with you, express herself more easily, even with intimate subjects, laughs at all your jokes... Does she have some details through the day with you specifically? Like bringing or sharing food with you, small presents, doing you favors that would ease your day...? At least, these are things I would do for someone I am interested. Also sometimes, I repress my desire to message or engage in a conversation to not be a burden or, if I suspect that feelings are not corresponded, to avoid being obvious about mine.
Hope it helps. I wish you luck with your crush and it's very nice you inform yourself about her mbti type. But also, have in mind that everyone is different and I would take my opinion with a pinch of salt! "
5278,isfj,"ENTP here but I would say she is interested in you for sure. ISFJs follow proper procedure for stuff like this. Obviously every one of them is different, but I think they are best defined by the slow, steady grind they apply to almost everything, including relationship. 
INFJ as you probably can imagine are like, radically different from this. They squish time into their own perceptions of it, imagine the future, take the relationship to the end, see both your deaths, and bail before the relationships starts. 
ISFJ and ENTP have a big thing going for them: When both people purse health and development, the relationship will see growth too. You grow toward each other. But if either or both don't trust each other, the types of mistakes that each other will make will be obviously quite threatening to the other. 
ISFJ is a great match for ENTP though. It's best if they come to understand ENTP for sure. Look up the Socionics ""Dual"" relationship, which is a slightly optimistic take on the relationship between people who swap each others Dominant, auxiliary, inferior, and tertiary functions. ISFJ and ENTP are each other's best fit by this metric. But I do believe that the trouble in the relationship most often comes from the ISFJ not really believing that the ENTP is so different from them. ENTP can come to grips with the reality of the ISFJ easier than the ISFJ can come to grips with the ENTP, IMO. It's like, the ENTP is so much broader than they appear; contains all the dark and the light; the ISFJ is so much more condensed.
I think in the best version of the relationship, the two learn to high value one another's strengths, Dominant and Auxiliary functions. 
This could be helped by steering your friendship toward NOT doing your tertiary as much with her. Try when alone doing LESS Fe and more Ti. Let her notice you are different toward her, and tell her some day that when you get comfortable with people you become more authentically you, which looks like introverted thinking, less funny guy. Notice how she is doing the analogous thing already for you; she's doing LESS Ti when alone with you; she's doing more Fe when alone with you. This is a vulnerable state for an introverted sensor like her; she's basically stretching her toe across a line and reaching out. It's far more comfortable for her to stay in a Si/Ti loop. 
Remember isfj feels attracted to using Ti and being complimented for it but it's better for her if she leans into Fe. It will be incredibly refreshing to her some day for you to let her know that what you love about her is the Fe, that this looks magic to you. Eventually you can start shoving her off Ti when you see her doing it, and she can shove you off Fe when she sees you do it (which will build a relationship where you lie a lot less and she obsesses a lot less).
My ISFJ cousin and I became very close, having a bottle of Wine and talking business every night, or say three nights a week, for like a year. He then cut me off out of concern I might be a psychopath after some stuff went down at work that he didn't understand. I didn't know for 18 months he was feeling down on me; I just figured we grew apart. He called me up and asked if we could set up some time to talk through it; he said he had feelings he wanted to acknowledge, that he was operating on a lot of assumptions he suspected were wrong about me, and that he simultaneously needed to acknowledge a way I make him feel when we interact, which was: Diminished. I think I totally understand where he is coming from, because back then I thought he was an INTP or ENTP. He's in his 40s, highly skilled, Ivy League student of philosophy, amateur comedian, and I've always perceived him as the most intelligent friend I have. 
AND YET thanks to having done so much MBTI in the past 2 years while he and I were on the outs, I recognized that what is so brilliant about him his is astounding Fe capacity combined with this Slow Steady Grind ability he has (dom Si). Man. It's brilliant. The way this guy learns engineering for example: start on page one, move through to the end. Keep track on a board of how many hours for motivation. Just hundreds of hours, 12 hours a day for a year, and now he programs applications. That kinda thing. 
In our little makeup convo, I only had to tell him one thing to help him understand I wasn't a psychopath—I just had to explain how I had perceived a thing that went down at work, and why I took the action I did, which, whether the action worked out the way any of us wanted, was not psychopathic. Awkwardly enough it was protective of him, which became obvious to him rather quickly when we discussed. It appeared to him it had resulted in his loss of work, and mine. In fact, his loss of work was already enacted; my behavior only added the loss of MY job to the mix, in an effort to save his. It literally doesn't bother me that it was unclear to him what I had been doing; I'm uncomfortable with the idea that I acted just to save a friend. That feels unethical. haha. Fe ethics, dammit, so beholden to a power structure that I feel out of place using Fi stuff to be like ""Mine and my people's shit matters more here than the corporate rule."" Fe tows the line of the higher power structure; I used Fi to try to save him and my Fi is uncalibrated so I probably acted unethically I realize now. 
AT ANY RATE 
This illustrates some of what I mean when I say the ISFJ may misunderstand the ENTP. But ISFJ really can be a thrilling conversation partner, best I've ever met. They just need to know it's okay to tell you to STFU, to say ""I am exhausted by our conversation, It's time to be done,"" to say ""I need to go eat now"" or whatever. 
But the most valuable thing that happened with my cousin was when he told me he felt diminished, I was able to hear him out totally, and he realized that I love hearing critical takes on me; I love being Seen by a person who sees clearly; so then I was able to tell him that I find him incredibly brilliant, and because he's a decade older than me perhaps, I never used to take the energy to worry about the possibility of like, diminishing him, and I'm sorry for being so reckless. I told him that I understand us better now, as I used to think we were the same, and he was smarter; now I understand we are sort of complimentary opposites, with totally unique sorts of intelligence, and I would in the future remind him all the time that he needs to cut me off when I cut him off, put his hand in the air to signal that I can't interrupt him, train me a bit in this way, realize that I do in fact know that it can wait, I just forget; once he understands more about Ne, he can help me build a system for our relationship, like ""Let's talk for this many hours, and you need your pen and paper for notes so you don't interrupt me as much."" Etc. "
5279,isfj,"Thank you for taking the time to write out a thoughtful response!
Your explanation for the pitfalls and promises of the ENTP/ISFJ pairing are about what I would expect. For what it's worth, I've worked incredibly hard to strengthen my Fe, so I debate less for fun and try to foster harmonious relationships with most people! But yes, I could imagine a scenario when I make a dark/cynical/some egotistical comment almost completely in jest not realizing that it could actually be hurtful. Definitely an area for growth!
I'm glad you're positive based off the signs. She hasn't ever given me any sort of presents/food etc. I don't know if that's purely a side effect of the fact it would be weird since we're coworkers. I'm also super independent, don't tend to vent negative emotions and am usually fairly upbeat when she's around, so I also wonder if, as an ISFJ, she doesn't know quite how to handle someone who doesn't ask for or appear to need her help, even if privately I WOULD LOVE the kind of practical, dependable, logistical skills she has in my life."
5280,isfj,"Interesting question! I never really thought of it like that before. There's some similarities, but probably more differences. I don't pull pranks like Jim, but I am definitely the joker/social instigator at work. Like Jim, I imagine a lot of my antics are aimed at getting her to laugh and make her day more interesting.  Unlike Pam, she is not seeing anyone currently, but seems as cautious towards anything too overtly flirtatious as if she was (though I can definitely understand that fundamentally being a ""we're coworkers"" and I don't want to cross any lines thing too).  "
5281,isfj,"Would you be able to give any advice from the ENTP perspective of the relationship? Particularly the early, courtship stages. I think what I  am struggling the most with really is just being patient with the ISFJ gradual willingness to warm up. As an ENTP, when I know I like something, I can be incredibly impatient..."
5282,isfj,"That's actually exactly what I was going to address. My wife took a while to warm up to me emotionally, so patience is definitely key.
However, I've personally struggled with my joking and argumentative nature. Learn to curb those things, if you can relate. There's a time and place for those things."
5283,isfj,"She is an ISFJ and she has some medical issues and is a little pale.  Despite that she is breathtakingly beautiful and her voice, when she says my name it cuts through all my thoughts.  It stops my brain.  She hates me.
I am 40 years old and single and never married.  Yes a 40 year old man who is single and never married is a miserable failure in life.  Yes there is so much wrong with me.  Yes most people hate me.  Everything you would expect of a fat miserable man at 40 with no reason to live.  I am everything everyone makes fun of and hates.  The guy who can't get ""laid"".  The guy who read comic books.  All that stuff.  Anything bad about a man you can possibly imagine that is me.  This isn't why she hates me though.  We have been kinda friends for like 2 years.  I tease her all the time, because I dont want her and people at work to think I am interested in her.  I am sure I took it too far.  Despite all that she talks to me still.
And she sends me an email now and again.  And thinks of me when she sees something on TV and tells me about it, that I might like it etc.  And sometimes she even talks to me in person.  And she is so beautiful it is hard to look at her in the eye.  And she always looks at me in the eye, staring, wide.  Sometimes I look strait into hers.  I have no idea what she is thinking.  I dont really know what I am thinking when I do this but I feel connected.
I think we may be friends now her and I.  I make allusions of how horrible my life is.  I think she gets that I am depressed and have lost the will to live.  I have no idea what she knows or not I try to keep the conversation light.  We only ever went out once after work for a drink.  I just want to hold her once before I die.  I want a lot more than that but, I am 40 and she is 26 and my body doesnt even work anyway.  Fuck you all.  Fuck you and your judgements.  Why does she talk to me, just being nice I guess.  I hope I die soon.  Maybe an asteroid."
5284,isfj,"I am not sure what you want with your post. Are you trying to figure out her reasons for talking to you? I feel as though many of us can see when someone is in ""need"" and want to alleviate that for them -- we are definitely carers/nurturers.
She is pretty young for you. She probably wants to be friendly but I would not look too far into it. My boyfriend and I are INTJ/ISFJ and I am surprised you say you sense a connection with her... we often are thinking extremely differently from each other (Our functions are all inverse... ISFJ = Si Fe Ti Ne and INTJ = Ni Te Fi Se).
Honestly, you sound like you could benefit from therapy. I definitely have episodes of extreme doubt in myself and everything around me and I know I need it. I am sure you are more accomplished than you believe. But do not go after this girl expecting her to make all your troubles go away. We often take on more than we can handle and don't know when to leave a bad situation/how to say no."
5285,isfj,"This is such a thoroughly non-INTJ post... 
Not saying you're mistyped or anything. Maybe you're just really unhealthy, stressed, or for some other reason stuck in shadow functions. 
I hope you can find goals again. 
I hope your feels heal."
5286,isfj,"She just seems like a very caring, genuine person.  Obviously you two won't end up together, but if nothing else, she should have at least restored a little hope in you that caring, genuine people still exist.  I'm talking about people who look beyond the exterior to see if there's anything of value inside.  By the way, after reading several of your posts I think you do have value and you need to stop making excuses(fat, unhealthy, old) for being miserable.  Excuses are immature.  "
5287,isfj,"Been in therapy a couple years now.  I guess I wanted any response from a ISFJ.  Thanks.
I know the situation with her is impossible.  She is getting married soon to a tall hot rich guy.  I fear I am her bad situation sometimes, that she doesn't want to say no to.  I wanted some opinions maybe on whether she is genuinely my friend or just being nice.  My post probably gives not enough info anyway."
5288,isfj,"I am 40.  I think that is the answer to why I seem different.  Also I am a genuine person and feel no pressure at all to live up to whatever the teens on reddit feel I should be like.  Many of the INTJ's in the INTJ sub have been accused of being fakes.  Maybe there is some truth to it.  Maybe all you know about what an INTJ post looks like, are just teens on the internet trying to pretend they are they next Dexter.
Thank you, so very much."
5289,isfj,"Been in therapy for years.  Hasn't helped at all.  I tell them I am miserable and my life sucks.  There is no possibilty for happiness all I ever wanted in life is long gone.
Therapists only answer to this is ""join a gym""."
5290,isfj,"She is probably trying to be a friendly acquaintance. If she ever reveals to you her own inner thoughts, then you might consider her a friend -- I often try to seem very happy and cheerful to anyone who doesn't know me well enough for me to really tell them how I feel.
I wouldn't consider you her ""bad situation"" because she is not doing anything inappropriate with you; as you said she is getting married soon. I think she is honestly just trying to give comfort to someone who she sees as needing it. Again, try not to look too far into it.
Hope this helps clear things up for you on some level. I don't actually know her, but this is just my best guess as to what is going on between you two."
5291,isfj,"To reiterate, I was not saying you're mistyped. Your post made me sad because it seems like it must not represent your normal self. 
I refer to functions, not stereotypes. The thought loop that leads to a never-ending analysis of facets of a problem is something I'm familiar with. I was there when a past workplace went sour, and I was there when I was told I'd need a major surgery. I haven't been in your situation, but I identify with at least a corner of it. 
Best wishes. "
5292,isfj,"Nothing, just stop making them.  Your main problem is you'd rather make excuses than accept responsibility for your choices.  Change some things in your life, take some risks.  What have you got to lose, other than your lazy mentality? "
5293,isfj,"She tells me things that her fiancé says to her like that she is weird.  And I joke around and say you ARE weird.  And she says, well I keep telling him that he asked ME out.  I just type ""haha"" and say something like well love can be strange.  I don't know this guy and have no advice to give her if that is what she is looking for.  She is so fair, so beautiful.  So vulnerable.  I wonder if she knows how much I want to hold her.  She is so young anyway.  I am probably somewhat obsessed with her because I am a pathetic lonely old man.  It is a fun distraction from my non-life.  Maybe we really are friends after a fashion.  A year from now she will be married and pregnant most likely.  With her big tall rich hot pierced young guy(everything I am not).  So my takeaway is that she probably does consider me a friend...bittersweet."
5294,isfj,I still go to therapy.  And every week therapist says I should join a gym.  And every week I tell therapist I don't understand how that can help.  And then they change the subject to derail me.  I think they can see me getting upset and want to distract me.
5295,isfj,"Okay, you are a bit of a creep and you have an unhealthy fixation. Please talk to your therapist about this. You should be focusing on making you like yourself, not focusing on this woman who has her life in order and does not need a creepy old guy obsessing over her."
5296,isfj,"Not willful  I have worked out a lot in my life.  Spent countless hours working out actually.  Drank the protein drinks, did it all.  My max bench was 305.  Never did a cycle,  I dont know anyone who never did a cycle who could even come close to 305.  So anyway, been there done that, it did nothing for me but give me a bad back and high blood pressure.
So, you tell me.  Am I deluded ?  Because I really feel like I know."
5297,isfj,"Let's talk about immature.  Cheat, take steroids, and then talk about fitness and excuses.  You are a liar, a cheater, and the reason the world is a shitty place to live.  I don't have the words to describe what a disgusting miserable person you are.  You make me sick to my stomach."
5298,isfj,"Have you given a reasonable effort toward full body stretching/yoga and cardio combined with self myofascial release? Being in good cardiovascular shape brings more mood benefits than weightlifting. Also, I noticed you only mentioned bench press - squat and deadlift are better metrics for overall muscular efficacy. 
If working out gives you a bad back and high blood pressure, you're not doing it correctly at all."
5299,isfj,"Haha, the main difference between you and me is that I have said fuck it. I'm going to enjoy the fuck out of this life, get juiced up, bang bitches, snort coke, take risks, and climb out of my miserable middle age shell and actually do something. You, you are a lump of shit who has already accepted defeat. Life conquered you, you little pathetic bitch. You are no longer even a man. Yeah, put a bullett in that worthless skull of yours. And call me a piece of shit all you want, but spend one month with me and I will change your fucking shitty, defeatist attitude. "
5300,isfj,"Absolutely false.  I have been around, and sqat and deadlift are used by fat kids to pretend they work out a lot.  People who do sports, who can fight, who are athletic have a good bench press.
I did some cardio on my off days.  Cardio is very very annoying to me."
5301,isfj,"So like the title say, what are ways that ideas are easily conveyed to you?
I am dating an INTJ and sometimes he will try to describe things to me that he is learning in his classes, or just random theories. It is very hard for me to grasp the concepts most of the time.
I get very stuck on the one answer I think is correct, and then it is difficult for me to change my perspective on the matter (not because I think that I am 100% right, but just because I have a hard time wrapping my head around things I guess?).
What really has ended up working for us is drawings or analogies/similes.
I just wanted to make a post about this because I think it has really helped our conversations. Before I think I would have just given up understanding/nodding my head as if I did (when I had no idea)... But no, I tell my boyfriend ""Okay, I need a picture, or a comparison. Do not just keep talking, because I am not getting it this way.""
Also when I am learning, I really don't learn just by listening but I need to actually go through the process on a piece of paper just so I can really visualize things.
So... anyone ideas/comments about this? Just thought it might be something interesting to talk about on this pretty empty sub :P"
5302,isfj,I completely agree with you. I need things to be taught to me visually with examples to make sure I got it. Simply explaining things verbally does not suffice. I guess I get caught up in some minor detail and get side tracked. :)
5303,isfj,"I've also started dating an INTJ and sometimes find it difficult to follow his logic when he is trying to explain something to me. He can go from A to Z in an instant, while I'm still trying to figure out A to B. For me, the best way to learn is not by listening, I need to see it for myself or write/draw it out myself. Also, I need time to process things internally before I can come up with a solution/answer. "
5304,isfj,"i learn best from someone first describing the over all concept, then filling in the details of how it all works. like someone explaining monopoly as a game where people buy, sell, and trade property, until someone owns everything and wins. and then going on to explain movement, rent, chance, etc."
5305,isfj,"I feel that way working a 9-5 job with a 1.5/hr commute one way. On top of that I have my dogs and errands and everything else. But I always slip some books onto my phone, or an app that gives information and sometimes I'll surf the web when my boss isn't around :/ I can't help it! The urge to learn is voracious! 
Just find different ways to incorporate it into your life"
5306,isfj,Yes? No? Maybe? What do you all feel about that? I'm very open to it (not the out right sex acts in public) but general peck kisses and holding hands or touching the back or arm or shoulder. Even saying 'I love you.' Just curious what you all feel about it. (Me=INFP for reference.)
5307,isfj,"As long as it stays to that kind of innocent touching, 10000%. If it goes beyond that it makes me wildly uncomfortable, because I hate seeing other people make out in public and don't want to inflict that on anyone else :P Generally I'm extremely touchy feely though, so any time I can finagle some physical contact, I'm happy. "
5308,isfj,"ISFJ (f) I LIVE for PDA. I must be touching my INTP at all time. It is shocking to me that he isn't overwhelmed by my unquenchable need for affection. When we were first dating I was very distant from affection -because for me I feel loved and valued through touch, and having dated so many ass hats, I realized if I removed affection I could see a bit more clear. Although, through our relationship my INTP was always affectionate and didn't even register that affection -touching my knee, holding my hand- was only when he made the first move. 3 years later, we are still like 12 year olds constantly all over each other and inseparable. "
5309,isfj,"I absolutely love PDA as well. It makes me feel really good about myself to know that my partner isn't ashamed or whatever to be with me and wants to show the world that I am their girlfriend. Physical touch is second on my love language list, so naturally I gravitate towards touching my partner more because that's what I want as well. "
5310,isfj,"Yes. Very much yes.  I'm pro pecks, holding hands, other and nice innocent touches.
1) I don't like holding back affectionate things i want to express.
2) feels good to know my partner is openly affectionate of me as well.
I'm kind of a corny romantic person about it all. Little things like this have me over the moon. Once a girl I just started seeing saved a seat for me at an event. I had the biggest smile that lasted throughout the day."
5311,isfj,"Yo, as an ISTJ female dating an ISFJ male - this is super accurate and explains a lot. Your responses are incredibly helpful. Also makes me feel odd for having a totally different love language (acts of service is my ultimate weakness)."
5312,isfj,"I am extremely physical affectionate but I'm not comfortable AT ALL with it in public. Maybe hand-holding, or leaning against each other, I suppose, but anything more than that just makes me anxious. "
5313,isfj,"So cute! I love the artwork and handwriting style. I know an ISFP dad who compared his ISFJ daughter to a hummingbird. Also, did you show this to INTJs and did they completely lose it? haha. I know a lot of INTJs like to be seen as fuzzy people. Your snake does look pretty sweet though."
5314,isfj,"Hi all, titles says it all I guess. 
Sometimes I think a profile may be ISFJ (and hope it is maybe..), and was wondering what would you guys personally like to get as a first message / what are you more likely to answer or not answer?
(I'm male 31, looking for female, serious more than hookups)
I submitted a similar question in INFJ"
5315,isfj,"Just as the other person said,  be yourself! More importantly be genuine.  If you're looking for a long term, serious relationship, possible ""the one"" then you'll have to be unapologetically yourself. 
I met my partner (who has a similar personality type) online and he literally just sent me a message saying ""Hey, how's it going?"". We've been together for two and a half years and I'm confident his the one! 
My point being, just be yourself and if you come across the right person for you then it'll all work out. 
Best of luck! "
5316,isfj,"Comment on something particular in her profile (shows you read what she had to say, which she will appreciate). Compliment her on how beautiful she looks. Above all, be genuine in your compliment! Don’t say something generic or boring "
5317,isfj,"I have a friend who's a male ISFJ. He is the classic ISFJ with a servant's heart, always doing things for other people--which, unfortunately, veers off into insecure territory. He becomes insecure and wonders what worth he has outside of what he can do for others. I need to help him understand what it means to have self-love and how vital it is to help him live a happier, healthier life. Any thoughts? "
5318,isfj,"I'm really happy to get your perspective as a male ISFJ who went through the process of self-love! 
I'm wondering if there were any specific resources that may have helped you... any particular articles or books? Or talking to some counselor or adviser? "
5319,isfj,"My fellow ~NT~ friend and I are throwing around an idea for a podcast. People write in and we dispense rational, scientific based advice, divorced of feeling or sympathy, a la Data / Spock from Star Trek.
It would require research on our part for some questions. For example, if someone writes in about a contentious relationship, we'd have to look up the different styles of amygdala  hijack (fight or flight response to stress) and how to deescalate the situation. 
There would be NO ""tell the person how you feel"" or ""just be yourself"" or ""love yourself at your size"", feeler advice. 
Just cold hard, science based, advice and an action plan attached to it. And of course some ~NT~ snark. 
So I'm taking a survey. 
How many of you think this could make an entertaining podcast? 
Additionally....
We are currently taking advice requests from people 18+ to make a dummy run of the podcast (to gauge how long it should be, editing, style etc)
Our test run will not be put out to the general public, but if your letter is selected we will send you the audio file of our test run. 
Of course, your identity would remain anonymous. 
You can send a letter here.

If you have any suggestions or comments, I would love to hear them. We are in the planning stages now, and any ideas are appreciated. "
5320,isfj,"Of the friends I have typed.
Close Friends: ESFP (Been friends for 8 years we are inseparable), INTP (My super Close Friend Group consist of the INTP and ESFP, Great Loyal Friend and we always have interesting conversations), ISTJ, ESFJ, INTP
Friends: 3 ISFJs, ESFJ, ESTP, ESFP, ENFJ, INFP, ISTJ, ENFP, ExFP. 
How about you guys?"
5321,isfj,"Best friend: ISTP, we are basically sisters and have been friends for 13+ years. My other extremely close friend is an INFP.
Friends: ENTJ (not super close, but he’s nice), ISFJ, ENFJ, and another INFP.
Ex-boyfriend: INTJ. We were super close, but he just had a bit of maturing to do before he could be sensitive to my feelings."
5322,isfj,"Current Best friends: INTJ, INFP, ENFP, ISTJ, ISFP
Boyfriend is also ENFP
I find that the more time I spent with my ENFP girl friend, my T side comes up a lotttt which I don't particularly like; but not so with the boyfriend
INTJ and I are the oldest friends and I don't think we will ever break up ♥"
5323,isfj,"Not really, honestly. I’ve always been friends with N people, and consumed N oriented content/ideas. So I have a lot of memorized intuitive connections that makes me fluent in the most common N stuff.
I often feel a little slow, but Fe picks up the slack when I’m not on the same level. 
I always forget how natural it can be to talk to other SFJs. Sts are scary. I guess I always like to be the more practical one in the relationship :)"
5324,isfj,"Good late evening. So me and the co-mod thought it'd be fun to switch up the weekend thread this week with a game. We decided to do the fuck, marry, and kill game lmao. 
I'll start this game. 
Fuck: ESTP. I tend to be naturally drawn to these types though I've only meant guy ESTPs. It would be interesting to meet a girl ESTP and see if we hit it off. Overall, I feel like they would be good one night stand 
Kill: ESTJ Sorry I'm just not very drawn to the super high Te.
Marry: INFJ. I only know one INFJ in real life and she's great to talk to and get her perspective on things and problems I'm having. I also feel like these personality types are deep romantics (really all of the NF types could be). I also like how their quality of being reserved but empathetic (sometimes extroverts can be overwhelming). Overall, they seem like a soulmate type. "
5325,isfj,"Fuck: INFJ: we get on like a house on fire, they flatter me and make me feel fuzzy. We part ways before they interpret me raising a tiny issue as a warrant for full-blown attack where no holds are barred and I'm to blame for everything ever (I'm sure there's more stable and wonderful INFJs; I've just encountered some very unhealthy ones who have said horrible things to me)
Marry: ENFP: so nice; draws me out, won't hurt me
Kill: ESTJ: same reasons as OP"
5326,isfj,"Fuck: ESTP (probably couldnt deal with their ego-centric nature long term)
Marry: ISTP (sexy fuckers and have a deep intensity)
Kill: I can’t stand the thought of killing any type....but some of my least favorites are, ESFJ, ESTJ, and ENFP "
5327,isfj,"Fuck: ESFP (idk guess I like the craziness and niceness lmao)
Kill: ESFJ (too much Fe, stop caring about me so much!)
Marry: INFJ (best friend is INFJ and we dead ass can talk about almost anything for hours)
​"
5328,isfj,"Fuck: ISFP.  Something about Se is so, so attractive to me.  It's like the Se-users I know are naturally sensual, even if I don't find them attractive.  I find female ISFP's particularly attractive, even if I wouldn't date some.
Kill: ...ENTJ.  Sorry, you guys.
Marry: ISTP.  I love ISTP's so, so much.  Such a puzzle to figure out!  Any mature STP would do for me in marriage.  "
5329,isfj,"INTP here
fuck you istj, you are too structured and orderly (to the point of inflexibility even at great reason), and dont have the same nice charm as isfj
tu mourront esfj, youre boring as fuck, and your small talk plans should go die
infp youre the best ;) always so kind, and (excluding infjs), the only feeler who seeks truth and (being an introvert) can connect best with me"
5330,isfj,"I will start off with that I am ENTP. My girlfriend is ISFJ. We have been dating for over a year. I just feel like we have a lot of the same recurring problems and I don't know why she puts up with me. I don't believe she has any positive gain from me. She is an endless bubbly fountain of love, support, and happiness and I always seem to hurt her feelings when I don't intend to. I ask her so many questions about how to be better and she say's she wouldn't want to change me but is it worth it if all I ever do is hurt her? It just doesn't quite seem fair. She is very emotional and I recognize I have emotions, I just don't know what to do with them. I guess I don't really know how to love you guys. I would like to learn how to better for her. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
EDIT: Thank you for helping me! You are all so nice. As an ENTP being the subject of all this caring and niceness really can freak me out."
5331,isfj,"For me, I really need someone I can tell anything to -- and this won't develop right away because it takes a long time for me to open up. I have so few deep friendships but the ones I do have ground me and keep me sane. I also am pretty picky about the people I even ""select"" to try and be friends with... I think while ISFJs are very nice and want to help others we are also at the same time reserved and private about our own problems and life.
For me, my boyfriend is the person I can ask, ""Am I too crazy for thinking this?"" or ""Should I feel guilty over x or was it not really my fault even though I'm blaming myself?"" etc (of course we have a lot of loving moments blah blah but my point is he is my sanity sounding board). It might sound silly but that is what I need -- a person who I can tell anything to and not feel judged or stupid.
I also have been in bad relationships before where my emotions were largely invalidated and ignored. My current SO is very supportive of my emotions and always tells me it is okay to feel how I feel. And sometimes I randomly kind of snap (pretty stressed lately) but I immediately feel bad and ask ""can we just pretend that never happened"" and we do.
Also I really want someone who wants to do small simple things for me just to make me happy -- and without me having to ask for. If I ask for you to go to the plant stire with me and pick out something to grow then I'd want my SO to want to go and not sound sad or upset or even slightly grimace because any small sign of annoyance and I immediately feel guilty for asking whatever I asked and will repeatedly say ""nevermimd, I can do that on my own!""
Hope this helps and best of luck to you and your girlfriend."
5332,isfj,"I was with an INTP for a while, so that sounds pretty similar to what our situation was like.
The thing about ISFJs, or at least in my case, is that we can get offended relatively easily, but we also generally get over it pretty fast. If my feelings were hurt over something, and I brought it up, as soon as I got an apology or an acknowledgement that it wasn't intentional, and they didn't mean to hurt my feelings, I'm so over it. 
Communication is really going to be your best bet, here, for both parties. I learned very quickly that I had to be extremely upfront and direct with an xNTP, and they don't pick up on subtle cues or hints, which was okay with me, but it took some getting used to. ISFJs can also be somewhat needy when it comes to affection, and it's easy to feel a little neglected if we aren't getting enough.
It can feel very strange to have to remind your partner that you'd like a little more love and affection, because it just comes really naturally to us, and we can be super gushy people, but honestly, it's really the most effective solution. I was prone to feeling unloved or neglected by my INTP, when he was really just doing his own thing, and he was distracted, it wasn't that he didn't love me. He just didn't show it as often, or in the same ways I did. 
Do you have any specific examples of when/how you've unintentionally hurt her feelings?
I could probably give more tailored advice, if you do. 
Emotional stuff just isn't going to come as naturally to you as it does to her, and it's unrealistic for her to expect that from you. But that being said, we're very affectionate people with our mates, and little gestures of love and affection can go a very long way in keeping things running smoothly."
5333,isfj,"Props for you to seek out assistance! That says a ton about your commitment. In my ISFJ-ISFJ relationship, the communication is really key. Sounds to me like it might benefit you both if she actually let you know how you can improve in the relationship. Maybe you can try to communicate that you just want to understand her better and grow the relationship, and it's not about changing who you are as a person. I know personally I tend to be very observant, and my observations tend to be accurate, but sometimes I assume too much and get myself in trouble for it. That's why I've found clear communication to really help make sure that I'm not reading too much into things. 
Jumbled advice, but I hope it helps. Best of luck to you!!"
5334,isfj,"Thank you. She does bounce everything off of me and tells me that I am her best friend. She is self conscious of the world and I don't know why, she dresses well and always looks great, meanwhile I am dressing as douchey as I can just to piss people off. I am the first one to be on anyone that judges her because she feels the weight of the world. That last one is big for her as well. She wants me to do the things that she wants to do and complains when I don't invite her to things. I just see it that we are still independent people with seperate interests and I am not going to enjoy a country concert with her friends and she isn't going to enjoy playing magic the gathering and getting drunk with my buddies so why torture one another. I try to compromise every once in a while for her but I know she can tell that I don't actually want to be there and it bothers her. I guess I will have to try harder."
5335,isfj,"Yeah. That is fairly spot on. I don't even notice and a lot of times I don't honestly think that would even be hurtful or offensive. 
Specific examples being she gets upset when I don't want to do some trivial thing with her and if I am like alright, I will go then she doesn't want me to. She wants me to actually want to go. How do you force that? It seems unreasonable to me. Makes it worse when I let her know that.
Other examples are really just me talking out loud and questioning the world around me and inquiring about everything. I take things literally and mean exactly what I say, no more, no less. She doesn't  quite do that. 
I guess I just need to compromise better. Thank you though!"
5336,isfj,I communicate everything. I think that scares her sometimes because I see things so differently than she does and because my mind wanders a lot and I will go to really weird places. I have to wrestle information out of her sometimes and that doesn't always go well. I am picking up what your putting down though and that is a good angle to use. I get myself in trouble all the time. I just always assume I am in trouble. Thanks!
5337,isfj,"I think it is fine to not do everything together -- tbh I do not ask my boyfriend to do things I really don't think he will enjoy but accompanying me to the store won't kill him. I recently went to a concert (Grimes if you have heard of her) and I know my boyfriend is not a huge fan so even tho he offered to go I told him I would rather go alone to enjoy the music. I also garden and compute alone altho I do appreciate his silent company. Sometime I will ask him just to do his own thing outside with me while I garden so he will read or play on his laptop or do bike maintenance and it's a comfortable silence.
I do think separate hobbies are good but there should be shared ones as well. I can go hiking alone or with my boyfriend, he goes biking without me but he has also helped set up a bike for me and we go biking for a few hours throughout the week, we each play our own video games but have some we play together. I also have a few online friends that I watch movies with or just chat with on weeknights and he takes that time to do his own thing. And of course we have Netflix so we always have a few series we are watching at any time -- he watches The Magic Schoolbus for me and I watch Bill Nye the Science Guy for him as an example.
It would surprise me if your girlfriend really does not enjoy alone time but I guess you meant more like if she goes out to do something she wants you with her? I used to be in an abusive, codependent relationship and after ending that is when I really started to not mind going out on my own as much."
5338,isfj,"Yeah. We aren't living together yet so I think she just wants to see more of me and that's awesome but I don't appreciate her expecting me to drop whatever I am doing to do her thing. 
Like you said just to have him near you I have do that regularly. She likes to lay in the sun and tan but doesn't want to be by herself and I am not sitting in the sun all day if I don't have to so I just drag her around to wherever a comfy spot in the shade is while I read or something. 
If she goes out she always wants me to go with her and normally I don't mind but when it's a constant I do get tired of it. 
Talking these things to someone who is not going to immediately tell me otherwise is probably a help and obviously I need to may be relate this to her."
5339,isfj,"Right now I live with my boyfriend and we are both home a lot so I actually have the problem of just wanting him to leave the house sometimes! But that is much different if you don't live together.
If you don't mind -- how old is your girlfriend and is this her first relationship? Like I said I used to be like her and kind of codependent/separation anxiety maybe but a bad relationship and time changed that. I'm 23 now but only about 4 or 5 years ago I was similar to your girlfriend. Also in my first relationship I just was really stupid and in love and I think ISFJs tend to fall really hard but we try to keep it to ourselves a bit.
If it's her first relationship she might just need to grow more. It is not wrong to feel you aren't compatible and I am not saying you should break up -- but my first two relationships and break-ups did help me grow a lot.
Best of luck."
5340,isfj,"Yeah. I can see that. I am always doing something and going so I don't foresee that being an issue of hers to kick me out. 
She is 22. I am 23. This is neither of ours first relationship although this is both of ours probably most serious relationship. Especially for me at least. Commitment doesn't come easily for me.
I have no doubt that she cares more for me than I do for her. We care in totally different ways. I joke with her and tell her that she is invested more in my life and future than I am, which doesn't always make her too happy."
5341,isfj,"I was just wondering what other ISFJ's feel about this. For example, I find myself befriending INFP's. My boyfriend is one and my good friend is also one. I feel drawn to them, like I'm very comfortable in their company and such. I wouldn't doubt it if my best friend is one, I'll find out and update this when I do. "
5342,isfj,"My best friend is an ISTJ, but generally the personalities I'm mostly drawn towards are ENFP and INFPs as well. I tend to be able to have the kind of conversations I crave for with them, and build a proper connection with them. "
5343,isfj,"I kind of have my own idea, so that question may as well be rhetorical - but would love some additions. 
I think that what strikes me the most, is that you all seem to have all of the bases covered to my opinion. You all seem to be emotionally as well as intellectually ready, people who have tolerance, lovingness and industriousness to fall back on if the outside world does not yield any results. People who have a fairly decent ability in letting their hair down. You seem to not be bossed about by timidity or unwarranted ego, but strike a faultless balance of looking like people who are on standby to be of assistance.
And it's why you'll be hard pressed to find anybody with a bad word against you :)"
5344,isfj,"I don't know about my comrades, but for me, my tolerance and love for others comes at least partly from a lifetime of struggling to tolerate and love myself.  I know how much it hurts to not be comfortable with yourself and wouldn't wish that on anyone else, so I shower others with unconditional approval."
5345,isfj,"That's a real compliment haha. I have an unconditional love for everyone in my life. Especially lovers and friends. I dunno. I just want to do my best and be happy with my life and friends. I have such a big heart. They forgive my stubborn and sometimes moody nature. I can have days where I feel like I need to be alone and am not being allowed that time. That's when I get a little short with some people because I really care about my well-being. But, if someone is in trouble I can toss that aside and help out however heh."
5346,isfj,"This is so true. There's only about 3 people in this world I've ever been really truly attracted to, and 2 of 3 were ENTJs. They're so self-assured, adventurous, and they just don't give a shit about anyone else's opinion. They're just about everything that I admire in a person (even if they're impulsive and impractical sometimes)."
5347,isfj,"Very well put. The struggle is real. Even if we cannot love ourselves, we can try our hardest to make sure no one else feels as bad as we do.
Treat others as you want to be treated. But inside we treat ourselves horribly (in my experience ). My boyfriend always reminds me I am my own worst critic and should try to treat myself like I treat him or my coworkers. I am very forgiving about any mistakes they might make, will say everything's fine and not to worry if they mess up... But if I do I never forgive myself.
Sorry for the kind-of rant, but I do really love your comment. "
5348,isfj,"I agree with what you've said... I've commented something similar in a past post. It's like we want to be appreciate, but if we feel like we were only doing what needs to be done then there is guilt upon receiving a compliment. And I put my happiness aside, which has led to always asking what another person wants instead of myself--I am finally learning to try to think of what I want because maybe someone does just want to please me instead of the other way around (this is mostly in regards to my SO, where he wants me to pick what I want and not just try to guess what he wants).
Even as a child I'd tell my mom not to compliment me in front of her friends for doing stuff like helping her bake a cake or clean the kitchen... It's gotten to the point where I am starting to feel weird when my SO compliments/thanks me altho I know he just is doing it to make me feel appreciated. And I don't know why I get uncomfortable because of it."
5349,isfj,"Yeah, I'm the same actually. I've only really liked a couple people, and they're definitely ENTJ. They're pretty much everything I admire as well, and it sort of sucks because it seems very difficult to build a strong relationship with them, at least in my experience. "
5350,isfj,Thank you crazytoasterguy! I'm sure your friend is so lucky to have someone like you as a friend who recognizes this about him. I have a boss that notices these qualities in me and it feels really good when he voices it out :)
5351,isfj,My goodness. You hit something in me. My mom used to praise me all the time because she wanted it as a child but didn't get it. It sounds good but she'd do it in this loud and obnoxious way or kind of brag about me to people while I stood there awkwardly. It made me wanna cry kind of. Hard to explain. I don't think I know how to do things for myself properly yet though.. Something to work on.
5352,isfj,"I'm fairly introverted and I really need some friends seeing as how I don't have any xD I get along great with people I'm around at school and work but I feel awkward asking people to hang out otherwise so that we can get to be close friends. The other problem is Idk what to do when you hang out with someone. I do not like going to parties or bars or clubs, and there's not much else to do nowadays. I'm pretty tame and boring. Its also important to know I am a horrible judge of character and I end up with friends who aren't really friends. Please help me!!!"
5353,isfj,"Lol isfj with similar issues. But I’m also 29 so that’s kind of a different ballpark of issues. Most of my past friends group came about in a string. Started with one, then that person introduced me to a group, so on and so forth (referencing high school/college). But initially the one person who introduced me to a larger friend group, I got to know over a small amount of time and organically one or the other asked to hang out outside of school. If it’s more organic and not just random it’s less intimidating, especially if you’ve build some form of interactions over a small amount of time.
For hangouts, maybe just grab a coffee and talk, to bowling, go for a paint/art class, a hike. What are your interests? Maybe start there. Keep an open mind to their interests in the hangouts, you may learn something new or meet other cool people. That’s kind of how my high school college friend experiences went. Also, find an entp, lol. They’ll really get you out of your comfort zone which can be both stressful but realllly fun. Esfp and Estps are great for this too. Not saying friend based on type, but some of my most fun friendships have been these types!
As well, I understand he desire for true friends. But be open minded to superficial friends - mostly because, as mentioned, you never know who they might introduce you too, especially since I’ve noticed those types tend to be social butterflies. 
Happy friending!"
5354,isfj,"That's a hard trade-off then!
What was the last you really enjoyed doing something with other people? Is it worth it to dive into that? 
Also, if you feel busy right now, how do you see friends fitting in your schedule? How long will your school plus work situation last? Can you wait until afterwards?
Could you consider classmates and colleagues as friends? Are there possibilities to do something after school or work? "
5355,isfj,"How encouraging. Have you been in a relationship with one? I just read today that ISFJ's are supposedly an ideal match for ENTP's (which I didn't know existed). ISFJ's seem like a sensitive/delicate type and I'm slightly skeptical how well a relationship could work, considering I can get pretty exhausting/abrasive in my ""informational interrogations"" and also have a tendency to loose interest. "
5356,isfj,Well I'm in school until October and I wanna make friends before then. There's only aone few people at a hook o would wanna be friends with but Idk how to intimate that stuff. Like we go out for our lunch break and grab food sometimes but that's 20 minutes. Idk how to ask without being weird
5357,isfj,"Yes, in a relationship with one now, going on three years. Best ever. We’re duals according to Socionics, the best most growth oriented relationship. I love listening to his Ne, and he enjoys making me laugh and in awe with all his incredible ideas. He enjoys the Fe super love I show him and the grounding/stability that comes with Si. 
I think this pairing works best as an adult (I’m 29, he’s 28). I think that gives those lower functions time to develop so it can be a more rewarding experience. For an isfj I’d like to think my Ti is pretty good which has taken some time to develop. His Fe definitely shows as well. 
How old are you? I know he probably would’ve said the same about losing interest in his younger years, and me not being able to handle some of his seemingly crude remarks. But we’ve both grown, and I can see through the lens of Ti/Ne and don’t get offended really ever, and he has improved his Fe/Si and is soooooo loving. You guys are secretly teddy bears. <333 let us love you!!! :p"
5358,isfj,"They are great! I learned SO MUCH from my ENTP ex. My ex and I differed on a few major things...
career/life goals: Simply put, just different. 
religion: I am religious/spiritual, he is atheist. I respected this, but didn’t truly realize how dismaying this was to me until he wouldn’t attend a family funeral mass with me.
We learned from each other, challenged each other, grew up, and grew apart. We wanted different things in life, had different passions, different ideas of how to spend time. Throw in a year of long distance, some hard-to-forgive relationship curve balls on both ends, and a dash of “a lack of communication”... it just didn’t work out for us. I don’t regret the relationship one bit though!"
5359,isfj,"I'm happy your relationship's going so well, and a ""growth oriented relationship"" sounds divine. I'm 26 and definitely can agree that I require more maturing than most my age especially to compliment what I'm taking so far to be a prim and proper, organized type.  
""Fe super love"" sounds desirable and worth investing in but makes me worried that I'd be working with a person who's too easy to hurt, if that makes any sense. Honestly the whole Feeling type seems pretty foreign to me and makes me question how well my ideas could resonate. I think i'd be a good encourager for an ISFJ but in my limited understanding of other types, it seems like it could be weirdly controlling in a maternal kind of way. But that's just a guess. "
5360,isfj,"My beloved ISFJ's, I'm going to open up here, be brutally honest with myself and you - I woke up this morning feeling bad about something...like from the second I opened my eyes and oriented myself, but I couldn't figure out what it was.  Then I remembered.  My post.
Guys...I am so sorry.  I was going through something yesterday and I had no outlet during a very dark time.  As I said before, my wife has struggled with my new direction, and it's completely understandable, as leaving security and predictability for the unknown is not the ISFJ's preference.  
To give context for yesterday, I was in a state of loneliness and heartbreak as my wife was out on a country dancing date with a guy she met earlier this year and has had some intimate contact with (not sex, but kissing and that kind of stuff).  She met him while I was traveling for extended periods of time working on my book and academic research.  She has been suffering from male issues since her dad left when she was 9, was sexually abused at 11, and raised in poverty as both of her parents are deaf.  That said, I have a lot of compassion and understanding and my personality is suited perfectly to allow her the flexibility and space she needs to figure things out.  She met this guy who recently divorced his wife because she had anxiety and depression issues (so does my wife...just let that process for a minute).  But he's a blue-collar worker, simple, easy going, and he appeals to her feelings and gives her something that she feels is very good for her soul and I absolutely hate it, but I can tolerate it.  It's just a very hard thing for me.  She has always been vocal about how she wished I was more of a simple man, predictable, reliable, easy going, laid back...but then goes through periods where she's in love with my intensity and idealism.  The thing is...I WISH I was more of a simple man many days.  I loathe the fact that I was born this way, so overactive in my nervous system and brain, such a misfit, so lonely.  So the fact that she has sought out another man who is a simple man, makes me feel very sad.  The fact that he left his wife, that he has no problems pursuing a married woman...these are things that go against my deepest values and I do not respect as I am very loyal and long-suffering with my commitments.  I communicated to her that I was not comfortable with her going down to see him, that I'm not comfortable having an ""open marriage"" and the more I expressed it, things got ugly.
I think the thing that really has bothered me is how justified she's been by society to potentially jeopardize our marriage and little family (we have 2 little boys).  When I went from being clean shaven, neatly dressed, corporate and all that to having a beard, long hair, academic...it seems like she's been encouraged and justified to pursue this guy because I have betrayed our family by what is perceived to be irresponsibility.  
So here I am.  She finally came home after being out all night, and seems really happy.  We are going to marriage counseling (and have been for a while now).  I don't understand the ISFJ and how unselfish they can be in the short term but how fickle they can be in the long term.  It's like....we are exact opposites or something :D lol
If someone could speak to me and help me understand why a woman would ever want a simple man as a long term solution over a passionate loyal and faithful man who is a good father.  I feel like she's taking advantage of my openness and flexibility and that a lot of xSFJ's do too.  
Again, I'm sorry, and I thank you for letting me open up.  Now on to part two."
5361,isfj,"As an ISFJ female i find this post disturbing, i really can not relate to your wife and her disloyalty! When i have been in relationships i go all in for better or worse! I truly think that in this case its not you that is the problem, or her wanting a simpler man! She is ""seeing"" this guy because she has the ""grass is always greener"" mindset. She thinks that giving up on her faithfulness to you and starting something new with another random guy is gonna fix her personal issues.  She is running away from herself and her own demons, in the meantime she is ruining the love and bond you guys have built up over time. I'm very sad that you are in this situation! You should not put up with this, we (isfj's) respond well to firm and assertive words and beliefs from our loved ones and she should not feel for one second that her seeing another man when she already has a husband and a family, is in ANY WAY ok. Not for you or your kids. 
I'm sorry if I've overstepped, I usually never comment but i felt compelled! "
5362,isfj,"Very sorry for what you are going through.. IDK what to say. Really wishing things will work out through counseling and with time everything falls into place.. How did she respond when you said that you weren't okay with an open marriage??
​
Don't apologize here to us strangers, you don't owe any apology to any of us here :) 
​"
5363,isfj,"To answer your bottom question...
We just want to be loved. We don’t want fancy, complicated things, we want simplicity and....
Someone we can fix. You’re not fixable (read: you have nothing that seems to need fixing) and you seem to have a bit of a temper. This man appeals to her through similarity and she feels as if she can help him go through it. "
5364,isfj,"my isfj husband stepped out on me while I was very ill, so yes even isfj can be disloyal especially when stressed. You need to stop being flexible, open-minded & 'nice' when it comes to potential infidelity - it can destroy your family! You should firmly point out that you have been loyal while that other guy dropped his wife as soon as the going got rough. I hope you are earning enough money as a academic & are responsible with the bills because that is important to isfj's imo.... "
5365,isfj,"I know when isfjs had already enough BUT NOT THIS WAY.
She gives a bad name to all isfjs and I hope shes been mistyped because if she isnt then I dont know what to do.
If she really loves you then she should just stay with one man and mingle with another man. She's not a loyal wife! 
If she continues this then i suggest you file a divorce "
5366,isfj,"Thank you!  I agree, which is ultimately why I reached out to you all in this forum.  It seems that many on here have been offended by me and I know when an ISFJ builds a resentment it's hard to overcome, I truly hope y'all can see my intent."
5367,isfj,Yeah well she’s married so she needs to grow up and decide what she wants. If she isn’t mature enough to commit to her husband she needs to admit it and leave instead of put expectations on him to be different. 
5368,isfj,"I am in no way offended by you or this post, I'm appalled over your wife, it is incredibly unfair to you how she is behaving! Marriage is the real deal, when things get rough you don't just give up, especially when there are kids involved! Cheating is unacceptable, you should voice your loud opinion on this matter, let her truly know that her actions make you feel like crap, ISFJ'S appreciate when someone opens up emotionally who is not used to showing that side to him/her. Be open and raw with her, assertive and firm. "
5369,isfj,"aww, thankyou! :D ..You're so sweet and seem innocent.. I think so too.
As for PM, I'm really sorry PP, I have a rule against corresponding over PMs, please don't mind.. :( If you want to ask me anything, you can do so here - I will try my best. But please forgive me.
How's it going with your wife today?
EDIT - I have seen your posts about your wife. I wish she knew how much you love her :)"
5370,isfj,"You seem to have your things together. You have your life in order, at least on paper. You know what career you want, you know what you need to do to pursue it. And any issues you do have are not new issues, and likely not something your wife can relate to emotionally. 
I know my ISTP boyfriend would be less than pleased if I went out dancing with another man. Your feelings are valid. "
5371,isfj,"Does she really feel like she's connecting with you? When you identify as a loner, as a misfit? Do you really feel like you're connecting with her? It doesn't surprise me (though I'm not saying it's good behavior at all) if she's looking outside the relationship for the connection she isn't getting. Are you depressed or do you push her away from you, the real you, what you're really going through, thinking and feeling? "
5372,isfj,"Haha thank you!  No corresponding over PM? that’s interesting!  Do you mind me asking about that?  Is it like a family rule or a marriage rule or something ?  
As far as where she’s at today....not good....I’ll update when I get done free time"
5373,isfj,"Hehe, I love ranting about Si!
To me, Si is not so much about the ""past"" itself (although it's very close to it), but more about the ""familiar"".
As high a Si user (and especially Si dominant), I feel most comfortable with things that I am used to. And because of that, I kind of resent ""the unknown"". I tend to be scared of trying new things or doing something for the first time, because I have no idea how it will go down. I feel like I need to know every single detail on how to do things before I do them, because it might go wrong and might not be perfect on the first try. That's also because of our Ne inferior, obviously. Once we develop Ne, Si can pretty much get used to anything and will build experience in all fields (I sure hope so at least).
Si is not just the ""fear of change"", though.
Si works with personal associations, because it is an introverted function. For instance : if I'm walking in the woods, I see the sunlight streaming through the leaves and it makes me happy because it reminds me of how warm it feels to have the sunlight on you, and then, by association, it reminds me of times when I felt warm and happy.
Of course it does also work with bad memories, ahah. Because of that, I sometimes get triggered by things that remind me of a bad time I had. I might also avoid doing anything that will get me in this situation again, and will go to great length to do that, because Si is also about learning from past experiences (to feel at ease - most of the time we love stability and for things to be simple). For instance : I was in a really unhealthy friendship. Because of that, it's hard to interact with things that remind me of that person (places, songs, etc.) and I feel like I have to reclaim it. (It might also be why types with Si ter have such a hard time with their loops?)
Which brings me to something I believe has to do with Si (and I'm curious about other Si doms' experience on it): I associate some people with really specific scenery or things. One of my INTP friends, for instance, I associate with this image (beware it's going to sound a bit stupid to many people ahah): 6pm evenings that get dark enough that it's almost impossible to distinguish sky and land, but you can still make out what is happening, and when you look out the window and into the city, everything is blue except for the windows that are glowing from the lit rooms of the buildings. I think I associate them because my friend and that time of the day give me the same exact feeling of tranquility (hence the subjective, introverted sensing, I guess).
I hope this helps! Amazing username btw ahahah"
5374,isfj,"I read it much better described in this one article I can’t find, but here’s the cliffnotes for the experiential aspects of Si (as opposed to the tendencies Si-doms manifest).
A month ago: I read a book. The Beatles Yellow submarine was playing in the background. I was in the train, feeling a bit uncomfortable because the tag on my shirt was scratchy, and I was worried about an assignment. 
Today, with normal amounts of Si: I read a quote from that book, and remember being on the train listening to the Beatles. 
Today, with a high amount of Si (happens when I’m stressed or depressed): I read a quote from that book, and I feel exactly how I felt on that day I read the quote. Stress, tag, Beatles, train. It’s the internal impression of the exterior. 
These impressions are how I interact with the exterior world. I saw this grossly puffy piece of pizza last night and it gave me an impression. I was immediately reminded of a similar impression something had made on me. I thought: It looks like an old acquaintance from highschool who’s put on weight. I remember looking at them, and thinkjng, hey why are you so puffy all of the sudden? I don’t remember you like this. Like the pizza. "
5375,isfj,"That was really really helpful and made a ton of sense (haha) to me. I really appreciate it.
In your opinion, is it possible for people with Si to be really bad at giving examples? For instance, if you tell an authority figure that you feel some negative feeling coming from certain people and they ask you for a time that happened... And you draw a blank. You can describe the feeling and what you think are the motivations behind it and what it does to you and even how it's felt and affecting others but not the actual actions? "
5376,isfj,"This was really cool to read.. I guess I take these feeling-associations for granted as an ISFJ. Today I was just listening to a song that made me sad and nostalgic one tough day in college and it transported me back to where i was.. I was working on an essay on a Friday night because it was due the next day (Saturday) and I walked to the cafe in the rain wearing my orange jacket listening to that song.. and I walked past a common room where people were dancing and it just fit so perfectly with that bittersweet tune (""Before"" by Washed Out). And I felt sad and envious and lonely but nostalgic and like life was still beautiful and I still remember all of that. It's a cool feeling. "
5377,isfj,"But Yeah, I too as an ISFJ avoid situations that made me feel terrible in the past.. I just get really overwhelmed. Mostly when an authority figure is lecturing or criticizing me. In general I do everything I can to avoid conflict with anyone."
5378,isfj,"Hmm it wouldn't surprise me! People tend to say Si doms/users have the best memory but I would say it's a very selective (and sometimes even subjective) memory. I feel like I remember random details and never the actual (whole) thing. Also, I always have loooots of stories to share about everything, but the second someone asks me to tell them one, I suddenly have none ahah. 
But well, Si is the salt function as well, let's be honest... so even if sometimes I do forget the details of what it was that made me mad, but I stay salty because I remember exactly what they did to me... 
Edit: I think that, as a whole, if I don’t think about what I’m going to say thoroughly I have a looot of difficulties expressing it and remembering everything I wanted to say... "
5379,isfj,"Thank you hehe I totally understand, though. I think as ISFJs we tend to universalise our experience without really meaning to! I only really became aware of it when my ISFP friend and I compared our sensing experiences with respectively Se and Si - I realised that Si is a lot more about associations whereas Se seems to be taking in the actual sensations in a more objective but intense way! 
Your example with the music is truly relatable tbh
I try to avoid conflict as much as I can as well... I guess the goal for our Si-Ne axis is to go through all kinds of experiences, even the bad ones like this, so that we could actually handle anything. Good luck to us all!! "

5381,isfj,"I'm curious to see how you all deal with letting things that meant a lot to you go, moving on from a close relationship, or any similar situation. As a male ISFJ, I'm learning that these are things I have serious struggles with."
5382,isfj,"As /u/avelaera wrote, I have a very hard time letting go until they do something that I just cannot handle in whatever way -- and then I am 100% gone.
I have a few relationships I have let slip away, and I have serious regrets about them. Would have dreams my friend came and found me (after years of not talking) and sat next to me etc, woke up crying.
On the flip, once I was done with my first relationship and I had left him -- I felt so relieved and was moved on instantly I think (although I did spend about half a year in a weird limbo of not really loving him but unsure of how to break up and he guilted me intensely -- so that made moving on past the break up a lot easier probably).
Best of luck to you, OP."
5383,isfj,"I'm working through this at the moment. I fell in love with an ENFP (at least that is what she tested) and we were seeing each other for a little bit. I could feel something change between us suddenly and I knew it was coming but I chose to believe that we could still be together. 
It is fine between us but I am having a little trouble moving on. The part of me which loves her doesn't want to let go because I have so many good feelings and memories associated with her that I don't want to just fade away. But I guess they will and that's what makes me sad. "
5384,isfj,"I have a slight ambiversion to isfj, (predominantly Esfj) but I lean more toward that side of my personality upon reflection and regret.
First and foremost, what caught me up was not being properly trained to embrace my own passions. I was often ridiculed for having different views on social norms and would often times revert to dominating conversations with tones and body languages. I had seen many people use this technique and hand have incredible results unconsciously and began to emulate it. (Namely my father)
Second, I made the mistake of thinking that the people I care for most would never have conflict with me. I clashed with religion, insecurity, and trying to be too good of a person because that is what made me feel good a bout myself despite being raised around of selfish (but good deep down) people.
Third, I never got past the fact that I couldn't count on my family to keep their word and raise me to even get a driver's license because I had somehow managed to establish an alpha status by wanting to take care of everybody. My tone and body language gave an aura of false confidence that they all followed and I managed to bury myself in a hole with no true emotional support or societal guidance. I was a boy trying to play a man's game.
Fourth, I realized that by not following through on these values, I was becoming everything I never thought I would be and hated. I never ended up instilling my own set of personal values and identity. 
Dominating a conversation with tone and body language only brought me pain and heart ache because I was attracted to people like myself who sought only to be understood and valued. I came out for the attention that I deserved as a child from people that I simply didn't connect with on a more personal not.
Like a child I wanted to be love as an up and coming teen. Now as a self aware man, I want to be loved, hated, feared, and respected for standing for who I truly am, and the principles in which I will always be continuously fighting for.
If you skim through that read this:
Embrace your passions to the fullest, talk to a counselor and seek out other like minded people and connect. It takes seven good thoughts to cancel out one bad thought so the more people that you have to smile with and make smile, the stronger your courage to face conflict and embrace your passions will become.
if you don't do this, then the people who hold people like us down, will continue to, because we have been molded at such a young age to believe that we deserve to be punished. 
Stand up, be proud of who you are, seek personal development and like minded people, embrace conflict and stand by your principles so that people will learn to love, hate, fear, and or respect you. If you stay consistent with this and seek new experiences with different people, I promise that the challenges of being yourself will become goals to conquer.
Be well my friend. Feel free to message or video chat me. (mysticmseray @Skype.)"
5385,isfj,"I totally understand what you mean by ""that line."" In the past there have been times where I'm really hard on myself way too long after parting with someone and then it feels like I wake up one day and basically say to myself ""Would you look at that... I've moved on!"" It's a weird feeling, but it usually brings with it a huge wave of relief."
5386,isfj,"I'm so sorry to hear that... Thanks for the input. I'm in that same kind of situation where my girlfriend broke up with me almost eight months ago, yet the reasons I still can't get her out of my head is 1) we still actually maintain a pretty good friendship and have the same core group of friends, and 2) there were a lot of unknowns for me about why she broke up with me. The best way I can describe it is this: When she walked out the door, she didn't close it all the way.
I tend to have some days where I feel fine and  able to keep my mind off of her, yet there are still days where I fall back into this line of questioning and trying to understand the unkowns.
Thanks so much for your thoughts. I truly appreciate it and I'm wishing you the best!"
5387,isfj,"Thanks for that response. I think you make some really important points and it's good for people like us to not only hear someone else be honest and say these things, but for us to stand up and be honest with ourselves. Thanks
Edit: I just now realized how late I was to respond to this... My bad."
5388,isfj,"I get what your saying, but the issue for me with not remaining friends with her is that to effectively do that I would need to walk away from my friend group entirely. As I've said before we have the same core group of friends, so we spend a large amount of time together in social settings, so if we weren't able to remain friends it would probably create an incredibly awkward situation for both of us.
Thankfully it isn't awkward when we are together. Actually we have a pretty solid friendship. That just makes me wonder how we couldn't work things out if we get along so well."
5389,isfj,"INTJ here who has recently started dating an ISFJ. I'm absolutely fascinated by her for a huge many reasons. One of those reasons is that I feel like she has a great deal of depth to her life that she doesn't even recognize as being special, unique, or important. I will certainly ask as our relationship continues to grow what types of things are ideal for her, but I also recognize that it may take her some time to open up on a great many things including what she really wants in certain aspects since she may not know. We're both in our early 30's with good jobs and rich lives apart from each other, but I want to show her to the best of my ability currently that I care for her, or lust for her without being misunderstood or offensive while I patiently wait to get a better understanding of her as we spend time together.
What are the ways you most like to be shown that someone cares for you, loves you, or lusts for you?"
5390,isfj,"I'm an ENFP gal and my bf of 3 months is an ISFJ. I tell him I appreciate him all the time for the little things he does, like tuck me in at night and make me coffee in the morning. He says no one's ever told him that they appreciate him before. I notice he does a lot of ""thankless"" jobs for his family and work.
Also, I ask him if he wants time to play his games or work on his truck, etc. He spends most weekends with me and doesn't get to do a lot of things around the house while I'm there so I make sure he has time to do those things because he likes them. 
He told me that he likes to make me happy, even if it means he goes without something. I appreciate that but I care about his happiness too. I make sure his needs are met even if it's just washing the dishes after dinner or not talking during a movie even if I really want to. 
He's pretty easy to please. It was his birthday yesterday and I gave him a card with the logos of all the stores and restaurants we've been to since our first date photoshopped into a frame. I wrote him a poem too and he liked it and said no one's ever went to that much trouble or written something for him before. He didn't want a gift and said he'd be uncomfortable receiving one. My other ISFJ friend (a female) loves receiving gifts so I don't know if it's an ISFJ thing or just a personal preference.
We haven't been dating that long so I don't know the ins and outs of ISFJ relationships yet, but I hope some of that was helpful :)"
5391,isfj,"May it still be useful to answer this thread, I'll add my personal comment.
The fact that I'm a male ISFJ should not interfere that much, my mother being an ISFJ as well (so I have at least 1 example of both situations).
It seems that ISFJs very often have ""Acts of service"" as 1st 'outcoming' (emitting) love language. But please be aware that the love language we speak is not always the love language we best like to hear...
It seems that ISFJs often has ""Words of affirmation"" as preferred 'incoming' love language !
Which makes sense: ISFJs find natural to help, but most often don't expect the same in return. Anyway, we are often frustrated not to have at least a ""thank you"" answer, even if we often even don't really pay attention to that (because of the habit we have not to be thanked). And another thing is we are anxious, and need to be reassured constantly about our special SO's feelings and intentions.
So Words of affirmation comes 1st.
2nd seems to often be ""Physical touch"" (seems that we're often touchy-feely as soon as we're with in romantic relationship with SO, but this probably depends more on the person than the fact that ""Words of affirmation"" comes 1st). 
The rest is 'special bonus'.
""Acts of service"" could hit the top because this is ISFJ-type outcoming love language, the kind of things quite rare for ISFJ to obtain spontaneously (which then they don't hope from anyone, because of their reasonable expectations from other persons). 
But beware of the risk of not being able to deliver regularly ""Acts of service"" throughout the time of your relationship: ISFJs being generally passive-aggressive when they face relationship issues, you could pay a high price the degradation in your ""Acts of service"" ability... without seing it really come, or being able to read/interprete the signs of degradation of your relationship.
I think this trend is probably worse from ISFJ women.
Another thing that may be useful for you: traditionalist and/or religious ISFJs (which I'm not), more particularly women, seem to often think that their SO should know about their feelings and/or expectations without the need for them to say/explain anything. This is a classical flaw, but maybe more frequent for such persons (which is often the case for xNTJ persons, moreover). And there is absolutely NO obvious at all in life, specially in terms of feelings and expectations.
So I think it's specially important for you to prevent that by focusing on communication, which is quite critical due to the fact that you're both introverted, AND quite opposite in terms of cognitive functions (ISFJ=Si Fe Ti Ne, INTJ=Ni Te Fi Se) ! So there will be many communication issues, whatever you do !!
3 other things: 
_ISFJs take love and commitment very seriously. Don't take love easy or you'll break her heart for years.
_ISFJs value stability, courtesy, sometimes chivalry, traditional-type attentions. What is cheesy for others is often praised by ISFJs.
_If you offer her gifts, you'd be well inspired to choose them with a lot of sense, according to her intimate preferences/meaning. And for an ISFJ, something which can help them to deal with everyday life (her actual & personal everyday life) will have as much meaning as a romantic attention. So these would be the two leading types of appropriate gifts. You should find advice about this on the Internet.
I wish the best for both of you.
Pierre-Yves"
5392,isfj,"You treat your ISFJ well. 
As for the gift thing--I think he meant he didn't want you to go out and buy him something? I love receiving gifts but a thoughtfully written card means just as much, if not more, to me than a scarf or something material.
And I definitely love feeling appreciated altho I also can feel embarrassed for receiving compliments on things I feel I'm ""supposed"" to do - - I have to get used to my boyfriend thanking me for doing our laundry/dishes bc I see it as ""well someone had to do it, don't thank me for doing the necessary work that needed to be done."" 
I also love making my (INTJ) boyfriend happy however I can. I have actually asked him to ask me to do more small tasks for him (get him a glass of water, make him tea, etc) bc I like doing stuff like that as it makes me happy and he wasn't asking me enough on his own :P I wanted to feel more needed. "
5393,isfj,"Definitely. He said a card was the only thing he would be okay with so I said, ""Fine, I'm going to give you something with words."" hence the poem.
My love language is words of affirmation and I definitely express myself accordingly! He said he would be fine with no compliments and that it's a given to him that I like him if I'm with him... SO unlike me. He does compliment and give me affirmations though so I definitely feel liked and cared for. I think he does get a little embarrassed or confused as to why I'm thanking him for little things that need to be done though.
Aww!!! I definitely notice he likes doing things for me. He gets the door (even the car door), cooks, gets me water, makes sure the blanket is on the bed straight and he's not taking up all the room... He's really sweet. He told me he likes being counted on and needed too."
5394,isfj,"Hi everyone! I’ve been browsing through this subreddit for a bit because currently I’m an ENFP male pursuing an ISFJ female. I have to say a lot of the information I have read seems to be accurate. However, I’ve now come to a roadblock.
TL;DR at the bottom should anyone wants to skip the short description.
We have known each other for about 3 months now, we text everyday. I’ve previously confessed to her already, but she has mentioned she doesn’t feel comfortable yet and wishes to know each other as friends first, before moving on. Also, she has mentioned she doesnt feel comfortable going out with me 1-on-1 especially since she is really lazy to go out. She is only comfortable with meeting with me 1 on 1 for meals or studying (and it’s winter break now so, I can’t exactly ask her out to study). Just recently, she has refused to allow me to follow her private Instagram account (even went as far as to change the username after telling me the initial username), and refused to disclose the location of her new part-time job (I had suggested going there to see her). As far as I have read, this should mean she’s still fairly uncomfortable telling me stuff? 
TL;DR
ENFP male chasing ISFJ female. She texts me everyday and refused to allow me to follow her private instagram account. She also found a new part-time job and didnt want to tell me where it is. Is she still uncomfortable? 
PS: And also, while we were both messing around on her Tinder profile, on her phone, I noticed notifications (text) from 2 other different guys. 
Question: does her texting me everyday mean anything at all, considering she could be texting 2 other dudes on a daily basis anyway. Is her refusing to share details a sign she’s uncomfortable? And how do I proceed from here?"
5395,isfj,"We are very private people, so not sharing details with someone she doesn't know very well doesn't have to mean anything.. And I would not keep talking to someone I was not interested in.. But that might be just me. "
5396,isfj,"Yeah this is where I’m confused. I read that ISFJs talking to someone everyday might imply she has interest, or that we are fairly close by now. But then she wouldn’t let out certain details like this, which then throws me off."
5397,isfj,"Surprisingly, she has never dated before. But to clarify, she has a main instagram account which I’m following, and a private one where it’s meant for closer friends. As for the Tinder part, perhaps I could make myself clearer. So she unlocked her phone so we can both mess around on her Tinder. I happened to see texts coming in from 2 different guys. As in, normal texts on the iPhone (not tinder texts)"
5398,isfj,"Does she text you first? If she's always only replying to your daily texts, it's politeness. 
What do the texts say?
""haha""
""that's wild""
""you're silly""
""sorry, I JUST saw this""
"":)"" 
​
Those are all polite lines, in my experience."
5399,isfj,"But how could I possibly make progress from here since I can't ask her out to study, and it's hard to ask her out for meals either. Although she is still texting me daily (which I am unsure if it means anything), and I would only see her once a week."
5400,isfj,"There’s actually no one who texts each other first because the conversation just keeps on going. Granted, when the texts eventually comes to an end, i’m often the one throwing out a question or topic. I think the unwritten rule between us is basically, just reply. We would often happen to have a 10 - 30 minute session daily just to text back and forth, with little pauses. 
As for the texts, we would slightly banter with each other and I’d say we tend to tease each other? I’d make fun of her for certain stuff, and she’d turn it on me. The only issue is she doesn’t actively start a new topic when the conversation end. Even in real life when we hang out, I’m often the one asking her questions and teasing her. She just doesn’t seem to be comfortable taking the lead and talking. "
5401,isfj,"I see.. might be complex.. might be something that actually doesn't matter... I would ask her directly.. but not in a VERY direct way. just straightforward, but not too blunt..? maybe it has something to do with her, and not you?"
5402,isfj,"She doesnt do too well with confrontation about such stuff though, unfortunately. The last two times I approached her about my feelings, she got really stressed out in real life. But okay, thanks a lot for all the opinions!!"
5403,isfj,"We have been working on this server for almost a year now, and at the moment we are staying at the 100+ members. We want to branch out, and that's why we're posting this. You're all welcome, even if you don't know your type. https://discord.gg/csDt8Jg"
5404,isfj,"Maybe this is just a problem I'm having, but I feel like I get way more invested in a relationship than my partner is.
I kind of go overboard, and I know it's not healthy, but I don't know how to stop myself.
I sort of make my life revolve around them a little too much.
They enjoy the attention, but it becomes a huge problem if they don't feel the same way about me, or if they end things, because it feels like there's such a huge hole in my life when they're gone.
I do have hobbies and other things I enjoy in my life, but I really struggle to not let a relationship take over my life.
I end up thinking about them very frequently throughout the day, I put in a lot of effort to look nice for them and give them love, support and affection and gifts, and I start planning my future around them.
The big problem is that I tend to be drawn to types like INTPs.
And while they're wonderful people, they function very differently, so they never seem to have the same enthusiasm or commitment when it comes to the relationship, and it seems like I'm the one who hurts the worst when it ends.
Does anybody else struggle with this? What do relationships typically end up like for you guys?"
5405,isfj,"While this might not be a popular opinion around here, I just want to share my perspective. I'm an INTJ subbed to you guys because I want to understand my ISFJ SO better, but I just asked her about this topic and we are on the same page. I'm just as enthusiastic about her as she is about me, we focus on each other more than on anything else. I don't really find meaning in supporting others witt the exception of a special someone, so I channel all my attention to her and she is not scared away by this like my previous love interests, on the contrary she really enjoys it.
The point I'm trying to make is, and I'm by no means speaking on behalf of the entire NT population, I know there are a lot of loners, but there are people out there who will find your attitude the most attractive thing there is, so just keep an eye out."
5406,isfj,"Honestly, it is always the reverse for me. The men I have dated have always been more into the relationship than I have. I have always been the one who ended it. I know it is common for ISFJs to put their partners on a pedestal. I think the best thing you can do is take time for yourself to do things that interest you so you can spend time outside of the relationship bubble you have created. 
At the same time, the commitment and love that ISFJs often shower there partners with is also very respectable, there just needs to be a balance. "
5407,isfj,"This was how my first relationship was... A codependent mess on my part. It was very unhealthy for me. Where my life literally revolved around them (not accepting invites to go out with friends so I could stay home to talk to him, ignoring my mom bc she didn't accept him, picking a school close to him, giving him my money to gamble with,...) I was basically his robot that did whatever he asked and couldn't ever tell him no. 
In my current relationship, I have worked very hard to not be codependent yet still be very devoted to my boyfriend. I think my first relationship has made it difficult to ever reach that same level again. Which is fine by me. "
5408,isfj,I don't really have much to add you've summed up my experiences pretty well. Hobbies and friends are what I usually try to turn too but like you said relationships do tend to take over a bit as well. My personal thoughts on the matter are that my natural tendencies to want to support and help others all get focused onto one person. I can't speak for you but for myself I would find it almost unreasonable for someone else to meet me at that same level of involvement that I can get to. Trying to redistribute that level of involvement to not solely focus on your partner but to involve yourself with others is the best thing I've found to help. 
5409,isfj,"I am the same way for the most part. I tend to take things probably a little to far for my own good, especially with relationships. Like with my friends I'll bend over backwards to make them feel better when they're down to the point of smothering. It's even worse with relationships though, I'll drop everything I'm doing to make sure they get what the want and are comfortable. Of the women I have dated, all three ended up taking advantage of this or got abusive, but that's a story for another time haha. It's not easy to change, but I have taken time off from dating to work this smothering problem. Like DolphinShades has said, focusing on others and not just your partner is really helpful. I know you'll figure out what works for you, and remember to not be afraid of asking for help when you need it :)"
5410,isfj,"I think this might be because ISFJs don't open up and commit unless they're very sure and/or comfortable, and that means that if you never get there in the relationship you never really give 100% of yourself (which is the opposite situation).  I'm not really well-versed in personality theory but this is my own experience."
5411,isfj,"Similar for me.. my ex-boyfriend was very dependent and constantly gave me/needed attention and since I was comfortable with him it simply easier to make my life revolve around him rather than expend energy meeting new people. In the long-run it just wasn't healthy and didn't align with what I really wanted in life. Now, I do still crave intimacy with another person but I definitely want to avoid the pitfall of becoming dependent on each other and no life outside of the romantic relationship"
5412,isfj,"In the past I have received the results INFP and INTJ/P. I went through all of the types and ISFJ feels right. I dunno 100 percent though. Here are some random insights into who I am. 
I am very withdrawn. I am married, have been with husband for 12 years, married for two. I am very passionate and romantic person and work very hard on my relationship. Husband is equally introverted but we are just as in love as we were then and its beautiful.
I have had very few friends in life. I have trouble trusting people though and have been used in the past.  I rarely show my emotions. Inside I am constantly battling self doubt. People say I am very kind.  I dont have it in me to be mean even when wronged. I get hurt very easily but don't let it show. I come off as cold and emotionless and I believe I have social anxiety. Despite this I am happy with my life. I am hardworking and ambitious but deep down I feel really stupid. I suck at conversations and people have described me as a robot cos I am not quick witted and struggle to find the words to say. Part of this is that my mind is always racing and I cant seem to slow it down. 
Does anyone else have similar experiences? I think my inability to handle social situatuons has hindered me from getting jobs I want and things like that. I plan on going into teaching because I want to help others but I am scared of the interaction aspect. I think it is something I could excel in."
5413,isfj,"A lot of this sounds like me and my mom and we're both ISFJs, so I would say it's well within the realm of possibility that you are, too. 
My recommendation will always be to do some research on cognitive functions if you really wanna be sure, though. The mbti-notes tumblr has some good, quality guides on figuring out your type via the cognitive functions and explaining cognitive function theory, although they're a bit of a heavy read sometimes. Or you could probably just google it, but I can't vouch for the quality of any of the sources you'll find. There's a lot of bullshit out there about mbti lol."
5414,isfj,"Ok it says lead is introverted feeling (Fi) and auxilliary is extraverted sensing (Se). I will try and find out more about what that means. My highest score after Fi was actually introverted sensing so I don't really know how the aux function is determined. Of the two, lead and aux is one always introverted and the other extraverted?"
5415,isfj,"Tests generally aren't considered very reliable measures of type though, which is why I suggested looking up the cognitive functions. Even if it's a cognitive functions test, sometimes the wording can be so weird or narrow that it completely throws people off and sways their results. "
5416,isfj,"That's interesting that Fi was your highest...I thought Fe would be higher since you say you do no harm to others even when they harm you. That's a very Fe thing. Fi is so passionate about their beliefs that they would find it really difficult to keep the harm from others buried. It might help to ask yourself why you keep your feelings to yourself. Are you afraid they would make others uncomfortable? That fear is certainly Fe. Fi would not care much if their feelings were not well received by others.
Plus you want to teach and know you'd be good at it! Another sign of Fe, in my opinion."
5417,isfj,"I keep my feelings to myself so I dont get hurt, I guess. And yes I would love to teach but I'm also looking into a program to become a therapist so I'm kind of torn between the two. I also thought INFJ is a possibility. Is Fi their dominant function? I scored high on Fi and next was Si with everything else being average or below average. I read a lot of posts about differences between INFJ and ISFJ but both sound like me...,
Nevermind, I see that INFJ has Ni as their dominant function"
5418,isfj,"I would just say that tests are not great at figuring out who you are. It's way more effective to either ask others about your behaviors or look at the types of functions and make your own conclusions. We are quite bad at evaluating things for ourselves IMO, so if you know anyone who can evaluate your external tendencies, you absolutely should. Your external behaviors are way more telling of your personality than your own personal thoughts!"
5419,isfj,"It's useful info as long as you know about the bias.. How X view Y without knowing much about MBTI is good data, you then know how you are perceived, pitfalls, what to work on, what not to do, your strengths..."
5420,isfj,"reminds me of this article i read recently about fixed or growth mindsets. where is says that if we are in a fixed mindset, we kind get of stuck examining and asking ourselves ""are we good enough""? or ""is that person good enough""?  while in a growth mindset we focus learning and changing and in turn decrease judgmental thoughts.

5421,isfj,"Hey ISFJs! 
I have a movie date with someone I'm 99% sure is an ISFJ. Although tonight is more Netflix and chill, it got me thinking. What movies do ISFJs like? Movies that captivate you and make you want to talk about and analyze them afterwards.
I was thinking maybe the Before series (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight), Mysterious Skin, Cloud Atlas, Waking Life, Perks of Being a Wallflower. 
So, what am I missing? What are your favorite movies?  
Edit: Thanks for your replies! I have a lot more options for next time now :)"
5422,isfj,"I came to the conclusion I don’t like any movies at all, they just make me lose time.
But when is indispensable to watch, I enjoy more movies who makes me think about life and the people relations, because like this I don’t think my time is being wasted.
Although a few times I like watching non-sense cartoons just to bring a little bright to my days 😊 "
5423,isfj,"I have not watched any of the ones you listed, but have heard good things about the last one (the perks of being a wallflower). Maybe I wouldn't go for waking life, it seems it could turn very dense/complicated, although is in my list.
I love all kinds of movies, but maybe I would recommend for an ISFJ movies with a style like Her or Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. I recently watched ""Three billboards outside ebbing, Missouri"", which was an amazing movie and it gets you hooked from the beginning, so it may be an option too. "
5424,isfj,"Ok. I wonder if I’m just out the ordinary here, but I love going through horror films if you’re hoping to talk them over at the end and snuggle all the way through. The good ones pose serious personal questions and leave you with resolution, not necessarily closure though. Like the babadook (i get it, it’s controversial) but if you recognize the antagonist as her depression and inability to let go, you can certainly dwell on that for a while. Or many religious horrors ask questions about the nature of God, how could he let this happen type deal. There’s also cosmic horror like The Void, forcing us to broaden our scope of understanding beyond just our petty issues by letting the antagonist reside beyond our mortal and physical plane, with the goal of pulling us out there too. 
But if you’re looking for lovey dovey stuff, there are plenty of romantic comedies to enjoy. Like my BF and I just watched Why Him and I loved it! He’d already seen it and, like any good ISFJ, took the opportunity to snuggle me while watching it on and off making sure that I enjoyed it. 
If an ISFJ wants you to watch a movie they’ve already seen, it’s because they want to be with you. They want to know what parts to gauge your reactions at, when to mimic quotes, when they can nuzzle without missing anything. If you want an ISFJ to watch a movie, they’re gonna be aware of how they would pitch a movie your way and they’re gonna try to be fully attentive to you and the movie at once. If you know what you like and can engage the ISFJ about it, they’ll be all over it and you. You just gotta bring something you’re passionate about and your energy will fuel them.
If they’re up for it, take your ISFJ through cloud atlas and watch for reaction and realization. I loved that absolute shit out of that mind ‘splosion. "
5425,isfj,"Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, The Godfather, The Dark Knight, Star Wars, Monty Python and the Holy Grail....
I guess I'm not super into ""think-y"" movies. Probably the one that comes closest to that would be Inception."
5426,isfj,"I'm more of a horror junkie, buuuut...
In the past few years, movies I've watched that have really stood out and had me pondering for a few days: ""Room"" and ""Inside Out!"" I cried through at leat half of each of those. 
EDIT: Realize this thread is 14 days old... meh, choices for next time ;P"
5427,isfj,"Specifically, when going for new things. Recently I’ve found that I get very nervous to the point where I’m almost sick to my stomach when I’m anticipating newness. Whether it’s going to a new place, applying/interviewing for a new job position, or having a new experience in general. Overthinking is a problem for me. Unfortunately, there have been many missed opportunities because of this and I’m wondering, do you all experience this as well? And what do you do to get yourself out of it? "
5428,isfj,"Cleaning helps me to calm down when I’m feeling anxious or overwhelmed. It’s harder for me to deal with things when things are a mess so I start cleaning, sometimes without even realizing I’m doing it. "
5429,isfj,"I will overthink like you mention to the point of discomfort in my stomach, head or body. Then I do as I have always and think my way out of it. Usually I throw the risk of not doing x or if I don’t achieve x is it really that bad? Or there are more chances later. But if it’s a one in an lifetime and I kick the can too far I have a resentment moment and try to get that back."
5430,isfj,"I do the same. I get that twisty feeling in my gut and have trouble relaxing. One thing that has helped me is having my one “person” I can talk to without judgment. Sometimes getting it out of my head and into words helps me process, and having someone else’s support (even if I don’t need their advice) feels helpful."
5431,isfj,"I recently moved across the country to be with my SO and it was ROUGH. Everything was so new and getting settled took longer than I thought it would, and I overthought everything to the point I worried I made a huge mistake and would never feel at home. But affirmations from my friends and SO helped the most. I had to force myself to share what I was feeling when it was less than great, and my support system really helped me see things were better than I assumed. Also, keeping things tidy and having a good soundtrack kept me sane through the transition."
5432,isfj,"Overpreparing. For example, writing a script before getting on a phone call that is making me nervous. Or googling the hell out of a new place/experience. The more familiar I am with something the more I thrive in that scenario, which obviously isn't possible with new experiences. So at least researching can help me feel a bit prepared for the unknowns. 
Another thing, sometimes I get the nervous feeling even for experiences that I have had repeatedly. Putting on a go-to comforting outfit helps (one that I know I feel great in/doesn't make me feel too 'new'). "
5433,isfj,"I always rationalize what I'm thinking when my I'm going into overdrive with worries (for example, if my inferior Ne is giving me negative possibilities, I'll quickly remind myself of why something like that just isn't possible to calm myself down.)  I don't know why, but I like to think out loud when I'm nervous, but I always do this in private - developing a full understanding of what I'm saying and what I mean always helps me feel better.  It helps me feel like I have control over my emotions, which I like."
5434,isfj,"One thing that helps a lot is when I ask my partner or a friend to read me a fairy tale or a short story that's engaging. I have a pile of folk tales books for this very purpose.
Also, when stress is work-related, I cut down my task in smaller manageable ones and do them in sequential order. I'm a translator, so for instance if I'm stressed out by a big text, I cut it down in 200 word bits and I make a doodle every time I finish one. One after the other, slowly but surely, and it's not overwhelming any more."
5435,isfj,"I certainly do experience the same kinds of anxiety. One thing that might help is doing a little research on whatever you're planning on doing. Maybe watch some videos of people doing those things. 
Another great tool is mindfulness meditation. I especially like meditating on gratitude because when you're truly thankful, it's harder to get carried away by negative emotions.
Hope this helps!"
5436,isfj,Oh! Yeah that is weird huh. Didn’t think about that. I check Facebook messenger before I go to sleep to message back my one or two friends I talk to regularly there. And reply to any messages from my mom. It’s a daily thing I guess mainly so they know I’m alive. 
5437,isfj,"I just finished Parks and Rec and cried super hard at the finale. Now I’m trying to find something to fill the void. I’ve been watching Derry Girls, Great British Baking Show: New Beginnings, and RuPauls Drag Race: All Stars 4. Nothing compares to the wholesome, feel-good comedy of Parks and Rec though..."
5438,isfj,"I'm watching The Office (currently in season 6), The Haunting of Hill House (creepy but amazing), The good place (lighthearted/fun but slightly philosophical), The Sinner season 2, Black Mirror (if watching the special episode counts)and Terrace House (japanese reality show)."
5439,isfj,"I'm really, really getting into Old Simpsons. It seems like watching seasons 1-10 fill me with a sense of nostalgia, even though I have never watched the seasons before. There's just such a heartwarming feeling to the episode, and you can really understand just how much the writers cared for the show and the characters."
5440,isfj,"OKAY I saw The Defenders but thought the ending with Matt and Elektra was kind of BS. I was also in the middle of Jessica Jones s2 binging but it became hard to watch.
Right now I’m rewarching Reign for Anna Popplewell (Lady Lola INFJ in Reign, Susan Pevensie ISFJ in Narnia).
I also recently finished Titans on DCU Streaming, every episode was pretty good but the finale was too messed up for me.
Hmm.... then saw Aquaman last night. Gotta rewatch! The scenery and graphics were beautiful, took me to many different worlds in one sitting."
5441,isfj,"Is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions? For example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances? Other useful information includes sex, age, and current state of mind.
Female, 22, currently relaxed.
Describe yourself as a person if you were to introduce yourself to someone else like in a cover letter. What kind of person are you and why?
I don’t know what I’d say in an actual cover letter if I were introducing myself, so I’m just going to describe myself. I’m easygoing, really relaxed most of the time, hardly get stressed or worried about things, and I love to enjoy life. I’m pretty lazy and I’m hard to motivate. Even if I want to do something like lose weight, it’s hard for me to actually get motivated and dedicate time and effort into losing weight, partially because I really love food. I don’t have life goals, I have no idea what I want to do in the future, and I’m not an ambitious person. I’m easy to get along with, can converse about many topics so I guess I’m pretty open-minded, and I like to keep things peaceful. Because I’m all about peace and comfort, I don’t like doing things out of my comfort zone and I’m very conflict-averse. I’m accommodating, have a hard time making any of my own decisions or taking initiative, and I’m an agreeable person. I typically either have strong opinions or no opinion at all (or not really). I’m extremely materialistic, have a hard time saving money, and I’m interested in anything aesthetically pleasing including fashion or anything beauty related, photography, and interior design. I’m not a risk taker, like stability and security, and have a good memory for detail. I’m ethical, reserved, shy, and it’s hard for me to get close to people and feel comfortable with them to the point where I’d open up or express my feelings to them. I’m pretty bad at dealing with people who are being emotional to me. I’m kind of a follower as opposed to a leader and I’m very passive and easily taken advantage of. 
What were you like as a child? Think about how you were in school, with friends, and at home with your family.
As a child, I was friendly and active; I liked playing sports as a child, but now I’m very physically inactive. In the classroom, I was a good student, but I was also quiet and hardly ever participated. A lot of my friends in school enjoyed bullying me, not because they thought something was wrong with me, but because they just thought it was fun to hit me or pick on me since I never did anything back to them and never spoke up for myself. At home with my family, I was helpful; I used to help my mom with chores a lot, and she said that I was fast with my hands, but that I’m now too slow. When I was still in elementary, I enjoyed going outside and traveling to random places with my siblings even though we had no idea where we were going. I wasn’t that obedient to my parents at home. I still did unsafe activities even though I was told not to, such as go out into the streets alone. 
What kind of person would you LIKE to be? Why? What kind of person would you NOT want to be? Why?
I’d like to be someone who’s kind, but able to stand up for themselves and speak up when necessary because I admire people like this. I also want to be someone who has their future envisioned and who are passionate about things because I’m not a passionate person and I have no future dream. I want to be someone who’s artistic and good at writing because even though my writing skills aren’t bad, I want to be even better. I also want to know how to draw really well. I want to be someone who has their shit together/planned out, and is achieving enough to actually go after what they want because those people work hard and have the motivation that I lack. 
I don’t want to be someone who’s unethical and selfish because I don’t like those kind of people. Those people who go after what they want at any means necessary without being concerned about how it’ll affect other people annoy me. I don’t want to be someone who’s only concerned about money. I wouldn’t want to be someone who’s excessively pessimistic, worrying about things that could go wrong, and complaining all the time because they drain my energy and annoy me. I also don’t want someone who’s rude and lacks manner or someone who’s aggressive, competitive, and controlling. 
Do you think there are any differences to how you described yourself and how people actually perceive you? How do you think others would describe you? If there are any discrepancies between these two that are you are aware of; do you know why exactly that is?
For the most part, I believe the way I described myself is how people perceive me. One discrepancy is that people see me as lazier than I actually am because most of my friends are friends I made back in high school, and that was when I was so lazy to the point where it was too much. In high school, I didn’t care about my grades at all and I all I did was enjoy life and disregard my responsibilities like homework and studying. I’m a lot less lazy than I once was before. People also underestimate my intellect; a lot of my friends think I’m a bit dumb, but I’m actually not. Others would describe me as chill, funny, a spender, open-minded, shy, a pushover, slow-paced, too agreeable, nice, helpful, and friendly. They would also describe me as a homebody, lazy, easily irritated, indecisive, and two-faced. A long time ago, many people thought I was a big mouth who liked to gossip too much.
What in life do you find to be of importance? Why?
I believe it’s important to be happy and stress-free in life. I don’t think people should overwork themselves too much or expect too much out of life just in case they end up struggling to meet those expectations and as a result, get stressed out and/or unhappy. I believe it’s important to just do what makes you happy otherwise you’ll live a life you won’t really like, and you might end up regretting the path you took because you aren’t living life how you prefer to live it. To me, happiness is more important than things like money or status. I also believe it’s important to treat others how you want to be treated, and to not deceive people.
How do you react to new situations in your life? Can you describe an event in your life where you were in an unknown situation? How did you deal with it?
I don’t adapt to change as quickly or easily as I’d like to. I feel like it might be because I’ve become so comfortable and situated in a situation I’m already used to, and that makes me more hesitant to change. That along with not knowing what to expect. If the new situation isn’t anything too big (traveling, trying a new activity, etc) I’m fine with it for the most part. However it’s kind of bad if it’s something like a new job or anything that involves waiting to know what the outcome will be (good or bad). I was put in an unknown situation when I started working a completely different job, and I disliked not knowing how I’d end up performing after training, which was hard for me. Because of that, I quit during training. Another situation was when my family and I moved into a new house. For that, I reacted and adapted pretty well. I did prefer my old home, but it was easy for me to get used to living in the new house. 
Please describe yourself when you are in a stressful situation. How do you act and why?
When I’m stressed, I’m more easily irritated and prefer others to not bother me. Besides that, I don’t really know because I don’t catch myself stressed out that often. I guess I’m also more impulsive and irrational when I’m stressed out, and want to make hasty choices without thinking clearly first. 
Describe your relationship to socialization. How do you perceive one-on-one interaction? How do you perceive group interaction?
I’m okay with socializing if it isn’t for too long because if it’s too long, I start to get tired. One on one interactions are nice if I’m comfortable with the person and they’re easy to talk to, but if not then I prefer group interaction. Actually just in general, I prefer group interaction because I can listen more than speak whereas in a one to one interaction, it’s always a back and forth exchange between me and the other person. If I’m not involved in the interaction though, I find one on one interactions more appealing because they seem more intimate and from an outside perspective, it would seem like the two people have a really strong connection. However for me personally, I’d rather be involved in a group interaction. 
Describe your relationship to society. What are the elements of it you hold important or unimportant (e.g. social norms, values, customs, traditions)? How do you see people as a whole?
I'd say that most social norms, values, customs, and traditions are okay, but I don't care whether or not they should be kept or followed. However there are some social norms and etc that I don't particularly agree with. I don't have much of an opinion on people as a whole. I guess some people are cool whereas some people are annoying. One thing I always think is that people should stop trying so hard to be who they aren't to the point where they'd do something like act rude to others just because their friends are like that. I feel like many people make things complicated when they don't have to be. Other than all of that, I actually don't pay that much attention to society or anything.
Describe your relationship to authority. How do you perceive authority? What does it mean to you, and how do you deal with it?
I don’t really like authority because many people abuse the power they have. I also dislike authority because I feel like people should treat everybody equally, so I don’t find things like authority, hierarchy, and power appealing. Even if I was in a position of power, I don’t think I’d want to exercise it. In terms of my relationship, I listen to those in authority even if I don’t want to just in case something bad happens to me if I don’t obey them. 
Describe your relationship to order and chaos. What do order and chaos mean to you? How do they manifest in your daily life?
I don’t have much of an opinion on order, but I dislike chaos because I like having at least a little bit of control over my situation just so things don’t go out of hand and turn super chaotic, which would be hard for me to deal with.
What is it that you fear in life? Why? How does this fear manifest to you both in how you think and how you act?
I don’t have any strong fears, but I guess I would say that I fear conflict because it’s hard for me to deal with and because I don’t want to make enemies with anyone since it would feel so awkward if I have to see them, knowing that we got into some issues and dislike each other. It’s also just something that makes me uncomfortable. This manifests in how I think and act in that I fear conflict to the point of not standing up for myself even for the simplest things ever, and I can’t even speak up when I know it’s necessary to. Other than that, I also fear public speaking because I hate attention and feeling like people are possibly judging me for either how I look/sound or how my presentation is. 
What is it that you desire in life? What do you strive to achieve? Why? Where do you think these drives and desires stem from or are inspired by?
I desire a happy, relaxed life as well as my ideal appearance. I desire all the designer items on my wishlist. I also desire stability and financial security. I don’t know what I strive to achieve lol.
What activities energize you most? What activities drain you most? Why?
The activities that energize me most include listening to music, watching shows and movies, eating good food, being on the computer, and relaxing at home. The activities that drain me the most include being out for too long, being in crowded areas, listening to someone talk excessively without giving me a turn to reply, and anything too physically active. 
Finally, is there something else you find to be of importance you want to add about yourself you think might be of relevance when helping to type you?

My enneagram is 9w1 SP, tritype 269 I think (not in that order). 
My temperament is phlegmatic and sanguine
I’m not nice or helpful because I care about other people or want them to be happy, but because I either feel obligated to help, want to avoid conflict/haters, or feel like I should be doing something (like holding the door for others, etc) because it’s the right thing to do. 
I’m good at reading other people’s motives and usually pick up vibes about their character when first meeting them. 
I dress for appearance, not for comfort
I’ve been through a lot of phases in life such as a preppy phase, a gothic phase, a tomboy phase, a scene phase, and stuff like that when I was in my teen years. 

Types I'm stuck between: ISFP and ISFJ
Results from similarminds cognitive functions test: highest percent is Si followed by Fi, Se, Fe, Ni, Te, Ne, then Ti."
5442,isfj,"I would say ISFP because the emphasis on physical experiences/sensations and appearance sounds more like Se than Si to me, and I get and Fi vibe from your answers about social norms and interaction. There's a lot of ""I agree with/disagree with"" which reads more Fi to me? "
5443,isfj,"I think you're probably ISFP rather than ISFJ. I think ISFJs don't tend to struggle as much with motivation, and while we're easy going... I don't think people really describe us as lazy.
Also in terms of what you were saying about authority and traditions doesn't quite track.
I also picked up on what you said about getting the chance to reply.. that sounds a bit more Fi to me."
5444,isfj,"What would the typical ISFJ answer be about social norms and interaction? 
I've been leaning more towards ISFP lately, but the only thing that has been throwing me off is Si. I dislike change, new experiences, and I'm really risk averse. I also use my past experience for present and future situations. I like stability, knowing what to expect, and security.
Could it be my enneagram or other factors such as lifestyle that makes me like this? Because I do feel like I'm more Fi than Fe, but my stack clearly can't consist of both Si and Fi being high lol
Thanks "
5445,isfj,"Haha it was more middle school to high school, but yeah I also don't really know ISFJs who have gone through different phases.

Thanks "
5446,isfj,"Yeah that's true haha. Even if an ISFJ is enneagram 9, they probably wouldn't struggle too much with motivation right?
What would an ISFJ's answer be about authority and traditions? 
Do you mind clarifying the ""getting the chance to reply"" part? I'm not exactly sure which part of my post you're talking about lol

Thanks "
5447,isfj,"Idk, I can't tell you the ""typical"" ISFJ answer but I know for me it's almost always about what will make other people the most comfortable and happy. I'm very concerned with accommodating others and making sure their efforts are appreciated, even if I don't actually enjoy the outcome, that kind of thing. 
I get really uncomfortable if people want me to do things really differently than I'm used to, but what I'm used to may or may not be ""normal,"" so it's not the appearance that I'm concerned with so much as the breaking of routine. 
I don't have any attachment to particular social norms, and there are ones I hate a lot because I think they're hurtful to others, but I do prefer that people I'm having short interactions with follow the ""script"" and not get too creative, because it throws me off and makes me confused and anxious; people who try to make jokes while I'm ringing them up, for example. 
That does sound more like Si, though; do you score high on 6 for enneagram? I'm 9w1 as well but 6 tends to be a close second. There are definitely factors that MBTI can't account for though, because MBTI is really just about how you take in and process information. People like to assign stereotypes, but it's just based on two sets of judging and two sets of perceiving functions lol. But it also can't account for things like mental illness or the environment you grew up in, which can impact the way you think and behave compared to others who share your type. 
Tbh though if you don't mind the recommendation, I'd say go take a look at the mbti-notes tumblr. They have a lot of guides and analyses that were really helpful when I was trying to figure out if I was ISFJ or INFJ, maybe they'll be useful to you, too! "
5448,isfj,"Here's a sneak peek of /r/mbti using the top posts of the year!
1: As an ENFJ, I feel like I've adopted a lot of introverts. | 51 comments
2: Not sure if this is a repost but I thought it was funny | 50 comments
3: ENTP in one image | 42 comments

^^I'm ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| ^^Contact ^^me ^^| ^^Info ^^| ^^Opt-out"
5449,isfj,"Of course, both of those things have an effect on how your functions manifest. I'm about 65 percent sure I am 9w1, and I am definitely ISFJ.
My ISFP coworker is not hugely big on change. For example, she has no desire to experiment with new foods. She'll get the same things over and over. 
But, when it comes to other things, she's just flying by the seat of her pants. She's not anxious about much, and she doesn't do a whole lot of planning, except in creative things. (She loves planning her daughter's birthday parties, and goes all out.)
I think everybody uses their past experiences for present and future situations. It's just a matter of how they use it, and how much weight they give it.
To answer your reply to somebody's else's comment, with authority and traditions, an Si might be more attached to traditions. It hurts me when my INTP boyfriend goes on a bent about doing something just for the sake of always having done it, but to me, Christmas traditions and going to the fair every year are a part of me.  
As regards authority, an Si might think, ""We do this because so and so told us to do it, and it's my responsibly to obey so and so in authority."""
5450,isfj,"So is the reason why you accommodate others even if you don't enjoy the outcome because you want other people to feel happy and comfortable? Because I'm also really accommodating, but my reason isn't about making them happy unless I really like them; it's to avoid conflict and hate, both of which make me feel uneasy/awkward/uncomfortable. 
Oh okay I see what you mean lol. I wouldn't say I score that high on enneagram 6, but I do score higher on it than most other numbers. However the score mostly derives from security, loyalty, and skepticism/reading motives. I'm pretty much never anxious or worrying about things nor do I need support/guidance for most things. Perhaps it's the 6 in my fix that makes me seem more Si-like? Along with other factors unrelated to MBTI. 
I'll definitely take a look into mbti-notes' tumblr more. I've briefly looked over the page before, but wasn't conflicted about my type at that point in time lol "
5451,isfj,"Oh I see. Yeah I'm totally up for trying new food for the most part as long as I know what the food is, but not that interested in trying other new things like jobs and activities like clubbing. How are you with trying new things?
So how do you and other ISFJs usually use past experiences for present and future situations? 
Oh haha there are some traditions I grow accustomed to that become a part of me, but I'm guessing they're more important and stuff for Si users right?
I always listen to what authority figures tell me to do just in case I get in trouble, but I'd be doing it while getting mad in my mind and/or disagreeing with their choices, just not vocally because I'm not brave enough to express disagreements haha. I don't know if this is something a lot of ISFJs can relate to? "
5452,isfj,"Pretty much! It makes me really happy to feel like I've helped someone or made them happy, although if I can't manage that much I do still prefer to avoid awkwardness/hurt feelings at the very least. I generally have to work to set boundaries for myself and not accidentally make myself miserable because my natural instinct is to volunteer to help people and do things for them to make their lives easier and more enjoyable, and I also really love it when people do those things for me. 
Maybe so, though! Another thought is, have you looked at your inferior function? That can also help a lot; Si is really easy for me to identify in myself, but Ne is also a really obvious factor in my life in the negative sense. I'm very easily frightened because scary images or ideas get into my head and then I spend forever ""what if""-ing, I worry any time my parents go out because I start thinking of all the things that could go wrong, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, etc. That's my inferior Ne talking, because I'm great at going ""what if"" but I only make use of it when I'm stressed or goofing off lol. 
I would encourage you to do so though! Even if you don't read all of their really heavy, analytical stuff (which can admittedly be hard to get through) I found their posts on identifying your functions really great and helpful! "
5453,isfj,"Wow that's great lol; I'm glad you care about making other people happy! Do you enjoying helping everybody whether they're close to you or a stranger? 
I have! I don't really relate to inferior Ne, which is one of the reasons I began questioning my type. I always thought I had Si and  I could kind of identify with some of Fe, but I definitely don't identify with inferior Ne. I was always thinking, well how could I be Si dom then? Haha. I feel like I don't relate that well with inferior Te either (maybe to like... half of the description), but I do relate to it much more than inferior Ne. 
That sounds pretty intense; I'd probably have such a hard time coping lol. I hope you don't get stressed out too often then!
Yup I'll look into the page more in depth soon. Thanks for the help :)"
5454,isfj,"You are probably just an INFP. From what I read, you are using Fi and Ne. Fi in the way you are able to describe and understand yourself. Ne from the way you see the world in your own way. Si because you acknowledge that people view the world in another way. 
I could be wrong here. I would narrow it down to IXFP, but not so sure on the I, because Ne types are known to mistype themselves as introverts. As far as Se goes, they are more likely to take in the world for what it is and then bend the rules; verses questioning it and acknowledging like Ne types do. 
ISFPs I have met don't seem to care about other people's feelings as much as INFPs I have met. As an ENTP, I noticed this with ESTPs too. They don't seem to really care about how others feel as much. It could be that Ne Si vs Se Ni."
5455,isfj,"Hmm it's possible but a little weird seeing how I always score low on Ne when INFPs have Ne second in their stack haha. I've gotten many IXFP answers before, which I'm starting to believe now. It's just that I don't relate all that well to a few stereotypical Fi traits (cold, melancholic, self-absorbed, etc) 
Thanks!"
5456,isfj,"I often finding myself holding onto things that people have said or done to me from forever ago because I’m still hurt by it and, being the isfj I am; take everything personally and just can’t let it go, even if I want to. 
So how do you find peace with such situations and let go of people or things they’ve said about you?"
5457,isfj,"Well as much as it is hard to do that, theyre not worth it and karma will just take care of them 😊
It's just no use sitting around and playing the past scenes ya know. Sometimes i remember and dont give a sht and sometimes i remember and replay those scenes until i get sad again. I dont know but my brain is just strange
Well what goes around comes around"
5458,isfj,"Honestly it takes me a long time to do this. But you just have to know and accept that those people and things aren’t doing anything for you or your mental health. Time heals everything. Step back, breathe, focus on yourself, and things fall into place how they should."
5459,isfj,"i have 3 main techniques for different situations that i mix and match or go back and forth between to diffuse hurt. they're kind of long. and maybe a little crazy sounding. and all of them were very difficult to get to and learn how to live with.
1) i try to understand where the person is coming from. how they think, what they fear, what they know, what they don't know. not everyone is privy to the same experiences as me and not everyone can understand what i am concerned about. 
someone could be rude or offensive or hurt me simply because they didn't have the experience to teach them not to do so. or maybe they come from a place where that is not hurtful? or they could come from a place where they never learned to see or adjust how they interact with others. 
if i was born into their body, with their genes, with their upbringing, and experienced everything they experienced, and lacked all the experiences they never had, I would be exactly them and do what they did. In a way, people doing dumb stuff is like when a child of 4 decides to spit at you. Yeah, it's rude. Yeah it's wrong. They didn't know any better. We just have to understand how little difference there is between a few months of experience and a life time's worth can be. Everyone is a child in their own way.
2) i think about how pointless life is. and how there is no inherent meaning in anything. and how short our time alive is in the infinity of the universe. and how time spent being upset is a waste of the few moments I have before my life blinks out of existence. and that I have here and now to give my life, my brief moments of consciousness, any meaning/purpose/enjoyment. focus on things i love, things i want to do, or want to achieve instead. and let my love and purpose and happiness heal the pain/hurt from my identity.
3) last one is an extension of the previous ones. i think about the study on a bunch of guys that all were delusional and all thought they were Jesus Christ. And they were all studied together and got to interact with one another. They each thought the other was crazy while still maintaining they they themselves were Jesus. And i see how, other then their identity, they're perfectly sane and act perfectly sane. 
Just like I think I'm poolboywax. I create the narrative that defines my identity. I can weave a problem i face into a story arc where I learn and grow. I can weave my sadness into tragedy, where I am forced into a deep well of great despair with no escape. I choose who I am with how I choose to narrate my life's story to myself. It's all about perspective. 
Is this problem so hard that it feels like i'm standing at the edge of a cliff and I have to jump off? How do others just deal with it like they're casually walking down some steps? How do they perceive this in a way that's easy to them yet I find it so hard to me? How can I see it the same way as they do?
So I practice putting some time between the thoughts that arise from my feelings in order to not react right away. And then I can decide how I choose to react to them in order to define who I am. And in a way, it can help control the flow of thoughts. Instead of having my emotions lead the flow, I build a relationship with my thoughts to allow me to also guide them toward who I choose to be. and i choose to be someone who lets go of pain in order to lead a better life so my mind needs to think of other things."
5460,isfj,"As cliche as it sounds, time heals all wounds - be it grudges held, or heartbreak from previous relationships. It takes a long time for me, and I’m not sure if it’s just me, but I seem to have (intentionally or unintentionally) blocked out most of the events that has hurt me in the past. I still remember some of the things people did that hurt me deeply, but not all of them. For what it’s worth, this could be my coping mechanism."
5461,isfj,"It depends on the context for me. Someone may have been having a bad day and even though what they said may have left a mark on my soul, I'll try to balance the hurt with forgiveness. There's lots of things people have said to me and it was often because they were not taking care of their own emotional health, especially after stress from things like death, unemployment, electronic stress, love stress, etc. So I try to see it from their side too and forgive them.   
If you find you can't forgive something and it has crossed your boundaries, detach and let their own bad behavior come around and show their true colors, usually someone else or a situation will call them on what they are doing that is unacceptable. Besides if they've hurt me, they've probably hurt others similarly."
5462,isfj,I think it depends on how close the person was to me. For strangers I am quick to forgive and move on. For people that are extremely close to me I feel betrayed still. I am not sure how to “get past it” without letting those people back into my life.
5463,isfj,"I was struggling with this a little while back (made a post about it myself.)  For Si-dominants, and particularly ISFJ's, it can be really hard for us to get over things that have happened because we are guided by our past experiences.  Sometimes, letting go of a situation for me means looking at things in a larger than life way - if something has ended between us, or you've really hurt my feelings, something that helps me kind of bring myself back to a good place is remembering:

No matter what, I'll make new memories.  Right now it hurts.  Tomorrow it will hurt a little less.  One day, this won't even matter.  What seems big now is smaller than you think.  
The people that hurt you aren't better than you, and if you aren't in contact anymore, it's the best thing possible.
"
5464,isfj,"If someone does or says things just to hurt you, they don't deserve your consideration in any regard. You don't have time for that. If what they said is true and they were just an asshole about it, take it with a grain of salt and don't give them or what they said any more thought. Being hurtful is a logical foul and therefore a waste of air.
​
You are not alone in having these kinds of thoughts. I have them too. They blindside me, they suck, and they don't stay gone. Try to see the truth in each situation. Learn from what you can so it doesn't happen again. Bulldoze the rest.
​
Know that there are people in your life who think you're pretty darn swell. At least this internet stranger is glad you posted instead of letting him wonder if anyone else had these kinds of thoughts and can identify. Good post. Thank you."
5465,isfj,"I just pray to God.
Lol.
I never really let go, I try to accept the feeling created in me and try to move on. There's nothing to be done, I try to shift my focus away from dwelling on the hurt feeling for long.. I don't do well sometimes, but I try to keep walking, breathing, find something in the moment that can soothe or heal me."
5466,isfj,"It gets easier to not care as you get older too. Everytime I realise I'm holding onto some form of hurt that someone's caused me I remind myself of the karma thing as well. I also know from past experiences, if it's a particularly bad falling out with someone and they give a crap, they usually apologise after a few months. I forget about it knowing that they'll probably own up to their shitty behaviour and if not then they're not worth all the worrying."
5467,isfj,"IDK.. I am definitely on the lower side of the scale.. I think it depends on my partner for most part as long as it doesn't involve extreme stuff like blood, poop, extreme pain etc.. I'm content and prefer plain vanilla but intense lovemaking.. it's definitely all about expressing/sharing/giving love/pleasure and pure sensuous trance of it all.. the more emotional, the better..  I guess I'm more of a romantic. If my partner expects something I do oblige(within limits), so anything new that is 'kinky' comes from my partner. I'm definitely a sub, somehow even when taking the initiative.. I do have some fantasies but they're nothing what one would call, kinky.."
5468,isfj,"I don’t really know how to rate it.... maybe a 6 or a 7? 
I have a couple of slightly more exotic kinks like a size kink, medical fetish, a thing for sexual exhaustion/forced orgasm, etc, and I lean towards sadism. I haven’t had much opportunity to explore that aspect of myself, but my partner has mentioned the idea of wax play, and the idea of him in pain definitely turns me on lol. 
That being said, I don’t know that I would ever have an interest in the really extreme stuff or the D/s aspect of BDSM, so I certainly wouldn’t put myself on the “very kinky” end of the spectrum. "
5469,isfj,"My judging allows me to plan far ahead into the future, and to keep everything organized as I head toward my hopes and goals. When it comes to doing activities, I like to know exactly where I'm going, who I'm going with, what time I'm going, who's going to be there, etc. and know exactly what I'm doing, rather than just making it up on the fly. 
It can be stifling if you get too caught up in it; planning so far ahead has also caused me a lot of stress and I have often been told that I need to loosen up. I think it's mostly useful if managed well. "
5470,isfj,"The last letter in the MBTI is either J (judging) or P (perceiving). All this means is which you prefer to present in your extroverted self. The words ""judging"" and ""perceiving"" are a bit confusing, but all they mean is, do you present as someone who prefers to take in information (perceiving) or someone who loves to make decisions or act on information (Judging)?
For example, my friend is an INTP. He loves to read and is very very knowledgeable, and if you talk to him at length about almost any topic, he will surprise you with how much he knows. He prefers to present himself (his extroverted side) as someone who gathers knowledge, who perceives.
I am an INTJ I don't much care to look like the one who has a lot of knowledge, who takes in information, even if I do that a lot. I usually show myself as desiring to be the one to figure things out, to use the knowledge I've already gained to make decisive judgments.
These two sides are represented in the middle two letters of the MBTI. So, as an ISFJ, you perfer to perceive by trusting your senses, focusing on all the details because you need to know every little thing before the big picture becomes clear. And you prefer to judge (make decisions) by relying on your feelings rather than thinking things through. And overall, you prefer to show yourself as someone who likes to make decisions (judging) over someone who collects information (perceiving).
The toughest thing is the the connotation of the word ""Judging"" makes it sound like you're a very judgmental person. That's not what it means at all."
5471,isfj,"Hey everybody, I just discovered Reddit the other day and just found you guys! I was just curious why there seems to be so few of us ISFJ's on here and over on the MBTI sub. I was also wondering if anyone else doesn't really like the MBTI sub, they seem to be a little hostile to us ISFJ's and I can't seem to figure out why. 
That's all! I love the sub so far you guys and gals seem like a great little community! :D "
5472,isfj,"I feel like we're pretty quiet here mostly, it surprises me going and looking at another area, ENFP for example and seeing how active it is heh. I do also notice that other types either post here to compliment us or ask for advice about us. I like that though, I feel like we can give some good advice to other personality types with ISFJ's in their life. I like this place, there's just not always a lot going on. I check in pretty often though, makes my day better."
5473,isfj,"I'm fine with the MBTI subreddit. I enjoy the various posts on there. I haven't noticed any hostility towards ISFJs (haven't really seen any other ISFJ commentary other than myself tho, so...) honestly the subreddit that bothers me is /r/sensors because it's full of trolls who are trying to incite fights and always have a bunch of ""_ are the most stupid type!"" posts... (I'm already upset just thinking about how much I dislike it 
I think that ISFJs seem the least represented because, well, you said it yourself. You only found reddit yesterday. I usually don't participate in these kind of forums, but rather 
just observe and see what other people say. Or maybe many ISFJs don't delve into mbti theory? "
5474,isfj,"That's something I noticed, there's a lot of INTJ's on there, not that I'm knocking them at all! I just don't think most of the other types understand us very well which is too bad, but that's life right? I do like you guys, here it's so laid back I love it! Oh, and thank you so much for responding! It's my first sub/comment so I'm pretty excited :)"
5475,isfj,"I'm not saying everyone is hostile or anything, just seems like theres a little more towards ISFJ's then other MBTI types. Then again maybe I'm seeing it because I'm new haha :P. I was just curious if any of you guy's and gal's have seen any of it yourselves, I'm not trying to dismiss the whole sub or anything. There are some very interesting threads over there and the community as a whole is pretty darn positive! Thanks for the response! :D"
5476,isfj,"She was an ex smoker for 10+ years when we met.  Years into our rocky relationship she started smoking again, and blamed it partially in the stress our disfunction caused her.  Things got worse. 
I tried to be as accommodating as I could.  We both went to therapy and eased the disfunction and stress a great deal.  
When she quit smoking for about 6 months, we quickly became the closest we've been since early in our relationship.  We both had so much compassion for each other and it made the rare hurt feeling heal so quickly.  We stopped having whole weekends mad at each other.  It felt like we had relationship stuff figured out.
She went out of town for a day and suggested she might have a cigarette.  I was in a ""you do you, I do me"" frame of mind, and didn't put up a fuss.  Now she's been smoking for 6+ months and along the way I realized that we are taking a step back into disfunction.  She definitely has less patience with me and the family. We definitely are still much better than our bad times, but she acts much less compassionately overall.  I looked up symptoms of long term cigarette use, and damn... they fit what I was feeling.
I love her with everything in me.  I want us to get along as best as we can.  And I only want to spend the rest of my life with her.  The thought of her dying before me is fucking scary.  Dying of a painful and preventable disease... I can't put words to that thought.
She is a stubborn one.  In the past, any kind of pressure to get her to quit hurt her feelings, pushed us apart, and seemed to make her dig in her heels.  She doesn't like the hint of being told what to do, or the impression I think I know what's best for her.
Any suggestions?"
5477,isfj,"Thread discussing her. I assumed the same (that she's ISFJ), but a lot of Googling shows uninspired INFJs (more evidence Hitler was INFJ) and absorptive INFPs trying to claim her? Funny to me. What do ISFJs think?"
5478,isfj,"Sorry for constantly posting on this subreddit,  my mind been racing with so many thoughts lately.  Forgive me.  Anyway,  I was watching a video earlier today and this woman caught my attention. She said if you "" had a bad childhood and you're an adult you need to get over it. ""  Personally,  I try my best to keep my past to myself and buried it inside.  However,  I don't think you can just get over it. I honestly don't.  I came to realization that I should never speak about my demons to anyone.  It's hard to explain.  I hate leaving myself vulnerable and manipulated when I do talk about my past.  I've been betrayed countless times.  I just want to know if is it wrong for me to feel like this? I don't even talk to my family about my inner demons.  I've built a wall around myself to protect myself from potential pain. I hope I'm not the only one who feels like this ."
5479,isfj,"I bury it so deep sometimes I don’t even realize I have baggage, until one day I’m like “OH F*CK where are these emotions coming from” or “hey that’s whats been going on,  that makes sense.”
Also I tend to keep my emotional baggage to myself because I’m scared of making someone else’s day harder due to my problems or I don’t want to sound like a broken record  (y’all know how we isfjs get stuck in loops sometimes) "
5480,isfj,You and me are in the same boat. It’s hard to get over past baggage and it’s not a simple as just forgetting about it. I almost never bring up any emotional baggage to family members/friends because I’m afraid of being judged and manipulated. Ive been manipulated before but luckily I didn’t lay out my whole past for that person. I’d suggest getting a journal and writing in it when you feel upset. I feel that journaling really helps me feel refreshed and sets my mind straight. 
5481,isfj,"This sounds like Childhood Emotional Neglect to me. I know the term might sound harsh, but I HIGHLY suggest looking into it! Dr. Jonice Webb is like the leading founder on it, or whatever, she wrote a book, I'm reading it, and so far I definitely recommend. Take this https://drjonicewebb.com/cenquestionnaire/ questionnaire, it might help you. There's a questions like, do you like animals more than people, do your friends think you're aloof/distant, do you feel like you're on the outside looking in, do you have trouble asking for help, do you have a hard time knowing what you're feeling, do you frequently feel upset for no reason at all, do you feel awkward in social situations. There's like 20 total, it'll take like 10 minutes if you know yourself pretty well, or longer if you don't. But I PROMISE it is definitely worth looking into, and if it fits, than maybe you can heal. Wishing you the best!"
5482,isfj,"Hey, sorry to bother you.  After reading up on Childhood emotional neglect I came to the realization I suffer from this.  Pretty bad. However,  I don't see a way to fix this. In your opinion,  how would try to fix this issue if your parents been dead for 14 years? I honestly don't see a way to fix this.  I'm not trying to feel pity or anything like that.  I'm just curious,  what would you do if you were In my shoes. "
5483,isfj,"It's no bother at all! I haven't gotten far into the section in the book (called Running on Empty Overcome your Childhood Emotional Neglect) about how to recover and move forward, but I looked ahead a bit, to see what else there was and as far as I can see, I don't think it it requires directly making amends with your parents (if that's something you're worried about) There are three chapters in the recovery section, Why Feelings Matter and What to do With Them -understanding the purpose/value of emotions, identifying/naming feelings, accepting/trusting feelings, learning to express feelings effectively-  Self Care -learning to nurture yourself, improving self discipline, self soothing, having compassion for yourself-  Ending the Cycle: Giving Your Child What You Never Got -identifying your specific parenting challenges. So if I were you I would go to drjonicewebb.com or to emotionalneglect.com if you can't afford the book, or round up 15/20 bucks and buy the book. I think that's your best bet on fixing this"
5484,isfj,"I have periods of sadness and emotion processing (some shit happened) and during those I'm 90% certain I'm ISFJ.
Otherwise when I'm not hurt or falling into emotional attachment towards a person, I'm ISTJ.
So... I can't decide. Really, what am I?"
5485,isfj,"This exact same thing happens to me, too! I chalk it up to my mood changing, and when taking the test, doing something different in the situations asked during the test. 
90% of the time I'm ISFJ, other times ISTJ. Either personality fits me, strangely. Nothing says you can't have traits from both types!"
5486,isfj,"Hello all! I've been having an issue lately with a friend who I care about a lot and consider close.
Usually me caring about others more than they do me doesn't bother me at all but it's really been bugging me with this particular friend. We spend a ton of time together and lately he's been kind of weird with me. To the point where I'm starting to get upset/hurt and feeling like he just doesn't care. I've mentioned how he's been weird and he acts like he doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Anyway, I was thinking of distancing myself from him but then I feel like I'm being silly. I don't really know what to do here...wanted some thoughts and opinions from other ISFJ'S. Also, as a side note I am happily married and I'm 98% sure the guy doesn't like me romantically. If anything I think he might be uncomfortable with how much he cares about me (unromantically...) but I don't really know if that's the case.
Also, we haven't met in person yet and when I told him I was going to be where he lives visiting and asked if he was available...he blew me off. When we talked about it before he wanted to see me. So...I'm confused at this point."
5487,isfj,"Exactly my problem with a close friend these days. I have gone out of my way in the past for her happiness. I am being ignored and getting a cold shoulder for no reason. I know there is no reason because the last time I talked to her she gushed about how she loves my willingness to help with an issue of hers. 
This has been a pattern, as you say. I care about people's issues and am consistent in checking up and offering help if they are going through something, whilst getting minimal in return. 
That said, in my moments of need, things tend to work out randomly and miraculously, so it's true what they say: Do good, and good will come to you."
5488,isfj,"I used to deal with this on an absurd level. It was really a big part of being overly sensitive to things. Then, I read this article  on attachment, and Anxious-Preoccupied really spoke to me. And I realized that it wasn't really a part of my personality as much as it was an insecurity of mine. It may have been amplified by my personality, but it was not a concrete part of me. 
It took a few months and constantly rethinking my first reaction, but eventually I was able to see that people weren't ignoring me or not caring, and that not everyone shows care the same way I do. I show it by being immediately there for all of my friends and helping them with whatever they need. Others help differently, and that's totally okay. And it doesn't mean they care about me any less than I about them. 
It's hard to keep in mind, but if you constantly remind yourself that the people who are sticking by you are doing so because they see value in you and want to be around you, you'll soon start to realize that it's simply illogical for them to go to so much effort to pretend they care when they actually don't. And if they're not wrong, then it must be you're looking at them wrong. 
Try the new viewpoint and see how it goes. You might be surprised at how quickly friendships can get better :)"
5489,isfj,"My experience with this type of behavior has lead me to discover (and confirm) I'm attracted to psycho/sociopaths (male and female). I know now how to spot one and when I do I distance myself from them. They're totally not worth investing a single second of my time. I suggest reading up on the subject to see if this is the case for you. If not, I'm really not sure what else to tell you."
5490,isfj,"Did he started acting different once you said you were going to be where he lives or before already? Could be that he's uncomfortable meeting up.
Is he still taking the initiative with starting discussions so now and then or does it all comes from you? If the latter either something happened in his live, he got scared for meeting up or for some reason he doesn't really want the friendship anymore, but doesn't dare to say it, so he prefers to let it bleed dead.
To protect myself I ditch the people who I notice put me very low on their priority list. It's not worth my time, energy or worries. When I meet them since we are going to the same event for example we can still have a nice chat, but I won't try meeting up actively or staying in touch."
5491,isfj,"I was supposed to meet him earlier this year and he seemed excited about it. He also talked about going to an event together so I have no idea what's changed. Liked I said, he's been weird with me the past several weeks.
He usually inittates the conversations, only when he has work though. I'm constantly initiating when he's not bored at work (ie weekends) which used to bother me but I let go. He's also bought me gifts (and I have for him) and one time he didn't text me on a Sunday and the next day he apologized for it. I think this was the last time he did something like this to show me he cared and that was a few months ago, since then he's steadily gotten more weird with me"
5492,isfj,"Hi guys! I'm an INFP and I've never been here before. You guys seem cool and I was wondering if you had any advice for me about my ISFJ roommate. She and I get along well but I am hoping to get some tips about how to help her with stress, how to best support her, etc. Her top love languages are acts of service, quality time, and physical touch. Thanks for the help!"
5493,isfj,"My best friend is an ISFJ and I have some experience walking him through his anxiety. The first thing that helps is to get his/her respect. If you have his respect and trust and you show that you are not worried/would not be worried in his/her situation, then you're already on the right track. 
The most important thing is just to go through the problem logically step by step and to help view the problem from a perspective that he/she has not considered."
5494,isfj,"I am a ISFJ man. I'm an easy going man. And the way you earn my respect is caring. Simply caring about everything you do: family, work, and organizations. And when I say caring, I mean actually caring. Dedicating your time and effort, not afraid to get down and dirty to establish anything. Selflessness goes a long way for me."
5495,isfj,"One time I got ISFJ on a test. Don't know how the hell that happened because I couldn't be any more different from most ISFJs (I am an ENTP after all). But yeah, you should go on YouTube and find some ISFJ videos so you can relate to them and whatever. "
5496,isfj,"I don't remember any specifically, but there's one INFJ channel that has videos with her ISFJ mom and friend and they talked about ISFJ things. Her channel is currently called Vase Face but I don't remember what any of the videos are called. Just look up Vase Face ISFJ and you'll probably find them. "
5497,isfj,"(My apologies for the length, I felt it may allow you to give better insight) Me: 30 yrs old, about to turn 31 mid year, My (former?) ISFJ: 28 yrs old as of the beginning of this year
Background: Before I met my ISFJ, I was married for 6 years to an INTP. I supported the guy for the last 4 years of the marriage. Within the last year he was adamant about having an open marriage, and within the last few months, wanting his own place. In the last several months my ISFJ noticed me at work and started coming to my desk to talk fairly often. I had given up on my last attempts to salvage things in my marriage when I decided to separate and live with a friend temporarily. My ISFJ pursued me, even though I was afraid it would be too much for him, and despite my ""better judgement"" at the time we started dating (April 2015). He asked me to move in with him (at the 1 and a half month mark) when my plans for a new place with a new roommate fell through. He helped me find a divorce lawyer, and I've been waiting for said divorce to finalize since last June (2015). He had me meet his parents and sister around the same time. He even was fine with me bringing my 3 cats along into his tiny studio apt. It didn't take long for me to fall head over heels. In the past I'd always been the one providing, and I couldn't help not only be seriously attracted to him for his other attributes (smart, funny, witty, can always make me smile, similarities in taste: music, movies, shows, books, foreign cultures, you name it), but also appreciate all the small things that he would do to show how much he cared. 
Things seemed great, and both of us got large responsibilities at work (still working for the same company), on different projects. There was still stress on my end since my soon to be ex husband (now back in CT with his parents) would frequently text me novellas trying to get back together and convince me to stop the divorce (he still does this now).
Fast forward to November and the first signs that something was up: One of my cats had been fairly active at night, and my ISFJ is a light sleeper. It turns out that he'd barely been sleeping at night because of it. He of course didn't tell me this until 7 months had passed. I decided to send said cat (which I'd had since he was born and would never have contemplated doing for someone else) to my parents (who'd just lost one of their 3) because I wanted to make sure he was ok and less stressed. Arrangements were made for the cat to fly back to NYC right before Christmas. 
Fast Forward to December 2015: a week before Christmas we had our company holiday party at a nearby bar, with a 1920s theme. I'd been trying to buy new clothes recently since my ISFJ kept mentioning how it would be nice to see me in something other than jeans, sneakers and my geeky t-shirts (he always would dress fairly stylish unless he was particularly stressed or tired that day). I found a cute dress, headband and some high heels (which I almost never wear - these were the highest I've owned). Cue the music at the bar with a Daft Punk song coupled with my accident proneness, and in my exuberance to find one of my female coworkers that I'd dance with at the company parties, I managed to do a tumble and ankle twist. For a good portion of the rest of the evening I pretty much drank the pain away. My ISFJ had been semi-scarce the entire party and found me towards the end to tell me that he and a few other co-workers were going to go back to the office to play games, and invited me with. I emphasized that I didn't know if I would be able to make it in my heels and ankle, and that I'd wait for him at the bar with a few other co-workers (and their friends) that were straggling. Another coworker was wasted, decided he'd force everyone to take shots. By that time most people cleared out ( a few hours later), I realized I was a bit over my head in alcohol and was creeped out by a guy that generally kept trying to talk to me and look down my cleavage. I meandered to a chair next to the bouncer, trying to think clearly and texted my ISFJ to find out how much longer he'd be or if I should take a cab back home. He said he was having fun, and that I should catch a cab. I don't remember what I texted back, but he said to stay put and in some time came to pick me up and called us both a cab. He took me home, put me to bed, and started writing about how he didn't like what happened that night, that he needed time to think and was going over to a co-worker's. He left, and him shutting the door woke me up. I saw the note on the pillow next to me and freaked out. I called him, and we had a bit of an argument. I asked him if I should move out, and he said yes. I cried and managed to fall asleep 3 hours later. He got back sometime the next morning, not having been able to sleep at his friend's because of a loud radiator. He wanted to break up. I confronted him as to why and he said that I was the most amazing person he's ever been with, but that the very things that attracted him to me in the first place were some of the things that sometimes irritated him. He said there were tiny things that irritated him and he knew it wasn't rational. I asked if he still loved me, and he said yes.  I pressed on to find out what those issues were. He mentioned how he felt that he needed quiet time to recharge. I was surprised and said ""Why didn't you say so when you were first bothered by that? I can easily go hang out with people while you're home so that you can have that"". He said he didn't feel right asking me to change things that he thought were intrinsic to my personality, and I told him that he should be able to trust in me enough to tell me what he was irritated by, and that he should trust that I could determine whether it was in issue or not. He agreed to that. I then asked him if he was still attracted to me, and he said that I was out of shape and so was he (due to the stress at work and not having a chance to work out for several months), and him being that way made him more critical of me being that way. He also said that he thought my breasts could be a bit perkier, to which I mentioned: gravity and that it was a shallow statement. We both cried and made up, but he was still adamant that even though we were still together, I find a different place. I lucked out and found one in my budget within 2 weeks (former co-worker that was moving had a shared 2 bedroom under rent control), but they wouldn't take my 2 cats. I found a co-worker that would take them long term, but wouldn't be able to until February. I got my keys on Dec 28, and was going to move the first week of Jan, but got severely sick and he insisted I wait with the move until I got better. 
January 2016: I was sick for a week (102 fever for the first several days, with a lingering cough from hell for the next 3 weeks). Work got more stressful. We had events lined up every weekend. He finally asked me when I was going to move out, and I had thought we were going to wait until my cough subsisted, and then wait out his birthday weekend, plus our friend taking the cats (since my ISFJ expressed strong dislike at the idea of ever doing the litterbox). After some discussion I thought we'd clarified our misunderstandings, and I got a UHaul. He said not to worry about the cats, he'd take care of them, and helped me move most of my stuff over. Birthday week happened, I spent most nights at the new place, with only 3 nights at his as I slowly moved more of my stuff over for the next 2 weeks (into Feb). He seemed calmer and more grounded, more loving. He was still stressed out since he got another promotion at work and now realized he was responsible for a larger team and the entire technical debt of our flagship app. Meanwhile I'd been stressing out on the new app that I'd been placed on as the infrastructure technical lead (and with the exception of 2 team mates being lent to me for a sprint, the only engineer). Our deadlines on it kept shifting back and forth, so I was frazzled in terms of whether or not we could ship it.
Feb 2016: We got our bonuses. He found out he finally got a raise with his promotion. Not as big as he'd hoped, and felt under appreciated. I got a raise as well, and we realized that I still make a larger salary. The friend that was going to take the cats started to date someone that is extremely allergic and said he couldn't take them anymore. The week after, talk of deadlines shifting on my project happened again, and people got shuffled again (as they have been twice in the past 8 months). Word came through that the board was upset that they'd been told one date and not another. I got pulled off and a new-comer to my team (that started on Monday) got put as a technical lead to ""change perception"". My ISFJ was furious and thinks I'm being scapegoated. My team has been scrambling to gather evidence on my behalf (which has been surprising and humbling). Saturday (Feb 13th) we went to our regular DnD game which we've been in since last year. We had fun, and he drove me back to my place. He said he wanted to talk. I asked him if he wanted to come in, and he said no, that he didn't want it to take that long, but that we should take a walk. He broke up with me. I asked him why and he said that he couldn't give a logical answer. I told him I wanted an answer and that it didn't have to be logical. I asked him if he still loves me. He said he does, but that the relationship just feels wrong. I asked him if it ever felt right, and he said that yes, it felt very right at the beginning, but at this point it doesn't, and he doesn't want to go into more detail. He said he gave it 2 months since our talk in December, and he still doesn't feel it's right. He left, and I cried and talked to my roommate. She decided that we should just bring the cats, come what may, and so I texted him to let him know. Feb 14 (Valentine's Day): we went over in the morning and brought the cats and the last of my stuff. He helped bring some of it over. I gave him his keys back. I asked him for a talk. I told him that I would like to know, when he can tell me, what he thinks I did wrong, that I would like some feedback. He told me that he's already committed to sorting it out, writing it down and sending it over to me in a month, but to understand that it would just be a snapshot of how he feels at this time. I asked him for a hug and told him that for what it's worth, I still love him and I hope he finds happiness, whether or not it's with me. He said he wished me the same, hugged me and left.
I feel like my heart is breaking. I don't know what to do. Could someone with an ISFJ perspective help shed some light on what went wrong? What I might have done wrong? I really just want to work things out with him, but I don't know if it's too late already.
Thank you for reading this, and for any advice forthcoming.
~ One heartbroken ENTP"
5498,isfj,"Honestly, it doesn't sound so much like you did anything wrong, as much as it sounds like you just have incompatible personalities.
I absolutely adore xNTP types. You guys are the best. However, ENTPs are challenging for me to be around for long periods of time, and living with one would probably be a mess, for me.
My brother is an ENTP, and I lived with him for 16 years, until he moved out. He's an awesome person, and I love him, but we function so differently, I couldn't stand living with him. All of the things that made him fun and exciting to be around were also things that drained and frustrated me.
I don't think this is something that either of you could really fix or change. It sounds like he really loves you, but your differences are just too big for him to stay with you.
ISFJs typically won't give up on a relationship unless they know for sure that they can't make it work. Obviously it's going to vary a lot depending on the person, but I myself would never pursue an ENTP, solely because I know that they would be challenging for me to live with, and eventually the traits in them that I find myself drawn to would be the very traits that would make me resent them later on. 
ENTPs are extremely exciting, charming, funny, ambitious, outgoing and eccentric. They're one of the few extroverted types that I feel complete adoration for. But I need a lot of quiet time, and as exciting as ENTPs are, I would personally prefer a partner who is very calm, mellow and quiet, which is why I'm usually more drawn to INTPs, as I've found them to be a better fit.
This doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you, and I really don't think you've done anything wrong. ENTPs really are lovely people, and plenty of ISFJs have happy, healthy relationships with them. But I know I could never do it, and it sounds like your ISFJ feels the same way. It's just a matter of compatibility.
If it's any consolation, he probably still holds deep affection for you, and he probably still views you with great admiration. In my experience, when an ISFJ loves somebody, unless they do something to totally betray us (and even then, plenty of us make exceptions for that sort of behavior), that love is always there. 
I'm sorry things couldn't work out between you two, and I sincerely hope you have better luck in future relationships. "
5499,isfj,"INTP here, hanging out in ISFJ because I've had THREE relationships with ISFJs that have ended pretty much like that, and I seek similar understanding. I've never felt so loved, and so much anger and frustration, as I have with my ISFJ exes.
Thank you for sharing your story the way you did. I really appreciate the level of detail and investment in making sure your tale was completely understood by those that take the time to read it, and a lot of the details strike a chord with me and my experiences.
I'm also sorry your other INTP seems to have been such a lazy, clingy little shit. I think perhaps the older we get, the more we have opportunity to develop Si and Fe, and the better we get."
5500,isfj,I'm so sorry for how heartbroken you're feeling. Well his comment about your breasts stuck out to me (maybe because I'm insecure about mine not being as perky). You can change weight gain but you can't change that. Perhaps that relates to things you can't change in your personality and he doesn't want you to. I've been in some friendships where I've had great times with the person but in the end something didn't click and I couldn't explain it but couldn't keep hanging out with that person. I've never been through a break up like this but I believe that if something is meant to be then it will be and I hope you find that person you're meant to be with.
5501,isfj,"Thank you HoundBerry!
To clarify: As soon as he mentioned the quiet, I've been trying to give it to him. Personally I get more energy back from going out with friends, so I've been doing a lot of that and giving him space as much as possible, while still making it a point to give him a hug, a kiss and telling him I love him once a day. I prefer to show my affection through touch, and we both found that back rubs, leg rubs and head rubs seem to calm him down and unstress, so I've been doing a lot more of that as well, as time permits. 
He's been getting more and more stressed at work though, as our responsibilties (and especially his) have been piling in that respect. I've also noticed that the more stressed out he is at work, the more likely he tends to get about our relationship, as well as having an increased tendency to be more critical of others (especially friends).
Would it be possible for that to be a contributing factor?
P.S. I really appreciate your perspective. Thank you.
P.P.S He also had a long winded on/off relationship with someone for almost 8 years (over and done with 2 and a half) that was completely abusing his caring nature, and he's emphasized that he's determined to be less compromising afterwards. He's also never lived with an SO before."
5502,isfj,"Thank you, Yarr! 
THREE? How long have they lasted on average? Were there any noticeable patterns? Any commonalities?
In response to the last portion of your comment: My ex INTP was diagnosed with ADHD type I (inattentive) early in our marriage. Ever after he kept using it as an excuse and just kept spiraling into continuos video games, messiness and unemployment, all the while saying how because he had an IQ of 180, he should automatically be given a job in the tech industry and taught the skills he would need to succeed. He couldn't understand why other people were more successful and would try to rationalize it. There were a lot of issues there. I ended up hanging around as much as I did because by marrying him I felt that I'd made a promise to try to work through things, and I wanted to make sure that I kept it to the best of my abilities."
5503,isfj,"Sorry ISFJs. Gonna XNTP all up in here. :D
/u/HoundBerry knows what's up. 
All three of us share the same elements arranged into a unique alloy: 

INTP is Titanium, Silicon, Neon, Iron
ENTP is Neon, Titanium, Iron, Silicon
ISFJ is Silicon, Iron, Titanium, Neon

My ISFJ relationships have lasted between ""on again/off again for a year"" to three years - two of those being us completely ignoring each other. 
The first was 3 years. V was 14 years older than me. We both worked at a major airport. Me for the City, her for the TSA. We'd commute to work, she worked her job, I worked mine, then we'd commute home, have dinner together. Then she'd watch Survivor, etc. every night until bed, and I'd work on a project or play World of Warcraft or something until bed. For the whole relationship, I felt loved and cared for, but for the second half, I realized that I wanted SO much more than ""a shared bed roommate"" out of a relationship. So I moved out in 2008. 
I take it back. It's not THREE... it's FOUR. chuckles
The next one was an ISFJ, too. L was 15 years younger than me. We met playing Warcraft, and she moved to CO from TX after a number of months, and my having flown out there from CO a couple times. We lived together for 11 months. We broke up because she missed her friends and family ""too much"". Oh, and she'd met another guy in TX. shrug It's a thing that happens. I get it. But she didn't tell me. I found out the hard way (an overheard conversation), about a week before she left. I did get an email from her a couple months later telling me that she'd realized she'd made a huge mistake, and that she REALLY wanted to work things out. But a violation of trust like that is pretty hard for me to get past. Not because of the affection for another human being. That I get. There's a lot of cute dudes (and women) in the world, and sometimes we get a little hung up on them temporarily. It's the secrecy, coverups, and lies surrounding the affection for another human being that I have a huge issue with. 
Skip forward over a 14 month relationship with someone 4 years older than me (which also ended swiftly thanks to her lies, secrecy and coverups about a dude...back to back like that was really rough for me) to...another ISFJ, a year younger than me, which lasted 14 months, also. Cause of death: Inability to come to a consensus on division of household labor, coupled with long arguments about ""what really happened"". The fatal wound was her issuing an ultimatum - ""If you don't get out of bed right now and come camping with me, you're breaking up with me."" - Note the logic flaw and assignation of responsibility there. Not ""I will break up with you if..."" but ""If you don't, then YOU are breaking up with ME.""
Uh, no I'm not. If I don't go with you, then...I'm not going with you, as I've been saying for the last 6 weeks. If YOU attach greater significance to that act and decide that's the final straw for you, great - I'll show myself out - but you can't put that on me. 
The last ISFJ was this past spring. 9 years younger than me. Cause of Death - a knack for reconstructing memories of the past in a way that fit with her current narrative. It was the weirdest thing. No amount of ""Look. X actually happened on Y date (and here's incontrovertible proof in the form of a text message or photograph), so it's impossible for Z to be true because Z happened before X happened, and that would mean...I dunno...fucking TIME TRAVEL!"" would move her from wherever she staked her banner in the sand.
The common threads among them have been that I've never felt so loved and adored in my whole life, and never in my life have I simultaneously wanted to cut someone's heart out with a spoon (Because it hurts more, you twit!). My experience has been that logic. does. not. work. with an ISFJ. They're all about the feels, from start to finish. Their feelings are their reality. I'm totally willing to accept that the ISFJs I've been in relationships with have had other issues going on, but the similarities in retrospect are striking. 
Real life examples: 
If A does not feel like you're pulling your share of housework, going through the exercise of actually making a list of all the household chores, coming to a consensus of 'relative effort' and balancing things 50/50 on that basis does no good, and the next argument will be about the fact that A feels like you're not doing your share, and you rigged the chart in your favor anyway. (Nevermind that we consensused the chart and A friggin' picked the list she wanted to have! Now it's about how I ""know she hates dishes"" so I lightened the side with the dishes, knowing she'd pick the other list. Mmmm-hm.)
M, who is in LA, decided to not look for a job where I am currently (Phoenix) because ""she tried looking when you took 4 months off to go hang out with your mother (Sacramento) and didn't find anything at all in that time."" 
Note: Phoenix is the 6th largest city in America (1.5 million in the city, 4.5 million in the Metropolitan Statistical Area) while Sacramento is the 35th largest city in America (485k in the city, 1.7 million in the urban Metropolitan Statistical Area), and those are totally the same thing in terms of predicting success in getting a job, and lack of success in the small market means lack of success in the large market. sigh
I'm a HUGE fan of Eilamona's Sarcastic MBTI Types - because they encapsulate in 4 short paragraphs what each function looks like when they're operating optimally (the upper two boxen) and what they look like when they're stressed out and overwhelmed into operating non-optimally (the lower two boxen). 
In my experience, ISFJ's are FUCKING AWESOME to be around when they're self actualized and stress free - which is probably what attracted you to your ISFJ in the first place.
The problem with being in a relationship (with anyone) is that you'll never be in those two top boxes with someone 100% of the time, and when the ISFJ is stressed out and overwhelmed, I've found they tend to dive into the Ti-Ne loop of the lower two functions, and there is just no way (that I've found in my relationship skillset and toolbox) that I've found to break that loop of ""everything is terrible (Ne), it has always been terrible (Ti), and it will always be terrible (Ne again). I could potentially see your ISFJ being stuck in that loop right now. Not ""everything has always been terrible"" necessarily, but certainly ""Things have taken a turn for the worse and I don't foresee them ever getting better.""
Despite having all 4 functions in common, the arrangement means that you and he will forever view the world in ways that are completely different (and, in my experience with ISFJs and ENTPs and INTPs) completely incompatible in the long run. 
Seeing people down in their Tertiary and Inferior functions is a pretty awful thing. I went through that recently, when I got dumped (hard) by this awesome woman I met at the Star Wars Marathon back in December. Fortunately, I can live with my Tertiary/Inferior loop. Si found me still awake at 2am that night, posting videos of amazing V-12 engine sounds to my Facebook account while Fe hoped that my friends would like them, and therefore, like me for being a Cool Dude Who Posted Cool Shit That One Time. 
All while Ti bitched about how Facebook EdgeRank meant that none of my friends would even SEE the posts, because...fuck EdgeRank right in it's stupid ""hide your friend's content"" face. "
5504,isfj,"For example, when buying food and they tell you to enjoy it and you say, ""you too"" instead of ""thank you"" even though they're working, not about to eat?   
I feel like that's part of why I hate small talk so much but I don't know if it's because I'm not even listening or because I automatically say what I feel was expected, which is usually in that situation ""you too"" because they usually say have a good night/day/week/whatever so 98% of the time an automatic ""you too"" works.... I just feel like it happens to me way too much and I don't witness other friends do it. Just me? lol"
5505,isfj,"YES!!! I've always felt awkward for as long as I can remember when people tell me have a nice day etc. I say 'you too' really shy and quickly out of common courtesy, but I don't really care-and I don't want to be disingenuous or insincere. I always sweat the small things :')"
5506,isfj,"Sometimes I reply too soon and I'm not replying to what they said anymore... I think I might be afraid to take too long to reply and then I'm seeming impolite? And then I end up telling them to enjoy the food they serve all day and probably can't stand when they get home 8 hours later lmao oops.
I FINALLY have been able to just laugh and go ""dur I can't believe I said me too"" instead of wanting to crawl under a rock lol."
5507,isfj,"Hi, so I'm an INTP daughter, looking to better myself, so I can get along better with my ISFJ mom. I have a lot of trouble putting myself in her shoes. She cares about me a great deal, but we still butt heads cause we're two very different people. So, what don't you like about INTPs? And how should I communicate with an ISFJ? I try to give her affirmation, but maybe not enough."
5508,isfj,"Lack of sympathy and genuine interest in other people's lives is what annoys me about INTPs. Ask your mom about how things are going and have follow-up questions. Show that you care about whatever struggles, accomplishments, etc she's having in life. Be there for her when she needs help or comfort.
ISFJs also like to be appreciated. Show that you care and are grateful for the things that your mom does for you."
5509,isfj,"My intp best friend of over a decade is incredible. However, from experience and considering what it may be like as an isfj mom to intp daughter (especially while your Si/Fe aren’t yet fully developed), I see a few challenges. First, consider she may not want a solution to some things, just a listening, loving ear (but as an older isfj she may appreciate the Ti/Ne solutions, but it’s likely challenging as a mom/daughter combo). Second, please be gentle in pointing out her logical inconsistencies. I’m bringing Socionics into this one. Pointing out our third (Ti) function is flawed (your dominate), is a huge point of insecurity for us. In theory, as we get older, we want to be good at Ti (I can see this in myself). But being in the tertiary, we’re not as good as we would like to be. 
Hope that helps even a little!"
5510,isfj,"Just a follow-up question, because maybe you can help me out with this one. My mom often cries really easily, because my dad says stupid, ignorant stuff.(they have a very unhappy marriage) We(her kids, all thinkers btw) always say she's overreacting and she shouldn't be as concerned about the dumb shit he says anymore. 
We mainly do this, because we're all so used to how he acts and we laugh about it a little, but it's mainly to cheer her up, believe it or not. 
Should I try comforting her instead, though? I mean, when she does this, it doesn't last for long, but maybe I should still support her. I'm sorry, cause this is probably very obvious to ISFJs, but it's somehow hard for me to know the right way to react sometimes."
5511,isfj,"I feel like xxFx are more sensitive and can't laugh things off as easily, they really take some things to heart. I think you should definitely comfort her during those times. If I was in her shoes, I would feel like no one's on my side and that no one in the family understands me. Maybe stand up for her or be there for her when she cries so she knows she's not alone.
Btw, that was really nice of you to buy her flowers and write a card. Very thoughtful!"
5512,isfj,"kjeezy0127 is right, ask for his opinion.
Though for me, I don't like things. I like activities to do together. My girlfriend likes physical gifts but knows I don't. So we have to give to one another differently. 
have you two discussed love languages? 
Words of affirmation, acts of service, receiving gifts, quality time, and physical touch.
we often want to show love how we recognize/like being loved. as a person that doesn't enjoy gifts, i don't think of giving gifts as that strong of an indication of affection. but people understand signs of affection differently depending on their upbringing. like some sort of language. a love language if you will.
there are tests online to figure this stuff out, but i don't trust tests or person bias when taking them. I just look at the list and think ""what do i like? what do i respond to?"" and ask my partner the same. and know to then adjust how we show affection so the other person can receive it better."
5513,isfj,"Oh that’s funny! My sister is an infj and she loved giving gifts. Although I appreciate every single one, I am a huge minimalist. In fact, having too many things really stresses me out. However I almost always prefer practical gifts if it must be tangible. I agree with the few others here. Ask. Also as mentioned, experiences. Feed our Si with experiences we can look back on fondly. ;)"
5514,isfj,"Definitely ask him what he wants! Nothing warms my heart more than being asked + then receiving a present I actually want, as I have extremely specific preferences that you will never know unless you directly ask me. I'll show polite interest in all the gifts I receive but I often feel a bit sad. Then I immediately feel guilty for not loving what someone has picked out for me."
5515,isfj,"Hi fellow ISFJs (and other types lurking around),
I have tested as an ISFJ pretty consistently (only one test out of 8 gave me INFJ, dunno how). Reading various books about personality theory, and browsing the internet definitely confirms me as an ISFJ. I’ve seen people get sad about their “diagnosis” as an ISFJ but for me honestly things just kind of clicked like OK, makes sense, and really helped me in my road to self-acceptance. However...
Especially the internet seems to propagate ISFJs as saints, working our butts of to make this world a better place and bending over backwards to be of service whenever and wherever possible. They do not gossip, are always kind and friendly and are a delight to be around. Who wouldn’t love an ISFJ? Well, while I do consider myself very considerate of others’ needs, and I’m a quite caring and loving individual, I am not as altruistic as ISFJs seem to be perceived. I am quite salty and cynical and by no means aspire to make the world a better place. I do not volunteer, I do not donate and I’m pretty OK with that. I do gossip, sometimes, and I can be a generally shitty person when I’m very stressed, severely angered or just PMSing. 
Am I a broken ISFJ or can other ISFJs relate? "
5516,isfj,"I can definitely relate. On good days, I’ll do anything for my loved ones and be super kind to the strangers I come in contact with. Other times (especially lately), I’ll be outright mean for no reason:/ This mostly happens when I’m in an unhealthy rut/have built up anger inside. "
5517,isfj,I feel the same. Isfjs are usually like guardians or protectors or whatever but i don't feel like that describes me at all. I like to help and make people happy but i don't super go out of my either. I think im just as nice as your average person haha.
5518,isfj,"In my experience, for each MBTI type there is a very narrow and specific profile that exists on the Internet for it. However, the people I meet in real life always seem to be much more diverse than that-- some of my best friends are an ISFJ who loves to prank, an ESFP who is the most thoughtful and careful person, and an INTP who is very emotionally mature.
I suspect that on the Internet, there's a bit of a confirmation bias happening. People who fit the stereotypes tend to be more active, or else people find the qualities of themselves that do fit stereotypes.
In any case, MBTI is a tool for self-exploration, not supposed to limit anyone to a specific profile, or take away from how someone's personality develops.
For the example of my ISFJ friend above, you remind me a little of him. He can be pretty cynical, and bends the rules sometimes, although he's definitely an ISFJ."
5519,isfj,"as a non-isfj, I have isfj friends who are just averagely saintly and some who are quite selfish. but i do have an isfj friend who is probably the most saintly of saints and I aspire to be like her one day. :) So maybe the isfj-ness makes it more likely that you will be perceived as a saint but not a guarantee? also depends on how those cognitive functions interact with your upbringing of course, right? "
5520,isfj,"I tend to treat others the way they treat me. If you're nice to me, I'm nice to you. If you ignore me, then I ignore you. I guess that's not very saintly cause I selfishly do not want to expend more effort than I need to to meet someone halfway."
5521,isfj,"I can relate.  I used to be the ISFJ pushover - you know, I'd give people compliments just for existing.  I gave them my food just for existing.  I felt that everyone was a good person, and so I tried to uplift people.  I was still judged.  I was not given the same level of forgiveness or acceptance from those who I was kind to.  I was talked about, and when I stopped giving some people my food or helping raise their egos, those people pushed me out of their life... literally for not giving them my lunch.  I've become much less trusting of others, though I won't make my mistrust known.  I'm not actively mean to people.  But I've become very, very comfortable with saying ""no.""  And after a few little incidents this year - one which recently almost led me to commit suicide because a group of girls who I'd thought to be my friends started bullying me on a group chat - I'm definitely a little more cynical than I used to be.  It's not that I'm this unaccepting asshole now.  I still care about people.  If the girls from the group chat were to realize that what they did wasn't right and apologized, I'd accept their apology.  But I'd never hang out with them again.  I'm sick of letting myself be used.  I used to let other people use me because I had low self-esteem.  I felt that I had nothing else to offer, and so I gave people my lunch, and I complimented them.  But you know what?  I'm only human, and a person can only take so much.  I want to accept everyone.  And on some level, I do accept every person.  But now, I treat people the way they treat me.  I no longer think that every person I come across is good deep down inside.  I don't think the opposite, either.  But I've been taken advantage of frequently.  And I'm not going to take advantage of someone else.  I'm just not going to be everybody's little pushover anymore.  If you don't like me, that's on you - because I can't remember the last time I said something mean to someone.  I was told recently, by someone who I was taking advice from, that sometimes, you need to put yourself first.  That's what I'm going to do from now on.  In my life, I come first.  And I don't think that's selfish at all.  Because that's how most other people do things."
5522,isfj,"Definitely this. I think the Enneagram helped me understand this aspect of my personality, for a couple years I wasn’t healthy and so almost nothing I was doing was altruistic like it would be normally. I’m finally slowly getting better and starting to like the way I’m naturally handling situations and reacting to others lately."
5523,isfj,"Okay. I'm an INFJ. My sister is an ISFJ. We don't have an incredibly close relationship, but she just had a baby so I've been seeing her more than usual. I want to develop our relationship and learn how to be there for her. So, I would love to know, what do ISFJ's value in a friendship? What is your favorite way for people to show you that they care?"
5524,isfj,"I know that personally, I enjoy 1) a sense of trust along with 2) the ability to carry a conversation on their own while still 3) knowing when to listen.  It gives me the opportunity to sit back, listen and learn about a person, and the opportunity to freely speak my mind and feelings to them."
5525,isfj,"1) Mentally in-sync/Mental depth. I have a fairly cynical mindset and inappropriate, un-politically correct sense of humor. I enjoy people that look alittle deeper into things.
2) Assertiveness/Extroversion. To get me out of my introverted shell and show what I'm made of.
3) Easygoing. Being able to be ok with me not wanting to participate, and understanding of my need for alone time."
5526,isfj,"One way to get on my good side is to do little tasks for me. Since you said she just had a baby maybe you can help out by coming over and doing her dishes or something - new parents  in my experience are usually too busy & stressed to do simple housecleaning lol. Offering to go to the store and pick up diapers or something (or even bringing some without asking).
I'm always the listener so I am always easily charmed by people who take the time to sincerely listen to my problems or seem interested in the mundane things I'm interested in (like talking about weather or traffic, or what happened to me in line at the grocery store)."
5527,isfj,"Just came across this awesome subreddit but here goes!
What we look for in a friendship: Anything that lets me know that you're thinking of me. I don't like talking on the phone, but for example, if you send me links to something funny you find online that would be nice.
What I do is even if I personally don't find something interesting, but I know that I friend does, I would think ""Oh, my friend would like this"" so I'll forward it to him/her. 
Now if I send something to you, I would appreciate a response back, like ""cool!"" or ""thanks for that!"" If you don't say anything it feels like we're being ignored. 
People will need to tell us about themselves too, because we don't like one-sided friendships. If the other party doesn't share, then there's nothing we can go on. How can we move forward to a friendship if we don't know anything about you?
Following up would be nice too. A lot of people would say that they'll do things but they forget and nothing happens. I don't like being a nag and keep reminding them. Having a ""bad memory"" is not an excuse. We are all adults here. If you really care about me, then you'll take it upon yourself to make things happen. 
Being invited to things is a plus. Nothing hurts more than someone who talks about doing something over the weekend that they know is related to your interest, and then you were not invited. 
For your sister, definitely check-in with her first. As an introvert, she might not necessarily want company and would want some time alone. She might think that she'll need to entertain you while you're there, which will just be additional stress with the baby. Make it clear that you are there to help and that she shouldn't worry about entertaining you or cleaning up the house before you arrive. That said, help her clean up or stock up her groceries etc. Also, asking her feedback too often can be stressful. Like, where do you want this stored? Where do your towels go? Where is your broom? etc etc. is more stressful than just her doing everything herself. 
Taking the baby out for a few hours (or for a whole day) so that she can have a nice bath or a nap would be perfect! Also, listening to her rants and empathizing with her would help. Emphasis on LISTENING and EMPATHIZING. At that moment when we are emotional, we don't appreciate being told what we should do or hearing the other side. We'll hear about it once we've cooled down and specifically asked for advice. 
Again, I don't know your sister and my opinion is not representative of all ISFJs, but this is my take on it.  Hope it helps!"
5528,isfj,"I get frustrated that I can rarely contribute to conversations because I fear that I don't know enough about the topic so I can't give a very objective answer to counteract what the person initially told me. At the same time, when I go back and force myself to read more on topics, I get overwhelmed by the amount of information that exists, where to start looking for information, how the hell does anyone memorize all this stuff to paint a clearer picture of a topic in their mind to then determine said thoughts and opinions to remain objective, etc. So then it turns out I have very little to say in social situations at all "
5529,isfj,"My imperfect solution for that is too keep learning things until i have a large source to draw from and it gets weird and people think I'm intuitively connecting dots and ideas.
The other thing I do is admit I know little to nothing of a particular topic and that I'm kinda in ""learn mode"".
Enough ""learn modes"" and you'll find you can start feeling confident giving input."
5530,isfj,"You know, perhaps it's a ""good"" thing (as in, not ""bad"". Who even knows what's ""good"" or ""bad"" anymore?) that we constantly believe we don't know enough about a topic? And yet, we still care about the people around us and how they perceive us, so we end up blending in with them. I'd say that absolute open-mindedness is something to be proud of and hold onto as a ""strength"", and to not feel down if someone shames us for not having fully formed opinions and an identity because fuck that noise."
5531,isfj,"yup yup! real strength is being able to admit stuff and not posturing to be super. posturing is fragile. it's what weak thinks is strong. real strength admits stuff and adapts to improve on what it admits.
and if people try to shame us for not being super. that sucks....for them."
5532,isfj,"Speaking as an ISFJ: I’m perfectly content to be alone for long stretches of time. I enjoy being with my friends and socializing with coworkers, but it takes me a while to feel lonely or feel the need to seek out company. I think an ESFJ would feel antsier after a significant amount of alone time. "
5533,isfj,"They're quite different, but it's not how social they are. Either/or can be asocial or extravagant. In general though, ISFJs have a certain stoicism to them. Their Fe is under the control of Si. So, it's really only used whenever the ISFJ's Si feels like it. This contrasts the ESFJ where their Fe is 24/7. And in the ISFJ, you can see Fi in them. Sometimes they come off an INFPs.
This's a tiny bit more advanced theory, but there's Fe- and Fe+. Fe- is centered around negative emotions, or regulating them. Fe+ more around cheer and making it goes up and up and up, but not bother with negative emotions. The difference can be illustrated in this scenario:
Imagine you're at a party with an ESFJ and ISFJ, and let's say there's a person crying in the corner. The ISFJ's Fe- would want to remove any negativity, thus probably go talk to the person. ISFJs want to mend things. In contrast, the ESFJ would not bother too much. They wanna make the party louder and happier.
Now, in this aspect, i believe the difference in Fe- and Fe+ is less appearant in xSFJs. Both xSFJs have a strong sense to protect the vulnerable and can be very compassionate. It's just that ISFJs have more drive to do so and understand the individual more. That is if they choose to value Fi.
Also about Fe+ in ESFJ. + functions do badly in negative environments. If there was a conflict between two people, the ESFJ will make a battleground turn into a holocaust. ISFJ will make it peaceful. But if there's no conflict and atmosphere is positive, the ISFJ will depress it to a balanced state. ISFJs are less excitable and pushy. ESFJs are pushy. Even though both can be social, ESFJ is a bit more ""HEY, MAN! WHAT'S GOING ON? LOL XD""
Another thing to note is their moods. ESFJs' mood is more dependent on the social atmosphere. Crowd is cheering? They're cheery. Crowd is bored? They're bored. ISFJ moods are more independent. They have this pent up system. It regulates itself whenever it wants to, then builds up anger/negativity, EXPLODES, then goes back to normal. ISFJs are kinda edgy at times.
Regarding Si. ESFJs have Si+ which is increasing comfort. Actively make means of what is comfortable. ISFJ's have Si-, removing discomfort. This's not to make anything comfortable, just not uncomfortable. I think a good example is fitness. Let's say an ESFJ and ISFJ both wanna lose some chub. The ESFJ will actually make a habit of exercising, going outside,  hitting the gym. In contrast, the ISFJ will be more lazy. Their way of getting better health is simply by avoiding unhealthy things. Dieting would work smooth for them. Actual fitness? Not common.
Another key difference is how you see the xNTP in them that comes out at times. In ESFJ, you see this little INTP. They want to become fluent in Ti analysis, show an inner ""Aspergerian"". In contrast, the ISFJ wants Ne. ISFJs have a more natural eccentricity to them. ESFJs try to be weird. ISFJs are just OG bizarre.
Also that inner xNTP is shown in their non-conformism. ESFJs are conform more to norms. They'll only change if someone is getting hurt. ISFJs like to be edgy. Between a conversation with a friend of mine yesterday, we came to an agreement that outta all the sensors, ISFJs are probably one of the most non-comformist.
EDIT - in the example of fitness. ESFJ and ISFJ would be reversed. EDIT - changed 'rebellious' to 'non conformist'"
5534,isfj,"My understanding is that extroverts get their energy from others, while introverts get energized from alone time. As an ISFJ I get worn down if i spend too much time around people, as much as I love and thrive on bonding with others."
5535,isfj,I have an ESFJ wife and I relate my socializing time with all of her plans as a battery and she zaps it every once in awhile and it’s always a tough discussion every time that I need alone time to recharge. She doesn’t get it and thinks an hour here and there it’s plenty and I’m like noooo.
5536,isfj,"for me (ISFJ) my self consciousness is enough to keep me from socializing, even though i love to. whereas an ESFJ has the same sensitivity but it doesn’t deter their social nature. this might be an oversimplification. "
5537,isfj,"ISFJ: Would be more comfortable with alone time and staying at home more often.
ESFJ: Would probably get more antsy and anxious when spending too much time alone. Would need to go out and socialize more
This post from personality cafe talks about the differences in depth http://personalitycafe.com/#/topics/1171186"
5538,isfj,"I thought I was an ESFJ for some time but after working with a bunch of them... I'm much more laidback.  My ESFJ colleagues are always running around doing something, looking for things to do (we work in disabled people's home so it includes making calls for them, cleaning their houses if they can't etc) and are really perfectionist when doing so, yknow the stereotypical making sure things are clean and tidy and getting mad at others when they're not to their standards.
I work with one other ISFJ and we are really good at planning things, for example planning a trip away with one of the customers.  We think of all the practical things she needs and how we'll carry out the tasks to ensure everything goes smoothly.  The ESFJs are good at thinking of the feel good things to take eg to pamper the customer with and they're good at carrying this out with their hands-on Fe.  "
5539,isfj,"This was so genuinely insightful. I appreciate you taking the time to type this! 
But now I’m having an existential crisis and feel like I’m more ISFJ than I had originally thought. Thanks for the insight!"
5540,isfj,"Ahah, i know how you feel. My personal advice, just don't think about it too much, over time, ponder how your inferior function affects you. Both the tertiary and inferior are portrayed as being those functions you use, but suck at. That idea is okay, but doesn't go too far. First, let's kinda look into the tertiary.
ESFJs thought process revolves around their intuition, while their ISFJs thought process revolves around thinking. Remember, the tertiary produces NONE of its own energy, it's there for the dominant, really. The best analogy i conjured up is that the tertiary is like a hilt to a sword. You can't hold the blade (dominant) by itself, you need something to hold it. In this regard, your tertiary works! But try to kill a dragon with only a hilt, you might as well just give up and run back to the castle to go play Minecraft. Our tertiary is really only good when lone for play. This's why it's called the child function. But due to it making you feel confident with your dominant, you will overestimate how much importance it has.
What we don't have that overconfidence in though is our inferior. Typically, people only feel comfortable displaying their interest towards their inferior almost like a French maid closing the doors and jamming out to Metallica. 
Also, whatever your tertiary is, consider it ""lopsided"", as someone once described it. Ti really only works in full effect when Te is used, which is something ISFJs SUCK AT IT. This's part of their rebelliousness. I found this within myself. I'm like ""LOL, you believe in the sources? THINK FOR YOURSELF"", but then i go to my friends who also like Typology and get spoon fed data. ESFJs have better access to Te, and know how to use it for investment (Te+). ISFJs more so on frugality (Te-). 
In regards to developing and training their Thinking functions, ESFJs are at a greater advantage. ISFJs win in regards to their intuition. Ne in ESFJ is only there to help out Fe. So maybe at a party, the ESFJ will think of a bunch of ways to keep it going.
And their Ni, it's worthy to note that ISFJs use Ni-, which is trends of anxiety. You might hear a lotta ISFJs having a sense that they must prevent tragedy. ISFJs are pessimistic and self-destructive. ESFJs way less so.
As my profile says, i used to think i was ISTJ. But before that, i remember thinking i could ISTJ, INFP, ISFP, and even ENFP. Who knows. But after looking at the inferior, I KNEW I WAS ISJ. The idea of an ESJ became a strict impossibility for me.
EDIT - last part about Te-. ISFJs aren't retarded with spending. INFJs are."
5541,isfj,"It's often portrayed as your unvalued functions are never used, but as mentioned, this's simply not the case. Example, you can train your role function fairly well. In the case of ISJs, that's Ni.
That said. For the functions out of the stack, i recommend reading this:

5542,isfj,"http://www.celebritytypes.com/blog/2014/12/pierce-presents-isfj/
I really enjoyed his writing on functional axes too. In fact I really enjoy reading up more on MBTI things. So my first question is what got you into MBTI? And do you really like to learn more about it? I always read up on my type and my boyfriend's but I don't try to learn too much specifically about other types.
However I've always been into things like matching my horoscope to a friend's and matching MBTI's and seeing what it says about our relationship-- is this something anyone else does?"
5543,isfj,"I found out about MBTI in college and my closest friends and I all did quizzes to determine our types (I was INFP at the time, this was about 6-7 years ago). I had always been intrigued by horoscopes and the apparent truths to many of the characteristics of certain zodiac signs and got to the point where I could guess at someone's sign after knowing them for a short time. My interest in MBTI has lingered but kind of took second place since then. While interesting, it's harder to 'study' than the zodiac because you need to have an extensive understanding of both sides of each trait (I vs E, S vs N, etc.) to be able to figure someone out, whereas horoscopes only require you to know someone's birthday. 
I do have a friend who has read extensively about MBTI and she correctly identified me as ISFJ before I even retested myself. I don't know if I'll ever get to her level of dedication, but it's nice to know it's possible. :)"
5544,isfj,"I heard about it online. Personality quizzes are always a fun time so I took one and got INTJ. I only somewhat fit the description so I tried a different test and got INFJ. Still only half-fit. Tried a third quiz and got ISFJ. The description was scarily accurate. I guess the accurateness was what really got me in. Normally I frown upon things like horoscopes (I'm supposedly an Aries but I am the exact opposite of an Aries so hearing about horoscopes in general annoys me because of how obviously fake it is) But this seemed so... true. And I was learning things about myself that I had never realized. So I see it as a sort of tool for learning about yourself and how you fit in with the world. I find myself mentally typing friends and family and find those to be pretty damn accurate as well!
Basically, I guess what got me into it was that I was seeing actual truth behind it. That, and I like trying to understand other people and how everyone thinks differently. I typically only learn about the types of close friends and family. I like reading about how we all fit in together, and how their brains work. (Which I also see truth behind.) Personality in general just interests me."
5545,isfj,"During this past month, a 5-month relationship ended with an ENFP on her terms. We had known each other for 8-months, and before the relationship, we would always skype in the morning and at night. We would be constantly in contact throughout the day, and as such, we were pretty close when we began the relationship. We both confessed our love for each other within the first couple months of the 'official relationship.'
For me to openly confess my emotions, I need to feel safe and cared for by the other person. I need to feel like the two of us can work through whatever life throws at us (and we did at times), so when the relationship ended so soon, it really hit me hard. I actually felt worse from this relationship ending than my previous 5-year relationship.
It made me think about the impact of duration of relationships and what it actually means afterward. For me, when I fall in love with someone, there will always be a part of me who will love the person in the future -- who will wish the best for them, even if the relationship ended on bad terms -- but I do not know if I can really be friends anymore. It also takes me a long time to get over it, and I will always look at 'what could I have done better?'
So fellow ISFJs:
When do you usually feel comfortable telling people you love them?
How hard do break ups hit you, even if they're short? What is short, in this instance?
How long does it take you recover and bounce back?
Would you ever want to be friends again? Do you end up being friends again?"
5546,isfj,"Hmm, it usually takes a while I guess? I try not to be too reserved about it, but to really feel that comfortable and get to that level of affection for someone I'd say it takes at least 6 months to a year. 
Really depends on the breakup. If I've only been dating someone for a little while, like less than 6 months I guess, and I've found that I'm not actually that attached to them, I'm emotionally over it pretty much immediately even if I still spend a while thinking about it, not much impact at all. 
For my longest and most intense relationship, we broke up about two years ago and I still don't think I'm fully recovered even though it doesn't really hurt on a day to day basis at this point. It was compounded by a few issues with friendships around the same time, so it had a huge impact on my confidence and self-esteem and hit me really really hard. The effects are still lingering because I sort of repressed everything and focused on moving on before actually dealing with my feelings about it. 
I almost never want to be friends with someone after a breakup, especially if it doesn't end well. I could imagine situations in which I would be okay with it if it were a very amicable breakup, but for the most part once I'm done with you, I'm done for good. I see too many people wasting their time dealing with exes they don't even really like, and I can't stand the thought of that being me; if we broke up, it was probably for a reason, and it probably means I don't want to be spending time with you at all. "
5547,isfj,"In my case it takes around a year to recover from a break up, but it can be easier and shorter if you find a new partner. I've never ended up being friends again with an ex girlfriend. We are not enemies either, we just lost contact."
5548,isfj,"Probably because those with a sensing function high in their stack (as opposed to intuition) are more likely to focus on the concrete, physical reality. As a result, they are usually more pragmatic and less inclined to theorise and entertain abstract thoughts on the internet."
5549,isfj,"I'm sure mistyping and general type bias also plays some part. Intuitive profiles tend to be much more flattering and interesting than sensor ones. (I thought I was INFP for years because I was quirky and interested in more than just baking and popular shows so I had to be an N type, haha)."
5550,isfj,"I feel it's 1) a matter of some people mistyping as INFJs (and other types too).
2) ISFJs are the most common in the world, but not on Reddit. I can see a lot of ISFJs liking the cute subreddits or subreddits devoted to their hobbies, but we aren't much for Internet arguing. I also think just a lot of people, ISFJs included, don't realize mbti exists and so they never try to look up forums about it.
So basically..... I'm sure a lot of factors are involved :P"
5551,isfj,"Sensors in general tend to be less interested in personality theory as a whole because it's not practical enough (Si), or stimulating enough (Se). I guarantee there are just as many of them on the internet as there are intuitives. They're just interested in different things."
5552,isfj,"Yup, exactly this. N descriptions are a lot more mystical and unique sounding than S descriptions. 
Took me years to discover I'm actually more ISFJ-INFP (definitely an Ne-Si user) than an INFJ; however, I still hang around on r/INFJ because I relate immensely to the personality type. "
5553,isfj,"I am an ISFJ and I'm pretty bad with remembering people's faces and names. But my memory is extremely good when people tell me stories and little details about themselves. 
Sometimes when I meet someone for the first time, I won't really remember their face but I will remember the clothes they were wearing, my first impression of them, etc. 
So I guess I have a really good memory but it can also depend on what aspect it would be."
5554,isfj,"Yeah, I'm bad with names and faces but otherwise, my memory is stupid good regarding things that people tell me about themselves! I actually have to sometimes pretend that I don't know something because when people don't remember that they told you something, they get a little creeped out that you remember it 😅"
5555,isfj,"I have a bachelor’s degree in public health and have been considering going back to school for a different degree for quite some time. I’ve heard several times that accounting was a good career for isfjs, and I’ve been thinking about getting a second degree in it. I was wondering if anyone here would recommend getting a second bachelors in it? It would take me about 2-3 years of going to school part time. I’m attracted to the career because of the different places you can work, stability, and ability to be self-employed. But is accounting a regular 9-5 job, or does it require a lot of travel and weekends? Any insight would be helpful, thank you :) "
5556,isfj,"is a bachelors necessary? I looked into getting a second bachelors at one point, but a professor pointed out to me that since I already had that, I really should just take the prerequisite courses and get a masters instead, which looks better to just about anyone. Of course, there might be a ton of prerecs and it would just add unnecessary time to your schooling. Just a thought!"
5557,isfj,"Today I was so commited to finish a song, but when I was doing it, I came up with another song, and when I was composing it, something made me think about a new and very sad story to write and somehow I ended up crying in my bed thinking about life. is this the ""P"" in my personality? gosh I never finish anything and"
5558,isfj,I'm the same way. Am a musician too. Haven't released an album or EP in two years yet I have 100+ song files on logic from 2017-now. It makes me so mad. I just lose interest. Idk if it's ISFJ or my adhd.
5559,isfj,"Honestly, this is me, a little bit.  When it comes to work that needs to get done - like, you know, schoolwork - then I really will just get it done, even though I'll procrastinate a bit.  But when it comes to personal projects, things that don't have a deadline, this is always happening to me.  For example, I'm trying to write a story right now, right?  And so two days ago, I started with a document for my characters and their MBTI types (weird, I know, but I LOVE typing people and fictional characters, so I want to type my characters.)  I pretty much know their types, and I know what I want to write in that document, but it's like every time I start writing down things for those characters I suddenly have a hundred new ideas for more documents spurning.  I convince myself that having these documents down will help me prepare, but it's like this is slowly becoming a big procrastination thing, even though I'm not really procrastinating.  There have been a few times when I've deleted everything on my document because I looked it over and I was like, ""Not good enough.  This could be better!""  I think it's the perfectionist in me, mixed in with the ideas that I'm urgent to get down."
5560,isfj,"I'm a bot, bleep, bloop. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

[/r/entp] ISFJs do that too!

 ^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^(Info ^/ ^Contact)"
5561,isfj,"""""I'm sorry"" (for doing things that you shouldn't be sorry for, like walking down stairs when a person is cleaning them).
""May I do ______?"" (asking permission for everything)
""It's good. But it might be better if ....."" (when someone asked for your opinion on stuff they've done)
""Do you mind to......but it's okay if you can't"" (when asking someone for a favor)
""I'm not sure, but I can find out for you!""
""Don't worry about it, I can get it.""
""Well, on the bright side, at least...""
""Was I okay back there/do I look alright/I hope I didn't mess anything up?""
""I don't know, what do you want?"" (totally indecisive about personal needs)
Or when saying something that might hurt peoples feelings, ISFJs say ""Now, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings or anything, I’m 'just saying.'
""You're sure you don't mind?""
""Do you want to talk about it?""
""Yeah, I guess you're right.""
""I hope I'm not bothering you.""
""No. ... No. ... But I don't want to! ... Oh, fine.""
""Am I being annoying?""""

5562,isfj,"I don't know if this is an ISFJ thing, but when I answer a deep-ish question, I always start off by saying ""I dunno..."" and immediately following it up with an answer. Which means I do know, I guess I just want to make sure the answer is not too direct or something."
5563,isfj,"I do this too but usually add it afterwards. Like ""I really think [some sort of semi-controversial opinion] but yeah...I don't know I mean, people who think [complete opposite thing] could be right too I suppose. "
5564,isfj,"I think people in general do that if they are good at reading others.  Prefacing your answer with ""I dunno"" and then exactly what you think, gives you sort of an ""out"" if you either don't get the intended response from a person or if you don't think your statement will be accepted.  I find myself using it at the end of a statement more than I should.  But since ISFJ's tend to want to please and appease, you might be just fishing for an agreeable answer."
5565,isfj,"INFJ here wanting to find out about your experience with discovering your personality type.
I typically find myself drawn to type ISFJ (my Mother and 4 closest friends are all type ISFJ) and am quite keen on the topic of personality types and such. It is something that really fascinates and I find that learning someones type enables me to better accommodate their needs and strengthen my relationship with them.
I have noticed though that the ISFJ's in my life are somewhat prickly about the subject. Each greeted the test with suspicion and disbelief followed by little interest in their result claiming that the test is ""stupid"" and the questions are ""not applicable"" to them and have each jumped down my throat any time it has been mentioned since claiming that a computer cannot know them and someones behavior cannot be explained by ""some silly web page"".
Did any of you have a similar experience untoward discovering your type, or helping an ISFJ discover theirs?
Was your experience different?
I wanna hear your stories to help me shed some light on this!   "
5566,isfj,"ISFJ male here. While I strongly identify with my MBTI profile, I did have some beef with two things.
1) The questions for the test are a bit plain. My ability to see through questions and see what their trying to find made it all the more frustrating. Questions like ""YOUR HOME AND WORK ENVIRONMENTS ARE QUITE TIDY"" make me cringe... because I know all that question is trying to do is put me either in a P or J category. ""A LOGICAL DECISION IS ALWAYS BEST, EVEN WHEN IT HURTS SOMEONE’S FEELINGS."" Again, its blatantly obvious that it wants me to pick either the T or the F answer.  It can be hard to take MBTI seriously when you feel like you can see ""the magic"" behind the scenes. A question asking me if I'm tidy means nothing to me--- some days I do keep my house spotless. But some days I'm like, 'fuck it, i'm not doing dishes ever again'.
2) I was first introduced to MBTI from the book ""Please Understand Me II"" While I agree with the ISFJ definition, the ""SJ"" or ""Guardian/Sentinel""  description is so off the mark for me that I still to this day question if I belong in this group. Guardians are defined as traditional, less likely to stray from their comfort zone, repetitive, and orderly. Who wants to be described like that? I read that as an insult. Especially when I consider myself impulsive, creative, adventurous, and a rebel. For me and for your friends, being put into a category with such conservative lingo can be quite insulting. "
5567,isfj,"I've done five tests. One of them said I was INTJ, two said I was ISFJ and two said again something completely different, I don't even remember what. I've read descriptions of INTJs, didn't completely agree. I joined their subreddit, didn't feel like I belonged. I've read ISFJ descriptions and there's no way that is my type. I almost gave up but decided to not take any more tests just read the description of INFJ, since I thought it was the T/F thing that wasn't clear enough. I've read through three or four descriptions with my jaw dropping lower and lower. I'm positive I'm an INFJ so I subscribed to this sub and so far it seems to be a community where I really have a lot in common with most of those who post here.  "
5568,isfj,"MBTI is a highly intuitive system and ISFJs suppress their intuition and thus are not naturally inclined. I have the same problem and can hardly mention the system to my ISFJ girlfriend. She loves tradition, and mbti is too deviant for her to totally immerse herself and care about it, and the results too intuitive in nature to give it any weight. "
5569,isfj,"I've taken the test three times over the past year and have been deemed an ISFJ each time. Honestly, other than the traditional portion I mentioned in a comment above, I'm comfortable and happy with being a nurturer. It describes me extremely well! And I like the test, although easy to determine what the question is asking for...if you have any prior knowledge of the theory!  
Maybe they just haven't looked into it enough? IF I remember correctly our type also prefers concrete methods of thinking so maybe the theory aspect of it is why they're so quick to dismiss it all? Just a thought! "
5570,isfj,"I get really hurt by tests like this if the description of my personality seems to paint me in a bad light. I was happy with my MBTI result because it didn't feel too negative (for example, the ""traditional"" part was described as ""new ideas need to impress us/prove their worth before we'll adopt them"") but my Enneagram results seemed to announce every flaw of mine with little or no positives and it hurt a lot. These days I'm more open about what's really bothering me, but the reaction you're describing is pretty much exactly how I would have reacted in the past."
5571,isfj,"I dunno; I'm totally okay with being described as traditional, unlikely to stray for my comfort zone, repetitive and orderly. I would be lying if I tried to pretend that that was anything but totally accurate for me. I'm not insulted by it at all. Impulsiveness and adventurousness don't appeal to me in the slightest. "
5572,isfj,"I too found myself insulted by how traditional and, dare I say, boring it painted us to be. I'm not prone to laws of social tradition nor am I religious. 
But I suppose that's where the idea comes to play that these tests aren't meant to define us completely but rather serve as a general observance. "
5573,isfj,"I actually had a similar experience in discovering my type.
The first time I took the test I scored INFJ. Then when I took it again a few moths later I scored INFP. After having spent long periods of time around ISFJ's I found myself scoring ISFJ and even INTJ at one point.
In the end I followed someones suggestion to go suss out the cognitive functions and break them down individually, do some research and find where I fit in.
I think the change in my scores was due to ""the chameleon effect"" as since distancing myself a little I have consistently scored INFJ."
5574,isfj,"Perhaps this is why my wife shoots me down just about every time I talk about anything remotely abstract.
She prefer I talk only about what I've directly observed and DON'T make inferences or generalizations: that's like the cardinal sin.
It can be really stifling as a dominant intuitive feeler."
5575,isfj,"In regards to the question, yes, definitely, by proving yourself repeatedly that you are worth it. Of course every thing I don't do as right as I could kinda puts me down but then I look at myself and compare to the people around me and that makes me feel better because I can see some big differences in my favor (earned through efforts of course). Maybe not the kindest thing to do but it works for me. "
5576,isfj,"Exactly, find what gives you confidence. What is the trait that you most value? Find it and work on that aspect of yourself as well as you can. For me, it's intelligence, and my professional field, which is not one of the easiest, gives me full confidence upon noticing that I am doing great. It's a life saver in hard times."
5577,isfj,"I’m an associate at a telephone crisis counseling line. I’m currently in a battle with the state I moved to to get them to give me my counseling license because they’re confused about the classification of my master’s program, but if I can work it out I’ll be a counselor at my current company. I love it, it’s an excellent fit for the guardian personality and it’s never boring. "
5578,isfj,"I’m an insurance broker and I love it.
It allows me to be serious sometimes and soak up knowledge and be able to educated people on coverages etc in a quiet, professional atmosphere. 
I’m august I started working st a remote office by myself and I am LOVING it "
5579,isfj,"I graduated in veterinary medicine and now I am working in a biomedical research lab after finishing my master degree. My intention is to do a PhD. I don't know if this career is considered a good match for ISFJ, although my memory and organizational skills help a lot. On the other hand, it was very stressful at the beginning, when I felt like a fish out of water. "
5580,isfj,"I'm employed as a CNA and am working towards a BSN degree. My job can be challenging but I find it incredibly worthwhile. I love being able to work so closely with people, I believe it syncs well with my empathetic side. I look forward to accomplishing my goal and becoming a nurse. I couldn't imagine myself doing anything else, honestly. "
5581,isfj,"I just found this subreddit. It never occurred to me to look it up, but I've been binging through the threads. My people!!!
My question for you. What Hogwarts House do you see yourself in? Have you been placed elsewhere (Pottermore, Buzzfeed, etc.)
My apologies if this post is out-of-theme, but I've always been curious."
5582,isfj,I took the Pottermore quiz and got put in Slytherin. All of my friends who love Harry Potter see me in Slytherin as well... Not very conventional ISFJ. I have no idea how that happened? But I love the ambition of Slytherins so I kind of like the idea.
5583,isfj,"My own answer:
I've always seen myself as a Ravenclaw. I assume that's picking up on the Introverted, Sensing, Judging parts.
However, Pottermore kept placing me in Gryffindor, which I guess pulls from the Feeling. But the archetype of ISFJ, as a nurturer/protector also seems more Gryffindor. 
Any correlations?"
5584,isfj,"RAVENCLAW!!!!
I'm almost a Hufflepuff, though. Very nearly.
To those wondering why there's so many Ravenclaws btw, I think it's because we are more likely to be interested in things  like MBTI because they help us understand the world by analysis (if that makes sense?)"
5585,isfj,"I think it is odd that so many Ravenclaws are appearing as well. Truthfully, I never even considered Ravenclaw because to me Slytherin was always the house I would have wanted to be put in. What are you?"
5586,isfj,"This sounds like something my girlfriend would like to answer. Shes an ISFJ and she will fill out these odd questionnaires on Facebook and then send them to me with the results saying something she wanted it to say. You have to keep in mind that kids make these test up and if you answer with a certain goal in mind, you will get the results you want. "
5587,isfj,"I've never done the test, but I would guess probably Ravenclaw, but could equally go to Slytherin. It's slightly closer to Ravenclaw as being mediators between Slytherin and the other houses is something I can identify with."
5588,isfj,I actually forgot that I lost my original Pottermore account which was Slytherin and when I started a new one it put me in Ravenclaw. I ended up recovering my account and deleting the Ravenclaw one but I now find it interesting that I got Ravenclaw when I took the test again.
5589,isfj,"I do, to an extent. I'm by no means well versed in the teachings of many philosophies, but I have dabbled in certain ones here and there. In my experience, the point where philosophy becomes so abstract that it has little practical value to me, and my daily life, is where I begin to lose interest. Metaphysical questions like, ""what is life?"" or ""what is time?"", are not questions I enjoy pondering. Why? Because thinking about these questions, or reading about others thoughts/answers to these questions, has little impact what goes on in my life tomorrow, next week, or next year.
When I read philosophy, I want to learn something practical and applicable to my life and things I do. For instance, I have enjoyed reading about the philosophy of stoicism. The idea that I can control my thoughts and reactions to emotions, and other ""exterior"" influences, appeals to me. It appeals to me because it is something I can use on a daily basis, something which has the potential to help me achieve happiness or calm as soon as I apply it. A philosophy with this type of applicability is what I enjoy, and seek out.
TL;DR: Yes, but it has to be applicable to my daily life."
5590,isfj,"I can't speak for others but I've enjoyed the couple philosophy classes I've taken quite a lot. I've also found myself listening to philosophy podcasts on occasion in my free time. The Partially Examined Life is a great, fun podcast if anyone is interested. Shoutout to /r/philosophy too, they're pretty small and although I don't comment at all it's fun to read. 
EDIT: okay, i checked out /r/philosophy's size, they're huge. my bad. but they feel small, which is nice."
5591,isfj,"Have you ever experienced some chronic pain to your stomach? It's not food related. I'm talking about some pain/huge discomfort that I feel when I'm upset, overthinking, worried ,anxious. It happens that, because of my sensibility, I suffer at a physical level. I was wondering if any other isfj has ever experienced that. I think that it may be part of our personality but this pain really bothers me. Thank you
Edit: thank you guys. It helps to know that I'm not the only one. At times I wish I wasn't that sensitive, but I'm sure I'll improve over time. There are also some positive aspects of my sensibility! "
5592,isfj,"I'm going through this right now. I've got a big project at work that I haven't made much progress on, and some of my coworkers are really getting on my nerves, which is upsetting my stomach and making me even less productive.
I'm not sure if I want to talk to them about it or just try to avoid them, but I'm also trying to improve my diet and get more sleep, so I'll see if that helps."
5593,isfj,I used to get sharp pain in my stomach from anxiety pretty often when I wasn't coping very well. I think it's best to try and find other things to distract you when you worry and start thinking too much.
5594,isfj,"I get abdominal migraines whenever I get way too worried or stressed out. Each time, it lasts about 24 hours with chronic pain and vomiting, and I end up in hospital with only a bit of Gaviscon + numbing stuff. 
These have improved after I started seeing a psychotherapist and taking lorazepam, however. "
5595,isfj,"Only really bad twice, but yes.  The first time it was so excruciating that I had to go to emergency, and the second time I had constant low-level pain and I lost all interest in food for a couple of months thanks to overwhelming stress.  It's gotten better since then (the second time was last summer) but I still have days where my stomach is noticeably upset for no reason other than stress."
5596,isfj,I don't feel great at work either and I don't get along with one co-worker in particular who happens to sit next to me. The problem is that I actually feel pain in my stomach even when I'm at home and I'm not (or I shouldn't be) stressed about anything in particular. I went the whole evening feeling some discomfort in my stomach while I was watching a movie. It was so frustrating 
5597,isfj,"These are the major aspects of my personality that differentiate me from other personality types. I suspect strongly that these things are probably true of most ISTJs? Let me know if you relate...


Without some frame of reference, I am lost. I accept, to some degree, that the first time I do something, I might do it horribly wrong. But once I do it a few times, I get much more comfortable, and the best work I do is with anything I've had exposure to. So math has been a good subject for me: teach a bit, then do a hundred math problems to get it down. If it was ""read this book and write an essay on your own thoughts"", I'd be lost.


Change is just always hard. And it's good for people, sure, but wow, it is incredibly hard for me. I recently got an eye floater and I feel like my world is ending, even though I read that 50% of people over age 70 have them, and they seem fine with it. (Granted, I am only 32) Having to adapt to any new health issue is always devastating at the beginning. And honestly I still can't get over my memories of pre-health problems and pine for those times.


Having Fe as my lead feeling function, I end up just not getting Fi. I have never understood how someone can see an event happen and immediately have a very specific reaction to it / opinion of it. Like say the government passes a new bill, and some folks immediately start protesting. Maybe there are some good parts to it? There's always a lot of grey...


Another key thing about Fe is that if I say something that grinds someone's gears in any way, I immediately back down, even if I feel like I might be right. I remember devastating losses in political debates between a liberal and then later a conservative in the same week! Shouldn't I have agreed with one of them? lol....


Our superpower, IMO, is knowing how to help others. Fe being our dominant extroverted function drives us to do this, and Si helps us figure out what works best. I admit I used to be awful at helping others at first since I had no clue how to. Now that I know techniques, I want to make a life of it. I want it so much that I've gone back to school to become a nurse. Which so far has been good, but I'm really struggling with mental and this one physical problem with my eye which I didn't have to worry about in my first college go-round. It's tough to venture out into the new.


And a few more things with that...I'm still single, and I have really beaten myself up for that. You don't need to offer any words of advice...I've heard em all, and my Si helps me remember it too, lol. It just kills me to be in a family where my brothers got married straight out of college and had normal lives, and I've been the one that had to try and convince myself to be happy with different, nontraditional circumstances. Hopefully you fellow ISFJs realize how tall of an order that is.


Anyway. That's all for now...."
5598,isfj,"I never realise that an ISFJ would beat themselves up for being single! 
An ISFJ friend of mine often lament on the fact that she's still single, but I always assumed it was because she likes the idea of romance/wants to settle down because it is a major life milestones ... Is there any advice that you've had in the past that you felt was particularly helpful to you regarding this?"
5599,isfj,"I wouldn't say that any advice I received from others helped at all, haha. We ISFJs kinda just have to experience things for ourselves. I struggled for years with negative thoughts about myself over my singleness, and I read countless self help books over the years about making peace with crappy life circumstances. The only thing that actually resolved it was actually getting myself a girlfriend finally.
Today I am single, but I no longer catastrophize about it. Now that I have a couple major relationships under my belt, I am confident in my ability to start up another."
5600,isfj,"How did you meet your ex-girlfriends, may I ask? My friend is a sweet young lady and she has the skills to make friends and takes good care of herself, but I think she did not really put herself out there enough. She hates going out to socialise and meet new people, hobby is staying home and watch tv, and she spends a lot of time at work, all of which I think makes it difficult for her to find someone to start with."
5601,isfj,"Not having any control over their emotions. Learning to control their emotions and use their feelings to their advantage instead (e.g. empathizing, avoiding depression or anxiety, focusing on a task and not letting stress overwhelm)."
5602,isfj,"I am so attracted to you and have the deepest of love and appreciation for you.  I have only dated INFJ's and ISFJ's (not by choice, it just works out that way...before I even knew what MBTI was).  I feel like in many ways the INFJ is more of a natural fit, but the ISFJ completes me more in a developmental way.  So here's a list of:
Top 10 things I love about the ISFJ.

The ISFJ is SO ""cute""!!! - I feel like the ISFJ are the ""cutest"" type.  Where as I find the INFJ more hardcore and ""hot"" in their depth and complexity but, I've always been attracted to cuteness, lightness, innocence, positivity, and responsibility.  I've always thought Marge Simpson was an ideal partner (ISFJ).  You guys are societies' Disney Characters and I LOVE IT SO MUCH.
The ISFJ/ENTP combo makes the best fictional relationships - Jim Halpert (ENTP) and Pam Beesley (ISFJ), Back to the Future's Dr. Emmett Brown (ENTP) and Clara (ISFJ), Saul Goodman or Jimmy McGill (ENTP) and Kim Wexler (ISFJ) from Better Call Saul, Sebastian (ENTP) and Mia (ISFJ) from La La Land....I could go on...basically all of the enviable and great relationships in fiction are ENTP/ISFJ :D
The ISFJ ""Includer"" - As someone who feels lonely and a chronic misfit most of his life, I cherish those who are sensitive to including me and making sure I feel okay.  My ISFJ wife is so thoughtful and concerned about people being left out, feeling unwelcome, or being lonely.  ISFJ's are the champions of inclusion.  Thank you.
The ISFJ and fairness - As someone who is committed to justice and equality, the ISFJ develops ""fairness"" within my soul. This can be annoying at times, as what is fair is not always delivered on the same terms as justice and equality.  
Responsibility and Dutiful - These are the two things I do not naturally possess for things related to the ""day to day"" and the short term duties such as paying bills, keeping commitments, following through.  The ISFJ helps me in this.  And in return, when it comes to core values, long term vision, and things that have lasting impact, I help the ISFJ first be able to see the big picture and remind them why it's important to stay true to your values (or develop them for yourself in the first place).  When it comes to long term commitment, I have no issues.
The ISFJ is ""Good"" - I love how you are so ""light"", I can see it in your eyes.  You are such an example of random acts of kindness and charity.  Again, thank you for this example.  I can be inclined to fudge things, bend rules, even tell white lies when I feel it serves a bigger purpose, and the ISFJ is there to remind me to be totally honest.
ISFJ's are surprisingly deep - I know they can seem superficial, but that's only when they are limited in their exposure to others who are deep.  The ISFJ has the ability to ""know"" things about people, they are surprisingly good readers of character when emotions aren't being manipulated.  When there is a manipulator out there who could use the ISFJ's emotional susceptibility, the ENTP has your back.
The ISFJ saves souls - I feel like the ISFJ's in my life have rescued me from some really dark places and really have a deep love of God or whatever you wanna call it and feels love very deeply in a divine kind of way.  The ISFJ's do this.
My kind of sexy - Like I said, I always thought Marge Simpson was sexy.  Why?  Because of that goodness factor, that sweetness...and then out of the blue they blow you away with their surprisingly intense sexual passion.  I've always been attracted to modesty - the clean and self-respecting girl - I've never kissed a woman I didn't love, and held off on sex until marriage.  It was worth it.
A good balance of being grounded and tolerant - You let me explore.  I need that.  And then, you bring me back down to earth.  I need that too.

​"
5603,isfj,"As a researcher, I've gotta ask what your sample size is here. This is a nice post but it does feel conditional as a previous commenter pointed out, and many of your points are viewed exclusively through the lens of your romantic relationships.  Many of the things you say are quite nice, and definitely hold good nuggets of truth (like the includer bullet point!) but when people disagree with you in the comments about how they identify themselves, you're pushing back and telling them to deal with it, instead of trying to listen to their perspective. I'd encourage you to try to apply the points on this list to ISFJ friends or colleagues and modify it to be more reflective of actions or behaviors rather than subjective opinion, because as you know, our romantic selves are only one facet of our personality. There are lots of experts here who could help you fine tune your list!"
5604,isfj,"Was it hard to produce such an organized final peice? 😜Just giving ya crap. D’awhhh. If you feel so inclined, you can find many a posts of me gushing about my entp and what I love about you spazzy beautifuls as well! :D "
5605,isfj,"The ISFJ is SO ""cute""!!!
No I'm not.
The ISFJ/ENTP combo makes the best fictional relationships
I am with INTP. Can somewhat confirm.
The ISFJ ""Includer""
Yes. I do that often.
The ISFJ and fairness
Not anymore. Life isn't fair and you have to be unfair to climb.

Everything else is subjectively lovey-dovey."
5606,isfj,"So... some thoughts since I have some time.
I don't feel like you can believe in personality typing but not in being specifically attracted to those types for specific reasons. It's kind of the same as believing in astrology and thinking you're attracted to say, Capricorns, because they are studious, ""good"", responsible, grounded, and fair. I didn't see most of the list as conditional, I saw it as a list of the things you like and notice about us when we're at our best or when they come out. I'm sure you have a list of 10 things you HATE about ISFJ, but it's not like they would apply 100% of the time I assume. I doubt you expect us to all be tolerant to everyone and everything and never lose our temper or decide enough is enough, or to be so responsible as to never ever forget a deadline or something. 
Number 8 and 9 though, honestly, have nothing to do with being an ISFJ. Tons of us have no waited for sex until marriage but are still modest, and self-respecting. Many of us do not even believe in a God or in anything divine let alone have a ""deep love of God."" You're probably looking for a churchgoing woman, not an ISFJ, if you want a religious virgin who does random acts of good and works with charity, because those are not personality traits and they are not universal. I do see that you say it's been the ISFJs in your life specifically that have this love of god, but it might just be where you're meeting the people who are coincidentally ISFJs.
However, while I'm sure this list was inspired by your partner and you were being playful in your responses, some people don't see playful tones all the time online. So, trying to say ,""soooo DEAL with it! :P :P :P :P"" becomes ""uh, just deal with it."" 
It is your use of the word CLEAN in point #9 that is actually a problem in my opinion. And things like 'clean' or 'unclean' are certainly not personality traits that you can apply to an entire group of people like that. You honestly could rephrase that entire point to be a lot less disrespectful. "
5607,isfj,"I saw your other posts and I think you are kind of right in both the worst and best aspects of an ISFJ. I hope you and your marriage recover from her actions, really... I'm in a relationship with an ENTP and we have been through rough times, I can understand the frustration you express in your rant post bc well..I saw my SO through that too. I also had the impulse to ""run away"" from our relationship and pursue a simpler man.. I never did anything totally disloyal like kissing or anything, but maybe it would have been considered as emotional cheating... I guess with all the stresses and differences exposed, she feels like you two maybe can't work together. That may not be necessary true, but it can be difficult and long process, bc ISFJ are very reluctant to change and outside pressure for changing can shut us down. I'm glad you are going to marriage counseling. Wish you the best. 
Edit: I'm glad I didn't went with the ""simpler"" guy and stayed loyal to my partner, we complement perfectly and I love his humor and the conversations we have. "
5608,isfj,"Haha screw you! <3.  That’s actually a huge misconception about us spazzy beautifuls, we can be incredibly organized when it comes to complex and or things we are interested in but when it comes to paying bills or shiz like that....crap shoot.  I’m new to reddit and have had sooooo much going on so I don’t have a ton of time but where can I find some of your writings  of my infamous type?  😘"
5609,isfj,"No offense, but I think your response was kind of cute.  Cuteness is a subjective thing isn't it?  
On the fairness thing...I think that's where the NTP/SFJ combo brings so many interesting perspectives to the table.  The justice/equality thing is more of the ""life isn't fair and you have to be unfair to climb"" perspective.  The fairness, to me, is a perspective that is more compassionate and considerate of feelings.  
You are quite the edgy ISFJ - I like it :D. 
And I am a romantic, so deal with it."
5610,isfj,"Understood. I just caught up on the post history and now understand the context. I think all of us who are interested in MBTI run the risk of conflating one person's (or a small number of people's) personality traits with the traits of a personality type, both good and bad. There are common threads that most of us have in common, but we are all ultimately very different people."
5611,isfj,"I've been tailing your posts on ISFJs for the past couple of days, and I have learned more than I thought I could. Thanks for blazing that trail.
​
This is not unlike that student in class that asks an off-tangent question that takes the class off course but at the end of the collaborative conversational journey we all come away more knowledgable than the pre-structured curriculum intended. 
​
I take my hat off to you."
5612,isfj,"Hi, I recently just found out that I am an ISFJ. Reading the description about it, it is completely 100% relatable for me.
Well here is a little background of me. Since high school, I have always been quite social and knows a lot of people here and there but I don't really have a deep connection with anyone even my few best friends. Not that I don't enjoy their company, but something is definitely missing from it. For example, like when we are in a group of 3, 2 of my friends will be very compatible with each other and I will mostly hear them talking and only sometimes participate in their conversation. Most probably, this is because I don't really open up with anybody (I can't and mostly I don't know what bothers me the whole time). But still I am very grateful to have them in my life, but at the same time I feel like something is wrong with me.
Now that I am in uni, same thing still happen to me that I think would change. I met people here and there and made some very close friends too. People around me said I am a kind and genuine friends because I really like to help people. But still, I am always out of chemistry with anyone when things started to get personal. I never want to let my problems spilled to others as it will make me somehow vulnerable. Things I hate is that people took me for granted like I didn't matter like almost invisible sometimes.
All the traits that ISFJ have really reflected on me. Sometimes I feel like I don't want to be such a sensitive person, you know just like the person that doesn't give a shit. Sometimes I feel like I don't need to have approval from others. Sometimes I just want to be a carefree person and do whatever the fuck i want without any hesitation. With this things revolves around me, everything really seems unpleasant to me. (friends,relationships, careers etc.)
Then again, I really only want to be the person to easily express my feeling and not be easily taken granted of. So I am just wondering if anybody here has been in this shoes before, and how did they go against this natural personality?
TLDR ; I feel like crap being too available for everyone and being taken for granted most of the time even actually I did it genuinely. I hate this conflicting stuff about me that wanting to have approval from others as well as genuinely helping them at the same time. Most of my friends seems unnatural around me (or I might have overthink this). How would you go away around solving this issue?"
5613,isfj,"i have had the same problems. and i've come to completely change how i handle my self image and how i deal with people. best i can explain it is with metaphors, please bare with me.
my heart can be really sensitive. so i want to guard it from hurt. i fear building relationships because that requires me to expose it to people. and i've been hurt before. so i want to put my heart in a cage. a really sturdy one where only the few people i put through thorough inspection can have access to view it, even touch it.
but the thing about it is that my heart is sensitive because it doesn't get touched enough. the smallest poke is excruciating and the gentlest stroke is heavenly, because it has been deprived so long from any contact. 
instead i found that if i let it out and understand that pokes and touches are a normal and expected part of living my life, i begin to see that pokes aren't so bad and caresses are nice but aren't as euphoric as i once thought. and my heart isn't as sensitive anymore. my expectations of disappointment, hurt, as well as friendship, and love become more centered and realistic and less on the extremes of pessimism/optimism.
and it allows me to be strong. not the hardened cage around my heart kind of strong which in actuality is isolation and defensiveness to defend a frail heart. but the real kind of strong: no walls, no cage, compassionate yet bulletproof and most importantly free."
5614,isfj,I have the same issue as you in that I don't easily form deep connections with people and have a hard time opening up. Ive noticed that I have an easier time with people who are INFJ or who are also ISFJ. Idk why that is but I feel more comfortable being vulnerable with people who are similar in personality. I guess I feel like they're more likely to understand and relate to me. 
5615,isfj,"I think you should definitely try to open up with your friends, despite thinking you might be burdening them. Sharing something personal about yourself helps to increase a sense of intimacy with another person, and if you start opening up with them, they will feel permission to open up with you too."
5616,isfj,"I’m new to learning Myers Briggs but I was just talking about this with my s/o yesterday. Even with him I find myself sometimes holding back. The issue was when hanging with his friends I was keeping to myself and never really contributed to the group conversation. This has been an issue even since I can remember though.   I love listening to conversations but I really wish I could break through and connect more deeply with people. That being said though, my best friend is an ISFJ as well and I find myself comfortable with her. "
5617,isfj,"you put your point across so well! i really loved reading your comment. :-) 
and OP, there's nothing wrong with you for having this issue. there are many others out there with the same issue, please don't be too hard on yourself! i wish you all the best and i hope you find that missing piece."
5618,isfj,"Hello everyone. I'm in need of some advice. My mom is an ISFJ and she has been in a very depressed state for several years now. She has become neglectful of my younger sister, she doesn't take care of herself or anything else without being told to do so, and she has become addicted to playing videogames to the point where she is in her room sitting on her bed everyday playing. She is unable to work due to rheumatoid arthritis which enables her to play all day. I understand what it is to be depressed so I was more than willing to help raise my sister, make sure the house chores got done, and bills got paid. However, I don't know how to help any further. Recently, she has been making minor improvements but I'm afraid that she is just going to fall back into the downward spiral of depression again, which has happened several times before.
Any advice you can give would be wonderful. 
In case that it might help when giving advice, I'm an INFJ. "
5619,isfj,"As an isfj going through a bout of depression, all I really need from my loved ones is a deep, tight hug. It's really hard to ask since I'm so used to taking care of everyone else. I don't want to bring anyone around me down, so I tend to crawl into myself and let the world exist around me. I'm sorry you're going through this. I hope your mom feels back to herself soon. "
5620,isfj,"This is a thing that happens. Children end up having to take on the role of a parent because the parent takes on the role of a child. It's confusing and upsetting and it ultimately leads to you becoming a highly capable person. Some things you should be careful about: sex problems, drug problems, and other addictions. Common in people who grow up like this.
As for your mom: Try to empathize with her situation, and help to build her up. All of you are better off if you can get her healthy. That can be very difficult. You very likely need help from a combination of people who understand these kinds of things.
What is your extended family like? Any help there?"
5621,isfj,"There was a similar thread a while ago in /r/getdisciplined: [Need Advice] My mother is addicted to video games, and it will only take a turn for the worse.
Maybe there is some advice for you in there."
5622,isfj,"First of all, I heard on youtube that arthritis is caused by a certain bacteria when there's too much of them in the body. Anything that kills unwanted bacteria, such as Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar or some kind of fermented vegetable drink with probiotic (good) bacteria, such as beet kvas, will get rid of a lot of unwanted bacteria. I started to get arthritic pain in my knees, but then I fixed it by drinking the things I just mentioned. So your mother should try those. Also how about getting a boyfriend or pets? I'm going to get pet rats because I heard they're very affectionate & intelligent. Either one of those should be great to lift her spirits. "
5623,isfj,"One or two will help a little. However, the rest just berate her intensely, my grandmother and my two eldest siblings included. I do empathize with her but truth is I'm an adult and want to start living my own life but because I feel it is my duty to help her I stay. I feel as though I'm suffocating and like my life is going no where real fast and I am currently sick and the doctors still haven't found the cause and I just feel like it may be due to the stress. My mental health feels as though it is on a steady decline. I seriously don't know what to do."
5624,isfj,"Hello,
I met a someone who fits the profile of an isfj on OK Cupid.
We met for a happy hour and talked for about two hours.  She was very sweet.  I'm an ENFP and something about her was so intoxicating.  She kept playing with her hair the whole time and then kind of rubbed my back as I walked her back to her car.  I felt this extremely strong flutter of electricity run through me when she did that.  Like I had just dropped straight down a roller coaster.  I was intoxicated by how beautiful she was and everything.
We got to her car and my eyes just locked on her's.  We said goodbye, and some how we were holding hands.  Then somehow we kissed.  Not french kissing, just a sweet little kiss.  There was this moment of ""oh no"" in her eyes right before it.  It wasn't something I planned or even thought about, it just came out from how much feeling was happening.  It's hard to explain.  To me it felt like my soul was reaching out, not my head or brain or mind or whatever, not my body or anything, just something beyond all that.
Anyway, she's gone away on business for 10 days.  We've texted a few times.  Sometimes I feel abandoned and have issues with that so now that she's gone it feels kind of sad and I'm anxious.  How should I proceed?
Being kind of insecure I asked her about 3 times toward the end of our date if she wanted to do this again.  She said yes all three times.  I'm a little nervous about having to initiate a lot and don't want to get rejected.  I texted her after the date could text me anytime and she texted back I ""could text her anytime too lol.""  I haven't mentioned the kiss or anything like that.  Just told her to have fun on her trip.
What's the best thing I can do now that she's gone on business for so long and I'm very curious about her still?
Thank you!"
5625,isfj,"This made me feel really happy inside. My first love and serious relationship was with an ENFP so I really understand what you're describing. That electricity between you, you'll never feel that exact feeling without that match. 
It sounds like you had a wonderful date c: Absolutely perfect in my opinion honestly. It's truly unfortunate that she had to leave so soon for an extended amount of time, I'm sorry you're feeling that way. She didn't abandon you, if you felt that really special something with her she probably felt it too. I know it sucks but you've really just got to find things to keep busy and try to enjoy your time between seeing her again.
It's okay to feel insecure, but I think she likes you and will definitely be seeing you again. She did say yes three times right? If you're feeling too anxious or bothered you can just text her and chat a little, just talking to her will help. I understand it's a business trip though so I don't know how her free time is. She probably won't bring up the kiss either, probably still thinking about it, reminiscing perhaps ha. 
The best thing you can do is wait as patiently as you can for her to come back while expressing a caring and interest in her. I always appreciate someone checking on on me once a day and asking how I am, how my day was. Just a show of your caring and interest is nice. Remember little details about her, favourite things, take an interest in her thoughts/opinions and you'll get close in no time c: Good luck!"
5626,isfj,"Thank you so much for such a generous and kind reply!
I texted her today and we chatted for quite a while.  5 hours actually.  The conversation kind of evaporated at the end without any real goodbye.  We were sending like 4 texts at a time.  She sent me a picture of her and I told her she was pretty.  She took the compliment really well.  I sent her a picture of me and said I look precious.  What an isfj word, huh?  Kind of has that caring connotation, wanting to take care of something, precious.  The conversation kind of evaporated at the end.  I sent her another picture and she said it was cute, then answered the question I had asked and the conversation kind of ended.
I'm glad you encouraged me to show an interest in her while she's gone, or I wouldn't have known whether or not to text her.  I wondered, should I text her or not?  As an ENFP it feels like sometimes I share too much, I just didn't want to overwhelm her.  I know she's concerned about rushing things and isfj's need time for things to develop and process things until they feel it's their turn to participate.  Plus it's not good to come off as needy.  It feels like our texting usually results in her kind of ending the conversation.  Actually, more just not continuing it.  I suppose that's when she needs time to process things.  These cycles of talking and then not talking are kind of nice.
Well anyway, thanks again!  I'm really glad to have your feedback and would appreciate any more you care to share.  It means a lot and has helped a lot, too. :)"
5627,isfj,"You're so very welcome! 
That's wonderful! I'm so happy you had such a lengthy conversation, I bet it eased a lot of your worries as well c: Ah, the evaporating conversation, don't take it as a bad thing. I eventually just don't have much to say or I'm all socialized-out and need time to be alone with my thoughts. Precious is such a cute and affectionate word haha.  Don't worry about conversations ending that way unless she is obviously not okay or sad, something along those lines really. 
I figured you'd want some reassurance about whether or not that would be best. I can really enjoy the sharing from ENFP's, especially when I'm interested in them. I take your sharing and interests as passion and it's very admirable and enjoyable to hear. Definitely take things slow but show that you care. As you have been by texting her and letting her know you've thought about her and enjoy talking to her. I don't think you're coming off as needy, you're doing very well from what I can tell. Yes! ""I suppose that's when she needs time to process things. These cycles of talking and then not talking are kind of nice."" You have an understanding of how it works. There's a balance that I almost need honestly. I love to talk, listen and spend time with someone but I need that time where we are not talking and I can be alone with my thoughts. Keeps me sane to have time to go through events and process how I'm feeling. 
You're welcome! I shared more in this reply so I hope it's just as helpful. She may vary from me so as you get closer to her you can ask about what she really feels to make sure. Otherwise I'd say you're doing very well, she likes you and I wish you both all the best c:"
5628,isfj,After reading a few relationship section of ISFJs online how accurate does it describe you? Do you put your SO desires before your own? How open are you to try new things even if it makes you uncomfortable? Does your shyness carry over? 
5629,isfj,"Yes, highly value pleasing my partner. I used to do things that made me uncomfortable just to please my partners but have finally quit that (still compromise of course but wouldn't do anything I really don't want to do like I did in past).
My shyness does carry over at times but after being in a long-term relationship with my current boyfriend that is not an issue.
I also am pretty exhibitionist, doing things on cam and posting pics etc. Pretty sure this is actually due to my desire to please others -- I can please a lot of guys by camming/pics which in turn arouses me.
I normally post here on my alt account but since this is a sex-related question, why not use my main? Lol"
5630,isfj,"INTP here so can't speak from personal experience. But from some research I find that that could definitely be the case. With Fe being the second function in play ISFJs gain a sense of pleasure in helping others. (Can be related to sex as well I'm sure.) Si being the primary function. As an introverted sensor(Si) practical traditions that make sense to to the individual play a huge role in basically any interaction with them. So add in practiced extraverted feeling (Fe) as that second function, and I'd imagine it would just be second nature to put others before themselves.
There will always be exceptions to this of course depending on life experience and maturity. But id say in general ISFJs will be fairly selfless people. Though deep down I think it might be a slightly selfish action (not in a bad way.) but I feel like the personal satisfaction they get out of helping people makes it so worth it to them. So maybe not selfish but a fair balance at least "
5631,isfj,"I wouldn't say my shyness carries over because there is nothing I am shy about in my relationship with my husband.
I'm willing to try anything once as long as it doesn't involve adding another person to the mix. My SO's desires don't come before or after my own desires. As long as both of us are having fun, then both of us are getting taken care of (if you know what I mean)."
5632,isfj,"Recently I've met an isfj who I think is interesting! It's hard to break her shell.. And the rare times that we do and click,  I feel happy! Her personality reminds me of a "" black cage"". I think we would totally balance each other out! (I'm an enfp) so how do I get her to open up? It can be hard communicating."
5633,isfj,"For me, I won't really open up until I know someone for some time. I don't like to share my feelings even with people I'm close with because I feel like a burden, so if you want an isfj to open up, it is probably best to try and bring up things that are relevant to her (or try to) and she will probably add on. That usually is how I start to open up to people."
5634,isfj,"Appreciate little details that you see her do, and make note of weird conversational ticks. Complement her in a non-intimate way. ISFJs love that shit. We subtly vie for attention from those we give everything to. Sometimes it falls short of our expectations and eats our consciences. Just appreciate your friendship together and spend time with her and I'm sure the openness will follow shortly."
5635,isfj,"Hey I like being an ISFJ overall. Although being a male ISFJ has been difficult in trying to fit in with a society where most males are thinkers. 
Pros: Dependable, Responsible, Great at Following Through, Compassionate, Empathetic, Sees the best in others, Good at Planning
Cons: Difficult living in the moment, can be conflict averse, taking criticism to personally, difficulty making drastic lifestyle changes
You know when you’re an ISFJ when someone starts crying and feeling bad in the room and you start to feel bad for them. "
5636,isfj,"Both pros, cons, you know when you’re an isfj:
Pros: You get along with mostly everyone (maybe excluding entjs and some intjs lol, our Fe wears on them). Organized (Si). Impeccable subjective memory (Si). You know how to present yourself appropriately in most situations (Fe). You can stick to a routine/habit no problem (ie workout 4x/week, eat yogurt daily) (Si). You know how to take care of yourself and others physically (sexually or otherwise) (Si, Fe). Once you’re a little older, you don’t get as butthurt over people who are direct (Ti). Once you’re older, you become really open minded (Ne). 
Cons follow the pros: You question your intelligence (maybe that’s a me problem, or a 3rd Ti problem). You’re fearful of unknowns (4th Ne). Annoying subjective memory (Si). Your debate skills are shit, on the fly is not your style (Ti/ne 3rd, 4th). You can miss the point of it all (4th Ne). You’re not efficient (Polar Te). You’re not great in the moment (Whitty) (ignoring Se, 4th Ne). You fear the future (role Ni). You vaguely know what you want (Fi) But have an innate need to make sure others get want they want first (Fe). You feel lost in life (4th Ne soooo many possibilities!).

5637,isfj,"I've never actually officially gotten in actual relationship before.
In elementary school, I was kinda sorta with someone (my guess she was ESXP). We were really good friends from like 3rd-7th grade and we kissed once (in 7th grade) but I was so awkward and insecure and immature and questioned if she liked me or not (my guess is she probably did). There was this awkward moment that had us not talking for a while.
From up until I finished college, there have a been a few people I liked but was too insecure to try anything (one thing I did was confess to someone in high school but got rejected. Thankfully we stayed friends and that didn't get awkward).
I'm now a 25 year old Male (turning 26 next year). Recently my social life is mostly going to local anime/cosplay gatherings and conventions (which are really fun). I've met some really cool people but haven't had any relationship progress (not sure if I'm trying too hard to find someone in this social group? I feel like it's my best bet since I'm a pretty big anime/video game nerd).
I guess my problem now is just needing to actually socializing more, being less shy/more confident and just find someone I can be comfortable with and feel like it could be a good long term relationship (that's my ideal).
But enough of about me, I'm curious how fellow ISFJs have gotten with their significant other(s). This post could probably just be asked on some relationship/confidence sub or whatever but I feel like I'd be able to relate to stories/advice that fellow ISFJs would give lol."
5638,isfj,"First two from online gaming/forums (both lived far away, as the downside).
Current one: Went out (a rare occasion) to play a D&D type board game with some acquaintances. While there we were drinking, and a few people walk in through the doorway. This guy says ""hey! He plays league and so does gretay, you should play together!"" and I thought he was super hawt so I wrote down my summoner name on a taco bell receipt and gave it to him. And then later that week he had added me on league and we joked and flirted a lot and then started hanging out in person etc etc. I think the key for me is to have some sort of online connection with a person because I feel much more comfortable online than in person (at first at least, now I'm comfortable irl with him lol). 
It takes going out of your comfort zone to meet people. I learned that someone wasn't just going to walk up to me and say I was awesome and we should be friends/a couple. So I started to be more open about asking people to do things, and going out even though it can be stresaful/scary... You'll meet someone eventually!"
5639,isfj,"My first SO was straight out of high school so I don't feel like that should count. We were together for 7.5 years, which took me all the way past college and then some. Getting into the dating scene when you're 23 is really weird and challenging. I had no idea of what to do. 
I knew the clubs were definitely not my thing and going out to socialize in large unfamiliar groups sounded daunting. So I opted for the interwebs. I was here on reddit and then OKCupid. Went on a lot of dates - some good, some bad. But I eventually found my my SO on Okc. 
He told me that when he was dating he would always follow through with a date no matter how he felt about the other person to practice feeling comfortable conversing with strangers. Might be helpful for you too. 
Edit 1: OKC was a nice place to look since you can see what people's interests are and also gauge their personalities somewhat. At least that's how I felt. "
5640,isfj,"Most of the people I've dated have just been people I met when I happened to be in the same place they were (class, youth groups, etc). I almost always waited for them to approach me first, or for some hint to be dropped as I was too insecure to try anything on my own. There were a few times I went out of my comfort zone when I was younger, and it made me feel incredibly uncomfortable.
My current SO I met while going out for coffee with a friend. He was a friend of my friend, and they met up at the coffee shop. I complimented him, and he reciprocated. From there I tried to judge whether or not he was into me, and spent a bit of time on the phone and talking online before getting brave enough to mention the idea of dating.
One thing I found that helps with confidence is making online friends. Try to be the person you want to be online (not to a ridiculous point, but more confident and relaxed) and some of it will carry over to regular life. Also, I find that face to face interaction is the hardest, so maybe start building relationships through texting or phone calls."
5641,isfj,I was in an abusive relationship and met my current boyfriend after talking to him about it for awhile until I realized how awful it was to be dating that piece of shit.  I really got to know him and we ended up together and have been for 4 years now (19F).  He ended up teaching me how to play video games because my ex told me that it would fuck up my life to play video games.  I've made so many friends through the gaming community and gaming has really strengthened our relationship.
5642,isfj,Title says it all. I'm an ENTP dating an ISFJ and simply put I have fallen hard for her. I feel that she's also falling for me and this brings me to my request for advice. How do I keep one of you from getting beyond irritated with me? I don't want to be insensitive and mess up because I enjoy a good argument or because I want to explore an idea further. I want this to actually work. How do I make this work?
5643,isfj,"My boyfriend is an ENTP and I'm an ISFJ and we have been together for almost two years. Because we are opposites there are bound to be disagreements on things. One thing that makes me really stressed out is when my ENTP can't make a plan. Being an ISFJ I live off planning so I really appreciate it when my boyfriend puts in the time to also plan things even when he hates to. That's probably one of the biggest things. Also show your emotions, reassurance is key. We ISFJs are very in touch with our emotions so it's nice to have someone express theirs too. Be open. We love being there for people so allow us to be "
5644,isfj,"Well ENTP here, so I obviously can't speak for ISFJs, and I haven't sat down and thought deeply about this topic.  
But something that came to my mind was just appreciation. In general love/relationships to me should be about appreciation. Yea of course we are different. But that is okay.  
For example I really appreciate ISFJs for their warmth, kindness, loyalty. I find it impressive how organized, structured, and practical they can be, because it is my own weak spot.  
If you really like something about someone, I think it is very great to show appreciation. But it should come out of willingness to appreciate, not forcefulness because you have to. You genuinely have to appreciate it out of love for them.  
There's tons of nice things I appreciate about ISFJs, and telling them that I appreciate them for it, and the joy I can see in their faces is really priceless and makes me happy too.  
If you really deeply care about someone, there's nothing better than appreciating them, and making them feel loved and cared for. That you notice all the things they do, big and small, and that it is valued. Because ultimately it translates into you value them for who they are.  
I simply just appreciate them, because I love to do it, not because I have to. It makes me feel wonderful too, and closer connected to them.  
It is also just basic psychology, if you appreciate a behavior from a certain person you show gratitude towards that behavior, because that gratitude might motivate that person to keep doing it. If they didn't get the gratitude, they might stop that behavior for whatever reason, because well, what is the fruits of it? No one cares anyway, and that is a shame.  "
5645,isfj,"Over time ISFJ can start to feel taken for granted. We show we care by taking care of people and tasks. Be cognizant of what she does for you and thank/acknowledge her for it. 
PP mentioned to planning. If you just can’t get yourself to make plans for whatever reason at least thank her for doing it for you both of you. "
5646,isfj,This. I understand that she has very strong emotions but she's impossible expressing them. It makes someone like me who will always say exactly what I think and feel without regard very conscious of that fact. So I've avoided saying it in response to being aware of how reserved she can be and risking ruining a great thing.
5647,isfj,"I believe I'm an ISFJ and I'm thinking about becoming an italian teacher (I'm a native speaker) in the USA. I have permanent residence and I'll soon have work authorization as well. I heard lots of nice comments from Americans about Italian people and the italian language. My main concern is that I might have hard time dealing with some students given the I'm an ISFJ. I'm very sensitive and I can get embarrassed pretty easily (for example if I make a mistake) . I'm not sure I would be okay with speaking in front of lots of people. On the other hand, I love languages and this is my main passion so I don't know what else I could do. I'm also assuming that most of my future students would be friendly and really interested in learning since Italian is not a language that is commonly taught (such as Spanish) - so if they choose it, it means that they are willing to work hard. As a student I was always shy and I remember how difficult some of my classmates were to deal with from the teacher's perspective. I read online that ISFJs are perfect teachers for kids because we're patient and caring, but I don't know about high-school. Should I consider getting a master to teach in college so that I deal with older students? I'm also thinking that it might be difficult at first but after some years I'll get used to it. Thoughts?"
5648,isfj,"I'm a foreign language teaching ISFJ! I did get a masters but with a certification so I could teach in public schools. My youngest student was 3 and my oldest 85. I'm surprised that teaching middle school age is my favorite with adults a close second. Because I love it so much, I don't get the anxiety that I get with other things. Like you said, people will take Italian because they want to know. There's a shared interest. And making a mistake isn't really that big a deal. Just be meek enough to correct it as soon as you notice. Now I'm working with refugees and other migrants. It's rewarding while still using my specific skills. Becoming a teacher was the single best thing I've ever done. Maybe you should tutor before you make a final decision. Your ISFJ patience could be a huge asset. "
5649,isfj,Thank you so much for your reply :) I really appreciated it. I'll definitely start with tutoring first and then I'll make my final decision. It's nice to see that there are other people with the same interests! 
5650,isfj,"Young adult fiction (I'm 22 but I still love 'em), fantasy, a lot of sci-fi!
I recently read Halfway Human by Carolyn Ives Gilman, and it was so good, I CANNOT stop thinking about it! Currently I'm reading The Authority, the last book of the series ""The Culling"" by Ramona Finn (a teen scifi series)."
5651,isfj,"Genre-wise i love sci fi and fantasy. 
Plot-wise I love stories where characters try really hard. I have a soft spot for stories about single parents or about a parent and child relationship. And I also find social/political maneuvering to be very interesting to read."
5652,isfj,I used to be crazy over fantasy when I was younger. It's still interesting now but I'm mainly attracted to crime and mystery as well. A lot of the young adult fiction novels seem to be about these genres.
5653,isfj,"i suppose it’s more like ancestry of animals and theory of evolution. I just think knowing how things like snakes, fish, us, bear... how all of us came to be and everything like that. it’s very interesting to read about. and then I also just like reading about animals and their behaviors. "
5654,isfj,"Do you have someone in your life who really knows who you are?
If not is it something you crave at times? 
There is a conversation that has stayed with me eversince. One night a dear ISFJ confessed that in fact no one truly knew him and that carrying a mask has made him wish to pack a bag and disappear. He said that if people knew his true self, they'd be surprised of how different it is.
Besides it pains him greatly that he can't ask certain questions. He had a deep connection with his grandfather who passed away a couple of years ago. His talkative and tender grandma would be  happy about any conversation but there is a blockage.
Do these problems sound familar? 
Thank you for reading :)"
5655,isfj,"Oof, that hits home hard.
Okay this is going to be a long post but, it I feel there a lot of different parts that really connect and I could go deeper but this is just a general feeling of it.
I can speak for my experience though I don’t know if all ISFJ’s feel like this. But, I know that feeling. 
I honestly don’t know where to start but, when you’ve worn a mask for so long, and the people you know and come to expect that mask, it’s hard to take it off and be yourself. Especially if you don’t act or think they way they want you to or expected. Extra points if they’re more so harsh and reject it hard. 
I feel like a lot of people really don’t know the real me and I do wear a mask often enough. Around everybody, even family and friends. It comes to point you feel like you can’t be yourself at all and you really just want to pack up your bags and leave. Go to where no one knows you and you don’t have this image you have to keep up. Just to feel that freedom of starting over and nobody knowing you. I crave that hard. 
This mask doesn’t just show up. It comes from a lot of areas. There’s the social pressure of trying to be a good upstanding citizen, the internal expectation to try and be this perfect individual and do no wrong, and then there’s the expectation or/and obligation of your friends and family around you that you must be this certain way. It happens as you grow when your “good” side is praised by others more and then rejected/scolded if your “bad” side shows and it sticks with you. I’m no good with rejection so it hits home harder to try and be this person that’s expected, even though it’s not always truly me. 
I also think that the mask isn’t fake entirely and we’re not showing our “true” self, rather were not showing our entire self. The darker and more risky side. The more humanistic and imperfect that we know is there. 
A lot of my friends and family often tell me I’m nice, kind, smart, and friendly. I have no malicious intent with my actions and I’m always trying to do the best that I can.  That side of me is true. I am that but, that’s not all of me. 
I’m not perfect and I get mad, sad, angry, depressed, stubborn, anxious and so much more but, I have a hard time showing those sides because they get rejected or people don’t like acknowledging that I’m imperfect too. 
It not just feelings, it’s future plans or little wants that you want for yourself. 
But often enough when you try and show what’s passed the mask that’s people expect, they don’t want to see it. Go back to who you “are”.  I know who I am and question a lot about myself but, I’m not entirely the person they describe at all. 
I remember a classmate surprised that I was skipping a school day for no reason. I value school but, I don’t like my time wasted when nothing was going to happen that day. She just didn’t ‘expect’ me to be that ‘kind of person’. I seemed more like a ‘good straight edge student’. 
Or last night I talked to my mom about my possible wedding in the future and that I wanted to get eloped at the court house and thrift/alter my wedding dress (I’ve thought about this for awhile), she laughed at my idea of it and cut off the conversation right there and told me to keep thinking about it and that I’ll change my mind. 
Two different things I know but when your constantly told or rejected about being you or doing something that you want, it’s extremely hard and tiring to wear that mask all the time. 
Also the reason why I’m planning on moving to Germany because I feel like I can’t psychically stay where I am because of that damn mask and expectations. The more the months go on the more the feeling to go gets stronger.  I just want to pack, leave, and never go back. There, I get the chance at being truly me. 
Your ISFJ friend must be trusting of you to share that side of them. It’s hard sharing that side because we try to be this perfect person when we know that we’re not. Please don’t reject or freak out when we say certain things that you don’t expect because it’s hard wearing that mask all the time and sometimes you just can’t stand it any longer. Plus, it helps us relax and feel like we can be ourselves. I’m working on that myself. Besides, sometimes that other part of ISFJ’s are a hell of a lot more fun and surprising then you could expect ;)
Sorry for the long post but I’m a rambler and it takes time for me to really think through my thoughts and get it all down. 
I hope this helps!"
5656,isfj,"I feel similarly. I feel I have many faces for all the people in my life, I imagine an expression of Fe. I’m so worried about perceptions and pleasing people, that I feel I don’t get a chance to really be “me” and I have to hide. It’s hard to explain. This, I suppose, is where Fe is found to be superficial and inauthentic. I would say the person who probably knows me most is my Entp boyfriend. But even then, I feel sometimes he sees the idea of me more than me- but is that most people? But he’s the only person I feel I can be myself around, and he appreciates every little piece of me. Which just reminded me of this incredible song. You’re welcome. ;) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6S6g3pEw8uU"
5657,isfj,I strangely relate to this. People have expectations of me and I'm trying or not to uphold them. Multiple masks. Different piece of you with different people. Nobody has seen the whole thing. Last day one dude got surprised because I told him that yes I actually failed an exam. He looked shocked. 
5658,isfj,"I don't even know who I truly am. Lol
But am 100% with you. The people who I love unconditionally, whether it be friend or family member, I am SO much at ease. My ISFJ guarding disappears into a very lively, happy, bubbly person. I am carried away by the conversation and am not purposefully trying to make the interaction go somewhere. That's how I wish it was most of the time :("
5659,isfj,"We all have different faces we allow others to see and based on them is how they perceive who we are. Contextually this is appropriate circumstantially, as in professional vs personal relationships. And, typically, ISFJ's accept others more willingly than we expect to be accepted. "
5660,isfj,"The reasons for wearing masks are numerous and it shows in your replies. Again thank you for sharing. Without wanting to steer away too much from ISFJ I have found something interesting  about wearing masks in relationships. 
https://jebkinnison.com/bad-boyfriends-the-book/fearful-avoidant/
The subject is such a multilayered one and this is just a small aspect, but nonetheless interesting."
5661,isfj,"Thank you for sharing your insight BlueEyesAnxiousMind :) , it's a difficult subject and you made it relatable.
I guess to a certain extend masks are a part of people's lives and many will know how tiring it already is to keep a straight face at work.
When it doesn't really stop at home with family members or when spending time with  the inner circle of friends are unaware of your needs. Maybe to some it means only getting a break when no one is around.
The ISFJ I know would have a strong urge to shield his family from any negativity and display a more superficial version of himself to make him less attackable and keep the focus away from him. He nods,he jokes around and no matter how miserable he feels he will still manage a smile while listening actively.
No friend,parent or sibling would ever expect him wanting to pack and leave to be himself for a moment, escaping expectations. Stop upholding a perfect image.
In the area where he grew up in, where everybody knows everybody and you have a reputation to uphold made it especially difficult.
It makes sense that you would get a sense of liberty being away from known territory for a while.
When being scolded has made you feel reserved, it can become so engrained that it seems familiar,like a part of you. Affection challenges this self image and might turn it upside down, maybe part of the mask comes off. That can be scary.
Would you say that you are kind to yourself? 
You would think that when an ISFJ speaks everyone listens up. Sadly your mother's reaction is familiar. A family member won't put much value to his words either. I'm sure none of them has bad intentions, but it's a burden nonetheless.
There remain many open questions but I didn't want to cut the flow by asking them. It was my time to listen. Just when he turned quiet, I asked if he would keep the line open, he said yes. But the window of opportunity closed. It hasn't happened since.
Maybe looking back he thinks of it as having an uncontrolled moment. You have to be comfortable for someone giving you their whole focus.
I don't think he is aware how much his words matter."
5662,isfj,"Thank you,Pieces is a good song.  :) And music a real messenger for what words otherwise can't convey sometimes. I once sent someone a song because I didn't have the words I needed at the moment. It was understood.
I'm glad you have found someone who sees you for who you are. "
5663,isfj,"Having people around that make you forget your surroundings and go with the flow is gold. I sometimes catch myself overthinking and not being in the moment for no apparent reason, so I appreciate those moments to the fullest."
5664,isfj,"Hey, Koalafied11, just a quick heads-up:
familar is actually spelled familiar. You can remember it by ends with -iar.
Have a nice day!

5665,isfj,I am in the beginning of a relationship with an ISFJ and I was wondering what’s up with his eye contact. When we’re talking he’s really into stuff we talk about and seems to really like me at most times. Will talk about future plans. But with eye contact I never catch him looking at me and if I look at him he doesn’t always looks back at me and if he does he doesn’t keep eye contact very long. With his other friends at work I see him making and maintaining eye contact. In bed he’s much better at keeping eye contact. So in the work environment why doesn’t he keep it? Am I intimidating to him in anyway? I am very outgoing person and keep eye contact very long easily. I’m an ESFJ. I don’t think it’s not because he doesn’t like me. Actually he’s one of the relationships that seems to like me the most. 
5666,isfj,"I also struggle with being able to maintain eye contact, and at least for me, it's for a couple different reasons. 
First of all, it depends on how well I know that person. With family, friends, or work colleagues I've known for a while, it's not a problem at all. However, if it's work clients I see twice a year or a new relationship, it's super difficult. ISFJs are very observant, so with a person they don't know well, they're trying to carry on a conversation while picking up cues and learning how that person best communicates. ISFJs also enjoy routine, so when something brand new comes along, it can throw us off our game.
In times when I'm in a new relationship, the above definitely applies, but my lack of eye contact also boils down to being nervous and unsure of myself. ISFJs crave validation, so they get concerned that the other person might not like them. I struggle with self-doubt, so I tend to hyper-analyze everything I've said and then wonder if I've somehow made the other person uncomfortable because of something I've said or done. In any new relationship, especially with a really great person, there's always room to feel intimidated and like they're out of your league, too.
Based on what you've said, he's definitely interested and I think the eye contact will get better with time. It sounds like you're both connecting really well so far, both physically and emotionally, so as he gets to know and feels more comfortable with you, the eye contact in more casual settings will improve."
5667,isfj,"Hmm.. I think he'll get better with time. Does he look at your face? 
I think I am unlike your ISFJ.. I am comfortable with eye contacts, even with strangers. I don't tend to look continuously in the eyes, but shift between eyes and surrounding part of their face like lower part of their face - generally. With people I am interested in romantically, I am heavy on contacting with the eyes! :) However, when I'm intimidated, uneasy or anxious or lying or just not comfortable enough sometimes because of one of my moods I cannot hold eye contact.."
5668,isfj,I also have an issue on long he takes to text me back sometimes. I’m the kind of person which texts back as fast as I can and it often take an hour or two for him to respond and I don’t get it. He has an Apple Watch. When I get a text from someone I like (which is most everyone I talk to) I will respond immediately. Is this something you do?
5669,isfj,"This made me smile because I have had to apologize to so many people about being a terrible texter. Sometimes texts come when my introvert self is ""recharging"" after being around people all day, so to avoid being exhausted by even more socializing I'll respond later. (He could also just be otherwise occupied - I tend to hold off whenever I'm at work, even if it's someone I really like.)"
5670,isfj,"INTP here
What the f@&$ do you want? :)
I'm talking about inconvenient illness like colds or stomach bugs.
My reaction is always logical. When faced with x, y and z well often help you feel better and recover. When I try this with someone who is isfj, it seems to upset them. 
I think they just want to be hugged for 48 hrs until it passes?"
5671,isfj,"When I am sick I want someone else to handle my basic needs. Making soup and bringing it to me in bed, making tea and drinking a cup with me, bring me any book I ask for, etc. (This is directed at my boyfriend at least)
When I was sick in the hospital and younger though, I didn't want many people around. My family was very upset I did not want anyone spending the night in the hospital with me and I was upset they kept insisting on not leaving me alone.
For the most part though, I just want to be entertained and not move around much. If my boyfriend seemed very robotic in stating: ""You have x condition. I will get you y and z for your pain. These will help because of their x properties,"" I would be kind of upset... I want him to sound concerned about my health and not just like my doctor.
My mom and boyfriend are both INTJs and they have a very distinct ""business"" tone and I hate when it's directed at me, only because I always see it used on strangers. So it sounds stupid, but it can also be the tone of how you're saying things that is upsetting. For me, I hear the tone of how things are said almost more than what is being said -- a neutral/nice thing said in a rather cold tone immediately makes me think ""Oh no, are they mad at me?"""
5672,isfj,"Guilty 0:)
Also me. It's my way of helping, because it's what I want when I'm sick. 
So you say you want to be entertained. Can you be specific about things I could do that you would like? I'm not good at ""entertaining"" as an INTP."
5673,isfj,"If I need anything from them I will ask. It's nice to get a ""how are you doing?"" text or call but I have had family and SOs ask me multiple times a day how I am and it gets to be a bit much! If I'm really desperate for something it is nice to ask them if they can bring it to me. Just ask them and communicate about what they want from you :)"
5674,isfj,"I mostly mean entertained just by reading a book or browsing the web or watching Netflix. So if I needed a book from the other room or needed the remote or something I'd wanted my boyfriend to bring it to me. With a friend I would expect a kot less and it's only because I've dated my SO for so long that I even feel okay letting him pamper me (although in my head I'd really want anyone to help me I would not say it outloud to almost anyone).
But yeah ISFJs do value alone time so I did not mean stay with me 24/7 while I am sick. Alone time is pretty refreshing as long as I have something to do even if it's just reddit."
5675,isfj,"My mother is an ISFJ. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, she'll just stop talking. I ask her why, and she says she's thinking. 
But these pauses are more than just one or two seconds. They're much longer than I expect a ""just thinking"" pause to take—to me, it feels like she's just shut down the conversation without warning.
Do you have a hard time thinking on your feet? Do you need more time to process information or answer questions than, say, an ENTP might?
I know my mom feels like I put too much pressure on her to answer quickly. However, when she just STOPS talking in the middle of a conversation without even saying, ""Hm, let me think about that,"" I get kind of frustrated. Please help me out here, ISFJs! :)"
5676,isfj,"In short, yes. For me, it's because I like to think about a situation from different angles/perspectives. I often play devil's advocate and want to understand all sides. Sure, there's a gut answer, but I want to be empathetic and thoughtful about responses. 
My SO is an extravert and had definitely pointed out that I sometimes trail off or stop talking in the middle of a conversation. I don't do it on purpose, it just happens. 
Case and point, I put my phone down in the middle of writing this to fold laundry and think about what I'd already written and whether or not it would be a helpful response. "
5677,isfj,"Definitely have blank out moments. Then I have the post discussion “I should have said this or asked that etc” The blank out is trying to interpret along with recall any relevant information or experience. Risk calculation and current mood/state of mind play into it as well. Really like having my thoughts ahead of time jotted down or memorized. Really works out when my pre-engagement thoughts on how things will work out end up going that way. 
I also think while talking and listening on how that person or the environment we are in is affecting the conversation. Kind of weird thinking about it now. Thanks for the reflection moment."
5678,isfj,"I can totally relate to processing information during a conversation. I will start processing and stop listening for just a few seconds. For me it is double processing because English is also not my first language. Many times I need to truly understand and the context of what is being said.
Sometimes I even need to process how I feel about situations that happen at work or with my SO when I get home. But for me it goes at step further as I like people to listen and not necessarily provide an opinion. I need to understand how certain behaviors affect me directly. It is part of knowing ME and be a good person when people need your advice/opinion.
However, it is weird because I do very well when I am put on situations at work where I need to think on my feet. I also do my best work when I’m under pressure."
5679,isfj,"I don't really do what your mom does unless it's an emotional conversation, like a fight with an SO. Then I have to process whatever they said to me and think hard before I say anything back because I want to a) make sure I get across what I truly mean and b) not offend them or sometimes c) I'm too emotional to get the words out without crying. "
5680,isfj,"It's not that I have a hard time thinking on my feet, quite the opposite actually.  I tend to be ruminating over so many different possibilities (Ne) but internally (Ti) so people don't see it and we don't tend to shout out everything we're thinking as we know it might change in future.  For example, I could be thinking the most negative, emotional shit and I know I can't act on that or talk about it until I'm in a better frame of mind and have had time to think it through ""logically""."
5681,isfj,"I'm kind of the same as an ENTP though OP. I think it's Ne's work.
Something in the convo might trigger a remote chain of thoughts. I'll have to let it unfold to know what it is and whether I should include it or not in the conversation (sometimes it ends up being very far fetched while not bringing more than just where the conversation would normally go, and many times it's not something interesting to my interlocutor)
Often times, in group conversations, I'll just follow that chain of thought in my mind and space out without even noticing. In one on one I'll try and keep up with the convo but many times the chain of thoughts won't stop trying to branch me out so I'll eventually have to follow it and ask for a pause too. 
I think when I was younger, instead of exploring them quietly I would follow those branches ""live"" without noticing I was derailling the discussion into something else entirely, and that something else maybe wasn't interesting to my interlocutor. I guess that's how ISFJ differ from ENTP in that regard. "
5682,isfj,"You mean, risk that the other person will be offended?
So does my mom! I assumed it was just a preference, but now I realize it may be a necessity for her.
I never think about stuff like that. Can you explain how it factors into your thought process?
Thank you for your insight."
5683,isfj,"Ah, ok. Good to know.
Well, this is the main issue. I'm fine with processing things out loud, and she's just not."
5684,isfj,"Risk in offending myself, the other person, situation, subsequent situations, etc. its a rabbit hole sometimes.
Thats a tough one. I start gauging how that person might be feeling (physical and emotional), and what distractors are in the environment. Its been me for so many years ill have to pay attention more to when I start zeroing in. Might be a self lie detector."
5685,isfj,"I think if you acknowledge that the person is processing and ask a clarifying question such as, do you know what I mean? Then you provide the other person with an opportunity to finish processing or ask you further questions. I don’t think this would be condescending."
5686,isfj,"Despite what dichotomies make it look like, ISFJ and ENTP actually are a lot alike. They have all the same functions, just in reverse order. While they'll never meet halfway, they will mature towards the other's type (by developing lower functions)"
5687,isfj,Yes it would be the context and I start going into underlying pieces. Probably why I trail off in thought during the conversation. Find myself grasping for input on a subject or question without listening then my sub conscience will bring me up to speed. It has caused a bad habit of interrupting the conversation. I do try to be mindful. Mostly happens when someone has me storytell or join in explaining something and they don’t hit the detailed level I need to get the point across. 
5688,isfj,"Hi, I am wondering if anyone has ways to deal with overwhelming emotions? What I mean by this is, do you ever get very upset over small things-- and then later realize ""I should not have been upset... Now I am upset that I was upset...""
ex: 1) My highlighter leaked onto my bf's bedsheets, staining them... I was so upset, I started crying about it and he had to reassure me it was okay...
2) My bf and I are walking to class but he decides he wants to start longboarding... He goes off and leaves me and I just am unbelievably sad. He just had a class to get to. I ended up catching up to him though and when he saw me trailing behind he came back to walk with me... But I was just bitter he had even left. And then when we finally separated for class, all I could think of was ""I am so dumb, I should've just been happy I could walk with him but instead I acted moody and maybe he will be upset with me now because I was upset. 3) My roommate asks me to clean the dishes. A few minutes later, I am about to wash them but have to go up to my roommate and ask ""Are you mad at me?"" and burst into tears... (he reassures me he isn't, at the most ""kind of upset"")
How do I deal with these? I get so emotionally triggered by the smallest things... The worst part is that after the initial upset is over, I get even more upset that I was upset to begin with... I wish I could just nip it in the bud and realize ""Slow down. You are overreacting. This is nothing that big."" But I just become so overwhelmed it's like I am crushed by my emotions.
Sometimes I will just get sad for no reason and let it totally ruin my day, and then think ""WHY did I let that get to me?!?""
Does anyone have any advice? Is this even an ISFJ thing? I know feelings are, but maybe this is more extreme than most? I feel like a self-hating freak a lot of the time..."
5689,isfj,"Personally, I write things down.  I write down how I'm feeling at the time.  Then I'll go back a few days later, and look at it and usually rewrite most of it due to feelings of ""what the fuck was I thinking"".  Since my knee jerk reaction in some cases is emotional, writing it down allows me to be more methodical and rational about the situation when I need to be.
I was sort of made fun of for doing it, but I don't see it as a crutch anymore. "
5690,isfj,"i learned to pause when i feel strong emotions. it's not the best solution but it ensures i don't make any bad or inconsiderate decisions.
i used to act on anger or sadness pretty quickly. i realized that i was irrationally upset and directly effecting others with my irrationality.
that realization really effected me because i don't want to to that to people. and i don't like making dumb choices because of strong emotions.
i worked to notice it when it happens and just stop doing things or a while. wait it out. and when i'm calm again and when i worked things out logically i can go back to doing whatever."
5691,isfj,"Thank you and I think you are very accurate that I overthink. I have warned a lot of my friends/bf that I tend to overanalyze but I guess what I am really doing is just using my crazy imagination to come up with theories about why people are saying/doing what they do...
I find that I often think that people are more interested/needing of me than they really are. I'm starting to think that this is a downside of me wanting to feel needed. A few times I have run out of the shower thinking I heard a knock on the door and I wanted to rush to let whoever was there in... Only to sprint out and see that I was imagining it lol."
5692,isfj,"This is a great idea! Like I said, I often feel later (after the emotions have subsided) that I was so silly for being upset to begin with. If I start writing down the different times I get upset, and later on going back and saying ""wow that was silly"" -- maybe everytime I write something down I can be thinking ""now how many days later will I look at this and see that it was so insignificant?"" and that might help me start to rationalize.
Thanks!
Another thing that someone suggested to me is just to look at the situation, say the worst case scenarios, list all those, and then be like ""okay, now are these really that likely? what is the most likely case?"""
5693,isfj,"I entirely understand.  My first reaction in a situation is usually to assume the most malicious worst case scenario.  I'll end up writing that scenario down, and take a day or so which is usually enough time to ""play out"" in my mind the more likely scenarios and scrap my default reactions.  Its actually helped over time so that I less frequently assume the worst.  If somebody isn't speaking to me, I once upon a time would think that I had done something wrong.  The most likely scenario?  People are busy and have shit to do. "
